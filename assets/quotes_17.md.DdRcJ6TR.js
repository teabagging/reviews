Mr. Gray states many things as facts which are merely his opinion. He says women are only interested in and capable of orgasm some of the time.

In truth many women, myself included are interested in having an orgasm in every sexual encounter as all men do. A quicky feels the same to us as sex without orgasm would feel to a man. His book is heavily biased by a male viewpoint. There are a few good ideas but too many dangerous ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I wasn't expecting this book to somehow transform my sex life, but I certainly didn't expect the garbage I read.Yes, he makes some preaty good, but obvious observations.

If you only read those quotations, however, you would probably be able to skip most of the rest.I found his description of his life after being a monk to be offensive. He boasts about how much sex he had after nine years of celibacy, and he seems to have approached it as a research project, rather than a means of expressing love.

I told her that it was supposed to turn her on but she said she thought I was being creepy so I did not get the desired result not to mention I really did feel like she had perfect breasts so I conveyed that. So I was lucky she just thought it was creepy instead of giving me an e-slap and calling me a pig.

However there are no corresponding ideas for a woman geared to improviing her skills as a lover. By maintaining a position of gallant \\"ladies first\\" mentality he, in truth, is demeaning the power of women's sexuality.There is much to be gained by men reading this book.

The stories are always very well cut and told and they are pure pleasure in their logic. Gene Barry cut this character in such a personal way that he becomes kind of viewer-friendly : the viewers are the trusting friends of the inspector. They trust him to go to the root of the case and to find a very elegant way to do so and explain the crime. This elegance is neither too heady nor intellectual.

The idea of the book -- chess integrated with the mystery -- is wonderful, but the execution poor.

And, even though I enjoyed the read, the ultimate resolution is so hate-filled as to sour the rest of the book. Overall, exceedingly a poor novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as \\"The Club Dumas\\"","review":"I very much enjoyed The Club Dumas for its clever use of plot, subplot and the weaving in of Alexander Dumas' writing style. Thinking I'd found a clever writer, I unfortunately choose to read The Flanders Panel. I was very disappointed by this book. On the plus side, I enjoyed the mystery embedded in the painting and the use of chess imagery was intriguing. On the down side, the villian's identity was telegraphed way too early in the book which took the mystery out of the main plot. Finding out why this person did the evil deeds was a big let down and quite unsatisfying. I didn't believe the motive for a minute. Will I read other books by Arturo Perez-Reverte? Based on the strength of The Club Dumas I would say yes, but if the next one turns out as weak as The Flanders Panel I will relegate this author to my never again list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, the chess game was a let-down","review":"The obvious flaw in the analysis of the crucial chess game, also pointed out by another reviewer, totally blew this book away for me. Nice cover, nice typing, but intellectual? Not even clever. Looking for anther Eco? Don't bother. What a disappointment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, literary mystery","review":"I found this novel fascinating. You are kept guessing until the last page, and the interweaving of art, chess, and mystery makes for a compelling novel indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fine","review":"The first 100 pages were quite a delight - there's a strong feeling of old-fashioned European intelligence in this book, as well as some impressing ponderings on the basic questions of existence. The beginning was also quite slow, and I thought the story would speed up towards the end, but as it is, this never happened.It seems to me that the author simply didn't know what to do with his ideas. The intelligence fades into snobism, the metaphysics go totally out of control, the plot drags on and makes in the end every page a battle you have to win. And the solution of the mystery... well, that was just unbelievable. And artificial.Two stars for the great European irony, which I prefer any day over American banality, and also for the chess-player Munoz, which I think was the only interesting character in the book. Did someone mention The Name Of The Rose? Well, there's a difference wider than the ocean between Spain and Italy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying, Intelligent Mystery","review":"The Flanders Panel is not one of the many page turners that leave you dissatisfied in the end. An art conservator connects historical events hidden in the 16th century painting 'the chess players' to the present with the help of an ingenious chess master who helps decoding a message that may be contained in the positions of the chess figures. That may seem far fetched but it is written so compellingly that I consulted the internet to separate reality from fiction.In the course of the book I gained insights into the work and psyche of the art conservator and the inspired chess player. In this way the author Perez-Reverte reminds me of Dorothy Sayers without -to his credit- infusing his characters with warm blood the way she does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin plot, shallow research","review":"A centuries-old murder mystery in which the only clues are offered by an enigmatic chess game in a Dutch painting -- a promising premise, but the execution is sadly lacking.The course of the mystery is unsatisfying and inconsistent, so that it does not pay to read this book for the suspense. In addition, the characters are entirely flat and predictable, except when some supreme act of irrationality is required in order to move the plot along, so you also need not buy this book for the sake of the drama. Finally, while I cannot comment on the author's grasp of art history, anyone who has ever read a chess book can tell that Mr. Perez-Reverte has not, and therefore I cannot recommend this book as a source of edification.However, I must admit that this novel serves quite admirably as a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Plot Gone Bad","review":"The Flanders Panel has an intriguing premise but I found it hard to read. The dialouge between the characters is unrealistic. Every comment by each character seems to be either part of some philosophical debate, usually pretentious or downright silly, or contains a reference to some historical or literary figure. It sounds like the characters are a bunch of professors, each trying to sound more intelligent than the other. Also, the comparisons of chess to life drone on endlessly. If you can get through the dialouge, the plot can be compelling at times. I found the ending, however, contrived and disappointing. Overall, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A French best seller? But so are Jerry Lewis & Mickey Rouke","review":"The reviewers that compared this to Name Of The Rose either didn't read Eco's book or were educated at an exceptional trade school.My kid's Barbie has more depth than any of these stereotypical characters. The mystery is slightly more challanging than a word search puzzle, and the denouemont is silly enough to make you cry that trees were cut down to make this book.The chess problem was the only good thing about this waste of time except I don't read fiction to learn chess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I read this book because it was compared to Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose. Turns out, however, Mr. Perez-Reverte isn't fit to carry Eco's breastplate (emblazoned with the Rosy Cross, of course). The characters are one-dimensional, the plot thin and the resolution so contrived and implausible it felt like I was reading the script for a TV movie. I wasn't surprised to read that the author is a tele-journalist. It shows. Anyone who compares this book with The Name of the Rose ought to be flogged the by the remaining members of the Knights Templar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat premise - the chess puzzle's solution is incorrect","review":"Great concept - poor followthrough. But most importantly: the author got the chess problem (which the book centers around) WRONG! The board position shown could only be legally reached if the bishop's pawn (on A5) had taken the knight. It is a simple matter of transportation and pawn movement. The retrograde analysis given in the book is flawed. Kinda disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriging chess characterization, while deficient history","review":"As an avid chess player, I was impressed with the use of the chess game depicted in the artwork, as a platform for the novel's plot. The artist successfully and engagingly interwove the characters' stories with the progression of the game. The disappointing aspects of the novel were the lack of substantive historical significance and its tenuous association with the present mystery. The novel was touted as a mystery orignating in the fifteenth century. However, in the end, history was no more than a specious pretext."},{"rating":"2","title":"A intelligent, gripping mystery.","review":"The characters are overdrawn. The plot contains several contrived twists. But the set-up is fascinating, and the resolution takes many unexpected turns throughout the book. Chess enthusiasts will enjoy some of the intracicies of the game interspersed through the book, and the chess-player character is the most sincere. If you can get past the other cartoon characters in the book,this mystery is for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever chess maybe; clever characterizations NOT!","review":"Perez-Reverte's meticulous depiction of art, history, literature, music and chess did not extend to the characters that populate this novel, most of whom belong in trashy novels that don't pretend to be intellectual. I found the gay character to be especially outdated - so witty, so sarcastic, so sensitive, so well dressed, so stereotypical. The other characters were cliches as well - the aging party girl, her dim but handsome boyfriend, the elderly rich man, his greedy daughter, the enigmatic geek, the ineffectual police detective. I was insulted by the \\"surprise\\" ending - the multi-layered mystery resolved itself with a very disappointing and unbelievable whimper. Don't be fooled by comparisons to the The Name of the Rose or anything by Umberto Eco - all resemblences are superficial. Erudition is not the same as quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive light-weight","review":"This book has an interesting theme at heart, however theexecution is lacking in any real unique features. Much of the'philosophical' or 'meta-physical' depths of the charactersare simply naive renditions of themes discussed in Hofstadter.The translation perhaps was an obstacle to ennjoying the paceof the story with a very varied style and no real attention todetail or consistancy.The book does have the desired quality of a real page turner, though this reader was glad to turn the last page. Beter off with 'Godel, Escher, Bach'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Knew Chess Could Be That Interesting","review":"The setting: Spain. The time: modern day. The main character: a woman art restorer. The subject: a painting. These descriptions seem simple enough when taken a face value but place them together in this novel and add a six hundred year old murder and you have the makings of a truly great novel. When the painting The Game of Chess is brought to Julia, the young art expert, she delves into a mystery that leaves a trail of murder and suicide. For all those who are lovers of the game of chess this surprising mystery of a game in reverse solves more than the reader expects. To lovers of books this combination of history and murder is a delightful change from most books of today. Perez-Reverte is truly an author that grasps the minds of his readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great set-up for a mystery....","review":"The story has one of the most entertaining original premises I've ever read. Throw in the game of chess and all of its possibilities both as an allegory and a device for solving the mystery and you have a very entertaining set-up. However, the payoff was not in line with the premise and that's where I downgrade the book. The ending was not consistent with the characterization, and, to me, there was something icky (for lack of a better word) about one of the key relationships. While that did not take away from the mystery, it did distract from the read.I did like the chess player, and thought he was a great character. The book would have been much better had he been the protagonist rather than Julia. Still, the plot in itself makes the story worth the read, and its originality eases the let down of the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it better in Spanish?","review":"Unfortunately, The Flanders Panel is one of those novels that lure you in with a tantalizing and well-packaged premise, only to leave you wrecked on a disappointing shoal of overwrought cliches and characterizations that in their attempt to tittilate only manage to over-reach. The only thing resonating through it is a false note of itellectualism that at base is nothing more than obscure name dropping.Much of this may be forgivable if it weren't for the sad way in which Julia's dialogue renders her a pale spectre floating through her own starring role. Her words sound as though they were generated by writing software rather than a human being and I wonder how much of this owes to the translation as The Seville Communion feels so much more believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art, chess, and murder make for a clever Spanish mystery","review":"A wonderful book with several charms. The story of the painting is interesting, a primer on art history that makes the subject intriguing. The chess game at the heart of the novel is also a lot of fun. I rediscovered chess lately, so I paid close attention to the chess moves the characters make throughout the story. There are chessboard illustrations for each of the game's moves, quite unusual for a novel. The Spanish setting is a delightfully fresh--why aren't more mysteries set there? I look forward to reading other Perez-Reverte books set in Spain. True, the ending of the book spirals into silliness and nasty homosexual stereotypes, but overall it's a remarkable debut. I'd like to see the characters Julia and Munoz return for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Solved in Past and Future","review":"An interesting mystery novel. It follows two separate mysteries and introduces the reader to a somewhat seedier world of art dealing.An enjoyable read that keeps the reader's attention. Fast paced enough that it can be finished in only a few or even one sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric Chess Mystery","review":"For the most part \\"The Flanders Panel\\" was a disappointment. It was undoubtedly well-researched, but the plot didn't grab me. I never felt that tug pulling me to the book and forcing me to continue reading. I could put it down at any moment. I like this author, but I found this book cliched and shallow. The characters lacked depth, and there was a repetitive quality to the prose, so that I found myself correctly anticipating how a sentence would end. I had difficulty connecting with his world of fine art and antiques. Maybe that's just my problem as far as choice of reading material, but I think Perez-Reverte is a more inventive writer than that. And then the central mystery, \\"Ooooh, I'm scared, somebody left chess moves on my car! Gasp!\\" Just not very thrilling. But I would recommend \\"Queen of the South\\" to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I loved this book so much I couldn't put it down! What a great story! Julia, an art restorer, finds a hidden message in a 400 year old painting she is working on: \\"Who killed the knight?\\" What follows is a fascinating story of murder, chess, and the relationships of the people surrounding her. It's a game-within a game-within a game, as Julia and her friends try to figure out whodunit over 400 years ago. I don't play chess, don't even know a thing about it, and was a little worried that I wouldn't understand what was going on. Not to worry though, the author gives an explanation of what is going on with regards to the chess moves. This book is a great introduction to this author, and a great follow-up to \\"The Club Dumas.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely absorbing !","review":"First off, let me say I'm not a chess aficionado. But I don't think that one need be to enjoy this book.Initially I thought it was heading towards a typical \\"damsel in distress\\" scenario (albeit with a latin tilt).The beautiful,talented and fiercely independant Julia, with the fabulous career,jet- set social circle,etc.I thought for certain this was going to be pseudo-intellectual pulp! Well,I was wrong.Once I got reading I was enthralled,the layers of the story held me. I loved it! Don't be put off by the supposedly \\"high brow\\" content.Just Read it!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent beginning, poor follow-through","review":"It's a fascinating premise and I loved the beginning of the novel, but unfortunately the rest of the book didn't live up to the first couple of chapters. In addition, there are a number of comments made about the psychology of homosexuality that are dubious at best and offensive at worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller but predictable: stereotypes people and Animals.","review":"I found this novel a real romp, even though it was predictable. I loved the mingling of art and deductive reaasoning. I found the characters uncomlicated, dull and every reference to animals in this novel was barabric or dismissive. On this ground alone should we stereotype the author as a typical Latino? It makes me curious about the author's other novels, but makes me not buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"No te lo pierdas....Must read!","review":"Uno de los mejores libros de Perez-reverte. Si te gusta el arte, el juego de ajedrez, el suspense y Madrid, este libro te encantara. Una vez que lo empieces no lo podras dejar. ______One of his best. If you like art, chess, suspense, and good descriptions of the city of Madrid, you'd like this book. Must read, you can't stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly interesting book with homophobic ending","review":"I found this book to be engrossing, but the ending was homophobic enough to make me squeamish...suggesting it was sinister and diabolical (even going so far as using chess moves to describe it). That's at least one I haven't heard before.Also, I don't know enough about chess to be bothered the mistake a few other reviews mention. I didn't even notice it, so I doubt your average chess player will be distracted by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad waste of a fine premise","review":"When I first started the book I was captivated with what I took to be a refreshing old-world obliviousness to political correctness. And, I thought, amid such a promising intellectual atmosphere the stereotypes would surely deepen into real characters eventually. But instead the context flattens out to match the stereotypes. The mystery plots (both historical and contemporary) turn thin, the chess and musical analogies go off-key, and to find the conclusion at all persuasive you have to buy into some pretty nasty prejudices. Since the professional reviewers have overrated this so badly, for the sake of fairness I'm giving it only one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good weekend read","review":"The ending of this novel left a little to be desired, and at times the plot seemed contrived. This would make a good summer or vaction read for any mystery novel fan who enjoys chess and logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing start. Flat finish.","review":"The book started out with an interesting premise: After 500 years, a hidden inscription on a famous painting is revealed right before the painting is to be sold at auction. And murders occur which seem to be connected with the mysterious story of the painting. And the best way to uncover the mysteries of the hidden message and the murders is by decyphering a chess match depicted on the painting. Oh, how exciting. Well, it is interesting for a while and the chess puzzle is cute, but in the end... The ending was a disappointment. And the story about the painting just got to be too much. It had potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Until the End","review":"It was an interesting milieu for a mystery novel. There was a fascinating beginning. Unfortunately, the steam ran out by the end. Real let down...but good until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it seems","review":"Well, the first time I hear from the book I thought it was gonna be great. I had the book at home, so I began to read it (not very fast but...). It was great at the beginning (murders, a great scheme...), but the thing I hated the most was the final part (if you have read the book you can go on reading on but if not....), when the girl, the one you think at the beginning she's perfect steals the money and scape with his friend... So, I think the book has a good scheme but an stupid end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The chess problem was the only good thing about this book","review":"Even though some reviews have complained, the analysis of the chess problem was fairly convincing. If you assume that it is obvious whose turn it is because of the attitudes of the players in the painting, it is possible to deduce backwards two moves, and it was a very clever idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading from an Anne Rice faithful","review":"I love Anne Rice but I must say that this is among her worst books. I found the tale common, predictable, boring, unrealistic. This book lacked Anne's usual feel, flavor, intensity, character development,the feeling that makes you stay up all night turning pages.

I would recommend any of the Mayfair books or Vampire Chronicles over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, boring","review":"This is probably my 2nd least favorite Anne Rice novel. I remember it being uninteresting, the characters, bland, tiresome. I have read every single Anne Rice novel and dislike giving her any negative reviews, but unfortunetely, I found nothing to like about this particular book. Would I recommend it to a fan who has not read it? Truly, no. Though her quality of writing is superb as ever, the book offers no reward upon finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rice's Best Book Since The Early '80's","review":"This novel's setting ranges from Persian-dominated Babylon of mid-Biblical times to modern Manhattan, and concerns the spirit of a once-mortal Israelite youth held on the earth by ancient magic that compels it to stay in this plane for as long as its gold-encased bones remain uncorrupted. This spirit tells its tale and works to foil the plot of a Jewish messiah-figure, who seeks to 'purify' the world of most of its population, in order to bring about a utopian realm for Jews and a select few other peoples. Good historical descriptions of ancient Persia and of modern Jewish life within the xenophobic ultra-conservative Chasidic courts of New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, then surprisingly tedious","review":"For someone who is capable of writing The Vampire Lestat, this book is a shame. It starts out wonderfully, with Rice's vivid visions of ancient times, but then fizzles out into ... utter boredom. Who can empathize with a character who deems a thief worthy of murdering? Who can stick with the lifeless plot of the second half of the book? Those who liked the book, I suppose. Seems like this book was written for the author, not the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Azriel's tale is nothing but tedious dialogue!","review":"I started this book a couple of days ago because I thought Rice would put me in the mood for Halloween--was I WRONG!! The cover promised a tale that took you through several interesting historical eras--instead it BORES you through those eras. Only a brief section of the book took you into the time of the Black Death, I don't know why they even mentioned it on the cover.Azriel has tediously similar dialogues over and over which finally caused me to start skimming the book in the hopes I would get to something interesting!! It NEVER happened I remained uninterested until the bitter end.Unlike the reviewer who took two years to read it, I read it with the speed of light because there was nothing to savor! This book was garbage and that is where I threw it when I thankfully finished. I would have given it half a star or less if that was an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful touching story","review":"The story itself is beautiful and unforgettable. I would have given it 5 stars, but it has more than a few typographical errors. I read the kindle version, so I don't know if the errors can be found in other published versions. Other than that, it is truly a great story. If you enjoyed any of Anne Rice's Angel Time books, the Witch books, or Memnoch the Devil, you will love this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Rice is a brilliant writer, and her style and ideology is always brilliant, playfully convoluted, and alluring. So why was this book so lifeless and difficult to read? I struggled through the first part, as I have never done with any other contemporary novel (technical manuals, Middle English literature yes), and where was the payoff? At least when I struggled through Dante and The Canterbury Tales, I could at least brag about my accomplishment ;) I will view this book as an experiment and forget it ever happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Twaddle!","review":"I'm sorry, but after wading through this, my first encounter with Ms. Rice, I don't think I'll bother with any more.

The first chapters were a bit of a struggle to get through but once Azriel settles down with his meeting with Jonathan and began pouring out his tale, it was deliciously mystic and dark. As always, Anne Rice's characters seem to have had noble beginnings, and this was no exception with Azriel. I was breath taken when Azriel was made into the Servant of the Bones. It all seemed to happen so quickly that I had to re-read the excerpt twice over to make sure I hadn't missed anything. I'm glad I didn't give up with the book when I read the first few chapters otherwise I would have missed out on this brilliant luscious dark tale.

I'll try it again some other time, but I could not do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"This book was, simply put, terrible. The prose was overblown, way too flowery, and at times downright funny. Anne Rice seemed less interested in giving us characters than she did in sticking in her favorite little touches; i.e., the numerous examples of barely-latent homosexuality and the two pages of gratuitous sex. As a result, all of Azriel's raging emotions and the changes that take place in him are glossed over and have no impact on the story, although they are naturally pivotal to the plot. A great many potentially exciting scenes are rendered flat because of the style of writing, and some are barely dealt with in any case. The one redeeming quality of this book is what appears to be an authentic description of Babylonian theology and worship. Still, it's not enough to get me to explore Anne Rice's work any further"},{"rating":"1","title":"Naive","review":"My first Anne Rice book and I almost torched it down after reading 250 pages. The book has a old \\"mummy movies\\" feeling and that's great but the plot is incredibly naive, it's almost a Carebear fantasy though 3/4 of the lame story that pretends a pharaon just came from death and stirs all men and women emotions because he's handsome, smart, friendly, etc, etc. No drawback. The man is even single! Low budget and cheap love supermarket 5 bucks novels where a female just gets what she wants: THIS IS FOR YOU! Anne Rice pretends to hook on the reader with what looks like a strong frustrated libido making everybody involved in sexcapades (but you'll have to go through more than 400 pages of endless happiness, poor tense situations, etc to get there). The bisexual touch pretended to add a feeling of decadence but I am not sure it looks so smart when you realize you are reading the book as someone's personal fantasy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time to hang it up, Anne...","review":"Don't get me wrong- I think Anne Rice has done some brilliant writing. Unfortuntely, I don't think this book falls into that category. What Rice accomplishes in 387 pages could have been done in 50.

She does her homework, and incorporates important historical and philosophical elements. In Servant of the Bones, she ties together fascinating character studies with a supernatural \\"mystery thriller\\" flavor. Although she is clearly now a media figure, she does not shy away from poking fun at the fascination many people have with celebrities and pop culture. An intelligent work from an intelligent author. You won't be able to put it down during the final chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fascinating","review":"I can't understand why more people did not enjoy this book, probably because it wasn't about vampires or witches. Rice has a fantastic imagination, and I was thrilled to see her venture away from her formula and try something new. Ancient Babylon has long been an untouched-upon subject for fiction writers, and she wonderfully brought it to life. As her first ghost, Azriel experiences many of the feelings of her vampires, conflicting emotions with who he is and what could he have done different, etc. I hope we see more ghostly characters from Rice, with this much detail and imagination, and none of the scatterbrained storytelling that she showed in 'Violin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"This books is awful.","review":"Don't waste your money.

Rice did not seem genuine with the plot line and I was not convinced of Azriel's true purpose. It was an ungraphic and unillustrated attempt at one of her other genius stories. Bones was a simple and clear, while vague and unabsorbant, recapturing of one uninteresting young man's life. I know that I am not some rich and ingenius critic. I probably bear no leaverage at all with wether or not you read a book, but it feels better to vent. The possiblity that Ms. Rice will check this to see an unenthused response to her novel is a bit fetching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Job","review":"The Servant of the Bones at first seemed like it would be a sad comparison to Rice's other novels, but it is suprisingly interesting and inviting to read. The reader may be put off by the initial Biblical aspects, but after a few chapters, the story opens itself to be enjoyed. This is one of my favorites, and being a fan of the Vampires it is a equally captizating tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"No... Again?!","review":"I read all of Anne's books so far.

The first part is redundant, the second part lacks Rice's famous detail, and the third part...Well, I had to keep swatting myself to stay awake. To any Anne Rice fan who has read the Mayfair witches chronicles, as well as the vampire chronicals...you will be dissapointed. Servant of the Bones lacks the passion, sexuality, and fervor that can be found through out her writing. Overall, I bad choice for me. I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNFULFILLING","review":"I thought this book had a very good story topic, full of potential, but its awkward telling is so jarring that it's nearly impossible to read. What little descriptive character this book has seems out of place and forced. Its as if the editor of the book handed it back to Ms. Rice after reading it and told her to \\"...make it more descriptive...\\" which she tried to do by merely adding quasi-descriptive comments to the existing text without regard for transition or context values. In addition to this problem, the book suffers from a disjointed feel, as if it hasn't been outlined correctly. These are major failings in my opinion and made the reading of the book so distasteful that I couldn't finish it. In the future I hope that she and her editor are both in more professional frames of mind for her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking? What was _I_ thinking???","review":"I've never really gotten into Anne Rice much before. Her only book that I read before was Memnoch, which I actually kind of enjoyed because of the interesting alternate twist it gave to the religious concepts typically believed today. I started reading this book expecting something somewhat exciting and eerie. Right now I'm 3/4 of the way done this book and I can't many books have bored me this badly. The plot seems to crawl along and the characters are not very believeable in the slightest. It's never taken me this long before to read a book and I find myself almost having to force myself to read it on my morning bus ride. Azriel seems to constantly be whining about one thing or another, and the way he flips between loving and hating the other characters in my opinion just doesn't work. I won't make the mistake of bothering with another Anne Rice book after this yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Awkward","review":"I am usually a HUGE Anne Rice fan, but I think that she has fallen too much in love with the sound of her own narration to really write a novel anymore. Same thing as in \\"Memnoch.\\" She has lost her touch, and she does not hide it well because of the utterly stupid organization. She spends half of the novel showing off how well she can research Jewish history, and the second half milking a predictable, half-baked story. Please, Anne, go back to the world you were in when you wrote \\"The Tale of the Body Thief\\" or \\"The Witching Hour.\\" Maybe her next book, \\"Violin,\\" will be better. Hopefully"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a very confusing and boring novel","review":"I love Anne Rice novels. I couldn't put the Witching Hours down. I read it in 3 days. I also loved Cry to Heaven, and I did read the Sleeping Beauty novels, they weren't my favorite, but I did like them. But, Servant of the Bones had a very boring beginning, which was very hard to get through. Once I did get through the beginning the story started to become interesting, but then it took to long to get to another interesting point. I felt like I was reading and reading nothing to get to something interesting. I was very disappointed in this novel and I couldn't finish it. But, not every song on a C.D. is great. Most of the time you only get one good song off of a C.D.. If every author could write a top book, they would be perfect and we all know nobody is perfect.

While reading this I was so distracted by her copy-cat characters from the novels before-i.e. Esther-Dora, Rachel-Terry, Geogory-Roger,The Elders-The Talamasca, Johnathan-Daniel.

The characters are very poorly developed; the plot doesn't go anywhere; the allusions to Jewish heritage are empty, with no real reference to the very real ghosts of that heritage; the editing is terrible with inconsistent formatting.

Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Anne Rice. And I'm a fan of her vampire chronicles. I love how flowery her writing style is and her character description of character depth and scenes is amazing to me. But the first 3 chapters in this book was so boring I could not go on. It seems that the chapters could do nothing better than ramble and ramble and ramble.

Some people have reviewed poorly, but the details in the book is what makes the book. It makes you feel Azriels' pain as he is turned into a golden god, only to be cursed for all time by a hag. I recommend you read this book for the book itself, not because of Anne Rice's other works. It cannot be compared to her other series of books because it is a different type of book completely. It does have some super-natural enities in it, with powers, but they are on the other end of the scale when compared to the Vampire's. I love this book. If you are un-sure due to the mix of reviews try to borrow it first or buy a used copy. I was very pleased with this book, and it is one I never lend out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully boring!","review":"The first Anne Rice book I ever read was 'The Vampire Lestat' and i loved it so much that I decided to read all the books in the Vampire Chronicles. When I bought 'The Servant Of The Bones', it was at a book signing and I even got Anne Rice herself to sign it. Little did I know that Servant would turn out to be absolutely the worst book I have ever read. It took me almost 2 years to read!! The book was filled with names that were just as easily pronounced as the ingredients on a package of gum. The plot just does not seem to go anywhere, but rather drags on and on to point of tears. Overall, this must be one of Rice's worst books, however, the great books from her earlier years makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Anne Rice","review":"In this book, Anne Rice continues with her vulnerable male character-types, and creates Azriel, whom you can't help but love.

This book was very weak in characterization, except for Azriel, and the plot was ludicrous. It appears to me that the author keeps trying to make each book she writes more unbelievable and gruesome than the next.

When I finished watching it, I felt as if I'd fallen into my neighbor's septic tank. In short, the description of the movie is as much a lie as the characters themselves. Indeed, my wife thought they must have men playing women and women playing men. Whatever they were, this is one movie to add to the septic tank.

This ominously-titled Warp666 recording forebodes brutal scenes from a purgatory. Unlike some Masami Akita's recordings where the sounds growl, churn and grind in a loud but dispassioned way, this 4-track tour-de-force leaps out of your headphones, explodes in your ears, splinters, transfixes and mummifies you into a terrifying blind of electronic hell where even angels fear to tread: The static stutters uncontrollably, the bass loops itself over and over, unearthly metallic screeches hiss, stab, and attack mercilessly, and the angry, wailing maelstrom of electronics gone horribly wrong conjures up terrifying visions of a cursed dimension. This record drags the listener - kicking and screaming - helplessly inwards, into the abyss of the Underworld: He is compelled to experience fear, pain, and awe. Satanstornade.

My only complaint was due to a hiss that became evident when the music dropped to quiet levels. I think I have noticed this on other DG recordings, but normally only when I am using headphones (I don't hear the hiss on everything I listen to, so I'm not sure whether it's DG's recordings or my headphones).All in all, this is a great disk, and one which I will listen to in its entirety many times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best puzzle magazine out there","review":"I have tried the basic crossword and logic puzzle magazines out there, the kind you get at the airport and so on (usually by Penny Press), and the Games Magazine publications, World of Puzzles in particular, are by far the best. The simple physical quality of them is better, the puzzles more interesting and just overall a better buy. I admit I have never finished all the puzzles in it, but it's also great because I can keep them a while and still find puzzles to do! If you do a lot of puzzles, get a subscription. If you're more limited on time and never finish as many of them as you like, you can generally find this at places like Borders and buy every other edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Dr Freudstein!","review":"I picked up this little gem for about 5 bucks from a local used DVD shop. I would recommend this to fans of older horror movies. True, the dubbing does suck and the acting is questionable, but the last 15 minutes of this movie almost make up for it. Dr. Freudstein is truly one of the most twisted and interesting villians I've yet seen in a horror movie and its easy to see Rob Zombie's inspiration for his Dr. Death character in House of 1000 Corpses. Not to mention, there's a few scenes near the end that push the gore envelope to the max! Love the maggot-stew gushing out of Freudsteins wounds... Truly twisted!!

Of coarse the actors aren't good, the voice overs aren't good, but I'll tell you now, that Euro Horror, just scares the crap out of me. It's dark, sadistic and wonderful!

Strange things happen right when the family moves in. The family finds a headstone in the living room and for some reason they cant open the basement door. Good thing they cant though because there is a rottet zombie that is down in the basement.This is one movie that I can watch over and over. If you like good gore cult movies you will like this one.

I enjoyed it. I was, however, very impressed with the crisp, moody photography (in a WIDE letterbox) and, all in all, I think I made a good investment. One thing that often bothered me about dubbed, Italian films of this period is that they are often boring, relying only on gore. There certainly was plenty of that, but my attention was held quite well considering the idiot plot.

It's like watching a Godzilla movie where the monsters are only in the last five minutes of the film after watching an hour and a half of nonsense! And the DVD.... While the print is clean I have to say that Anchor Bay's job is a shadow of what they did on the films I mention above. The sound is 2.0!

The dark/black scenes were quantized to a gray scale with very little contrast and sometimes almost looked like negatives.

Admittedly, Fulci's other films, such as THE BEYOND, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, and ZOMBIE, are wild and wooly but, at least the made sense in their own way. This one doesn't. You could drive a cement truck through some of the plot holes.

However, at times it moves rather slowly, and the gore is no where near sufficient for the die hard Lucio fan. Strong elements of the film however, include tense atmosphere and a sense of lurking danger. For the most part however, I would resommend the film Zombie for a true taste of Lucio's genius. I give this film two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This film is just plain boring, as are most of Fulci's films infact. There is no atmosphere, the dialogue and some scenes are laughable(and not in a good way) and the dubbing of the main childs voice is incredibly annoying. The picture quality is pretty good for the price(certainly as good as Anchor Bay's release of Zombie) and the sound quality is also decent, although the music itself seems to burst in and dissapear at the most inappropriate times. The only reason it doesn't get 1 star is because there is some decent gore, although not enough to save it. I certainly won't be watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"House By the Cemetary","review":"I would actually give this movie a 2 1/2 stars. Out of all the recent Italian Horror movies that my friend has bought recently, this is by far the best one yet. It does have the suspence that a good horror should have. The makeup isn't bad either. I would also say that parents need to review the movie for themselves, prior to letting their children watch it, as it is very grusome, and gory. The movie portrays a couple of movies and gave them thier start. One of those movies would be \\"The Sixth Sense\\". By the time the movie comes to an end, you are cheering for the little boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"FULCI'S GREAT BUT THIS ISN'T THE BEST COPY TO BUY.","review":"After getting Pieces and this title I'm staying far away from Diamond DVD's all together. I'm a hard core gore fan, and the biggest fan of Fulci's work, but was dissapointed in this copy. You're better off finding a COMPLETELY uncut form of this movie from an inport service such as Midnight Video. contrary to most beliefs this is not an uncut version. But hey it's on DVD, as for the price, you get what you pay for. P.S. Pieces is not totally uncut either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hell is this great Fulci film converted into 3-d , the company that is releasing this should be ashamed of themselves !","review":"Lucio Fulci ,would not be happy about this being converted into 3-d , this is just a marketing scheme. Don't buy this version of this film, Only buy the real version of this film. I'm a Lucio Fulci fan, and I have to say this is just wrong. Please , Amazon take this version down.Johnny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Transfer for the price","review":"This version of \\"House by the Cemetary\\" is the uncut version, copied by Diamond Entertainment from the Japanese Laserdisc. It is a reasonably good looking transfer except for the occasional greyscaling and evidence of filmgrain. It is one of Lucio's best combining elements of \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Hellraiser\\" with a truly creepy feel. The earlier video release from Vestron video had reels 2 and 3 out of order. They have been put back correctly making the story all the more interesting. A great buy if you're a collecter. If not you may want to wait for Anchor Bay's version coming April 24th. This film scared me as a child and still retains a lot of it's eerie feel that time and many other horror films have ruined with less stylistic displays of the same idea. PS - If you wait long enough after the film ends, you see 5 seconds of the end of the trailer and \\"Laserdisc stop side B\\" will appear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"Love Lucio Fulci.

I feel he did himself a great disserice by singing the great oldies he did, and should have choosen other tunes instead. The orchestration arrangements also were not as good as the originals I am afraid to say. Michael Finestein, Harry Conick Jr. can pull off singing great tunes, and I think Monte could too, but not with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad, But No Winner","review":"I thought the new arrangements on these old favorites were pretty good. Mr. Procopio has a decent voice but at times he sounds a little \\"stiff\\" with the faster songs. I think they used too many songs associated with Frank Sinatra on this one.

It was one of the best cases out there for the money, a highly protective hard shell case with the convenience and style of a gig bag. Some idiot in upper management (who obviously never played a gig in his life) decided to save a few pennies and stop putting D-rings on the case, so now there is no way to attach a shoulder strap to carry your instrument. Whoever heard of a gig bag with no strap to carry it? SKB, if you're listening, please put the D-rings back on the contoured trumpet case!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, compact, lightweight case, but no strap capability","review":"This SKB case is very well-made and provides excellent protection. There are 2 mouthpiece wells in the padded felt, and I am able to keep some valve oil and 1-2 other small accessories underneath the valve columns. I agree with the other reviewer that this case would be near perfect if there were D-rings for attaching a strap."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK!","review":"These performances of the Fourth and Seventh symphonies from the BPO and Karajan recorded late in his life are better left on the shelf. What was Karajan thinking in this Seventh? It is way too fast for one thing and the playing of the BPO is a little slack. The performance of the Fourth fares better, but I still would opt for both of Karajan's other symphony cycles for either of these works. It is almost like he needed to play games with the score just so it would sound different than his other two Berlin cycles. Bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs-Awful Sound Quality","review":"I think Mick Ralphs is a great songwriter and guitarist. His vocals are not his stong point but then neither are Keith Richards. You can get through the howling for the great licks and hooks.

It was probably the best takes they had and digital editing in 1981 was rather complicated and a bit blunt, so there you go. What I didn't see mentioned though is that the recording is severely clipped (distorted) in the loudest sections (Mars, Jupiter, Uranus): it can be easily seen in an audio editor software. So, to put it simply, this version of The Planets is subpar on both musical and technical accounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The planets","review":"CD was what I expected. The Berlin Philharmonics' rendition was lighter on the horns than I would like, but quality was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous","review":"I've owned this recording for nearly 20 years, and am pleased to find that there are others out there with my reaction to it: Ghastly. Uninspired. Out-of-tune. Wrong.Do NOT buy this recording.This ruined Holst's \\"The Planets\\" for me for a VERY long time. A friend turned me onto the Grainger/ Philharmonia Orchestra recording and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!That's the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best recording out there. Trust me.","review":"I shall make this review short and to the point. Of all the recordings of this work I have, Karajan's and Levine's probably tie as being my personal least favourites. Karajan's Jupiter begins with violins that are in desperate need of tuning -- you can almost count how many are being played and there's an annoyingly audible *squeak* in there too. Most of the music on this disk is sloppy and I strongly suggest anyone who is considering to buy it to look for another. If you want a *real* CD, there's always Dutoit's, any of Boult's, Simon's, or even Previn's. I've heard other recordings by Karajan, like the Rite of Spring (in which you can hear someone actually cough quite loudly), and I really don't see what the fuss is all about with him. He seems to me to be a rather mediocre conductor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karajan is solid here!","review":"Very few conductors outside of Great Britian can conduct the Holst Planets suite with this kind of ferocity and still maintain it's sense of structure. Here we are treated to some very subtle wind playing indeed! As to the Mars it is among the very finest. It is a textbook in how to conduct the Planets...this is one of the finest to keep along side of Boult.Very fine performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a truly classic rendition of Holst's Planets by Herbert von Karajan. This isn't very good for listening to in the car as the level goes up and down drastically so its either blasting at points or inaudible."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE DRECK","review":"I remember when this recording came out and I went to a friend's house to listen to it. He loved DGG recordings and was excited about his new purchase. Not only is this possibly the worst recording of the Planets, but one of the worst recordings of anything ever. When the organ came in I finally burst out laughing. I told him to toss it in the trash and get the Steinberg/Boston Symphony recording also on DGG."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Kitten seems to use it but the design makes it difficult to get the litter out.

My cat tracked litter onto it and then onto the carpet beyond, and I still always found myself vacuuming litter from her little area all the time. Also, if she ever misses the litter box and I have to clean this litter mat, the pee smell refuses to go away (even with bleach and vinegar!).

For one it is not ment for human feet, it and is not ment to feel good either on your feet since it is plastic. It is there to help REDUCE cat litter from getting all over the floor. I have also found that if you place the mat about two maybe three inches from the cat box that my cats will use it when they are done and not try to leap over it like some views have mentioned. It does also help when you are cleaning the cat box to clean out the mat of litter to otherwise it will not work effectively, just a couple shakes in the garbage bag will do the trick.

So we turned them over to at least collect some of the cat litter, but it still got everywhere so we ended up putting newspapers under the opening for each box and that keeps most of it off the floor. We leave the mats we have in place for cute value and because sometimes you can get away with just emptying those, but our new boxes are doing fine without them. The cats even seem to like to pee on the mat once in a while out of spite and then the cat litter melts and cements into the little groves. You might have better luck if you have less cats who are tidier and have less sensitive paws, but don't buy more than one until you know for sure they can tolerate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work, not recommended","review":"This is a cute-looking mat, shaped like a cat's paw with a little cartoon kitty in the middle. Well, my cats hate it. They won't step on it and instead jump over it, as it's not very big. So, it was no help at all in regards to litter scatter.Those plastic bumps on which the cats are supposed to wipe their feet are so hard, it must hurt their pads. Maybe this product would be better used as a \\"scat mat\\" to keep them off surfaces where they're not allowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"hurts my feet!","review":"I thought this mat would be good for catching the litter my cat flings out of the box but really it just ended up catching some of the litter and looking like an ugly eye-sore. It also hurts to walk on with bare feet. Having wood floors, I hate sweeping 3-4 times daily because my cats get a little too over zealous trying to cover up their waste in the litter box, so I thought I'd give it a try. Helped some, but overall I'd say not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..","review":"I'm just not convinced these things work at all, and this one doesn't increase my optimism. My cats still track litter well beyond the box. I agree with another reviewer, I don't think cats like stepping on this hard plastic mat. I don't like stepping on it, so why would they with their tiny feet?! I bought it because it was a good size and reasonable price - not so reasonable if it doesn't work. I wish I could find a foam one on Amazon to see if it does better. The bathroom rug captures more litter than this. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"I like the idea of this mat, it's a lil sticky so that's great, cleaning can be a pain but it's not that much of a mess, it doesn't really help clean the paws as much as I'd like, but it does help somewhat, so that is nice.

A simple rectangle or semi-circle would make the product more appealing to me. However, the product works great. It keeps the vast majority of the litter on the mat instead of tracking it through the house. One of our cats is long haired (on the bottom of his paws as well) so we still get some debris transported. However, our short-haired cats are able to use the mat to remove the litter before they leave the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"Is very cute, washes well, and catches some litter...unfortunately it didn't work for us.

I'm an admirer of her short stories, but all she's done in this larger form is expand the cast of characters, forgetting to give them anything to do. The characters are really only cartoons, which Porter seems aware of, since she doggedly gives us paragraphs and pages of analysis for most of them. But in a novel, characters define themselves by what they do, not by what they think about themselves, or what their creator thinks of them. The sheer number of them just hanging around listlessly becomes so unwieldly for Porter that you feel sorry for her -- you can almost hear her thinking, \\"Wait, what about So-and-so, we haven't seen him come out of him cabin lately, maybe I'll have him get drunk and make a scene.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"no information available","review":"I would love to write a real review about this video.

The 41-minute continuous piece \\"Reese\\" and \\"The Smooth Ones\\" (can't tell where one stops and the other begins) manages the difficult combination of offhand and precise that eluded the Art Ensemble more than half the time on record. The sound is plenty vibrant on the CD version and Malachi Favors plays enough small percussion that drums are not really missed. The saxes of Roscoe Mitchell and Joseph Jarman are in particularly fine full cry, never suggesting that the pauses are to cover for lack of new direction to play.

No more fear from programing, no more worry. Solution almost available. It combines both friendly interface, easy learning and using. With E-Z solver you can save both time and effort. You can touch the effect in changing one parameter on other variables. Also, you can see the effect when you change two parameters instead of one.It is very good for normal application, But not complicated (do not expect yourself you will be able to solve partial differential equation)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting look at an important job","review":"This is a great behind the scenes look at a the faceless people that we may have to rely on one day. As you would expect, it contains many 911 calls, from the funny to the scary to the disturbing. The author takes it deeper and more personal though. She shares how her personal experiences prepared her for the job, as well as how it can be a sometimes rewarding, sometime defeating job.I picked up this book because I thought it might be interesting to learn what goes on in the world of emergencies, I was not disappointed.

Peter Sellers' actions are described in poor detail, just graphic enough to muddle us through his life, and we never explore the motivations of the man. It's unfortunately not overtly sad, funny, or poignant, aside from the beginning of the book, where we see him at the end of his life and comatose in the hospital for all of a dozen pages.A ghostwriter should have been hired, but seemingly wasn't.

Then I got Slime and also installed a special liner on the inside of my tires. Have gone many months now with not one flat. The Slime is easy to install and I put half a bottle in each tire. Although it has been about a year, there was also one incident where the Slime sealed the leak long enough for me to get home, avoiding a long walk. I have also noticed that with Slime in the tubes I have to air them less often (tubes naturally lose air over time and prior to Slime I was having to air my tires every week - now I just check them once a month). One caution is in order and that is that Slime does not seal all leaks. Slime is great for punctures, like from a nail, but it usually does not seal cuts or slashes in the tube (say from a piece of glass making much more than a simple puncture)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slime","review":"Slime is one of those products that makes you appreciate the 21st century even more.

It is the worst product I have ever used. At least in the small applicance category. It is going in the trash today. It has a nagging tendency to stick, no-stick surfaces notwithstanding. It has a flimsy metal clip that is supposed to keep the swivel mechanism locked in place. It broke on the third use. Sine then, it will not stay upright when you turn it to extract the waffle. Extract is the right word, too, since I have to peel one half off, try to get the other, then reassemble on a plate. Dreadful, terrible, awful.

I think it's the acting that is \\"as nice\\" as a sound made by a nail against a blackboard.The actress playing Paul's mother is histerical. It is painful to listen to her lines and watch her behavior on the screen. In fact the second part of the movie is played in such manner by each of main characters.A lot of scenes look and sound fake - like the gays mothers' meeting or the the part, where she hits on Richard in his hotel room or (you can add here your own)...As far as I am concerned, this film is a huge disappointed. Second star for pictures of Barcelona and music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting; Disappointing Story","review":"So much potential and so little fulfillment. This film has some great acting by Kevin Bishop (Paul) and his mother played by Juliet Stevenson. Their chemistry is evident. Not so though with Bishop and the object of his affection (Paul Rhys) and all the other older men he seems to get involved with. It would have been nice to explore Paul's character a little more to find out the whos, the wheres and the whys of him. Sure we know he has a thing for older men...he's looking for a father figure....but we know nothing of what leads up to the breakup of his parents. His mother comes off as an irritating shrew .... especially in a scene where she comes on to Richard Kennington, the man her son is fooling around with. But the acting is first rate. Too bad the story is one note and very disappointing. This movie could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for fun","review":"Hardly a \\"great\\" movie, but it is an easy one to watch and get involved with. There are many times when I just looked at my partner watching it with me and laughed because the situation or dialogue was just ridiculous, but knowing that it was a lower budget film we let it slide. At times there are scenes that just sort of pop up out of nowhere, but the main story is easy to understand and does provoke thoughts around love, lust, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Just Happened?","review":"I'll skip the plot, since it's already well-discussed in the other reviews here. This production is beautifully photographed, technically slick and the acting very good. What the movie isn't is coherent. It's like trying read a book with pages torn out. Just when you have pieced it together, it ends, because yet more pages are missing. The script must have been inspired by a Psych 101 course that somebody cut too many times. It is difficult to feel any sympathy for the characters, since almost all are self-absorbed liars and users. I can't think of a single facet of the gay community, including PFLAG, that wouldn't be insulted by this jerky misbegotten epic, except maybe lesbians who, fortunately for them, are absent from this movie's flailing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and entertaining","review":"The acting was good and the scrip believable. The quality was top grade on video and audio. The story was seductive,Sexy, twisted and disfunctial. (Not unlike the real world) It was a good film and I recommend it. Because of a few very suggestive shots, I recommend this film for mature viewers. It has a good deal of Classical music however even if you dislike Classical music, I believe you will enjoy the story. The only negitive thing about the film is a scene where Kevin Bishop is confronting his mother, the scene appeared forced and failed to flow smoothly as it should have. Overall the film was good and would be an excellant addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love classical music....","review":"If you love classical music, this is a good movie to buy. However, I had problems with the unbelievable storyline, the sterotyping, the lack of a noticable plot, and the main character (Paul) acting like crack addict with his mood swings between seducing older men to further his career. The sound quality was very bad unless the music was playing. At one point I found myself looking to turn on the subtitles (there weren't any) because it was impossible to make out the dialogue.

I have been looking for a performance at Notre Dame because of the organ. The organ is fine; the orchestra okay [wobbly intro - reminiscent of LPs!]; and 38 minutes????? on a CD?

I was disappointed to say the least. These are poor quality and sound. The first problem I had was as soon as I tried to use the adapter to the computer it FELL apart. I tried to glue it together but it never was the same. I had another adapter so I just used it. Still little bass, mostly mono treble. Then they say you can purchase a d/c adapter at any electronics store to help charge the transmitter sad to say after looking around I couldn,t find a 12v 200ma adapter anywhere. So I figured I'd just use a rechargeable 9 V battery no problem. The problem is poor quality. The stinkin' battery door keeps falling off. Bottom line I'll give it to my son for his gaming and make my old RCA last til Christmas when I'll spend a few more bucks on a better quality and sound device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe it or not...","review":"... they actually don't work.

This import is a must-have for any Diana fan or anyone who is curious how the woman built a successful solo career after the Supremes. Why Motown/Universal has not released ANY DVDs of her concerts over the years is a big mystery, considering the amount of other concert DVDs that have been released for much lesser-known artists. The only US release was Diana Ross'sDiana Ross Live - The Lady Sings... Jazz & Blues (Stolen Moments)from December 1992 which was a very special, unique concert she gave, and never repeated. This live show from 1979 was performed frequently that year at several venues. The album she had just released wasThe Boss, so her performances of The Boss and I Ain't Been Licked are fresh and stirring. There are so many special moments throughout the show, that all I can say is buy this and enjoy! You will be sucked in right from the opening, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Changed My Opinion - This Deserves 5 Stars !!","review":"I had originally slammed this dvd because the Korean import I had appeared to be an inferior product.

It's slightly frightening to a potential patient to now have first hand knowledge of how much contempt the medical profession has for patients. I will be on guard in the future, whether it is on my behalf or on behalf of a loved one. This was not a well written book though. Could have used a good proofing for grammar to make it more of a deep, memorable read. Instead, I felt as if I were listening to a good friend over coffee or a beer and hearing a multitude of heart stopping experiences from her exciting and trying career as an Emergency Room Nurse. Again, a very enjoyable and educating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nursing is The Real Deal","review":"Thanks Roxy, for saying everything we nurses have always wanted to say. I appreciate Roxy's candor and no-holds-barred writing. To some readers Roxy may sound like she's the only nurse who can do anything good or right, but let's face it...any nurse worth his or her salt has to have extreme confidence in order to excell. And yes, nursing and the EMS are the only frontline professionals who do make a difference. No other job is as difficult or imperative as theirs. After all, your life is in their hands...let's hope they're more than capable. Thank you Roxy, for the laughs, the tears, and the memories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire a contortionist for your exorcism.","review":"The only creative thought that emerged from yet another exorcism movie is that when you need to bend your body in some way that most people deem impossible is to be sure to hire a good contortionist which is what these producers did. The entire movie consists of one contortionist back bending (as usual) scene. The rest of the movie - I forgot what it's about. Yes, it's that forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil Inside. DOES NOT DESERVE THE SLANDER!","review":"This film was a great movie, not the best ever made and not what the trailer let on but still a very great film!THE ENDING was brilliant!

I think the studios are no longer many big pics so they buy these SYFY channel movies and put their stamp on them. I can not stand these college kids hand held cam movies anymore it like what U'd expect from a really bad home made porn movie.... If the camera work was professional maybe the film would have stood a change. Word to the wise; if you have epilespy, vertigo or get sea sick or have motion sickness take your meds before hand.... just did not make the grade.two stars for the acting, one for the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible Movie","review":"I sat through this whole movie expecting to see at least a twist in the ending and I got nothing, not pay off, no excitement. Just plain boring talking the whole time with hardly any horror or violence. I read the outline to this story a year before it came out in a survey I took and the ending had a twist but the movie did not at all. I was extremely disappointed that nothing happened in this movie. Nothing exciting. I cannot believe that this came to the theaters and made money. This is some student straight to dvd type of film. Absolutely boring. If you want to be bored, this is for you. I had such high hopes for this movie. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAIT FOR IT ON THE PREMIUM CHANNELS","review":"Although, The Devil Inside is not a horrible movie, I still felt I paid too much for it as an Instant Video! Like many before me have said, the predictably was so bad that I had to force myself to stop rolling my eyes (it was giving me a headache, I was rolling them so often). By the time the movie ended, I felt like I was possessed... with boredom and regret. I would, however, recommend this movie on Halloween on VH1 (but never when you are paying for it directly). The Devil Inside seemed to be making a statement against the Catholic Church for not approving more exorcisms, and forcing people to suffer through a possession. I don't think the people who made this movie realized that the only people suffering was their target audience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Stress To You Enough, How Terrible This Movie Is...","review":"I am a huge fan of scary movies, especially exorcism scary movies, and I even like some bad scary movies because they are so bad they are almost good. But this movie is the all time worst movie ever made. I absolutely hated it and hated everything about it. The main character made me so angry that I was happy when she might have died in the end. I say might have died because the end was a cliffhanger. But not even a good cliffhanger where you can't wait for the next movie to come out so you can find out what happened. No, in the movie when the movie ended, I was just so happy that it ended, that I don't care at all what happened to any of the charters. I can only fantasize that they all died. The movie was completely predictable, not at all scary unless you are a complete half-wit or unless you've never seen a single scary movie before. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or movie renting or buying this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have heeded the bad reviews.","review":"$3.99 and 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I love faux documentaries AND exorcism movies (The Exorcist is my all-time favorite of any genre), but this movie was just terrible. The story - daughter tries to figure out why her mother killed 3 people during an exorcism and was whisked to Italy afterwards - is horribly executed. The acting was awful and unconvincing, the script pathetic (even their attempts to rip off parts of The Exorcist were bad), the camera work tried to mask lame effects but didn't... you get the idea. I didn't mind how it ended at all - I felt nothing for any of the characters and the ending meant that this terrible, terrible movie was OVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie should be call garbage on tape","review":"i love horror movies however this movie was extreemly stupid even for a horror movie.

The room of people who watched in my house was not happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Budget - not for you if you like Hollywood-type horror","review":"I felt compelled to write a review after the scathing reviews of this film. It's no Exorcist, but creepy nonetheless. Whether they are using contortionists to do the ultra creepy possession scenes or not - the effect is still startling. The acting could have used a little upgrade, but overall a fine film for low-budget. The premise is interesting, being a found footage and all. I would recommend this for fans of low budget horror and go into it with an open mind. I usually like the one star horror films and art films, so you may not want to take my opinion to heart. Oh! Also, defintely try to watch it with 5.1. Missing pieces of the soundtrack will lessen the overall effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have low standards, but... seriously?","review":"I'm not even sure where to begin. The idea of demonic possession, even for a self-described atheist such as myself, is inherently creepy. I've seen my fair share of movies on the subject and I almost always find something worthwhile in them. When I started the movie, I had no expectations, which I suppose is good, since it wouldn't have lived up to any of them.Aside from a creepy (but very brief) performance by Suzan Crowley, the acting teetered between uninspired and over-the-top. The characters were uninteresting and under-developed, the story itself was extremely \\"ho hum,\\" and the ending literally made me laugh out loud. Not because it was funny, but because it was so abrupt and unsatisfying, that all I could think of was, \\"Is that seriously the end of the movie?\\"This might literally be the worst movie I've seen this year. And I just watched \\"The Darkest Hour\\" a few weeks ago. That's how bad. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Awful ending and just a waste of time.

What's the poing of watching a movie if you can't see what the hell is going on!?!

You would think they would be able to make a better exorcism movie since all they need do is spend some quality time chatting up the priests, cardinals and maybe even El Popo. But not, this was the lamest excuse for a horror movie since Blair Witch. There is some value in this movie though. If you are allergic to sleeping medications and have insomnia, WATCH THIS! You will fall asleep and get a great night's rest without the reactions and next-day hang-over. My six year old step-son makes up more horrifying tales than this. It was a bland as eating a slice of white bread for supper. Had I paid for a theater ticket back when this was making its rounds I would have been most unhappy.

The nun on the cover.....however long you look at that nun is longer than she is actually in the movie.The acting isn't great, but it is suppose to be presented as documentary style, so I suppose the acting is sufficient.

Unfortunately, it does not deliver on the scary promise.The idea is interesting enough, I suppose, but from the outset I just did not care about any of the people.

I really think that you have to be into a wide variety of horror movies and you have to like exorcism movies to like this movie. If your just looking for a cheap thrill as they say in a horror movie, this one is probably not for you.

And especially what you teach to others. -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little things and big things","review":"I have had this book recommended to me and hadn't gotten around to reading it. I concur with an earlier reviewer about little historical inaccuracies that are annoying. The authors state that the motto \\"In God We Trust\\" was put on American money from the period following the revolution, but that phrase was put on some coins after the civil war and not on all coins until the 1950's. But for me the main problem is theological. The authors do not state that the church is the New Israel. Rather the United States is the New Israel. How other readers who presumably would value the Bible as the final source of truth could stomach that is beyond me. As a dispensationalist, I would want to maintain a distinction between Israel and the church. But I can understand the idea from Scripture that the church is in a sense the new Israel.

Certainly, the faith and courage exhibited by the earliest pioneeers makes for inspirational reading and, to be fair, the authors work quite hard to sustain the impetus of their presentation. The narrative lags seriously in a few places and the writers' uncertainties are made apparent to the reader, which hardly adds to the power of the argument.

A year later, however, upon repeated listenings, I have come to appreciate this song very much. The melody does not have an immediate hook but, like a lot of songs I have grown to admire, it has begun to affect me in a very positive way. I urge Johnny's fans to give this song another chance, especially the coda that blends with the last words of \\"Silent Night.\\"As for the rest of the album, it too, like good wine, gets better with age. For example, Johnny almost makes me forget Burl Ives with his treatment of \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\" and \\"Snowfall\\" gives me chills with its gorgeous evoking of an afternoon gazing out the window at falling snow.If you're a Mathis fan you owe it to yourself to give this CD repeated listenings.

What a disappointment. Yes, like other reviewers, I found the light to be completely worthless but more importantly, the mirror itself is horrible, cheap, crap. I thought that for $40 it would actually be glass, not a piece of shiny paper glued to plastic. The distortion is really bad--the piece of paper that is supposed to be the mirror is very rippley and stripey. And, to top it all off, when I removed the sticker shouting out magnification, it made a bubble where it pulled up some of the \\"mirror\\". This one's going back. Hopefully I can find something that actually resembles a mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost wonderful...","review":"This was a gift. Reading the box I was so excited to have a mirror where I'd be able to see what I was doing and have an attractive mirror. However, the base is extremely sensitive so it's very easy to turn the mirror off while using it. The most disappointing aspect is the low wattage of the light. If someone is purchasing this type of mirror they obviously NEED the light. If you are fortunate enough to have plenty of sunlight available then the large diameter and 7x magnification is great.

It was nice to be able to use this as a spring board of how to verbalize what was going on in my head during that time and even still today. I think that everyone's journey in an eating disorder is different but it is nice to know that there are people out there that can relate to your battle with food.

Another thing is that this book and therapy and stuff is only going to work on someone who is ready to stop their behavior. This book should have been more about comforting and supporting self-injurers instead of judging them for a behavior they cannot help. I don't see what is wrong with injuring yourself in order to feel calmer and happier.

Strauss directed that the sounds of the hunting party be played by an offstage band, to make them sound distant.

I loved that the story continued with David and Jessica. It was interesting to find out more about Lalibela and the Immortal Brothers.I did feel like maybe the editors chopped the story some. It felt a little disjointed. I was disappointed that it too so long for David and Jessica to reconcile their feelings with one another.Ms. Due wove a masterful creation with this book and it's prequel. As a reader I could identify with Jessica, and David reminded me of my husband it certain ways. The characters had just the right balance to make you feel like you knew them. I told several of my friends about these books and I would recommend them again, without hesitation.If there is a part three on the way... I can hardly wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Due knocks it out of the park with this must read sequel.","review":"I liked \\"My Soul To Keep\\", but I LOVED \\"The Living Blood\\"!!Due masterfully weaves together a suspenseful, exciting story pulling together a wealth of charaters, events and themes so brilliantly, I could hardly bring myself to close the book. A definite page turner!And the imagery - my God, the imagery!! Especially in respects to the life colony - rich, vivid and all at once ominous and beautiful!I can't wait for the next installment of the lives of these immortals. If there's any justice in the world, Due will write a series of sequels equally, if not more impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Serious Horror Aficianado","review":"King, Straub, Koontz, Barker, Rice...trust me, I've read them all. While others' work seemingly becomes stale & strained, Tananarive Due serves it up fresh. \\"The Living Blood\\" is an enthralling story intertwined with the spooky & sublime; a tale that leads the reader through a whirlwind of emotions, suspense, international travel and supernatural encounters. From cover to cover this is a brilliant piece of work, which will surely be an asset to every well-rounded literary collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoyed My Soul to Keep - this is part II!","review":"A gripping follow up to My Soul to Keep!

Now they're no different than any other blueberry brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmm mmm good","review":"These blueberries are dried while retaining moisture like ransins. They are plump and large.

Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading for this election year (or any other)","review":"Here are four in-depth conversations, most centering on art and politics, published in 2001. Considering the tidal wave of events since then, it's astounding how these interviews still resonate with contemporary issues. Depending on your point of view you'll find Rollins, Biafra, and to a certain extent Billy Childish, insightful or exasperating in their politics, but its hard to miss the passion in their arguments. Ferlinghetti, by far, takes the longest view of events past and present, and suggests solutions (some new, some old), sounding the most conservative by comparison. Many will consider these four exchanges as nothing more than preaching to the already converted, but in this political season they take on the character of voices crying in the wilderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Recording Ever","review":"Out of all the recordings of any music I have ever purchased, this one is far and away the worst. There is absolutely no soul in the performance. The orchestra rushes through parts that should be savored, and then lazily marches through areas that should be more intense. The violence done here to key moments in \\"Swan Lake\\" is an appalling abortion. I have heard many recordings of \\"Swan Lake\\" and would recommend just about any of them over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl has truly been interrupted!","review":"I know that this will be the most slept on album of 2002.

The songs on this album like \\"Count It Off\\" and \\"Jade's A Champ\\" show what a great lyricist Ms.Jade is. The album is full of great songs with the exception of a few weak ones.

All and all, this book is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Nuance","review":"This is an interesting book but suffers a bit from Gerald Pozneritis, whereby one is so angered by \\"conspiracists\\" that the author neglects the ambiguity of events for a \\"case closed\\" finality. For instance the author here never really addresses the incredibly prejudicial atmosphere in which the Hauptman trail took place in. Or the reality that some of the evidence was faked by the New Jersey police (he ignores that Jafsie's phone number was written in Hauptman's place, self confessed by a journalist). This doesn't make Hauptman innoncent but it is dishonest to gloss over the serious misdeeds in the case. If a guilty man is not given a fair trial that is surely still cause for major concern! An issue the author simply can not face."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dose of sanity","review":"For goodness' sake, how much evidence do the conspiracy wackos need before they come back to planet Earth? Fisher shows how Hauptmann a) had the money, b) owned the wood that was used to make the ladder, c) owned the nails that were used to make the ladder, d) had a criminal record involving threats on babies and the use of ladders, e) gave up work as soon as the ransom was paid, f) never worked again once the kidnapper was paid his money - and much more. His book (and his original and more comprehensive earlier work) should be a breath of fresh air for the conspiracy theorists. Unfortunately, absolutely nothing will convince them that Bruno Richard Hauptman was a thoroughly evil child murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodness","review":"Uninspiring, mean-spirited rehash of the official New Jersey State Police line. Useful for those who would like to know how the police wish the case (and their conduct) to be viewed, but slightly hysterical.

Forget the various Lindbergh baby imposters and the revisionist histories of Scaduto, Kennedy and the rest. Fisher's impressive research shoots 'em all down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been magazine article","review":"Although only 161 pages, it was still too long. Scott Berg did a much better job in his seminal biography of Lindbergh (which is less expensive). Mediocre to poor writing at best; frequently obtuse. This is a greatly expanded magazine type article. He sarcastically and self righteously criticizes an actress for protraying Mrs. Hauptmann even though she had doubts about Hauptmann's guilt. I guess no movies or plays can be made about guilty people. That illogical statement is illustrative of the author's approach. He should go back to the FBI where that type of thinking is highly valued and rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"The State is Always Right","review":"A typical ignorant diatribe to convince the pliable that the state does not make mistakes.A view of the trial documents by anyone ready for a bar exam would reveal any number of reversable errors, not to mention an inadequate defense. Hauptmann's own words just before his execution are cause for reasonable doubt. It is one thing to claim there is no proof that Hauptmann was innocent, but that goes against the standard of assumption of innocence.The fact is only Hauptman (and the real killer/killers if any) knew if he was innocent, and the state proved its case only to the jury. I can't imagine anyone the state would have had in that position going free, regardless of guilt or innocence.To call any question of the acuracy of the verdict in this trial \\"revisionism\\" is akin to objecting to the modern day view that the segregation and Jim Crow laws up to the 60's satisfied the current legal process, but were nonetheless morally despicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medium was Soft and like play dough","review":"This one has all the defects, like stickiness, coming apart etc, of a play dough.

We buy multi-packs of the larger size of our favorite flavor (Valdosta Blend), but since it stays fresher much longer than chips, candy and cookies, we can keep the variety pack on hand for guests. It's healthier than most snack foods; it's new and fun for guests since it's not readily available in stores; and it appeals to all age groups except the oldest (due to nuts). Target sometimes has a flavor or two in stock, but you can't count on it. Good price at Amazon and it arrives fast and nicely packaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new snack around","review":"They're delicious, nutrious, and far more flavorful than most healthy snacks on the market.

As to which one is best, opinions are divided depending on personal tastes for interpretation and sound quality.

The DVD picture quality is also quite good, and it is nice not to have network adverts crawling across the screen.However, I cannot give a good rating to a DVD set which hacks up the original show. If you're really a fan, you will consider this to be a low-quality, defective release, and you may consider it inferior to off-air copies.The theme music has been completely replaced with a different song. This should have been noted on the description; yet another case of false advertising in DVDs. The original song is, of course, much more appropriate and better.There may be other unidentified cuts and alterations, as the series used a lot of rather expensive music.The versions on Amazon Unbox and iTunes have the same cuts.The DVDs have several mastering errors; the \\"choose episode\\" option simply doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsifying product description","review":"I have always been very happy with purchases from Amazon, but this is an exception.

The pianist periodically throws in dotted rests and rubato that aren't anywhere in the score. I suppose in order to add a \\"deeply personal emotional emphasis\\" to the music. Instead, it just breaks the melodic flow of these sublime pieces of music. Meanwhile, von Karajan is beating mercilessly on the orchestra in an effort to get through everything as quickly as possible -- perhaps he's bored and would rather be doing something else.The overall effect is more like a wonky version of John Philip Sousa than Schumann and Grieg. I really regret having bought this CD, but I will at least have the joy of feeding it into a shredder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtuosity yet with so much feeling","review":"I compared almost 30 interpretations of the Schumann piano concerto and ended up with 3 : Abbado/Pires, Karajan/Zimerman and a surprising one : \\"Robert Schumann: Meisterwerke Zum Kennenlernen\\" with the czech pianist Marian Lapsansky. 1) Pires plays with so much delicacy and introspection, the flow of keytrokes is seamless : very refreshing and compelling esp. for the 1st & 2nd movement. 2) Zimerman displays great virtuosity without playing too fast, esp. in the 3rd movement which is arresting. 3) the czech interpretation lays in-between. I was surprised an unknown interpretation could be that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively, with a very full sound","review":"Two oft-paired piano concertos are available together on this album played by one the worlds best orchestras with on of the best piano players of recent times. This is very well recorded, with the BPO at their best producing a very full sound. Zimmerman plays with great feeling and panache.However, the Schumann Concerto is sometimes uneven in parts with the fortissimos emphasised a bit too much at times and occaisionally Zimmerman's playing is a bit uneven especially in the third movement. If you want a truly superlative recording of the Schumann piece try Sir Colin Davis' recording with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (Steven Kovacevich piano).The recording of the Grieg concerto cannot be faulted and must represent one of the best recordings of this particular piece on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well executed, musical performance","review":"There have been a couple of reviews that should be dispelled. The tempos chosen are perfect and not too fast......Karajan reigns in the young Zimerman's virtuosity to musical ends. Recording quality is excellent.

They value innocence - they wouldn't want to destroy it, and frown on those that do.Just to fill in a bit of defense for the Satanists, as my Wiccan/Witch fellows have already put in a good huzzah for them. This author really does need to do more research, and the quality of said research needs to improve greatly. Christians be warned, you are NOT getting an accurate description of Witchcraft, Wiccanism, and Satanism from this man. This book fuels only hatred, paranoia, and ignorance.

If you want that episode, you'll have to purchase it separately. I don't know why it's not included, but it should be, as it is part of the series.

However, a lot of the plot is what Hitchcock would call the \\"maguffin\\" -- the 'whatever' on which to hang the script.The real center of this series is the contrast of class. The two central characters have an unexpressed love for each other which subtly supercedes and cancels out any other relationships that they try to form. It is not a love of bump and grind, but rather a deep respect, a reaching out past class distinctions, and a primary need to see each other every day. Occasionally one will reach out to the other, only to be gently rebuffed. The excellent writing allows them barriers which they tentatively reach across.I watched the whole thing, amazed by the subtlety in which the two characters hang on to this fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also very dissapointed","review":"I have to agree with the previous writer. After viewing A Great Deliverance, I thought that the series would do a creditable job by these intricate and thought provoking mysteries.

The television version of George's \\"A Great Deliverance\\" had been well done, and I hoped to see that quality continued in these productions. When I watched the PBS broadcasts, my hopes were dashed. For some reason, the producers decided to try to fit these adaptations into a broadcast time of under 90 minutes each (whereas \\"A Great Deliverance\\" was a two-parter that ran for a total of nearly 3 hours). To do so, George's intricate, nuanced plots were butchered, and her complex character interactions reduced to mind-numbing simplicity. The one redeeming feature is that Nathaniel Parker gives a good performance as Tommy Lynley.Whether you are a lover of Elizabeth George's novels, as I am, or are just looking for a good mystery video, you should try something else, as this set would be a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Complex than the Books","review":"Not as flashy as some other British police procedurals but quite solid and interesting.

Instead of unrequited love or the pecadilloes of wearers of the old school tie, she is wrestling with the more realistic problems of aging parents and attendant guilt.They make a very good detecting combination.However, I did fixate on one thing-- Lynley's upper lip.

Great size, texture, material.Mine came with a tiny pencil, but instead I used sharpie to write on them. Inside, with my seedlings, they fared well. I put the plants outside, however, and left the stakes with the plants. After a period of time outside, and watering, they are white again.Good news is that means they are reusable.Bad news is, if you wanted to remember what variety a plant was, you'd better have kept notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible for writing on","review":"If you want to use a pencil to write on these forget it. A marker works well but you can erase the marker to reuse the stake. So, if you plant the same thing and want to always have the same labels makers work well. For writing with a pencil to erase and reuse, don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puccini - Madame Butterfly / Huang, Troxel","review":"This recording has several \\"breaks\\" or \\"skips\\" in the flow of the music. If it were an old LP record I'd look for a scratch. I received a second product from the seller - but it was exactly the same . . . so the problem is the actual recording. Look for another Madame Butterfly because this will annoy you every time you listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please consider this before purchasing this...","review":"As it has been stated before, Ricky Carralero actually painted over the works of another artist and took credit for it.

BOUGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER AS WELL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Stuff - crappy production values","review":"This is a nice reading of Tolle's work, done by the author. Comments about his reading style aside (to each his own in the regard), these CDs have a serious problem: the tracks do not break at sensible points. Some tracks begin with the sound of a bell and Tolle beginning to talk about an idea or read from the start of a chapter or section. Other tracks, most of them in fact, begin in the middle of a talk someplace, and a more than a few begin in the middle of sentences.If you're listening to it straight through, you won't notice. But if you want to stop at the end of a track and then start the next track in sequence later, the editing makes doing so extremely difficult. Instead of just remembering which track you last listened to, you have to remember which track and how far into the track you were when you hit pause or stop.Most annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing Book","review":"I can't write enough about this book and how true its words resonate with me and those I have lent it to. Tolle is truly a master of interpreting reality and shows a path to achieving piece of mind and clarity in all your actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The power of now","review":"Enlightening, liberating, and insightful. Requires several reads to comprehend the deep meanings. Could bring peace in your mind.

It's a necessary tool today if we want to stay grounded through the madness in our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"If not Now, when?","review":"Life changing. Read it, slowly, become present in the moment, pause and read it again. Practice living in the Now, become enlightened. Pick up a copy of \\"A New Earth\\" by Tolle too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power of Now Audio Book Review","review":"In my opinion - the content of this audio book is very enlightening. SInce I am on the spiritual path of learning how to live \\"in the moment\\" I truly enjoyed the various topics and means of achieving that presented therein. I listended to it on my commute to and from wortk and now my boyfriend is listening to it! It is contageous!!! It also helps alleviate road rage HA HA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The way to live","review":"I read a lot of books on spirituality and this one follows the same line of thinking. It's a little academic and I'm not sure it simplifies the concepts of Being, inner peace ect.. In a way that the average reader would be able to grasp. It isn't written for the beginner in this journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging to read, harder still to live by","review":"Tolle's 'The Power of Now' is potent and inspiring, even if the course he suggests following is challenging. The topic is almost so simple you miss it, which might explain why he introduces numerous routes in to his premise. I found Anthony De Mello's 'Awareness' as engaging, if not easier to grasp and apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Inspirational and definitely a good read. I would recommend to others. I pick this book up when I need a reality check, to focus on the present instead of letting my mind roam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily Understood Guide","review":"Reading this book was like a condensed version of the many classes I have attended from my spiritual teacher. Eckhart Tolle presents difficult to comprehend subjects in simple to understand language. However, do not expect that this \\"easy read\\" will result in instant enlightenment. He sets the basics down, it is up to the reader to absorb and act upon the lessons.I always leave a weekend workshop at my spiritual teacher's ashram on a natural high. This book gave me that same feeling. It is a wonderful book to help guide you on your spiritual journey.Author of the award winning book,Harmonious Environment: Beautify, Detoxify and Energize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Now","review":"This book is eye opening.

I just DO NOT LIKE this book!! It was a waste of my money!! it's too hard to understand so much of it and I struggled through what I DID read although i didn't finish it. It's just not interesting. (to me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The power of words","review":"Tolle's words bridge the gap between reality and illusion by explaining that it's the \\"now\\" which forms the basis of our spiritual self. Excellent read. And if you're in the mood for another thought-provoking book, then I'd recommend I Wish I Never Told My Father I Didn't Like Cheesecake, by Simon Waters, M.D. Incredible tale of love and inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at All What I Expected","review":"I thought I was purchasing a book that would help with coping, not worrying about things that may not happen, just improve my day-to-day life. Instead I got a dry, unreadable book that echoed philosophy books' language and it went straight to the used book stores. I was so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"As I tell family and friends: it's not an easy read at first, but you get used to the language. And when you begin to understand what he's saying about the human condition and, in a nutshell, why we're so miserable and what we can do to end the suffering... it not only makes sense but it's a solution that's been THERE and INSIDE YOU all this time! I've begun implimenting his teachings into my life (enjoying the \\"now\\" instead of being upset about the past, or worrying about the future) and I feel so at peace. My children are happier, I don't fight with my husband nearly as much, TRAFFICE doesn't even bother me! The other day... I made my own stomach ache go away when I started to get nurvous about being late. I took a moment, remembered to enjoy that moment, and the pain stopped. I felt calm, at ease... and I wasn't late after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of now","review":"This book is a little \\"out there\\", I felt a bit lost trying to listen to it on audio CD. I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a Tollist","review":"All I can say is I am listening to it again for the third time. I cannotexpress what you can learn from this cd set. It is a cure for thatnagging voice in your head that tells you what to be afraid of, insecureabout, judgmental of and all the other negatives you don't even realize youare hearing in your minds ear. Even if you are a Christian, Jew, or Muslimthis is a way of being, you can believe whatever else you want and still getthe maximum benefit from Eckhart Tolle. This has improved my stress level andrelationships and my understanding of the way we think and act. Try it !!!!You will only be better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book on Meditation - But Beware.....","review":"Seems like Eckhart Tolle took Zen Buddist concepts, added a dash of Christianity, and wrote a book. The basic concept is to find a way to quiet your mind and live in the Now. Great ideas.However, the book is not helpful. When the author tries talk about adopting his concepts to the everyday world, reality gets in the way. For example, he recommends that we let go of the concept of \\"time.\\" Later, when addressing this cosmic concept, he retreats to a more practical approach - we're to let go of \\"psychological time\\" but keep \\"clock time.\\"And, suggesting that we let go of our ego just seemed plain ironic in light of the author's apparent self regard.I was so frustrated, I quit the audio tape half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing here","review":"I am glad to see on reviews of this book, that so far, many of the negative ones have not been deleted as has happened in his book A New earth when ten reviews last week that were negative were taken off the site. They were not nasty just negative like many of the reviews here.I agree with the reviewers here that got little benefit from this book.They said it all and better for me. Be warned though if you are reading this and thinking of writing a negative review it may not stay on site for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled... ...","review":"Yes, people love this book as they feel much more in control and at peace with their lives, but these new-age effects are merely short-lived. Life will become a drag again, despite the knowledge and awareness of the subconscious mind etc. And the search for fufillment continues..This is a feel-good book riddled with numerous deceptions. At first glance it may seemingly make sense, e.g the denial of time, and the non-person of Christ. There are too many to list here, but if you're really curious about this highly-acclaimed book, read it and decide. HOWEVER, don't accept the contents as truth without careful judgment first.What is feeding him this so-called wisdom? His Being or non-mind? And where do they, or it, originate?It's essentially a feel-good book that is likely to produce short-term personal success, but I strongly feel it's a travesty of the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't throw your money away","review":"Beyond the first few lines it's a load of waffled gobbledygook.

But no concentrate on THE POWER OF NOW, the warm cozy bed... the feeling in your body....screw the past which led you to your miserable present, dont worry about it, you have nothing to learn from it, screw the future who cares you will be fat, just stay in bed because its all about the present, about THE POWER OF NOWAfter I read it, I was left confused and unhelped, feeling wasted my time and depressed..

But as soon as I heard Tolle's voice, the knowledge and enjoyment I previously had gleaned just kinda' deflated and balloon-farted out the window. His heavily accented German is hard to understand and makes it an effort in heavy concentration to listen to and just peacefully enjoy. My wife was similarly let down upon hearing his somewhat high-pitched and most assuredly not-ready-for-prime-time reciting voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Now","review":"The concept that \\"we live in the now\\" is something I believe in.

I am extremely disappointed with this transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life... I'm free from the pain!","review":"I bought this book trying to discover how to become more spiritual, but what I got was the answer to virtually every problem in my life! The reviews you read here are true. This is such a great book. Do you have \\"baggage\\" in your life that's interfering with your relationships? This book can change that. Are you your own worst enemy? This book can change that. Do you have people in your life who constantly drag you down or [drag] you into their problems? This book can change that? Do you worry all the time? This book can change that. Whether you are religious or not, it doesn't matter. This book speaks to you on a different level than you've ever realized is within you. I recommend the audio book. Tolle speaks very slowly, but that's okay, because there is SO much to think about and absorb in what he's saying that slow is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you believe","review":"I read this book and listened to the tape. Tolle is a gifted communicator of spiritual ideas. But Tolle is a man, not God, and remember: he's selling something. His main points, that we are not our minds and we should live in the present, are presented in the most clear and persuasive manner I've ever seen. I've found them enormously helpful. Yet, as a lifelong Lutheran, I am skeptical of the many \\"spiritual truths\\" he issues so declaratively. He also endorses \\"A Course in Miracles,\\" a New Age text supposedly channeled straight from God. It's time to start asking questions about his ideas. A good place to start would be Not Necessarily the New Age: Critical Essays, edited by Robert Basil. Other books about New Age thinking can be found in libraries. Just do a subject search on \\"New Age movement.\\" Don't just adopt religious ideas because someone states them in a soothing, authoritative way--and various celebrities thought the book was great. Your soul and mind are too important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychobabble on Steroids","review":"This book was created by a down on his luck nobody preying on the insecurities and fears of the masses in order to gain a following and all the cash that goes with it. His ideas are complex, disjointed, confusing and misleading. Rather than encouraging people to face reality and stand up to bullies and abusers, he advises people who have been bullied and abused to \\"surrender\\" to them. That is the worst counsel you can give to someone who has been traumatized."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Now CD","review":"Never received this item and was dissapointed that it was listed as available when they knew they didn't have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book can wake you up, if you are open to it.","review":"This is an entry into a new way of seeing and being, and Tolle breaks down the process with crystal clear prose, if one can slow down enough to allow the shift in perception that our culture makes difficult. This is a guidebook. You have to practice what you learn. But I've not seen another spiritual book that lays out the situation we are born into as human beings--and the solution, which is, after all, beyond language--in as clear and deep and thorough a way."},{"rating":"1","title":"short version","review":"Boring. These are not original ideas and the style drags and drags. If the author cited his sources, I might have been able to tolerate it. I wouldn't suggest to anyone to read this book for the spiritual content -- as others comment, there are far better books for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try reading Gangaji, she's the goods","review":"For the same information delivered with more elegance, authenticity, and passion, read anything by a woman in Northern California named Gangaji. She lives and radiates what Eckhart tries so hard to intellectualize. Also try to see a video of one of her talks--the light in her eyes and in her laugh reflects the truth of her words and goes straight to your heart.It's like the difference between reading a very good cookbook and feasting on a divine meal....Gangaji is satisfying beyond the intellect. Not a best-seller, at least not yet, but she's the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 cents..","review":"There are good and new ideas in this book. Unfortunately, what is good is not new.

Eckhard Tolle can and does in The Power of Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendence","review":"I'm convinced this is the best book on Spiritual Englightenment ever written. It is simple, clear, direct and easy to read. Given the subject, that is a major feat in itself. Written in the form of a dialogue, it's more like a conversation than a textbook. If every human being could learn to be \\"present\\" in the way that Tolle suggests, all the problems that plague the human race would be ended. This book can unlock the riddles of the universe. Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BIBLE OF THIS CENTURY","review":"NO ROOM TO REVIEW. THIS BOOK IS A MIRACLE. WHEN I READ THIS BOOK, I FEEL MORE POWERFUL, I FEEL THAT MY POWER IS ACTIVATED.

The big problem I had was with the amount of ego Eckhart inflicts upon the reader. The stuff he's sharing is ancient wisdom, not \\"his.\\" If you want a guru who seems to enjoy basking in your admiration, you'll like this book. If, on the other hand, you appreciate the self-deprecating aspects of most \\"masters\\" this author will turn you off in Chapter One, if not earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"There is one good idea in this book, \\"live in the present\\" it's then repeated ad nauseum for 229 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book took a Tolle on me.","review":"I found a lot of Mr. Tolles ideas a bit eccentric and a bit off the wall. While I think he has a handle on spirituality, I'm not entirely sure he has a firm grip on that handle. The one thing that was glaring (by omission,) was a feeling of joy! The ideas were written in a style almost devoid of personality and joy, leaving me kind of empty. That's not to say I didn't understand or appreciate the concepts, nor was the book poorly written - it just seemed formulaic and not particularly graceful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply blown away!","review":"I, like many others, have already read many books on inner peace and the like. But this book has just opened my mind in whole new ways. The way this author words everything is perfect. I used to have a really bad problem with constant anxiety, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out where it was coming from or even how to get rid of it. Thanks to the guidance in this book, that is now all but a thing of the past for me. I cant believe though this book has been out for over ten years, and I am just now coming across it. But of course that's completely irrelevant, and I'm just so happy to of found it now. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read from a great teacher","review":"As a mindfulness psychotherapist and teacher and author of 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' (Amazon), I frequently refer this book to my clients. It is a refreshing re-presentation of the essential teachings of the Buddha on the very human challenge that we all face - the balance between the world of conditioned \\"things\\", the emotional-thought products of the small mind, the ego, and the unconditioned dimension of pure spacious awareness that is our actual true nature and the fabric of our being. Eckhart gives us the practical insights to \\"break through to the other side.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing Book","review":"This book is amazing.

Tolle gives us one of the most valuable techniques for practicing the power of now. If you follow Tolle and his mind journey I promise you a great joy in discovering your own true self. What is missing from this book is mind programming techniques like hypnosis. My point here is to write the main exercises and program your mind with these suggestions. So if you want to find what a real inner joy is , buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never","review":"This book is beng taught in a class and it has brought a sense of peace to me in this caotic world. I am learning to not live in the past or the future, just in the now. It helps to stabalize you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a rehashing of old eastern ideas","review":"I read this book after it was recommended to me. The beginning chapter where he talks about becoming aware of his ego mind chatter was interesting, but the rest of the book is written in a question and answer format and seems to not really have any new ideas. He may have been \\"enlightened\\" for a while and it was amazing, but what he is talking about can be found in many other texts that have already been written. He is banking in the western world's ignorance of these ancient concepts that were already known. He succeeds in telling you how bad the ego is and that \\"thinking is bad\\" but with no backing in how to achieve what he is saying. I have tried to go back and read this book again, thinking I must have missed something since Oprah and Jim Carrey apparently love this book and it changed their lives, but I could not continue with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual classic that will stand the test of time","review":"This book should not be mistaken for just another self-help book, of which there are more than enough. Rather, Eckhart Tolle has correctly isolated the key concept behind numerous philosophies and religions, the importance and significance of the 'now' moment, and what it really means to spend time in this state. Those who have voted low for this book have missed out on the spiritual classic of the decade. However, we are all at different points in our spiritual evolution, and it's hardly likely that every reader will be ready for its message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!","review":"Through my journey toward spiritual enlightenment I have followed numerous paths, and by the suggestion of a respected sage took this one. Since studying this I have purchased it for others I love, each of whom found it inspiring. There are many inspirational writings available, but this you must read to understand what you will think next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative","review":"This book is a bestseller because it provides us with frame work to lifes many challenging questions. The Power of Now has differentiated for me the two things I hold in high esteem, namely my family and myself. By doing this I am in a better position to make decisions (by not intermingling these two). Another book that has proven very influential to me is Dreams: Gateway to the True Self. It's a parallel of this book in that Dreams identifies the self and provides structure to the endless sea of jargon surrounding the unconscious. Many have read both and liked what they have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifechanging book.","review":"It is very rare to find a book that enables you to actually experience the level of consciousness that the author is trying to convey. This book is not for your head. It speaks to your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"On finding peace in your everyday existence","review":"This book pulled me out of psychological misery and severe clinical depression into a satisfying, peaceful day-to-day existence. Since finishing it in July of 2008, I have been the most content I have ever been. Deepak Chopra's reviews states, \\"Every sentence rings with truth and power,\\" and this is spot on. It took me seven months to read (much slower than my usual pace) because I sometimes felt that each paragraph, or even one sentence, was enough of a lesson for the time being. I have referred back to it often, and am now enjoying \\"A New Earth.\\"I have to admit I found it odd that someone who was in their 30s (the age at which I judged Eckhart Tolle to be, based on his picture on the back cover) could speak from a place of such wisdom... then I found out he was born in 1948! Someone who looks SO young surely has to be getting something right.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Book","review":"I wasn't thrilled when my brother loaned me this book as I'm not really into \\"new age\\" or feel good type books much. But, I was pleasantly surprised. It reminds me not only of the Vajrayana Mindfulness practice, but also of the Dzogchen practice of Togal. This is one of the highest practices in all of Tibetan Buddhism. Yes, it also reminds one of Baba Ram Dass' classic work \\"Be Here Now\\" which is much more pictorial than this book. But, this book is a lot more practical with instruction on how to practice. I don't know how advanced Mr. Tolle is, but this is a fine book, well worth reading and practicing too. I'd probably give it 4.5 stars, but decided to round this one up to 5. After all, it doesn't talk about Trekcho! (the other main Dzogchen practice). In any case, this book is written simply and is quite straightforward. You don't have to be an expert or guru to get value from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a MINDBLOWER!","review":"I have no words to describe how profoundly this book has changed me AND my life.

Even before getting into the process of reading the actual book, Eckhart Tolle gives the reader the meaning of life in a quote: \\"You are here to enable the divine purpose of the Universe to unfold. That is how important you are\\". The flow of the book follows a question/answer format to bring the reader closer to enlightenment; closer to life questions answered. Not a single sentence and word is disposable for the search of inner discovery. Out of any book to shower humanity with like confetti this is the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook CD version is not good quality","review":"First, let me say that I love this book, but the audiobook version is very disappointing. I want to share this book with as many people in my life that I can, and my husband only listens to audiobooks, so I bought this for him. He doesn't like it at all, and I listened to it, it is very hard to hear the speaker, the tone of voice isn't very excited or animated at all, and I could not listen to it for very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarity at last","review":"Although the wisdom contained in this book is ancient, I'd never been able to benefit from it until I read Eckhart Tolle's interpretation. Perhaps it's because Eastern philosophy didn't translate well to my Western (American) mind. But by absorbing the message of THIS book, all of the \\"classics\\" suddenly made perfect sense. It was if someone had wiped a window clean and allowed me to see what was already there.Thank you, Mr. Tolle, for wiping that window!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money -your precious NOW!","review":"Save your money and time. Nothing new is revealed here. Tolle simply takes other peoples ideas that have been circulating about for the past two thousand years or more and claims them for himself. A couple new bents on female menstruation but other than that, not much more. As other reviewers have responded, living in the NOW is a lie. There is no NOW! Even as you read this your are moving ahead into the furture! DUH? How stupid is the public to fall for this NOW idea? Living in the present makes more sense but even that is a flawed perception.We are all products of the past. Tolle wants us to leave it behind, the who we are and have become. Not Possible! We carry our pains and pleasures with us. It is human to do so. Don't become a walking Tolle zombie new-age unreal person. Be who you are! Meditate if you must but don't make this guy another modern day billionaire guru!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Book of Truth","review":"Eckhart Tolle's \\"The Power Of Now\\" is the book of all books. As a student of Truth for the past 25 years, I felt I'd studied and worked with all the Masters, to numerous to name, then comes Eckhart Tolle who cuts through all the reading between the lines and lays it straight out, as clear and plain as the nose on your face. The tapes are a great compliment to the book, although, I carry the book around with me everywhere. Presently, it is an aide to keeping me conscious that Now is all there is.

It is easy and it is in there somewhere, apparently!There you go, I have just saved you 8 dollars. Something else to be happy about :)Ciao for now"},{"rating":"2","title":"So it's repetitve and redundant","review":"I have to say I'm really liking this book. Yes it repeats itself but for me, this is a good thing. The book has one and only one message \\"Don't think, just observe\\". He says this same message in hundreds of ways but given how vital this message is, I welcome the repetition.Most other books that I have read on the subject, from the Bible to the \\"Questions to a Zen Master\\" seem to have this same vital message but it's not IN YOUR FACE as it is in this book. For example, I found this message clearly but only in the last chapter of Deepak Chopra's \\"The Way of the Wizard\\"; it affected me powerfully... for 2 days and then it started to diminish. For me, it helps to see this message again and again to remind and motivate me to continue striving for it until it becomes second nature.If you're simply looking for a good read, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a new perspective on life, read this one with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DEEP BREATH OF FRESH AIR","review":"Take a deep breath and relax. You have found a guide to inner sanctuary. Sanctuary is inside of us. This book teaches us how to lose the anxiety and gain a sense of peace with ourselves and our present life. Wonderful. I also like I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You. It's alot heavier but in the end it too makes you feel light."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Resource","review":"Who would imagine that a concept so simple as the NOW could be so easily forgotten?! How could you forget what is?! Well, after struggling with the premise that there are no problems, and really working to get my arms around Tolle's teaching of the NOW, I was hungry for more practical applications! I could finally intuit the concept, but wanted ways to practice staying in the NOW. I was turned onto another resource called Present Moment Awareness that gave me clarity of the NOW in simple and practical terms. (So practical that I made it a required reading for my students.) So, now the two books sit together at my bedside. I thank you, Tolle, for compelling me to get present, and I thank you, Duncan, for teaching me how to stay present."},{"rating":"2","title":"No fun for the intellect","review":"Tired of your ego turning every spiritual practice into a pat on the back? The intellect dead-ends in this no frills book. It inspired me to go hear the author speak, which is an even more stunning experience...the first time I AND my friends were \\"zapped\\" with that powerful transmission coming from true silence. Subsequently, for the first time, we could actually still our minds for more than a nanosecond. Catch Tolle's dramatization of the ego grasping for status and security...it's a riot that will make it hard to take the notion of a small self as seriously again! He is, regardless, not one of the snappy dressers, not one of the glam performing gurus who will give you lots of concepts to think over and over. He WILL give you a lot NOT to think about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rein in Your Energy","review":"Because the now moment is the only time we have to change, this book brings a powerful message. As with any book, you do not have to embrace everything Tolle proposes to benefit from the overall message. What are you doing with the powers and the faculties you possess right now? This is the basic question raised, and it is a question that will be forefront in the mind of anyone seeking an understanding of the relationship between their internal and external worlds. Our external lives are the result of how we function within each new moment.Tolle offers a very deep insight into the individual's spiritual nature. Any person that has stepped upon the spiritual path will glean at least a handful of significant revelations to enhance their journey, a feature that makes this book worth owning.J Douglas Bottorff, author of The Whisper of Pialigos."},{"rating":"2","title":"The message is not new.","review":"It's another spiritual book. It points to what all spiritual teachings point to - your True-Self. There is nothing new in the message that Mr. Tolle gives to us. It is in the way the message is delivered that Mr. Tolle serves us best. He provides us with insight using language that is clear, concise, and current. No zen koans, but simple tools that can be applied in the course of your everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped","review":"I was very excited about getting this book and reading it. I am half way through it and I see nothing that enlightenening about it? He takes excerpts from the bible and intertwines them with his thoughts/opinions. Also, he is very repetitive and contractictsa lot. Do not recommend...much better books out there by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to Stop Reading","review":"I started reading this book after two individuals recommended it to me. I am finding myself more self-critical, more anxious, and more judgmental since starting the book. Today I decided to stop reading it. Perhaps it is unfair to rate the book given that I will not read the entire book, but I am surprised that so many people think this book is so special. I just hear the same thing being spoken over and over and over. Okay, I get it, live in the now. I like the ideas of dealing with pain bodies and analyzing emotions/reactions. Perhaps I am not mentally ready for the book. I may try to read it again at a later date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpful take on some eternal truths","review":"I seem to be at a place in my life where old lessons are being presented in new ways so that I'm able to understand them at a deeper level. This extremely readable book gets to the heart of \\"the meaning of life\\" in a way which may or may not speak to you where you are right now, but if you've found your way to this review, then maybe there's a reason for it and it's time for you to pick it up!I passed it on to my college-age son, who I hope finds time to give it a try, with a similar message -- not sure if you are ready for this yet, but you might be, and it is probably worth finding out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repeated simplicity is the POINT of \\"Now.\\"","review":"Why does Amazon put the most negative reviews at the top?? Reviewers disliking Tolle's repetition of the simple, essential message demonstrate the ego-mind's incessant demand for more! more! new! different! \\"Tell me something I don't already know.\\" This is the very addiction we all share, that Tolle addresses fully. Research has long shown that repetition of a message is necessary to break entrenched mental patterns.With the humility of beginner's mind, one can find in this book methods of true, \\"razor's edge\\" practice whose depth, transformative significance and power are absolutely real."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing, Life-Changing Book","review":"Incredible book, based on ancient wisdom, written in a way that is so accessible and relate-able today. This book has helped me cope with anxiety and depression, boosted my confidence with women, even made me better at the keyboard. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of this book!","review":"This book means well but it seemed to make me think more! I have been suffering with a little anxiety and got this book hoping it would help.. it did not. It made me feel like my way of thinking was completely wrong and backwards. It creeped me out the way the author says to basically quit thinking- I don't think that's a good way to approach life. I can understand calming your mind but completely shutting it down just seems unreasonable to me. However, I did take away the lesson that you should try and live more in the moment instead of constantly obsessing on the future/past."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to finish","review":"I'll make this short and sweet, ok maybe not so sweet. I listened to this audiobook and was determined to finish listening to the end as I had hoped the point the author was trying to convey would deliver some profound spiritual message. In a way it did... Live life in the here and now as it is the \\"now\\" thinking that creates everything else.THAT is the bottom line.... Listening to the monotonous drone ofEckhart Tolle was excruciating. I had also found a DVD lecture given by this author which I watched out of curiosity and thought that Mr Tolle exhibits a bit of \\"egoic superiority\\"... Ok ok he's human.The basic message,(as written above) is the essence and is an important one. so I give this review 2 stars for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"I read a dozen of these books when I was in my late teens. This version regurgitates the bulk of its ideas from Zen Buddhism with a splash of Taoism. Like rows of other books it says meditation can be beneficial, harboring destructive emotions can manifest itself in lots of ugly ways, finding a peace within can create tangible outer benefits....I'm not surprised that some people would love this book and benefit from reading it in the same way opportune timing can match a lonely man with someone to love, a friend can take a drunk to an AA meeting or a priest can offer meaning to someone in the throws of helplessness but it doesn't change the fact that the totality of new ideas would only fill a pamphlet.There are plenty of truths in this book and some people gain confidence in their own insights when they see those ideas in print but the practical benefit anyone might derive from this book will only ever be their own acceptance and appreciation of that which they already know and have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Mind Altering","review":"I was in awe of this book. I read it twice in two weeks. For me, it truly resonated. I got what he was saying loud & clear. What a great concept Eckhart Tolle has shared with us all. I truly believe it is a life changing book. With an open mind, these concepts can work for anyone. I really get that all of my pain is created in the past & in my projection of the future. Once I was able to see and feel that, I have been so much more at peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"What an incredible read. Not something one would just buzz through. I absorbed little by little, making notes for me inside.A challenge, but a thumbs up to anyone who is open to everything in thought between two covers.Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away - read mindell instead","review":"Tolle is deeply routed in the phantasy that there can be peace and good free from all of those 'bad' things. This extends to being free from power dynamics and the like. This is a little juvenile.There are good and bad things in Tolle's world. The ego vs. the self, clock time vs psychological time and so forth. More sophisticated authors move beyond this immature lens of the world.Underneath all his failings, he hits a kernel of truth supported by authors such as Joseph Campbell, Jung, or Arnold Mindell. Read them rather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy more than motivational","review":"Honestly, I got this book because I'd heard good things about it. After reading it for about 15 minutes I was so annoyed by how much preaching there was and how little valuable ideas it had that I returned it immediately. If you want a new belief system, give the book a try, but if you are just simply looking for a way to improve on the belief system you already have, this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible !!","review":"The Author tries to use Buddhist / Zen fundamentals but yet never truly acknowledges that or gives any credit to anyone but himself. He always tries to say things that the reader would like to read. He tries to give advise and 'teach' psychology which are way beyond his expertise -- because he is not a psychologist !! I think the problem is celebrities like Oprah highly 'boost' books / authors such as him b/c they themselves like these sort of 'feel good' types of books. But in the end it's readers such as us who end up absorbing all this nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing new BUT a Great book","review":"Great book for general public... technically nothing new... but much easier to read and understand than ancient spiritual scripts:)I like the languadging on the book.... not to new agy and up to the point. Osho-like...Good start..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Gibberish","review":"Don't know what Oprah is thinking about the ability of the author's words to inspire. I found it practically unreadable but laced here and there with some truthful generalities. I'd say Eckhardt Tolle has found a self-help formula that chooses gibbberish words from columns A and B that sells books. I purchased the book to take on a trip. Unable to stay with it, I even tried moving forward and finally gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like the Power of Taking Your Money Because You're Gullible","review":"I purchased this book halfway through reading Dave Ursillo's sycophantic ode to Tolle in \\"Lead Without Followers.\\" If THAT awful book was any indication on how dreadful Tolle's book would be, I missed it... and regrettably suffered about halfway through this so-called extraordinary book before I wised up and just stopped reading. Hey, I've suffered through depression too, but I didn't come out the other side a condescending D-bag. Just another reason everyone needs to stop reading self-help books and simply work on getting your own head out of your butt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is very good, and has lots of useful information. It is hard to put it down when I need to get something else done."},{"rating":"2","title":"All should read","review":"Eye opening (the minds eye that is) It's nice to know this philosophy truly is reality. I recommend this to all who would like to invite peace into their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing clarity","review":"The most amazing thing about this book is its clarity - it's the most lucid account of the workings of the human mind that I have ever come across. Like no other book I've read, it has an enlightening effect as you read it - you can feel yourself gaining greater clarity and insight. Another book which goes very well with it is the Fall by Steve Taylor, recommended on Eckhart's website.The Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New EraThis book Fall provides a historical and cultural context for Eckhart's book. It shows the ego's terrible effects throughout history and suggests that, as a species, we are now transcending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will put you to sleep.","review":"The actual material is interesting if you can stay awake long enough to pay attention to it. But what it doesn't say anywhere is that the author actually reads this in his own monotone british accent. I think this book is actually a driving hazard if you plan to listen to it at night, it will put you to sleep (the audio cd)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"on the path","review":"The \\"Power Of Now\\" provides concrete pointers,as Tolle calls them,to that level of awareness which at the present time evolutionary nature is leading us.He,together with many others, correctly states that it is imperative we make the necessary jump out of total identification with the mind generated self otherwise the the future for humanity on this planet is in doubt.His message is very clear and in presenting it in \\"The Power of Now\\" he also gives us direction towards that(THE NOW)which will bring about the change in conciousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"This old book is merely a repeat of familar ideas from other spiritual ideas but clearly advertised and sold well to make it appealing to buy.

The Power of Now which was promoted by Oprah has \\"it\\" all. Living in the present is where our \\"power\\" is to experience our lives in the ultimate fullness we were intended and designed to do and isn't that what we all want to be capable of achieving. The Power of Now reveals how to accomplish this goal presenting all the pitfalls that delude us into past or future thoughtforms. how to revise and change those thoughtforms. What many may think of as \\"power\\" is not power over others however the power of ourselves to experience our lives owning our own power which is the way of not only living our lives being self empowered and experiencing the divinity and peace that lies within all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mind bender...","review":"When you first start reading this book, it makes your head hurt. It takes a while to understand where he is going with his message. However, once you have your footing, it makes so much sense. Of course, the idea is to live in the now, so it is important that we stop dwelling on the past and worrying about the future. The exercises in the book have me watching my thought patterns now when I find myself getting upset or angry, it is almost becoming second nature. I am hoping that I can start living in the present more and more each day and this book has given me a nice foundations for doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Direct and Concise","review":"Tolle's direct approach to personal awareness flows throughout the book. In concert with Buddhist philosophy, the emphasis on fully being in the moment guides the reader. His discussion on the 'pain body' aids in the process of letting go. A must read for seekers of personal awareness and those desiring to attain calm abiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has over-simplified","review":"Author has over-simplified and compromised the essence of spiritualityWhen you claim well documented prior spiritual thoughts to be your own it only diminishes your credibility. I wish Tolle provided appropriate references - such as the Upanishads, the Gita, the Kashmir Shaivism, the Dhammapada and the Vigyana Bhairava Tantra - the first sutra of which documents the meditation technique of focusing on your breath and moving along with it minutely without falling behind or moving ahead - the idea is to discover the gap between pran (incoming breath) and apan (outgoing breath), this technique was used by Buddha for his enlightenment. Enlightenment means complete dissolution of the ego -not the refinement of it -- so when I see Tolle trying to pass this stuff as his own - it just takes away of his claim of being enlightened. Tolle regurgitates in verbally articulate manner spiritual gossip or as another reviewer put it a rather funny manner superficial \\"Hippy-Dippy wisdom\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not practical","review":"The theme you heard many times \\"live in the present\\".This is great advice ,but for most people i would say almost all, not practical.How can some rate this book 5 stars when i am willing to bet very few will be changed to any great degree with this book .This information is as old as time itself and reveals nothing that is new.The problem with this and many other self help books is that word are just that if there is no practicality in application it is relatively useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE book for those who can't let go of past mistakes","review":"My wife was reliving mistakes she had made over and over, what I came to call her \\"woulda, coulda, shoula\\" paradigm until she read The Power of Now.

I assure you, it will change yours.This is not some fake gimmick like 'The Secret' is. This is true, basic, factual information on the thought process and how it influences our ego, our behavior, our lives, and most importantly, our sense of being.If you Wiki Eckhart Tolle, you will see an amazing story of a man who's passion for seeking answers to his existence enabled him to survive while being pushed to the brink, in a vat of depression, nearly committing suicide. In an instant, he was awakened with very simple truths that positively changed his life forever.His focusing on the 'Now' is a golden message unto all.

As such even thoughts, concerns and preoccupations with the past(via memories)or the future(via anticipation, expectation)still only occur in the NOW.The above notwithstanding, an individual really intent on awakening from the \\"dream\\" of illusion could only get so far with the message(such as the thought that \\"I need to live in the NOW\\") and would require a legitimate Guru for the proper spiritual guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle","review":"I had heard so much publicity for The Power of Now and truly wondered if the book would hold up to the rave reviews.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ego is like, bad for your SELF, maaan. Hey did you know Tibetians see magic portals in the Book of the Dead? Far out, man.","review":"Reading this book is worse than listening to a stoned stranger prattle aimlessly about his psych 101 class. It's like a cult leader's manifesto, designed to demonize the ego and glorify the self, by treading back and forth across all of the most beaten paths in the history of psycho-spiritual writing. Let me share an example here,\\"When every cell of your body is so present that it feels vibrant with life, and when you can feel that life every moment as the joy of Being, then it can be said that you are free of time\\"Next, he will ask you to drink the poisoned kool-aid, so that the spaceships can take you to heaven.If you feel your spiritual side is missing, try fishing.

I must admit, I did not spend much time listening but I never got one clear message..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Now -","review":"Trying to follow where the author is coming from is extremely difficult. He relates spiritual experiences as if everyone has the same experiences and can easily produce them at a moment's notice.

I found it to be quite boring and difficult to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The type of guy the Apostle Paul warned us about...","review":"This guy is a straight hustler, ala the carpetbaggers of the old West. Christians beware: Paul clearly warns us in 2 Timothy 3 to steer clear of nonsense like this. Just like we have to endure the ease and pleasure in this life, sometimes we may have to endure the pain and hardness as well. No one can truly predict when it will happen. But it is through endurance that we'll find salvation and strength. If you are a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ don't be hoodwinked by this New Age wordplay, you'll mess around and lose more than you stand to gain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth?","review":"You really think this book is true just because someone else says so? Because the author spent 10 years toiling after what made HIMSELF happy? All he did was rip off buddhism and slap a new title on it. This book is not the way to joy. This book is not the way to live a life of meaningful relationships, and it's certanly not the way to feel good about yourself. What is your purpose here on this planet? Why are you here? For yourself? What kind of life is that? Living for yourself. Thats not a way to live. Don't get me wrong I am not condeming you for buying this book. No. What I am doing is asking you your motives. Why you are buying this book, and if you are sure you want to go on living a life this book wants you to lead.

Impactful, Helpful.","review":"This is a powerful book on this subject. Better written than many, more impactful than most. It is clear that the author has depth of knowledge and conveys it overtly and subtly. If you like this topic, you should read this book. I also highly recommend \\"Effortless Wellbeing: The Missing Ingredients for Authentic Wellness\\" by Evan Finer as a book that covers the how-to of wellness and now-ness in a very concise and potent way. Both of these books have depth and power and will profoundly help a person who reads with an open mind in a receptive state. They are good compliments to each other. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for mastering one's own mind","review":"This is my favorite book for lessons on mastering one's own mind. It gave me the tools to finally \\"quiet\\" the noise in my mind and focus on what's really important - the only thing that is important - which is this present moment, the Now. I have never found a book that explains how to take control of your own mind in the way this book does, it is brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous","review":"Huge fan of this book! This book has opened my mind to the power of the present moment. It has played a major role in my recent shift in perception.

There is no ego here, no fluff; only Truth as clear and resounding as a temple bell, stated in a gentle, practical and supremely accessible manner. If you want a sword that will cut through your illusions and confusions in one brilliant sweep, this is it. I also highly recommend the unabridged audiobook version--both the book and tapes bear repeated reading/listening/digesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening Indeed","review":"After I had purchased the audio cassette of \\"The Power of Now\\", I made a commitment to listen to it at least twice a week, usually while I'm performing some mundane tasks such as exercising or doing housework.

I praise Eckhart Tolle's skill in getting his message across without sounding arrogant.The impact which \\"The Power of Now\\" had on my \\"being\\" is so positive that I believe I have a better understanding of my own existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for skeptics.","review":"I admit it, I'm a scientific skeptic and annoyed by \\"new age speak\\" and unsubstantiated claims of spiritual powers and enlightenment. So when my girlfriend recommended I read Tolle's book about the \\"now experience\\", I was incredulous. However, I quickly realized Tolle's book in a category by its self. No grandiose claims, panacea remedies, or motivational empowerment here. His penetrating insights will make you STOP what you are doing, and I guess that's the point. The \\"now awareness\\" Tolle describes is available to everyone (new age seeker, or skeptic). My girlfriend and I have finally found common ground. If nothing else, it's a breath of sanity. Read it before you die."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Nothingness\\"","review":"I now know the definition of \\"nothingness\\". This book is it. Page after page of psycho-babel non-sense. I know those who read this will just say \\"you just don't get it\\". I would respond that is true, but only because there is nothing to get. Everything in Tolle's little world is subjective. If that is true then even words lose meaning. If the meaning of words are subjective, then why write a book to tell us everything is subjective? Tolle wrote this book and all the others for one reason - $$$$$$ Ka-ching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth -- \\"Hippy-Dippy Wisdom\\" :)","review":"I agree with the user who wrote the following and i take the liberty to quote: \\"When you claim well documented prior spiritual thoughts to be your own it only diminishes your credibility.

No, the idea is in the present moment, not some goal of spiritual liberation that must be achieved.You want the \\"now\\" - start meditating.

I don't remember the exact words nor do I wish to but he basically said well I understand how difficult it is but just think in the now and everything will be okay.

Tolle, The Power of NowIf this passage appeals to you then you'll enjoy the book. If you are familiar with the works of Wayne Dyer or Depak Chopra then you won't find much new material here but you might prefer Tolle's delivery. The writing is adequate with a rather contrived, I think, sense of mystery. Like all of the New Age writers Tolle pulls indiscriminately from dozen of teachers to weave his particular version of enlightenment. Some of his ideas are just plain goofy but most are harmless. If you can pick through the weeds you might find something of use here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skewed by the Dark Side of the Force","review":"While the book he excerpted from this one (\\"Practicing the Power of Now\\") is excellent, this book suffers from Tolle's earlier efforts to drag in every type of \\"spirituality\\" and try to make them resonate with the truth--which he DOES present, interspersed among references to things he apparently doesn't realize are from the Dark Side of the Force.Instead of this book, read his \\"Practicing the Power of Now,\\" which contains the truth from this book, without the trash. It's a life-changing book for any reader that puts its simple suggestions into practice.Tolle's problem is that he had a powerful revelation of the simplicity of truth, but not about the tricks of deception. His second book corrects this mistake, and is good reading for any age reader and for any spiritual orientation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Hype","review":"I tried to read a few of Tolle's books, and despite the hype, found them to be bland, vague, humorless and uninspiring. He doesn't come across as a real person, but rather, a gross caricature of a \\"spiritual master\\", overly serious and dry, and at times, a prude.I try to refrain from being a cynic, though I would tend to agree with some of the other posters here, who also find Tolle to be a cleverly adept bullsh-- artist. Upon closer inspection, his esoteric writing has no real substance.Instead, I recommend Richard Bach, Seth / Jane Roberts, Shakti Gawain, Wayne Dyer, Stuart Hill, or Louise Hay.Peace out, everyone.

I have been reading books of a spiritual nature and practising meditation techniques for over a decade and this book is a synthesis of most of the information I have found that is presented in a straightforward and immediately usable format. Tolle uses quotes from the great masters of all traditions to illustrate many of the points he is making.

It taught me that to really be part of life and living is to live in the moment. Living in the moment brought me in touch with the beauty that exists in the world instead of the noise in my head. Connecting with the beauty in the world showed me that there is indeed a God and that if I choose to live in the moment I too would some day be living a life of beauty. I took this message very seriously and now two years later, I see the manifestation and the transformation that has occured in my life simply by choosing to live in the moment.

Living in the \\"Now\\", the \\"present\\". I've tried, and yes a lot of life's problems can be solved. If God gave us messages, this message would be one of them. On the other hand, maybe it was God who made Mr. Tolle give this message to us. It is so true and so powerful. However, this book would be even more powerful if it was half the length it currently is, and if it was written more simply. The message itself attains its power from its simplicity, so why not make the delivery of the message as simple as possible too? That is why I have suggested Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsch in addition or insetad of this book which contains such powerful messages in such a simplistic voice which is the sign of a Godly message. As a sidenote: I am very impressed by Mr. Tolle's powerful experience that led him from suffering to where he is today.

His section on couples and relationships is so idealistic as to be unrealistic. He makes many excellent points, but misses others. I do not doubt his experience(s), but his explanations leave one wanting too often. For what it purports to be, I was disappointed in this book. Too often , \\"self enlightened\\" teachers misinterpret their very real experiences and mislead the eager reader or student.

It can induce a veiled apathy which is dangerous towards the true lessons learned in one's life.It is almost nihilistic in its attitude towards reality, this guy is RATHER egotistical, and although I do not doubt his spiritual path, he fails to see the VAST variety of paths which one can choose towards enlightenment.

Thank you Mr Tolle. If you have a spiritual practice these exercises will build your spirit muscle. These insights will explain some of the crazyness we see everyday. I especially like the \\"pain body\\" theory. It explains a lot about my friends and relatives and their problems. I'm listening for my 4th time and it makes more sense as I actually practice the exercises. I'm treating it as a college course. I have studied it every day for the last 3 weeks.

The reader becomes immediately involved in finding the answers to the proposed, andoften objecting-type questions in each part of the book. I have sent the book to a relative, I am so impressed with the thoughts and concrete examples in his explication.

The majority of the members are not impressed with this book. This is not a good book for people who have been truth seeker for years and feel that they are making progress. It is a good book for people who are stuck spinning their wheels in negative memories of the past or are too fearful to move forward in the future. Eckhart Tolle gives the impression that he has found enlightenment and anyone that disagrees with him has not. You can feel his ego throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains The Importance Of The Now","review":"For whatever reason, Echhart Tolle got the message and was able to write a book telling the rest of us what he learned. The concept of the importance of 'now' is not new, yet the down-to-earth way Tolle presents the material makes it easily useable. To be able to bring yourself back from the future or the past where most of us spend most of our time is monumental to anyone's spiritual growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am a very logical guy, so reading this book was very difficult for me due to the very spiritual nature of the content.

If you're searching for happiness and/or enlightenment, this may be the most important book in your journey, as it was for mine. This was the most important element in what ultimately ended my 30 year streak of depression. Now I'm turning 32, and I've literally never felt happier and more at peace.

Tolle presents to the reader a spiritual philosophy that is applicable to daily life - it requires no miraculous effort or \\"spiritual exercises\\" that are so often touted, but rather surrender to life as it is. He connects with the reader throughout and offers a format that is easy to follow and enhances the individual's comprehension of its content.

I just don't know what to say. Buzzwords abounded but didn't really mean anything. It is a thick soup of spiced up phrases and ideas, but I don't really think they mean anything. Reading a paragraph in this book is tough and the mind wanders from the lack of focus and meaning. I don't see how this could help anyone in their own life.

At first I felt like the author was repeating the same thing over and over. Then I realized it was necessary in order to get my mind in the correct mind-set. From then on I couldn't put the book down, wanting to see what new thoughts would come next. I found many wonderful ideas to help me live a more wonderful life.

To say this book changed my life is an understatement. I'm not going to say this book is for everyone, but it's my belief if you're living in the past and doing nothing but worrying about the future (even about things that may never happen!) this book is the best thing you can buy for yourself, it will definitely make you realize a thing or two.\\"THE POWER OF NOW\\" is in my top five favorite books (maybe even at the top).

Soul searching is a a process of the mind, not a process to obliterate it. Its nothing but a recipe to return to the comfort of a maternal woumb where you will not feel the agitation or anxiety of real growth. Live in the now he said, just as the animals do.

Very, very doubtful. Good for him, he received some grace when he was in a depressed state, and had a mystical experience - but it's quite a leap to believe this is enlightenment. His words certainly don't have that ring to it - they are often confused, vague, overly verbose, and smacking of the kind of arrogance which typifies much of modern-day 'spirituality' coming out of the West (e.g., Wilber and Cohen). I wouldn't be surprised if things changed for Mr Tolle once the stage he is currently in has passed, if he's lucky. Still, I do think this book contains some good advice, and would probably be an excellent gateway into spiritual realms for 'beginners'.

Spirituality and psychology, the positives and the negatives, are finally coming together Now, in mysterious union. As Jung might expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful","review":"I found this book to be very insightful, and not just in a spiritual way. Reading this book has changed how I view the world as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I was looking for a book that promoted higher thinking or even had a good motivational story... unfortunately this was not that book.It was the most difficult book I have ever read. It felt like I was reading someone's rambles...very repetetive and unorganized."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has had a positive impact on my thinking","review":"The author shows how we need to be completely conscious and aware of our thoughts and not let any negative thoughts slip in by keeping the subconscious mind at bay which is full of ego.I do agree with others that this book is very repetitive and has its share of jargon but maybe that is what the author intended since we tend to remember more with repetition.Overall a great book that everyone should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a copy.","review":"I agree with all of the recent reviews nearly all on this page alone, who found this book a waste of time. His title copies an american book of the same name printed twenty years ago and the ideas are exactly the same. How amazing is that. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste the money","review":"Bought it on basis of recommendation by a friend of the book, spend a lot of time commuting so thought the CD would be ideal, read some of the glowing reviews and decided to try it. Maybe I'm just a redneck with prejudices, but I had a terrible time understanding the Teutonic accent, and his microphone-voice combo results in rather smeared sound which is quite impossible to understand. Turned out to be a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddha on a Low Fat Diet","review":"Two problems with this book:First, you have to have an inclination towards this type of Zen non-thinking - for most Westerners this is a radical shift from our goal oriented, materialistic orientation.The second problem with this book is that even if you are so inclined, other authors have articulated the \\"no mind\\" subject matter in ways that are far superior to this Zen for Dummies approach.Essentially, Tolle spits out one tiny pearl of Hippy-Dippy wisdom and then yammers on and on, ad nauseum for the next 200 pages. Christ! It was like listening to my mother-in-law tell the same story, a hundred different ways. zzzzzzzz. Personally, I found this a tedious read.I'd recommend the works of D.T. Suzuki, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, Carlos Casteneda or Charles Tart for the serious aspirant. In my opinion, The Power of Now can wait a little longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sample","review":"The sample only allows you to view the \\"opening credits\\" and one page of the intro.

It has opened my eyes to lots things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks balance, but a really great book for gaining/developing Consciousness.","review":"There's a lot to gain from Tolle's words. I've learned a lot from this book. With that said, this work is not perfect. What I did not like is that the book does very little to offer, explain the importance of having BALANCE in life. There is a great deal of fun, laughter, and happiness to be experienced in (physical)life, and pushing it aside to constantly check for or to live through a filter of Spiritual Identity will not bring about those experiences.I most strongly agree with G. Fishman's Amazon review titled \\"Very powerful, but don't take it TOO seriously\\". Fishman does a better job at explaining what I want to/can't/won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Now","review":"I listen to a lot of spiritual teachings from different \\"teachers\\". Eckert Tolle is one I continue to come back to. It's a reminder for me to center myself with this calmness that somehow only this \\"teacher\\" has been able to do. Others for the most part rally around the same teachings which reinforces what it is that \\"The Power of Now\\" has to offer. I would start here which puts you in this place and gives you the ground work to spring forth and make sense of what's being taught by others. Unless I'm missing something, I have yet to come across anyone who can make the delivery quite like he can. You could very well find yourself coming back again and again which is how these teachings work.Charlotte"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully insightful","review":"This book offers a refreshing insight into the mind that you wont get from society.

It will change the way you view things forever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this book a -100 stars I would!","review":"Eckhart Tolle and others who preach this new age spirituality are dangerous. His teachings afford people the opportunity to deny their wrongdoings and hurtful acts to others and gives them a pass to do what makes them happy without regards to other people, their needs and feelings.If Eckhart Tolle is such a spiritual man, why is he charging people money to read and hear his misleading practices? Beware and don't fall for this. Also, don't line the pockets of an individual who is leading many people astray. Many thanks to Oprah Winfrey for unleashing this fake spiritual fraud on others.This crap only works if everyone in a house is willing to fall for it. Echkart Tolle ruined my marriage, my idiot husband fell for it. If you want to be unhappy, follow his teachings."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Pisses Me Off","review":"tolle uses the power of now to brag about how he invented/discovered present-time awareness and has reached enlightenment faster than the buddha himself. after 1/3 of his book, i am unconvinced that tolle will be able to free me from pain and suffering. i will take refuge in the three jewels, four noble truths, and eight fold path, while continuing my mediation practice... thank you very much... instead of listening to this park bench prophet for profit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved me.","review":"I don't know what other people think about this book, and I think people will always have different feeling and thoughts about things. It totally depends on how you relate to the book. For myself, this book really touched me, and I can easily relate to Tolle's words. And it really did save me from one of the most terrible time of my life. I did get out of my own created pains and misery by stop dwelling into the past and not thinking about the future, which creates the fear and worries. I'm only living for the present moment and focus on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly waste of money","review":"First, I'm thankful that I ordered this book on my Kindle so I could easily delete it after struggling through the initial \\"chapters.\\"This book was recommended by a friend, who knew of my longtime interest in self-help and exploring spirituality. I've read and studied many books in this subject area for 20 or more years and have almost always found value and material to learn from in all the books I've read. Unfortunately I found the writing in this book amateurish, rambling, with repetitive and nonsensical assertions. I rarely if ever don't finish an entire book, novel and non-fiction. This I couldn't even make it through a couple of chapters. The introduction by Mr. Tolle says that Time magazine reviewed the book as 'mumbo jumbo'-- I couldn't agree more.The sample downloaded to my Kindle sadly only included recommendations and the introduction...if it had even part of the wasteful \\"content\\", I would not have bothered. Stay away from this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info - terrible voice","review":"I started falling asleep within two seconds of the author starting to speak, and it just goes on, and on, and on. It's so monotonous at times it sounds like the artificial 'voice box'.It's unfortunate, because there's some real wisdom in those words. This should be abridged and read by someone else and then it'd be truly valuable.Note, I'm only referring to the Audio CD version. I still think everyone could benefit from the information presented here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could say that I liked it...","review":"I actually purchased two copies of this book afterhearing Oprah Winfrey rave about it on one of herrecent shows... (\\"If you only read one book thisyear, make sure it's this one!\\")Sadly, I have to agree with the other reviewerswho were disappointed with it...Eckhart Tolle does make one good point -- that itcan be truly refreshing to \\"step away from\\" yourselfmentally, and spend some time \\"observing\\" yourselfand your life circumstances objectively...But then he spends roughly another 200 pagesrestating the same point over and over...A much better book on this very topic is titled\\"Shadow Syndromes,\\" by John J. Ratey, MD, aresearcher and psychiatrist...His book goes into goes into the actual mechanicsof the mind, and does a much better job explainingthe technique of mentally \\"observing yourself\\"when you want to break the grip of an unhealthymind-set...I would read that book, before I'd readthis one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best self help book ever","review":"Everything you need in a book.

Focus on this moment and not what has yet to transpire."},{"rating":"2","title":"radical new way of thinking (or not thinking)","review":"A gift to humanity... The only issue I had is that he briefly (1 page) mentioned that people on medication (e.g. for depression) are really not conscious (as he defines conscious)... that the drug is just keeping them from growing to true consciousness. If Tolle does not have a medical degree or, more specifically, is not a neurosurgeon or psychiatrist, I don't think he has the authority or knowledge to make such a claim. I have battled depression first hand... causing not only mental anguish, but major insomnia also. Without my meds, I would not be here nor would I ever get any sleep. The meds have allowed me to feel normal again (not artificially good). I can now feel normal emotions... happy, sad, etc... thanks to meds. Otherwise, I would not feel normal and would never sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should have a copy of this book....","review":"I imagine most people will benefit from reading this when the time is right. Of course, some people will think its mumbo-jumbo - and this book isn't for them but if you're on a path of self-discovery, then this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Now","review":"I was looking for a book to guide me while I'm trying to be more present. I think I found it! I like how it has you stop at certain points and ponder what you've read. It's sinking in and hopefully I'll be living in the Now soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing Book for Me","review":"I would hate to see a couple of negative spotlight reviews dissuade anyone from considering this book. Some people connect with it, some don't.The Power of Now has made a HUGE difference in my life. Since I first read this book two years ago, my mind activity and emotions have substantially calmed and my underlying resistance level has dropped. My relationship with my wife has gone from gridlock to a sense of newness and discovery. I have ocassionally shifted into a state of awareness I can only describe as peace, grace, or presence.Tolle cautions readers from the start not to conceptualize the material and try to create more \\"mind stuff\\". There's nothing in this book to learn, memorize, believe, or not believe. The words themselves have the power to awaken consciousness in those who are ready and open.This is the most powerful book I have ever read and has been truly liberating for me. Thank you, Eckhart Tolle."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be the voice","review":"Perhaps the materials would have been better as written words, but I listened to part of this audio CD during my long commutes. The introduction was simultaneously pretentious and unremarkable. Many of the points he makes are at least 1500 years old. I don't mind the repetition, but he barely acknowledges his ancient sources.Then, there's the voice. His voice is slow, soft, melodic, carefully modulated to suggest wisdom and authority, like that of a man who takes himself far too seriously.My cult-o-meter was hitting orange alert levels, so I returned the CDs to the store.18 Jan 2009 PS: Read the comments for this review. I may have been a little too harsh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring self-indulgent navel-gazing","review":"Hard to read with drifting off to sleep in sheer boredom. My therapist (who recommended I read this) even said the whole book should have been a 15 page pamphlet. He was right. I got about 4 times further than that and realized my nightstand was filled with books to be read far more important, interesting and relevant than this. Tolle covers his own ass by saying at the outset that people with reactions like mine were closeminded and unenlightened. Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of a question and answer book","review":"Eckhart Tolle is an amazing spiritual writer, at first hard to understand, but once the book is finished it will change your life forever. It is well worth the time and effort. This book is in the format of question and answer and not as detailed as his more recent book A New Earth.If you want to better your life and impact the future of the world read this book or A New Earth. This format is easier to read and understand but if you really want the tools to be able to make a change in your life and stop the insanity in this world - make the effort to read A New Earth! If we do not change our ways and the way we view our lives and the life of this Earth we will all suffer. Take the time for yourself and for the Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great self-help book.","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. It's somewhat cerebrally written but not academically so that it's too obtuse. Tolle does a great job of talking about \\"now\\" and getting out of your mind and into your life. I'd recommend it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth listening rather than reading...","review":"This work has many of the now typical hallmarks of the new age spiritual movement and the voice of the author pulls the listener right in to the work. I immediately wanted to give this work my complete attention. One of the fundamental conflicts I experienced in listening is that I was very tempted to intellectualized what I heard and frankly, doing so is contrary to the point. This isn't a book you can just listen to and relax. You have to take it bit by bit, practice what the author suggests and really allow yourself to experience being absolutely present in the current moment. As the author intends, experience the now even as you listen without trying to figure it all out and categorize what you've heard. I listened while I drove but the soft, soothing tone of the author's voice might make doing so unadvisable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, even with all that God stuff in it.","review":"I consider myself a devout athiest and was not expecting much more than another \\"live in the moment\\" book, when a friend recommended The Power of Now. Being a perfectly content person already, I didn't think it would have much to offer me. In fact it gave me a lot to think about. Tolle makes a lot of very insightful observations about how the human mind works and the frustration we create for ourselves. He loses me whenever he starts talking about Being and how we're all connected to everything, but that doesn't get in the way of understanding the rest. He loses a star for too often using a weak metaphore as though it were evidence of his point. Although I'm not sure that he was really trying to prove his point, rather just trying to explain how he sees the world and let the readers decide for themselves. Either way, a very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Power of Now","review":"This book one of the weirdest book I have ever read,The author using complex and hard to understand word style.Really I have read many books recently and I regret getting this one.The vendor was Ok, he delivers on time with decent price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-contradictory","review":"It is self-contradictory that authors like Tolle claim problems are mind-made. If problems do not exist at all in their mind, then why do they perceive that others have problems? Why do they provide solutions? Ask you to follow their prescription? Why do these people write a book or ask you to attend their workshops? For otherwise if you do not follow, it will only make you further depressed.Their problem is that their NOW \`thinks' (do not know how they can think when their mind is still) others have problems and they are the only enlightened beings. If they expound an idea that in reality there are no problems, they should refrain providing solutions or stop writing books about the subject. It is amazing how a well educated society falls for the rhetoric and follows the path to an illusionary Garden of Eden."},{"rating":"1","title":"All you need to know","review":"All you need to know about Eckhart Tolle is that he has been struggling with depression for most of his life. Every few years he will come out of it and be in a mania for several months, where he will write. The reason that his writings are so odd, vague, incoherent, mystical, fanatical, etc., is that that is how a manic person thinks. It is no wonder that many people feel good when they read Tolle's work; he is writing in a state of mania, which is a very energetic, invigorating felling, and this is the psychology he communicates to his audience. However, it must not be trusted, and the fact that mania is a pleasurable, feel good state, has absolutely no bearing on its truth value. He is psychologically unstable. He is no person to give spiritual advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much double talk","review":"I found this book to be beyond wordy. THe atempt to be profound seem to be the message not the words themslves. Many others have said the same without so much fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"hazed over glaze on a chia pet","review":"I really dont think this book is all it is cracked up to be. It just seems too repetitive and never really gets down the whole point in a way that is understandable for most humans. I am in a class right now and we are using this book for a guide, and I will say that everyone in the class would probably agree with me. There is too much fluffy info and it lacks a tride and true method of some sort. When I read this book, I feel like I am starring into a deep space hole or something. I am all about the power of the so called now...but this book sucks... I would suggest reading something by Lama Surya Das if you are interested in this sort of thing... at least his books are interesting and they dont repeat the same things over and over in the most ambigous way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not inspiring for me","review":"I'm almost afraid to write what I really think because I've found that Eckart Tolle readers tend to be a bit on the rabid side. One of the things he teaches is that if you don't buy into his philosophies it is just because you are \\"not ready\\" as if he and everyone else is so much wiser and more mature than you. I find that quite arrogant. While there are many things to praise in this book (certainly living in the now is a noble endeavor) I just couldn't get past this all knowing superiority complex the man seems to have. Yeah, I know Oprah loves him but that doesn't mean everyone has to.One thing that disturbs me is that so many Christians seem to take offense at his words. I'm wondering if they are threatened by his logic. Have they really read the book, or is it just a knee jerk reaction to anything that isn't biblical?In any case, some people may really enjoy and be inspired by this work, I just wasn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Now","review":"How many of us wait to begin 'living' our lives until a certain scenario we have in our mind manifests? while we wait, we miss seeing and experiencing all the beautiful gifts we already have.

Of course a Cat doesn't worry, a female dog doesn't complain, and the frog is always relaxed!

Furthermore, he babbles on so deeply about enlightenment and the mind that you start losing interest almost immediately at the lengths in which he goes to drive home his OPINIONS.

However, that is just a defensive tool to avoid depression and to turn on \\"happy apathy\\" when the going gets tough. Neat trick, but the \\"fluffy bunny\\" experience does not, in my opinion, guide one to spiritual enlightenment. It just guides one on how to selfishly step out of the icky game of life and irresponsibly leave the remaining writhing mass of humanity to their own discomforts. Slaves of sleep. Not logical Captain. Spiritual enlightenment would seem to be the creative taking of full responsibility for repairing the games of life so one never gets trapped again. Less tragic lessons. More wisdom in resolving life's little anxieties rather than ignoring them. Read Judge Thomas Troward for empowering creative enlightment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you like overthinking cuz u will after reading this!","review":"Its funny that this book is about the dangers of over thinking and over analyzing yet that is exactly what this book does!

After I had read the first 5 pages I had a lot to think about and a lot to change. Through this book, which I am not done reading yet, I have learned to tailor my thoughts to be productive instead of destructive. I have learned how to appreciate what is happening now, how to smell, taste, see, feel and hear again. No matter what faith you belong to, this book strengthens beliefs already in place, and serves to show you how to better practice them. I would recommend this book to everyone. If we lived by what it suggests, there would be serious global change. We would be united, fearless, and peaceful. This book is worth 200 times what I paid for it.

This book is both poignant, philosophical and approachable. It shows the sacredness of life and of our own nature.

It changed my life.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical gibberish","review":"People will read into Tolle's gibberish whatever they want to hear.

You.... You.... YOU!Sorry, but that it isn't true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some good points","review":"I'm a complete atheist (or very materialistic, as my dad likes to call me). This applies not only to traditional one-God religions, but to all spiritual teachings, including Tolle's. I believe that almost any spiritual book has good points, and if you read it attentively, you can distill them for yourself, and just ignore everything else. Such is the case with this work. There are certainly great ideas here - don't live too much in the past or the future, but instead try to focus on what you're doing now and don't resent it, and so on. But all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo (sorry) of feeling the Being within yourself just passes me by. Like other reviewers have said, Tolle's instructions on how to feel the Being in you aren't clear enough for me. I understand that such is that nature of the experience, but I pretty much believe that he has undergone a profound spiritual change that cannot really be taught to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolle Translates Jesus to fit his belief","review":"Pass on this book. I started out reading it - thinking this guy had something to offer us all. Instead, the farther I got into the book, I discovered that Tolle has translated the parables of Jesus to fit his particular reality. This is absurd. How can ANYONE profess to know what Jesus \\"actually\\" meant by his parables. How did Tolle obtain this divine enlightenment? Again, it is absurd. In essence, Tolle is offering HIMSELF as a prophet. The fact that he's making millions of dollars from this book is a joke on us. He certainly is profiting on his ability to twist the bible to fit his greed. It is slanted toward Christians. Avoid this nonsense and just Live in the present and don't dwell on the past. It doesn't take a book to show you how to do this. Maybe a paragraph or a poem would suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have been a student of the Tao for several years and have a general understanding of Eastern thought, but it seems that Mr. Tolle just skipped any actual study and went straight for the book.Let me put it this way, anybody who says they have achieved enlightenment has not, and anybody who is enlightened would not publish a self help book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise to Eckhart Tolle!","review":"In all the years I've researched spirituality, I've found that Eckhart Tolle has encapsulated the many truths that lead to a path of enlightenment!

I gave it a 1 star because that was the lowest I could give.The book reads like a collage drop out on drugs trying to make a fast buck.Read the real King James version of the Bible and you will understand that this book is HOG wash!

I especially liked the question-answer format. It cuts right to the point and has no fluff. His style is straight forward, no mush. The book is basically in three parts: how he got here, his philosophy, how to apply his ideas.Some people want to cut right to part three, but I think the whole is better than the parts when you are first being introduced to his philosophy. I would urge people to read this book first and then go to the next \\"Practicing\\" later for something to carry around for easy referral.Like others have said, his work has changed my life - especially how I handle my relationships, letting go of things and living in forgiveness NOW.Overall, very powerful, but his words will only work for you if you are ready to hear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope that Mr. Tolle comes back as a 12-year-old girl ...","review":"...Then he can experience the menstrual cycle firsthand and may not be so enamored of it.

A previous reviewer said that Eckhart Tolle wraps language around complex ideas in a way that is practical and deeply engaging. I could not agree more. This book was a start for me. His next book, \\"The New Earth\\" is mutually as griping. It will cause you to be more aware of the dialogues in your head and help you to realize how influenced we are by our ego. My life has changed since reading both of these books. In my opinion Eckhart Tolle is the Einstein of Spirituality of our day.

This book offers true insight into gaining an acceptance of the Power of Now instead of living with past pain and the craziness of a mind projected future. I disagree with previous reviewers who felt that this book is New Age \\"mumbo jumbo\\" and repetitious. You cannot dispute Tolle's premise that all we really have is this moment - NOW. The past is gone and none of us has a guaranteed hold on the future.

I once experienced enlightenment many years ago and have since been looking for a way of recreating that feeling.While this book has not allowed me to do that yet, I'm sure with practice that it will occur sooner or later.The book is written in an question-answer format style that makes it easy to read. Furthermore, the material is repeated many times over such that the core contents of the book could actually be presented in less than half the number of pages.One of my complaints is that while most of the text is quite practical, it can get relatively spiritual at times. Other than that the book was worth the price. In fact I'm reading it second time round.Another book worth mentioning that is far more practical and is a much quicker read is \\"Working on yourself does'nt work\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The manual for enlightenment","review":"I love Tolle's work and I would highly recommend it along with FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz if you like a step-by-step approach to awakening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Now, handbook","review":"I find this handbook handy to refresh my memory after reading The Power of Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Power -- NOW, Positives Over Negatives In Life","review":"YES -- this book has the 5-star power of Now being here to help us.

Then what? Hello...you've now become a zombie! The approach taken in the Power of Now is the age-old Buddhist solution: life is amount to suffering from which we must escape.Anyone who has ever really lived will tell you that the beauty of life lies in appreciating in the whole range of suffering, joy, foolishness, chaos, pleasure and pain. In the final analysis the book proposes an escapist cop out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous waste of time","review":"The quotation at the front of the book says it all. How many serious authors quote themselves? And the body of the book is just as ridiculous. I have read many translations and commentaries on Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian philosophy, including the Dhammapada, Bhagavad Gita, and The Cloud of Unknowing. This guy's philosophy is essentially a mash-up of everything that has come before, but his writing style is so pedantic and self-congratulatory, it's a slog to get through it.

They have one shallow enlightenment experience, and they think they are fully enlightened but are not. Not that I am necessarily saying this about the author, but people who are enlightened don't usually go around announcing it. They look and act like normal people.This book has some good ideas. Like I said before, it is the new age version of Buddhism. Also, the author's assertions about other religions are sometimes erroneous."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 stepper","review":"I found this book to be repetitive and a little flaky.

I made the mistake of trying to read his other book \\"A New Earth\\" before reading this and became lost, but The Power of Now lays everything out and explains what is a very complicated (although it doesn't have to be) concept. Would recommend to anyone who is curious about exploring themseleves and their thought patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do people SEE in this book or the author???","review":"Don't even go here. Start with Thich Nhat Hanh's The Miracle of Mindfulness (and indeed anything by him), some Suzuki, the Dalai Lama's The Art of Happiness if you want something more topical. These are true philosophers, people who came by their wisdom over a lifetime of study, and the books are as clear and simple as can be. If you're dealing with depression and want to use mindfulness (or the NOW as this pompous creep relabeled this ancient practice) to help center yourself, there's a terrific new book, The Mindful Way through Depression, that is written by individuals with the education and experience to combine psychology with eastern philosophy. Sitting on a park bench after some sort of meltdown does not a spiritual teacher make. This is probably the most irritating book I've ever tried to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falsely sold as new!!","review":"The description for this book was new and it most certainly was not.

Instead of dogma, you get actual teachings and tools- that work!-in EXPERIENCING what we all hunger for. Presence, peace, connection to the Divine. As far as 'spiritual books' go, I've read them all, and none give me as many 'aha' moments as The Power of Now. And they continue to come, even as I re-read it time and time again. There is almost a transmission of the state that Tolle speaks of. Buy this book. Buy two, because you will want to share it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"It is not the worst book I have read by any means in this area, There are a few others maybe four. Tolle takes the idea of living in the now which is a very common and old idea, as if he just found it by himself and it is his idea. Then he writes a book about it copying the title from another book which uses the same words \\" the power of now\\".Very clever as it is so eyecatching. However having read other books in the same vein this book totally confuses itself in its eagerness to promise so much. No wonder its a best seller. Thank goodness I was too far down the spiritual path and not a complete beginner to get caught up in its hooks and traps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific world fusion","review":"These days, a lot of world fusion is a kind of half-hearted mixture of studio technology with a few skimpy samples of \\"ethnic\\" singing or melody thrown in, just to reassure the listener that the \\"artist\\" is, in fact, doing world fusion.This album is the real deal. Scott Hill has done a masterful job of assembling full-bodied, substantial samples of singing and percussion from various African countries--including Uganda, Kenya, and Senegal--and fused them with a perfect blend of electronics that makes the native music stand out, rather than smothering it in syth washes and beats.Hill has also sythesized/sampled native instruments--djembe, kora, darbuka--but here again, the mix is tasteful and complements the indigenous melodies he has chosen.An excellent example of today's world fusion--not for those looking for the thin, commercial type of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this book at a primitive event to see if there were any other methods or techniques I was not familiar with.

Unlike traditional books in materials science which focus on properties and crystal structure, this book delves into synthesis out of elements, and how the chemical composition of a material in turn determines the properties and crystal structure. The book gives good coverage to different classes of materials such as borides, oxides, carbides, nitrides, alloys, intermetallics, and glasses. The book also gives a good overview of the different types of materials (and their physical origins) that materials are selected for. These include piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, phase transition temperatures, elastic constants, Debye temperature, etc...

Not to belittle the extraordinary talents of Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Azaria, but the filmmakers really blew it. Using flashbacks to illustrate as Morrie (Lemmon) talks about his childhood will seem pointless to anyone who has seen the film \\"Short Cuts\\"--in which Mr. Lemmon delivers an entire terrific monologue without visual aids. Another problem is the whole relationship subplot (not in the book), not to mention Mitch's sportswriting \\"adventures\\". An interesting aspect of the book, only briefly touched on here, is America's obsession with the O.J. trial, which was in full swing at the time of the real Morrie's demise.I thought the book was great.

After all, the Harpo seal should be more than enough to start off alarm bells...What I found was trite and saccharine. Hank Azaria's performance is notably poor. Jack Lemmon alone salvages something from a hackneyed script, but it's not enough. Such a shame to see this fine actor trotting out drivel in his last days.I did not hate this movie -- I just found it to be an insult to intelligence. What scares me most is that people actually found something special to say about it. If you're after inspiration, without the cheese, look elsewhere.

I realize that this movie is well liked by many people out there, but personally I found it too be overly sentimental...in fact to the point that it was corny. What really pushed it over the edge was Morrie's habit of crying every five minutes, or so it seemed. If that had been toned down, the movie may have been salvageable.

I can't explain what it does more than the title; this story stirs the soul. It makes you think of life in a far different context than the hussle and bussle of everyday life allows us to. It shows us we need to slow down, enjoy the simple things in life and show people we love them on a regular basis, not just when it's convenient. I recommend this book and movie to EVERYONE, especially those who have lost someone, or who maybe have someone in their life that is ill. It makes you reevaluate the things you once thought were important. Also, there are countless messages of life and love and learning to live, we should all be so luck to hear Morrie's last \\"course\\" and are even more blessed to have a \\"Morrie\\" in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesadya With Morrie","review":"Having read the book and listened to the CD of the book (narrated by Mitch Albom, the author of it), I found that the film, staring Jack Lemon and Hank Azaria, did a pretty good job of handling this quite moving story. Mr. Lemon portrays Morrie quite well and the film does a decent job of showing what ALS does to the individual who has it. While each person with ALS goes through a similar process, how each deals with it and the affect is has on him/her varies greatly. I highly recommend this film to anyone preparing students to work with people with disabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays with Morrie","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie is a wonderful film based on the life of Morrie a Professor & student that come together after many years apart & how they both helped each otherto live a fuller life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tunnel","review":"We bought this for our 1 year old for Christmas, becuase she is a very active child.

At least every other day I take it off her to cut off the hair that gets tangled in the chain.

I strongly suggest Watership Down, a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for a Propoganda Piece","review":"\\"The Plague Dogs\\" exists solely to condemn scientists who conduct medical research on animals. By anthropomorphizing dogs and other animals from a research lab, Adams hope to convince readers that medical testing on live animals is wrong.I wonder if Adams (or anyone opposed to animal testing) thinks that it's a shame that we have antibiotics and vascular surgery. Neither would exist (along with most modern medicine)without animal research.Given that the book is written on a false premise, it's very readable. Adams is a good storyteller, and the book is generally interesting if a bit treacly. It is, however, filled with difficult Scottish dialect.My verdict: It's a decent read as long as you remember that dogs don't talk and they don't reason and that the author has an agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing disgraces the tradition of Watership Down!","review":"With all due respect to the author, THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE!!!!!

I know, things like this happen to our animals. After reading the ending of the book, I was so angry that I went to the wastebasket and threw the book away. I wish, the ending had been more clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adult read","review":"My first instinct was to claim that whilst this book is wonderful, it does not quite meet the precedent set by \\"Watership Down\\". However, this is not really the case. \\"The Plague Dogs\\" is simply a far more adult, mature read than \\"Watership\\" and whilst it can by no means be described as easy reading, it is certainly worth that extra bit of concentration. The writing style is amazing as always, and the storyline gripping and fascinating. Adams' ability to switch from the perspective of the two dogs, Rowf and Snitter, to the humans is incredible. The book's witty contributions, gripping story line and happy ending make a wondeful story without diminishing any of the underlying concerns. It is an incredible masterpiece, and should be devoured eagely by dog-lovers and book-lovers alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggie vision","review":"I really enjoyed the point of view of this tale, that is, the world (and humans) seen through the eyes of a dog. The dogs are not overly anthropomorphised; they have very doglike thoughts. Being a dog owner, I found much of it very amusing.This book has one of the most creatively constructed endings I have ever read. The reader closes the book on one ending, with the understanding that the more likely ending to the story is one that concluded earlier, and you can take away what you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Adams is a natural writer/story teller.","review":"This is only my second Richard Adams book I've read - Watership Down was the first. I found great depth in his writing and enjoyed the multilayed style of his writing. The story kept me on the edge of dispair and hope all the way through it. When I was 35 pages to the end, I didn't know whether I could continue it, it was so emotional. I did read it to the end and the richness of the book continued right to the end. Richard Adams is a natural writer/story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience will be rewarded","review":"This book is considered one of Adams' weaker works. Readers will find it maddeningly moralistic, pompus and self important. It follows the intrepid adventures of two dogs who have escaped from an animal research station in the Lake Country, U.K.But listen - I nearly threw this book across the room a half dozen times when reading it. I've seen the film, loved that, and I was determined to get through the muddy waters of the book. It was worth it. The last forty-some pages of this book are pure genius, absolutely riveting narrative. If you can make it through to the end, you will be rewarded with edge of your seat, nail biting tension. John Grisham has got nothing on this guy.In short, read this book. READ IT! Do not skip to the end. Be prepared to hate it. I did. Act Three will leave you breathless, and isn't it all the more worthwhile when you've had to work to get to the end? I think so. Thank you, Richard Adams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as (Watership Down or Tolkien from a lover of both.)","review":"It breaks my heart that no one has reviewed this glorious work. I read it 2-3 years ago and am stirred just thinking about it right now. The title and premise are a bit off-putting--too tendentious and/or cruel? Be not deterred! This is a triumphant book, reminiscent of the best Dickens (and as witty.) The happy ending with a gorgeous thumping deus ex machina is beautiful. Our little terrier pup is named for one of the lead characters--Snitter. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutally True and a book you get sucked right into","review":"Richard Adams shows us the true life of abused dogs and how they are treated. Rowlf and Snitter are two dogs that were victims of cruel experaments in a lab in England. Snitter had brain sugery and has been haunted by memories of his old master and Rowlf fears water and does not believe good humans exist. But when both dogs escape and have a chance of freedom, they team up with a sly fox and try to have a life. But soon it is rumored they are infected with Plague. Now the dogs are on the run for their lives. The way Richard Adams writes, makes you see right through the eyes of the characters. A sad story, but worth buying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, discription is good, but not 20 pages of it at 1 time!","review":"Watership down was a great book, with humor and warmth and lots of discriptive paragraphs. I love watership, in fact, it's my favorite book, but some of the discriptions got a little tiresome after a while. In the plague dogs, it just dosn't end. Discribing and blah blah blah blah blah blah about all this stuff that no one cares about. How do you finish a book like this? I sure don't know, because I just couldn't do it. The plague dogs could have been a great book, it really could have. But it was totally ruined by pages and pages of junk. If you are a fan of Watership Down, I suggest you skip this book, unless you actually LIKE spacy paragraphs of discriptions. This book, in my opinion, is nothing but ad nausuem......"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrific premise...","review":"Well, I have rather mixed feelings about this book. I always enjoy a good dog book - and this one certainly had points that were good, but I was a bit bogged down by the style. It feels overly wordy, with few sympathetic characters and contains no women to speak of. There are some interesting characters and aspects - I particularly like the depiction of Snitter's madness. The premise is quite interesting and I would have liked it more had it been executed in a different way. Really, the ending is the entire book's saving grace. Overall, it seems that Diane Jessup'sThe Dog Who Spoke with Gods, may have been inspired by this. It most certainly shares the theme of depicting animal cruelty - though they both display about it in a different way. Jessup's novel is a much more engaging novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this expecting Watership Down","review":"Surprisingly unreadable given the quality of Watership Down. Adams appears to experiment in this book with being an active participant in the story, but succeeds in only making me wonder at the end of the book why I stuck with it. Interesting viewpoint on animal research, but fully misses the point in providing a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tedious for me","review":"I really hate writing bad reviews, but I review what I'm reading, and this book was hard to keep up to my eyes.I've been waiting and waiting and waiting for something really dramatic and exciting to happen, but I'm getting nothing but internal conflicts in the characters.Yeah, ever once in a while there is a tiny bit of action, but lasts for only a few seconds and then dies totally, and nothing happens again for 100 pages.To tell the truth, I'm on \\"FIT 10\\" (the very long chapter). I'll very much intend to finish this book, only because Mr. Adams really is getting me to think these dogs aren't going to make it. So I'll finish it to see if the dogs live or die.Like everyone is saying, this is a hard book to read. It's very confusing and uses lots of big words and bad words and such and such. I started reading this book because I am a huge fan of Watership Down and I wanted to see what other things Adams wrote. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK","review":"Wow! I love this book! I am thirteen and I picked this book to do for a book report at school. Yes, the beginning is a bit hard to read through, and he does write a lot of seemingly useless, long, boring paragraphs, but it is so worth it to get this book. The characters are great. Gotta love that Snitter.. The language used is a little hard to understand, but you'll get the basic idea if you try a little. oh, and don't listen to those review-ers who are saying that it is too boring to read. Most of them said they only read about 10 pages! Perservere!! (haha) I look forward to watching the movie, although I hear its pretty depressing. Ah well. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed account of animals in research!","review":"Adams is a fantastic author with great insight into non-human animals.To understand what he has done here, you must understand what role animals play in scientific research. Chemicals come with material safety data sheets, or MSDSs which include toxicity information. These toxicity measures,LD50(Lethal dose,50%) and TLV(threshold limit value)are derived from exposing animals to injections of the chemical or by respirating it until a specified percentage of the animals die. LD50 means that at this concentration of chemical, 50% of the animals die. TLV is the concentration of gas or vapor at which breathing that chemical causes death.So for every chemical introduced, a population of animals must die. Animal testing is a prerequisite for commercial manufacture of a chemical under the Toxic Substances Control Act of the 1970s overseen by EPA.And similar research is required by the FDA in introducing new drugs for medical use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks right up there with Watership Down","review":"Although at times it can be a tough and confusing book to read it is well worth learning the language used in the book.

The problem is, he has no sense of realism.I think we all know how he is going to respond to a situation before he even opens his mouth.

I really laugh when he says things like \\"well, those people losing their jobs, will just have to be re-trained\\". Now that is the most silver-spoon, Ivy league nonsense I've heard in a while. Only people way out of touch with the average person would make a statement like that - a statement straight out of academia. Some of the things he spouts out on TV these days are even more ridiculous. His love of everything Republican blinds him to improvement because he can't be self critical.

The worst of these is \\"If I Fell,\\" which has Vegas lounge written all over it. And songs like \\"Day Tripper\\" and \\"Sgt.

I'm one of those folks who cringe at the inclusion of a drum set in any acoustic tango orchestra.

It's an ethic value that doesn't support parallel.And its achievement is worth a life. Based on real events, this is a masterful chronicle about a bunch of brave and courageous people who decide by themselves to turn the impossible in possible, this is none other than the slogan that encourages the epic spirit.To dig a tunnel of 5m. deep and 145 m. of underground extension, requires of a conviction iron and untamed attitude against all the odds.Tense and absorbing drama superbly written, dazzlingly acted and better directed.One of my top twenty movies of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Der Tunnel","review":"For all you fans of cold war movies and spy thrillers....look no further. This is the movie we've been waiting for. Set in Berlin in 1961-62 this film is intense and thrilling. The viewer doesn't know what's going to happen right up until the end. This ranks to me, as one of the top spy/espionage/thriller movies of all time, side by side with \\"Day of the Jackal\\". All Star performances all around by the cast....especially the three female leads. This is a MUST purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Honest Look at International Marriage","review":"Oksana Leslie's book, How to Survive in International Marriage, is a very thorough journey through the challenges of being a Russian bride of an American husband. The book not only looks at the many tedious steps involved in becoming an international bride, but the author takes you inside the emotional ups and downs of the process. The most interesting part of the book for me was to see the relationship between the author and her husband develop from the early stages of the \\"arrangement\\" into a deep relationship of love and caring. This book would be important for anyone contemplating an international marriage but is a fascinating story for anyone. It is a real eye-opener into a huge segment of our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crystal clear 5-stars","review":"Pokemon Crystal is a great addition of the Pokemon family, along with being an improvement of Gold and Silver.Though Crystal can be viewed as a similiar game as Yellow (Yellow is very much similiar to Red & Blue, Crystal shares similiarites to Gold & Silver), it has much more features.The Pokemon pictures are now animated, making it more interesting to battle. Also, it's heard that Celebi can be caught in the game, the mysterious 251st Pokemon. Like Yellow, some of the Pokemon are found in different areas than in Gold and Silver. Suicune now plays a major role in the game, and can be found throughout the game (it runs away if you get too close, though). Another edition which will be sure to make female players happy (including myself!) is that you can now choose from a male or female character. The buildings are also said to be an improvement.There you have it; Crystal looks like a great game, and a must-have for any Pokemon fan! Let's hope Nintendo keeps up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best review","review":"the game is awsome you could play as a boy or girl. you can catch celibi and the lagendary dogs. a trainer in the game has 4 suicunes but I'm not shure. on every route on the bottom of the screen what route your on. the pokemon breeder in goldenrod city gives you an egg ticket, give it to pokemon pcc to get an egg like with a cleffa with dizzy punch. you can also trade pokemon with a mobile adapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"crystal is enhanced to g&s as is yellow to blue and red","review":"Like I said, this is just like a special version of gold and silver. It has the option of choosing a girl character, a pop up sign that tells you when you enter a new area, new and better battle animation, and a new pokedex. If you liked yellow, you'll like this. Some say there may be new moves, but they couldn't have new moves and have it still be compatible with pokemon stadium 2 as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"the gold and silver series goes on...........","review":"what fun! these games...... oh never mind its so great i cant speak so go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pokemon goods and pokemon bads","review":"Here are some bads:it is imposible to catch Celibi, you can't catch Flaffy. Goods:it is easier to catch Suicune and here is a tip when one of the balls (pokeball, greatball, etc.) is in the air press B and keep it down until eiter it explodes (ball breaks) or you catch it. This works in red version too. I am not sure about the other versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again???","review":"The same story gets boring after awhile reapeating itself over and over again.

Being male, the new female character didn't affect me at all, so that addition.... The slight animation wasn't that amazing, but a nice little extra. Y was considerably better since it was more different from R and B than Crystal is from G and S. At least in Y the Gym Leaders were different. Being a major Pokefan I must give this game some credit. If you really, really love Pokemon you'll probably be pleased with the little add-ons. Happy Gaming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It u dork!!!","review":"This game is the best!!

If you played Gold or Silver before, I reccomend that you don't get it. But if you haven't owned Gold or Silver, buy it. Nintendo also took out good features that are in the Japanese version (ex. catching a LV. 30 Celebi at the forest after Azelea Town). Besides, after you beat it, it will start to get boring, and eventually you will stop for a while.To sum it up: Buy it if you have never played G or S. Don't if you HAVE played G or S."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It is great, I have all of the pokemon games, this is the best pokemon game yet!

Great strategy game and un for everyone.But if you have played the previous versions you have to be aware that is basically the same game and you have to be willing to start everything over and is not as much a challenge anymore because you already know all the puzzles and stuff. The improvements in this game are the trainer tower here you get to pick the level of your oponent, also you get to choose te gender of your trainer,cool animations and you can catch all 250 pokemon( you can't catch celebi).Best pokemon game yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl Power!","review":"Finally!

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pokemon again","review":"Come on people how many pokemon games have we been through aleready. Besides It's almost the same as pokemon gold and silver.

For all those pokemon nuts who have 10 posters of Pikachu or 3 Jiggleypuff plush dolls, u should get this. If you already own Gold or Silver, don't bother. I'll admit, u can be either a boy or girl, they made each pokemon move once during a battle, the color's better and the pokemon Tower was added. Other then that, it's not really worth it.

Some people think it sux 'cause it is a GBC. i detest when you go on the boat to go to Johto and it it take a long time. I have beaten the elite four 2 time. Easy Pezey game. Here is some advice. Never lose confidence. Always keep it up. When I was fighting I almost lost. I had a grass pokemon he had fire (you know what that means)! I didn't have any potions. I just had confidence and didn't lose! And never ever ever ever ever EVER use a rare candy on pokemon. It rises it's level but spoiles the pokemon.

Level up some strong POKeMON against Ash, yes you POKePlayers, Ash, Pikachu is probably the only POKeMON to give you any real trouble! Ohter than that, the game's a piece of cake! Extra features include \\"Battle Taunts\\" (POKeMON taunt other POKeMON when comming out, map, so when you enter a new town, you don't worry about getting lost and other trainers say a lot more things than what they say in the fist two installments.

It is more challenging and it is really fun. My favorite part is that the pokemon that were really hard to find in other pokemon games are really easier to find now. The new things like the battle tower is really challenging and you must be ready. So ask your parents and get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"pok��mon crystal","review":"I like this game very much, if you set aside the fact that it is practically the same as gold and silver. The upside is that Celebi can be caught with the GS-Ball. Celebi is not available in g/s without the gameshark. The downside is that the american version does not have the capability to hook up to your cell phone, as the japanese version does. So if you don't mind going through the world of g/s again, then this game will be a good thing to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collectors unite!","review":"Well, I never really liked Pokemon.That is, until I played it.This game brought out my love of collecting things. I swear, if you like collecting things, and you don't have this game, get it. I'm serious.I've played every Final Fantasy, but I think I'll spend more time on this game than any other Final Fantasy I've played. Just to collect all those extremely cute(and some really interesting) Pokemon.In this game, you can breed; which is actually half of the fun of the game. To get every Pokemon, you HAVE to breed. Also, the Pokemon have been moved around and some new items are available.And all you cute haters are there(like me, hehe) believe it or not Pikachu is actually a little tough to find.Well, basically, if you are a Pokemon fan or a have a love of collecting, I strongly recommend this game. Slowly, games like this are restoring my respect for Nintendo. Just don't come out with another Pokemon Snap(or Stadium). Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really Awesome!","review":"I like the crystal, gold, and silver line better than all the rest of the pokemon games. 1.) you have to get 16 badges, which include Jhoto, the new world and Kanto, the old world.

There are many more changes I know that I'll find as I progress through the game, but for now I give it a 4-Star rating since the plot is the same as G/S. You cannot catch Crystal Onyx or Celebi.

The most compelling thing about this book after reading it was the way the author outlines what self esteem is and recognizing it. I agree with another reviewer that half the battle is understanding that you have low self esteem. I'm personally working on some of the self-help excercises which Dr. Sorensen has suggested along with some other ones from different books. I would be happy to post again if it would be of any help to anyone.One last note I've also learned through email contact with Dr. Sorensen that other negative behaviour was also a result of LSE.

But not all thoughts are creating feelings, often it is the other way round. We give our feelings labels, but these labels are not the cause for the feeling.Finally it is highly disputed if you have to analyse everything in order to solve your problem.

At times, particularly on the more Irish-flavored numbers, UK-based vocalist Su Hart drifts in Enya-esque territory... however, I'm sure that won't be much of a problem for already-devoted Baka fans. If you liked their earlier albums, this one will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this piece of bakeware","review":"I love the easy to grip handles on this bakeware.

It is not very exciting but covers the standard academic territory pretty well. It has some nice sections in translation. Parts of it depend on having some knowledge of Greek.

I saw both of the Angels in America plays on Broadway. The live performances were gripping and astounding. This feature captures and enhances every moment. Fine performances.This is a period piece. Not a \\"gay\\" movie or an AIDS movie but a movie that capture human emotions and a very specific point in history.Beautifully written. Tony Kushner's finest work."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last... Movie making has got its balls back!","review":"If you are a religious fundamentalist, if you believe people do not have the right to live their life, if you believe in creative censorship, if you're a hypocrite... Please do not buy this DVD. Do not even think of hiring it! After a long time, director Mike Nicholls (of 'Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?' fame) combined his incomparable skills with profoundly erudite script written by Tony Kushner (on whose original award-winning play it is based) to produce one of the most memorable pieces of movie television history. HBO ought to be applauded for its support in this regard. Not since 'Philadelphia' has such a visionary movie been produced. It will instantly melt any open minded person, and is a morale booster for the browbeaten gay community and ostracised HIV postive people. The last episode is perhaps the best conceived notion of being human and alive!!! If you can afford it, this is one of the 'must-buy' movies..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels in America DVD","review":"This is one of those movies that you will either like or dislike.

It's one of those types of movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Event, but no attention to detail.......","review":"It's horrible that the DVD's producer would hire someone who knows nothing about the AIDS epidemic or the associated issues that go along with it. When watching the beginning of the movie with subtitles on, I began to realize that not all the care necessary was put into this DVD. When the dreaded Kaposi's Sarcoma was misinterpreted by the one who types subtitles as \\"chaos\\", instead of the correct \\"K.S.\\" derivation for the dreaded, opportunistic skin disease multiple times, I became somewhat dejected, and not as happy as I should be for having the DVD. It kinda sucks, and I feel taken advantage of. I'll get over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"beyond wonderful","review":"If they had released this movie in the theaters, there would not have been enough Academy awards to give to the writer, the director, and the wonderful cast. Who should get Best Actor? Al Pacino as the loathesome Roy Cohn or Justin Kirk as the dying Prior Walter? Who should get Best Actress? Meryl Streep as the practical, compassionate Mormon housewife, or Emma Thompson as the beautiful, terrifying angel? This series had me riveted to the TV set. I could not do anything but watch. Get this movie. You owe it to yourself to witness one of the major artistic events of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Never Tire of This Breathtaking Masterpiece","review":"Deeply emotional, wildly inventive, perfectly cast and superbly acted, Angels in America deserves to be acknowledged for the groundbreaking triumph that it is rather than dismissed by those who simply dislike the its characters' politics or lifestyles. While there are certainly legitimate criticisms that can be made (e.g., the dramatic tension doesn't always unfold consistently, and the long speeches would benefit from a red pencil in places) it's rare to find a movie that offers such intelligent dramatic fodder for the actors, or that stretches the imagination so vividly.Through this movie and several others of comparable merit (e.g. \\"Wit\\" and \\"The Gathering Storm,\\") HBO has upped the cultural ante in television, bridging the gap between high art and mass entertainment. Keep it up, HBO."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful beautiful movie","review":"The acting is suburb, the directing, and a beautiful story for those that really care to hear the message.

Are they shoving her \\"amazing\\" acting abilities down our throat or are they trying to present a great play on TV?

I purchased the DVD and invited 4 of my closest friends to watch the entire film with me in one sitting. We were transfixed for six hours. At the end, we could do nothing more than sit in silence for 20 minutes. The film is filled with ideas. It requires the person watching to concentrate, to listen, to pay attention. It is entirely unlike anything we've seen on film in a long time because it demands something from the viewer. But the investment of time and concentration pays off with an overwhelming and profound feeling of being a little closer to understanding ourselves. In the end, the film forgives. You will never forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political crying game","review":"Stupid pointless movie unless your intent is to punish the Reagan white house for causing aids. We all know that Reagan and the Right wing were responsible and It couldn't have been anyones personal behavior right? All opinions about the subject aside.

Well, there is nothing angelic about an individual who chooses to have sex with others who do not take into account the consequences about irresponsible sex. People get what they have coming to them.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant message, flawed delivery.","review":"An otherwise brilliant message for our times has been unfortunately obfuscated with the requisite dereliction of pathos. Quite predictably, any momentary sentiments are regularly overwhelmed with blended social commentary. Maybe someday a vehicle such as this will stand on its own pitard, but sadly, this project seems to be lost in a sea of syrupy contingencies.On the plus side, Pacino's performance is kissed by a neo-pedestrian air of civility, while Emma Thompson is a wonderful example of a tulip in winter. Too bad this play is more like the turtle which must cross the freeway...it doesn't get across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored in America","review":"What a boring, pretentous waste of everyone's time.

The DVD box did not say what the movie was about, but I decided to rent and it and watch it at home. After watching the film, I was shocked that this film had won so many awards. I had a hard time watching this movie all the way thorugh because it was so boring. Watching movie about people with AIDS was extremly depressing. Also, I could not believe the pervertiveness of this movie. I would have to say that this movie is a bore sick movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic.","review":"Would give it 0 stars, unfortunately impossible... Living proof of impotence of overall modern US culture. Depressing because guy just has nothing to say... Somebody compared this movie with Shakespeare.

Imagine Miss Streep playing her 90-year-old rabbi in a curtain speech -- and getting laughs. That would have been sweet.I suppose it was too much trouble to include a couple of extras. HBO pushed this 6-hour saga for weeks with \\"making-of\\" shorts and \\"conversations-with\\" features.Also, is it just me, or does the DVD stall at each chapter? I must fast forward a couple of seconds at the start of each chapter to restart the action. I wonder whether a programming glitch might have caused this. The discs are new and not damaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"HBO's Gift to Humanity","review":"All I can say is the following: If you want to see one of the finest mini-series of all time. Brilliantly created by HBO. Get a hold of this DVD set while it is still available & affordable. You will NEVER regret it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angels in America: Forget Scene Selection","review":"My comments and my single-star relate quite specifically and only to the issue of Scene Selections. That customary DVD option is not available on the DVD--neither in the packaging or on the discs themselves. Want to find the first appearance of the angel? Want to see Streep confront Thompson at the garbage can? Start scanning because you can't use your Next\\\\Previous buttons. It is impossible to use this DVD with a discussion group. Whatever were the producers thinking of? Remember: my comments are not about the filmed play; they are about the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonizing the Angels","review":"In The Western Canon, Harold Bloom, probably the most influential - and some say greatest - critic, listed Angels in America (the play)as one of the important works. As a play, I see how it may work - great metaphorical, beautiful language and sometimes in iambic pentameter - very Shakespeare.But adapted to screen, I think it is the language that fails. It sounds contrived and unnatural. When Shakespeare's plays are transposed to films, the directors often find new ways, new settings, new mise-en-scene to match the metaphoric language but in the case of Angels in America (the series), the director does not and that's where it fails.Another thing that I do not understand is why Al Pacino is given the best actor in the Golden Globe over Douglas Kirk who plays a more central and convincing role. Marry-Louise Parker is undeserving of her best supporting actress Golden Globe award as she is most of the time, wooden at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I don't object to the content. I don't have any problem with Aids, other than losing a lot of friends to it and wishing it would go away. I just think this is a bad play. Bad, as in poorly written. I know it isn't politically correct to critisize books or movies or tv shows about Aids. And that means we're subjected to a lot of bad literature. This play/movie is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get any worse than this","review":"Let's see...you take an award winning Tony Kushner play, add music by Thomas Newman, get Mike Nichols to direct, throw in stars like Al Pacino and Meryl Streep, and this was the best you could come up with?What we are left with is a totally flawed production, lacking in character development and script continuity. Add in an almost non-existent plot, and some really unlikable characters, and you have nothing left but the shell of an idea that is never brought to fruition. The 'Heaven's Gate' for the 21st Century.What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving and Stunning Drama","review":"I am glad so many people have given this work-of-art film such high ratings and accolades. I cannot add anything more to the countless wonderful comments already expressed, but that I don't think that I have cried more often, nor have been uplifted in joy, so many times watching one film. Truly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Perfect","review":"This is simply one of the best, well done, immaginative, insightful films I've seen in a long time.

I'm going to make my mom watch the DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This series is simply amazing. Hard punching and almost surreal. It's very easy to watch, and it's so innovating.

A modern work of art.","review":"I was intrigued by Angels in America because of the awards it had won and the acclaim it had received, and so I knew it was something I had to live for myself. And I am so glad that I did. I saw nothing but beauty in the confines of this story surrounded by AIDS. And having now read the play, I can safely say that the adaptation was done eloquently without any dragging moments, despite its long running time. And of course, the ensemble is one to point out. Each member of the cast is poignant and adds news layers to their characters, particularly Mary Louise Parker, whose portrayal of Harper Pitt is stunning and one that I will always remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"What a movie?,miniseries?, this is such an amazing piece of work that to classify it in such a way belittles it and doesn't begin to do it justice.

The Acting is suberb. Pacino as Roy Cohn is excellent. Streep in duo roles is mere perfection. Her portrayal as Ethel Rosenberg is nothing short of perfection.Anywho, the first half is so compelling I couldn't stop of watching it. I sat through all 6 hours in one sitting, and I didn't start watching until 7pm. The second half looses something. It gets confusing and very artsy fartsy. It distracts from the wonderful acting and message in this film. Still, I have no regrets sitting through all six hours. I hadn't done that since \\"The Stand.\\" This is exceptional filmmaking. A rare film that treats gay characters as people not stereotypes. There are some very humorous scenes mixed in with the grit and flights of fancy. There are moments that are so real and hit home with me. Simply excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious and compelling","review":"The AIDS-ravaged landscape of gay America in the 80s sets the stage for a sprawling, complex drama of love, betrayal, and redemption. There are too many characters and intersecting subplots to address in a brief review; this is a substantive work that will surely reveal fresh dimensions and new insights on repeated viewings. Writer Tony Kushner and director Mike Nichols seem to be suggesting that, although the human race has attained a critical mass of loneliness and pain, we must go on struggling with existence because life itself, however agonizing, is still desireable. Love and loyalty make it bearable, even pleasureable. It's a beautiful theme. I feel sorry for those who watch a film like this and see nothing but a soap opera about a bunch of liberal fags."},{"rating":"2","title":"It opens the door to the world of love!","review":"This story allows me to know about Aids, gay, and life.

I watched the entire series on HBO, never giving up on it because I kept thinking the \\"Ah ha!\\" would come. But it didn't. I felt like EVERYONE over-acted. I felt like the story dragged.

Don't be deceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast, hope you like gay men stories...","review":"Very disappointing. You get to spend several hours watching the story of several gay men that are either dying or finding new lovers. There's also weird ghost and supernatural stuff happening, but it doesn't seem have a point. One visit from an 'angel' turns out to be a rather pagan and sex based visit.This is a series where you keep expecting there to be a good point for everything happening and there isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn and bigotry","review":"This movie is porn and bigotry plain and simple. There is no artistic vlaue whatsoever. Don't waste your time or money. The NR is extremely deceptive and should be X rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolutionary, but Revolting","review":"Sadly, the best thing I can say about watching this DVD is \\"I'm glad I didn't pay for any tickets during the hurricane\\".When one sits down to watch a movie, she shouldn't have to be projectionist, ticket taker, usher, and critic all in one phase of history. Al Pacino can act like there is no tomorrow, but that doesn't make him a writer at the dawn of time. Likewise, Meryl Streep was not a baseball player. To imply (as this DVD does), that some kind of extra-terrestrial uranium force was responsible for the AIDS epidemic is more then irresponsible, it is downright anti-thought-provoking.On the positive side, the six actors who were at the forefront of this drenching catacomb did give the utmost sincerity in all known dimensions (and I believe there are four dimensions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired tirade","review":"This \\"movie\\" is an endless rant against anything and everything that is NOT pro homosexual, pro democratic socialism, and pro cultural marxism.

True, the Golden Globe awards made me want to find out what the fuss was about, and also admittingly I didn't expect a lot. But well done Mike Nichols. This is pretty powerful, and, I find, well acted most of the time. Plus I love the inclusion and adaptation of very early European cinema, as the scene with the hallway and the human candle-holders for instance (\\"Beauty and the Beast\\", France, ca. 1932, Moreau). Although this being a cliche in gay movies, in this context I found it original, as beauty and the 'beast' meet to discuss the threshold. And there is so much more. Definitely must be seen more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this","review":"Angels in America is truly a wonderful piece of art. I was so deeply moved by every single episode that I actually had trouble focusing on anything else after I finished watching it. Mike Nichols manages to combine the finest poetry with the most atrocious actuality. The acting performances are also exceptional. I especially enjoyed Justin Kirk's portrayal of Prior Walter. He acts with such truthfulness and authenticity and truly manages to capture the thoughts of a desperate man who's not able to accept his own destiny.My thoughts are; if you'll only watch one thing this entire year, watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Breathtaking","review":"Since this movie aired on HBO, I haven't been able to stop watching it. Every viewing peels away another layer of the beautiful, tragic, comic and intricate script. The acting is brilliant at all levels, especially Justin Kirk who plays the pivotal role of Prior Walter. I was never a big Meryl Streep fan, but she blows me away in this, as does the entire cast. Heroic and epic, it leaves you wanting 'more life'."},{"rating":"2","title":"We should have elected Erickson president in 1968.","review":"If you have any interest at all in Roky Erickson, I highly recommend this set.

The middle ten of the 43 songs on here are excellent, edgy, and not completely slaving to any certain genre. But the old stuff is just proto-60s psychadelic rock (as if it could get more primitive). I congratulate him for inventing it, but it just doesn't hold up. There is also a bunch of knock-off Dylan on here. No good.

The author may have been a fine CIA Operative, but an interesting author he is not. He was not into sharing much detail of \\"spook\\" type work.

Rilla Askew took my hand and led me there. Gave me time to breathe the air and smell the cooking. Let me feel the rough, peeling bark of a windowless cabin's walls, put my hand on the hurt of a beautiful child in the process of being destroyed by the ambitions and defeats of the adults who make up her world.I'm waiting for my memory of it to cool so I can read it again.

She tells a good story -- one that made this reader want to keep turning pages long after bedtime -- and she accurately portrays a way of life and a multi-layered society that has been ignored by most American writers. However, most impressively, she mixes biblical truths, wisdom of the ages, passion, and the creative imperative, to create a morality tale that is all her own. Askew has been compared to William Faulkner and Toni Morrison, but she is unique: Like them, her talent is undeniable, and like them, she writes about forgotten groups of people, but her voice and the rhythms of her language are incomparable. Her writing is informed by the King James Bible, but the beauty and power of \\"The Mercy Seat\\" are strong enough to stand on their own merits, without comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible story and especially well-told","review":"This book is well worth your time and in fact will take you out of time and not let you back until you have finished the story.

Excellent compliment to one another and very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to trust this guy!","review":"I purchased this book after having purchased the 12 second sequence book also by jorge cruise.Each time I have been led to believe by Mr cruise that this is the ultimate workout,in the 12 second sequence he states that twice a week for twenty minutes is the best way to get the best body however in this new book its 3 times a week for over 30 minutes.It is very difficult to trust this guy he seems to change his story with each book stating that a monday wed friday plan is what he follows which goes against what he said in 12 second sequence in which he says twice a week with two days between workouts!I just really dont know what to believe with this guy!He now promotes 15 grmas of sugar or less perday and 6 carb portion of no more than 20 grams each but in the recent past he sold Jorge Cruise shakes in a can that had massive amounts of sugar way more than 15 grams in just one shake!!!!I have had it with this guy some of his ideas are great but he just seems like a huckster!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than I thought!","review":"Okay, I think everyone can agree that the production values on this video are less than perfect. Also, when I do the exercise routine I feel like \\"rolling my eyes\\" because it's so short and can feel far too easy.HOWEVER, the next day the muscles I used are actually sore, and I really can see that I worked them effectively -- after only 4 repetitions each! That's pretty impressive, and the fact that this is such an easy routine to work into my schedule makes me give it 4 stars. There are a few mistakes in the voiceovers, and the look of the video is quite unpolished, so I'm afraid I'll get bored with it sooner rather than later, which is why I won't give it 5 stars (but really, how many exercise videos DON'T get boring after a while?). However, I think the principles behind it and the techniques Jorge uses are terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!! RUINED MY IPODS!!!!","review":"I thought I would take a chance on this product given its low price and all. I figured the worst that could happen would be that I am out $10. Boy was I wrong! I first tried my iPod Touch and got a message that said it was not a supported charging device. When I removed the iPod, it was drained of all power and would not charge on any of my other devices that I normally use to charge it! It will not even sync up to my laptop anymore, nothing will recognize my iPod Touch! I had also tried an older Nano on it and received the same message. It will now charge to a full battery, but will not play for longer than 30 minutes before it is dead. My laptop will not recognize it either. So now, not only am I $10 poorer, but I will be making a very expensive trip to the Apple Store in the near future.

I was so excited, and it's an awesome dock with lots of extras including wall charger (worth the price for that alone!), firewire cable, usb cable, 3.5 male to male cable, output for s-video, and the wall charger can be converted for U.S., U.K., or E.U. with all 3 plugs included (kind of amazing, right?)I was soooo sad to open the box and try it, only to find it is not compatible with my model. (Touch 4G.) The title says \\"universal\\" so I thought since mine fits the same charging dock as all the newer ipods, it would work. It WILL fit in the dock, but it won't recognize any of the outputs, and you get a \\"charging not compatible with this device\\" warning.

Your basic no-brainer here folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly incompatible with firewire","review":"I have had a major problem with this dock. Which is that I can't get it to work with any firewire cable except the one supplied with it. I've tried several cables (that I've tested and I know for certain work) but none will work. I can get power (the blue light goes on) but I can't get the iPod (60 gig 4th gen photo) to show up in the itunes window or in the mac finder (I haven't tried it with windows). This problem is perplexing because I don't see any difference physically in the 6 pin firewire cable supplied with this dock and the others that I have tried. I've emailed maxell but they have yet to give me an answer to this problem (after one week). There may be a simple answer but I don't have time to make this dock work right. I need to use my ipod so I'm returning it. In short, a word of warning, If you need to connect this dock via firewire and need a cable longer than the two foot one supplied with it, you may be out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price on a needed accessory......","review":"I just rec'd the dock and got it hooked up, seems to work just as well as the Apple dock I have, with a ton more flexibility and a better price.

Well, ok the Nano works with it, but with all the attachments I was really hoping that my iTouch would work but of course not. And when I say it doesn't work with my devices it won't charge play, nothing! Oh and the remote is udderly a worthless POS. You can't see it cuz it's black on black!

I noticed it would cut out over 80% of the time I was listening either entirely, or a large portion of the sound range would suddenly dissapear. Usually mid range (vocals) and below would cut out. If the cord was held just right it would come back for a few seconds but then cut back out. Also, they are slightly tight on the ears while wearing glasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst sound ever","review":"I simply could not believe how bad the sound is. No bass whatsoever, thin tinny midrange. Went from the box directly to the trash bin.

I do wear glasses and have ear piercings and yes, they are very uncomfortable after about 45 minutes. They hurt my ears a lot but I like them because I can wear them on my cheeks if someone says something to me or I need to hear something asap. I never liked ear buds because one tug on the cord and i can feel them starting to fall out of my ears, very annoying. I hate regular earphones because they leave an indentation in my hair. These are the best so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"These headphones can be slightly uncomfortable around the ears. Sometimes the part that loops behind the head is too bulky to sit comfortably while leaning on headrests or to fit under hoodies.I've had these headphones for about 4 months and the sound quality is waning. i can only hear from one earpiece most of the time.So basically, go for a higher quality, more comfortable item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm loving it so far+","review":"As I type this, I listen to music using this product. This is perfect in that it's relatively compact, toughly built, and most importantly it was cheap to purchase. Headphones and earplugs seem to come and go all the time with me and the end results always leaves me no choice but to buy a new one, but this I can say is a good buy, especially if you don't expect to be able to use it very long. The only drawbacks I can find so far is that 1. The cord is not reclinable and is slightly too long (I keep my MP3 in my waist pocket and there is about a foot of excess cable), and 2. they are kind of tight to keep wearing for too long. The fit is pretty sturdy though and probably desirable if you intend to use these while running. The tight fit against your ears also ensures that you can actually hear the music at relatively low to medium volume. Overall I am satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"I have had these headphones before, and loved them. I changed them for a bigger earmuff style headphones. I was not to happy with the bigger ones, and I have bought these behind the ear ones again. They are great, light weight, great sound, and they do not bother my cap or the top of my head. I can take my hat off without having to take off the headphones! The length of the cord it good to. It is long enough to reach any MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very average headphones.","review":"I got these headphones three months ago. They are working fine inspite of my rough handling and the sound quality is quite ok. Actually, that's what you get for that price. :-)However, the main reason for low rating of this product is that they are very uncomfortable if you plan to use them for more than an hour or so. Your ears and back of head starts to pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome... 4.5!!!","review":"I love my streetstyle phones. No earbuds ever fit on my ears, so I got these, and I catn believe the durability! I wrap the cord around either side of the plastic to store them, although i shouldnt, and theyre fine.

More of a plot, more of a specific reason for reading on, more details regarding the missing characters. The meat of the story could have been distilled into 60 pages.

And this book IS written with an agenda -- to convince you of something that's impossible, and to take your money. Give the Boy King a rest.

I study history, Egyptology and Theology. However, it appears to me that facts are certainly twisted in this book.The author USES scripture when it is advantageous to his theory. The scripture used is followed by his PERCEPTION of it taken out of context. The author also purposely misplaces biblical figures in time to make his theory feasible.I'm a firm believer in God and Spirituality. I am not into orthodox religion or doggedness, so I wasn't turned off because of that aspect.

The movie is very helpful on how to construct a healthy gay even straight relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest relationship","review":"Not sure I've seen such an accurate portrayal of a gay relationship. There were no easy answers in this film.Both Tom and Eli arrived with plenty of baggage. Both gave it the old college try and yet, doubts remained. Yet, they still both tried. Thought a bit unusual to work through issues before the relationship actually starts, I have lived through many similar circumstances.It was hard to tell if this film was low budget or not.

Set up on a blind date by two friends \\"A guy and girl who have the hots for each other and need an excuse to keep in contact\\" two guys, meet, have a disasterous first date and then keep bumping into each other. The guys are attractive but not unrealistic and the female friend is nice and funny but not the weird outrageous type getting so much overplay \\"e.g. Grace on Will and Grace\\" Fun side story with the straight couple, as when the guy uses the word butter cup to describe the color of a chair and suddenly has to convince the woman that he is in fact straight. A nice straightforward film that you can watch with friends, a boyfriend or just by yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite gay movie of all time!","review":"As far as Gay-themed films go, I would have to say that this is by far my favourite. It shows gays as most are--normal people with (sometimes not so) normal problems. This is a story about two gay men, screwed up in their own ways, having a strained relationship. This story is funny, romantic and ultimately satisfying. That, and one of the main characters is such a cutie....too bad he's straight in real life ;-)The verdict? If you like gay themed movies, this is a must.

I'm sure there are some people who are attracted to the wrong guy - but repeatedly?Actually, I have to believe that something must have happened during editing of the film. It is not cohesive. It must have skipped some major points to get from point A to point B then to the ending. And that's just not w/Tom and Eli, but 'Jackie' and 'Brent' too.

I really hat ethose movies where you know the outcome before the climax ever arrives, but this movie isnt about that at all. I truly was on the edge of my seat the whole way through because this is a real life problem, not a silver screen problem. The best part is that it worked out, it was believable, and even gave some of us hope! It instills a renewed sense in relationships and shows that through pain, growth can be achieved!

I loved him in '2guys and a girl' and was eager to see him in another role. Richard really breaks out of the sitcom mould in this movie - his characterisation of a chain smoking, heavy drinking masculine gay man is nothing short of breathtaking. The film itself is wonderful. It really delves into the difficulties of gay relationships in todays' society and how hard it is to meet 'Mr Right'. The onscreen dynamic between Dan Bucatinsky and Richard Ruccolo is excellent - you really are drawn into the complexities of their relationship. A special note should be made of the DVD. Unlike many smaller budget, indi films, this one is packed with features such as an audio commentary, deleted scenes, storyboards, interviews, trailers and a short film made by the director that will have you glued to the screen for hours. A wonderful movie that I wholeheartedly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"a definate feel good movie","review":"I loved this movie and recommended it to everyone I could think of (and they all loved it, too).

Though the story begins with the straight couple's romance and eventual engagement, the majority of the story deals with the budding romance between the gay couple and the emotional baggage that each man brings to the relationship. Richard Ruccolo is good as the ruggedly handsome alcoholic dealing with a lifetime of mental abuse from his alcoholic parents. Andrea Martin is a riot as Tom's (Dan Bucatinksy's character)mother. Doris Robert is good in her small role and the film also contains cameos by Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci, who play's Tom's sister. The dvd doesn't have much in the way of special features but if you like romantic comedy you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEARD IT WAS GREAT. BOUGHT IT.

All time greats; If Ya Want My Love, Just Lust, and the title track. You actually hear Joan and the boys harmonize on this Album! Good Music deserved so much commercial success...Beach Boy fans can catch Mike Love on this superb album, Darlene Love and rapper Scorpio. The only let down on the entire album is that it is kept so \\"clean\\". I always got a feeling that something is being held back on this album, like....angst,aggression maybe? If you ever got to see Joan perform Just Lust live in concert, then you would have seen the way it was supposed to have been done! I blame this on Columbia records mainly. You notice a change on Jett recordings when they go from Colubia to Warners. This Album is exaclty what is says it is...simply GOOD MUSIC! I love it! Needs to be in any true rock n' roll fans collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but often overlooked album","review":"This is a great cd from the queen of noise herself.

This book goes full circle from history of divorce, to risk factors, to process, to effects on adults as well as children, to remarriage, and finally to the future of divorce. For anyone going through a divorce I recommend this book as well for people contemplating marriage or just in a serious committed relationship. It will help you to analyze your own relationship for potential risks of divorce. It is a good educational tool for anyone who is contemplating marriage. It gives insight into your own personal risk factors of divorce. A must have for anyone currently in a relationship and who is also planning on marriage or children. It gives you the facts using the most up to date statistics and solid research. The authors Clarke-Stewart and Brentano have done a spectacular job putting together this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education against social problems","review":"This book goes full circle from history of divorce, to process, to effects, to remmariage. It's a good educational tool for everyone looking into marriage. It's good to assess your own personal divorce risk. Possibly, the more informed you are, the better prepared you are to enter a smart adult relationship with lower chances of divorce or possibly a more mature attitude and chance of survival, should your marriage end in divorce. It was also good in regards to statistics that it offered, going against many myths that people believe about divorce."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will definitely help your present or future marriage","review":"How many people thought about they will get divorce before or during their marriages? These days significant amount of people ended up in divorce and even some people divorce more than twice. This book teaches why people divorce and results of divorce by using statistics, references, and personal stories from divorced families. This book totally changed my perspective toward divorce in many manners. It tells you before-during-after divorce period with comparison of short-term and long-term. At the end, I was surprised from what I have learned and gained much more confident of marriage and divorce."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good and a easy to read book containing lots of information about divorce","review":"Much easier than other books about divorce which also covers everything you need to know about the causes and the consequences of divorce.

The book has really opened up my eyes to what I need to take into consideration for relationships in my own life.

It may be useful to those who plan on getting married to have a closer look at their divorce risks. I really recommend this book to anyone that wants to have a better understanding of divorce."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with these reviews?","review":"Is it just me, or do almost all of these reviews sound somewhat alike?

Although there is a plethora of information, the book itself is an easy read. Clarke-Stewart and Brentano present the topics in an organized and readily understood manner. This book provides useful knowledge pertaining to the causes and consequences of divorce. Even more helpful, are the suggestions provided for prevention and coping. As a college student, I would easily ignore this book on the shelves at a bookstore since I have no plans on getting married soon, let alone divorce. But, this book helps you question certain aspects in your life when dealing with relationships and learning more about yourself. Overall, this book provides great insight on the topic of divorce and I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have for those in a relationship","review":"This book is good for those that may either be pursuing a relationship or even in one at the moment. This book was very well thought out and put together and the structure allowed me to go through the book easier than I had expected. This book allows you to gain a new insight into all aspects of divorce. It also covers background history on the development of divorce, issues regarding children and custody, the remarriage process and so much more. I found it to be a very effective educational resource for divorce and relationships itself and it made me realize how many factors can play into having an effective relationship. Anyone that has gone through a divorce or may currently be going through a divorce may find it useful to read in that it provides a lot of resources and advice as to how the process should be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentials of Discipleship","review":"I have purchased this in preparation for future use.

This is an assemblage of black and white photos with random thoughts generated by Dylan on various subjects (Example: \\"God is woman. You take it from there.\\" This is superimposed over a b&w; photo of a naked, anonymous, headless woman tastefully covering her torso with her arms.).

And if you love the writings of Bob Dylan, you'll enjoy it a little more. Each page contains either an image or multiple images of Mr. Dylan, and most pages contain a blurb uttered by or written in a song by him. Considering the vast Bob Dylan songbook and the veritable sea of words Dylan has written, I would have expected more verbiage than what is presented here. I'm not complaining, mind you, just observing. There is only one Bob Dylan, and I'm glad he's here with us, sharing his extraordinary perspective.

Karajan is not a conductor at all! He is just a kappel-meister. In Karajan's terminology, there are only 6 words;fast,slow,high,low,soft and loud. When you obey these rules, and of course the metronome markings, you become conductor. It is very unfortunate for the piece because under Karajan's baton the symphony's key movements become meaningless.

The forward is just a history of plays that were written by women authors. I never knew before I read the forward that there were practically no women playwrights at this time. I guess I just overlooked it.The plays in this collection are all wonderful in their own right. The most engaging play had to be A Man's World by Rachel Crothers. It's very convential in the writing and the setting, but unconvential in that it protrays a srtong woman as a normal human being, not a plot device. It also shows a woman not giving up her morals for the sake of a man. I think that this play should be required reading in high school. If they were to put this play in high schools, then maybe some women would see that their morals are not stupid. Or maybe they won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality print","review":"I just received my paperback copy this morning.

Under von Karajan's direction, the long, epic first movement unfolds a landscape of indescribable desolation and barrenness, with many passages that are positively chilling (eg. the clarinet melody). The scherzo and the waltz are appropriately demonic, and the final movement is as cathartic as one could desire - and with incredible virtuosity from the Berliners. Von Karajan show us why many experts consider the Tenth to be Shostakovich's greatest symhonic achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I don't know where Rob got his listening skills from but he is not a good source for good music.

I did not like it at all. I guess I was expecting a bit more to take out of it then I did.

Things happen in his life and you have no idea what they are and when they happen. He was married and he had children? I get that is part of the addiction process but there are so many loose ends that on top of the writing style it becomes incredibly hard to follow. The whole book is pretty much him rambling on and on and on. I get that he was unhappy in his early years but he sounds like a self indulged whiner. I finished it feeling underwhelmed and bored.

There is more action and less stream of consciousness compared to the first volume. However, this does not mean a predictable protagonist we have. There is also more engagement with the political and social life of Americans of those times. But this doesn't seem to be didactic or partisanal.

Not only that, it is the great 1960s novel -- eventhough it didn't arrive until the early 1970s. Updike, no less than Bob Dylan, brought it all back home: the war, hippies, riots.

After a while of putting up with the boring and endless rantings of this character, I began skipping pages. I hate doing that but I had no choice.

Making it even worse is that CGI budget must have been very limited. Shots are reused so often that by the mid point of episode two you are expiriencing deja vue. After that it's like watching stock footage.And speaking of stock footage, there's way too much footage of modern day counterparts to the prehistoric animals.I found my self fast fowarding through the last three episodes looking for something interesting.There wasn't much!The two additional Full length programs weren't much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pet food scoop!","review":"This pet food scoop is great! The scoop is marked at 1/2 cup and 1 cup which is very convenient because we have small and medium-sized dogs - it helps me make sure that I don't under- or overfeed them. :) The clip is great and doesn't fall off the bag.Also, it's not a big deal but just note that the food scoop was a lighter blue than shown in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bulky","review":"The scoop is too bulky, but does measure out the correct amount of food.

One full scoop fills my cats' bowls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"There are so many Vortex spots in Sedona. We weren't sure where to look, so we bought \\"Sedona's Best Vortex Guidebook\\" It was very informative. Spots like Airport Mesa and Bell Rock. Each person may feel different things. Don't go expecting to \\"feel the power\\". Just go visit the areas and enjoy. Afterwards if you notice that you might have felt some extra energy to make up Bell Rock then that was the vortex. In other cases it might just hit you right in the face. Either way, this book is quite helpful for your vortex journies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"Nonzero, with its tremendous scope, would be a more difficult read than it is, weren't it for Robert Wright's expertise on his subject matter and ability to illustrate his point. Nonezero is one of those books that make you smarter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak arguments, not much empirical data","review":"If you read this book please also read Stephen J. Gould's book \\"Full House\\". I think Wright's arguments are weak and not supported by empirical evidence. For instance positive feed back \\"arms race\\" does not explain why bacteria are so numerous. If evolution favors complexity then why are bacteria still, by far, the most numerous life form on this planet after 3.5 billion years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"pothole","review":"This is a very preliminary reaction. Got to page 5. Decided to check referenced \\"prisoners dilemma\\" on pg 341. My dilemma is why does \\"you\\" wind up with two 10yr options while \\"him\\" does not get any. They both are shown with equal 3yr and 1yr options. Is that what is meant by a non-zero-sum?"},{"rating":"1","title":"when right trite when nocel wrong","review":"This book is a pretentious regurgitation of a half-digested science. The logic of the book goes like this. First, cooperation problems are ubiquitous in social and economic interactions (a common place idea). Second, human societies cope with these problems by devising institutions aimed at detecting cheaters and spreading information about them (also a common place idea barely worth repeating). And third, successful cooperation not only creates immediate material gains, but also gives rise to the need of more cooperation as some interactions that were hitherto impossible become viable (this idea, despite being the key for the whole book, is barely stated and never convincingly proved). If you want to write about science, it makes sense to use some method. State your hypothesis first and then show the evidence. Wright mixes up theory and evidence, perhaps knowing that his arguments wouldn't withstand any serious scrutiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe two stars.","review":"I agree with the negative reviews that suggest a breadth and not depth. The book is entertaining enough, but more often frustrating. I found myself, and I am no scholar, asking questions that would obviously need to be answered to continue his argument but he fails to presume them. Most of this is in regards to his willingness to take for granted any system that is more complex and involves humans has created a 'global village'. As a metaphor it fails because the interdependence he speaks of is entirely superficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Limits of Natural Teleology","review":"For an excellent review of this book by William A. Dembski, author of \\"Intelligent Design\\", see the August/September 2000 edition of First Things magazine, pg 46."},{"rating":"1","title":"noninteresting","review":"The purported thesis of this book is that non-zero-sumnass seems to be norm during our existance. The whole first half of the book is spent pointing out things like two neanderthals working together proved better than two neanderthals in competition. No kidding. I think it's obvious that every situation involving two entities doesn't have to end with a \\"winner\\" and a \\"loser\\". Finally in the second half of the book, he gets into concepts that may be new to some people, such as the idea of memes and cultural evolution. However, there are much better books out there on these topics, since they are only touched upon here for fifty pages or so. I also know why \\"Bill Clinton called the book astonishing and fascinating and instructed White House staff members to read it.\\" It's because at the end of the first part, Wright discusses how society might choose to concede many personal liberties in order to feel generally safe, and that this won't necessarily bring about 1984. Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Higher purpose","review":"I first heard about Non-Zero when I heard President Clinton refer to it enthusiastically in a speech, earlier this year, in which he cited how we are here on this earth, hopefully working for a higher purpose. I bought the book and read it and found it inspiring and compelling, especially realizing that the President had read it and been impressed with it, and gleaned and cited this particular insight. The Economist review cited on the dust cover of the book says, in part, \\"This clever and stimulating book is destined to become a classic.... Like Charles Darwin's On the Origin of the Species and Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene, it could well change the way people think and feel about their lives -- perhaps even how they behave... An intellectual entertainment argued with wit and style.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious, erudite, extraordinary","review":"Wright's ambition is no less than to offer an analog of physical science's elusive unified theory. He wants to explain the entire course of human history. To an astonishing degree, he succeeds. His erudition is almost overwhelming. He ranges fluidly from cellular biology to Chinese history to Islamic theology. And he does so in a style that is both friendly and accessible. Reading Nonzero is like having a pleasant, extended conversation over brandy with a wise friend who's had time to read and ponder all the books you've wished you read but haven't gotten to yet. No doubt this will expose Wright to scads of petty complaints from academics who are so narrowly focused on departmental politics and the minutiae of their dissertations that they not only can't see the forest, but have forgotten its existence. For the rest of us, though, Nonzero is a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I read his prior book The Moral Animal, and found Nonzero proof that someone who can write one good nonfiction book has at least one more in him. As an economist I appreciate the prominence given to game theory, as it lurks above everything (in the book and in life!). He writes in a compelling, fair, and entertaining way: classic popular nonfiction. The application to the meaning of life and its direction is something more pusillanimous academics would never attempt, so the new thing to me is actually writing out the interesting and straightforward implications of various well-accepted findings (anyone who thinks this is all based on speculative ideas is a dilettante). More to the point of population contention, the thinking that life in general isn't mere happenstance, is good cocktail chatter."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first foray into the purpose behind evolution - Fantastic","review":"Fascinating - and often humorous - Wright really got me thinking about the way we are today. What makes us greedy? What makes us generous?(To nudge this a little further: One unanswered question remains in my mind. If indeed we follow the path from tribes and chiefdoms to nation-states to the next logical mega-merger with intelligent alien peoples and cultures across star systems, what would the effect of our differing needs have on each culture? In other words: If an intelligent lifeform's existence is reliant upon different environmental/social/psychological conditions, how would our past evolutionary path proceed to this next step? Does the possibility of an invisible barrier exist, or will evolution \\"make it happen\\"?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle Brow Nonsense","review":"Theoretically it shouldn't take much time to get through this psuedo intellectual romp, for the writing is breezy. But even the few hours seems time ill spent. This is poorly reasoned, poorly argued tripe, so riddled with falacies and misleading interpretations of the evidence that it does not merit serious consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, well researched, well-written","review":"For an educated layman like me, who spends very little time contemplating the evolution of either culture or biology, this book is highly intriguing and interesting. It's clearly well-researched. Wright spends a lot of time quoting arguments from others, and that fact alone makes it a good introduction to anthropology and evolutionary theory, among other disciplines.In this age when \\"intelligent design\\" is a hot topic, it is interesting to read a view that allows for a designer but does not require it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change the way you think about History","review":"I had a hard time getting into this book, but once past page 64 I can't put it down. This will change the way you think about history and the driving forces of \\"Civilization\\". After years of traditional History (Individuals, dates, and events), it's hard to accept that many of these individual human triumphs and Tragedies may have had little consequence or impact of the eventual rise of civilization. The concept of the value of utility (for example had the concept of the wheel been lost, the value of the concept is so powerful that it would have undoubtedly been discovered again), had I guess escaped me in the emotion of the stories. The author makes a compelling case , I found the section on the dark Ages and the fall of Rome especially enlightening as it differs so from our commonly held understanding. This will undoubtedly change the way you look at the History, and possible the future of Humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Badly In Need Of A Rewrite","review":"Bottom line: The book is brilliant, insightful, and well worth reading. But you'll have to read it a couple of times to make out just what the author is trying to say. He often never explicitly lays out his point, and I found myself actually taking notes. The concept of maximizing non-zero sumness pays off, but reading the book is like listening to a lecture given by an ingenius professor who didn't have time to redraft his notes or organize his ideas into a cohesive whole. Frankly, it drags, and requires an enormous investment from the reader -- but it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice addition to the Timberline 4","review":"This vestibule is easy to use with the Timberline 4, and provides a bit of protection for gear that doesn't have to be inside the tent.

I tried pinching in the tabs on the connectors, but they were too stiff to do so by hand. I succesfully tightened one end using a pair of pliers. But the other end crushed three of the tabs. One of the tabs broke off when I pulled it back out so I could could get the connector to go over the jack on the subwoofer. Also, the packaging is a nightmare. Just getting the cable out of the package was an ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not well shielded","review":"This cable works fine when all the equipment is turned on, but when my receiver is in standby mode, the subwoofer emits a constant low-pitch hum.

It turns out you also need a Monster ILJRY-1 F Single Female RCA to Dual Male RCA Y-Adapter to feed the signal into both channels of the subwoofer, or it doesn't work right.

I think that the premise of the story is cute; Johnie being in love with two men who are in fact, both the same man. I get the point of the story, however, it is just going on and on and becoming monotonous.

Mozart. Sure it sounds darker than any other rendition, but the maestro slows the whole work down (except for the Dies Irae; in this recording, it's faster than usual), which makes it duller and less conventional. The soloists and the choir do fine, but I agree with {vaughna} that the singers \\"add drama in too many places where it isn't called for.\\"I would strongly suggest other recordings, like conductor Philippe Herreweghe conducting the Orchestre des Champs-Elysees (Label: Harmonia Mundi), or Jos van Veldhoven and the Netherlands Bach Society (Label: Channel Classics).

Karajan seems to be flogging his orchestra -- the pace is way too fast for a work that is focused on mourning. Perhaps because the pacing is too aggressive, everyone performs as if they were terrified. The soloists acquit themselves very poorly on track 4. The bass starts everything off with an almost absurd rendition -- he sounds like a walrus choking on phlegm. One of the female vocalists, probably Anna Tomowa-Sintow, cannot sing the letter \\"s\\" without hissing -- she sounds ridiculous.

Sounds like he rushed through a bad rehearsal and recorded whatever came out...rush job for the holidays. Very disappointing! He should be more selective with arrangements that match his talent instead of dragging him down. He has one of the smoothest sounds around, and can do so much more.

There is a certain lack of cohesiveness, and the vocals are, well, to put it nicely, not very good.Interpretations of standards are never easy, particularly when translating from voice to instrument; but more often than not-it just doesn't work here. Some of Botti's more recent efforts have astounded me with gentle intricacy and positive energy. This album sounds like a demo that hasn't had the kinks worked out yet.Aside from the issue with the vocals, there are misplaced sounds and synths that are out of time. Beats are missed and a few gaping gaffes in production.I really debated between two and three stars, but in the end I went with two because Botti fans will buy it regardless, but newbies may buy it and be left with a disappointed impression of him. This is really recomended only for fans.

I went to their website and previewed all of their tracks from their CD 'FROM ONE.' This Band and this album is quite amazing. They don't stoop as low as screaming which I like. Their lyrics are great, and Sahaj's voice is incredible. If you guys like hard rock, I suggest you check 'Ra' out. They are a great band. They mix a bunch of music genres together to form incredible music, they mix metal, alternative rock, rock, and some indie music in to form incredible music. If you want to listen to something new and refreshing, give this album a try.

With songs like \\"Only\\" and \\"Do You Call My Name\\" right on to \\"Skorn\\", it shows the raw originality between the Egyptian-sounding nature with the angry grunge of this pop-esque rock. While beautifully written songs like \\"Sky\\" make it more diverse, the band's vocals and original guitar lines are aided wonderfully by backups and harmonies that create a completely original and wonderful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"ratstar","review":"In a period where every band sounds like CREED, Ra has tapped into a old sound with a blend of todays rifts.

It sounds like the whole CD is based around one song on the CD that was an average song and I think that was the I Believe song...Around the 7th song I start to really get annoyed by the Ra Singers voice, but Parole is a very good song. The Songs all sound somewhat the same but all CDs do that, so I guess it is sorda how they all sound the same, this one didn't do a good job of that though because of the Singers Voice.

When I first put in the CD, the first song, \\"Do You Call My Name,\\" got me excited. The middle eastern sound was cool, and then the song moved towards metal rock, and was overall a good song. But then the second song came on and it was a generic sounding angry song. Then the third song came, and then the fourth, but none of the songs had the sound of the first song. Besides from the first song on this CD, I found it to be a waste of money.

But Ra doesn't follow that same formula whatsoever. Instead, they keep the heavy edge minus the mindless chord progressions and insert awesome vocals and powerful and somewhat middle-eastern guitar riffs (listen to their first single \\"Do You Call My Name\\") They lyrics are original and easy to listen to. Many songs come off as somewhat angry, yes, but they are for good reasons... But never do they stoop to the screaming level, and they also know that they don't have to be heavy all the time. \\"Walking and Thinking\\" is a standout slower song that even the metalheads should be able to like. In the end, Ra deserves to be put in the spotlight as a band that won't follow the current hard rock formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD","review":"This is a breathtaking CD. For any rock-listeners, this is a necessity. The songs are so well constructed, and the lyrics are so momentous. Some standout tracks are: Do You Call My Name, Rectifier, Only, I Believe, and On My Side. Every song on this album is remarkable, however. When you look at the lyrics, you connect with the band, and you feel what they are writing these songs for. I Believe is my favorite song, just because the lyrics are so beautiful. Also, he has a very distinctive voice, and it adds a sort of freshness to the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best New Band","review":"Main stream bands today are either those pansy garage sounding bands or dudes that feel by screaming their heads off, think they're actually cool. This band is neither. Within the first thirty seconds of \\"Do You Call My Name\\", you have no idea where this CD is going but then, BAM, it hits you like a ton of bricks. With lyrics and music that seem like they were blended by some mystical force every song is like an adventure into hard rock. And it doesn't stop there. With songs like \\"Rectifier, Only, Fallen Rock Zone and Violator\\", just to name a few, I promise the band Ra will not go quietly into the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favorite BSC books","review":"I'm a huge fan of The Baby-Sitter's Club books.

The camera itself looks great- but the photos it takes are REALLY bad. My 5 yr old 3 megapixel camera took much better and much sharper pictures. It makes my old camera look like a 7 megapixel camera in comparison. The indoor pics are so grainy I'd be embarrassed to show them to anyone. The flash is not very good. The LCD screen is pretty bad too. I gave it a chance after taking a few pics in the store- that maybe it would look better on the computer screen. I was wrong and I'm taking the camera back.

At first I really admired the camera because of it's sleek design, and low price. It seemed like a great camera for a novice with all of it's presets. I will admit that some of the presets do work pretty well (like the night shot), but you have to go through a few menus to get there.My advice, don't waste your money.

I'm not sure why the change, but my complaints follow consistantly with the other user's opions below; mostly grainy photos, dark lifeless color and a lack of general crispness that is seen on just about any other camera you pick up nowadays.Another complaint is that it takes a long time from the moment you turn it on until you're able to take a photo. I've missed many photo opportunties waiting in that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Played","review":"I had to watch this movie for a class, and I was sorely disappointed. You don't need to have read the book to see how abridged the movie is, condensing long periods of time into a few unconvincing seconds. This isn't helped by the fact that Russell Wong has the emotional range of Keanu Reeves. There were only two scenes in the film that I thought came together in every respect - both starring Victor Wong - but the fact that they were such good moments only made the poor quality of the rest of the film that much more apparent.I felt the script was bland and unoriginal, and the actors seemed to lack any real personality on the screen because of this. It seemed exactly like a dozen other American movies, only this one starred Chinese actors. None of the decisions within the movie seem believable, and the ending feels tacky and schmaltzy and all those other things I can't stand in a movie.It's definitely not the worst movie, but I had much higher expectations from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference","review":"I cannot keep this book on my desk my cube and have finally ordered more copies for the rest of the crew.

This book is worth having in your library if you are an Oracle DBA, but \\"Expert Oracle9i Database Administration\\" by Sam R. Alapati is far and away superior, both in content and in writing style. If you are looking for an Oracle9i book, start with Alapati's book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"GUNFISH is great!","review":"I'm excited! Thanks to the glowing review by Brodie Remington, I got a copy of GUNFISH by Claude M. Pearson. I learned more about life on a W.W.II submarine in the Pacific in just a the first few chapters than I could ever have imagined. The author, Claude M. Pearson, is a W.W.II sub vet and an expert at bringing submarine warfare to life. My favorite part was the daring rescue of downed fliers in the Pacific Ocean south of Kyushu, Japan. This rescue operation took place in the heat of battle and was based on the real-life experiences of the author! I also liked the way the plot bounces between the adventures of the Gunfish crew and the ladies they left back home in San Francisco. I highly recommend GUNFISH to anyone who enjoys a gripping true-to-life adventure. I hope this author has more books in the works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Mark Twain once said that good fiction must be believeable. This book is not. It is terribly written and not very believeable. The Captain in this sub actually preferred to attack destroyers with his gun mounts. That's insane. You only do that as a last resort. And you figure you'll lose anyway. Add to that, he made it a love story, with all sorts of female characters that had nothing to do with anything. The whole book was just stupid.

I ordered different colors and expected the same pants. When the order came in a note was in the box that they had changed vendors and these were an equal quality. The pants seem to be of a lighter material than the original and were longer in the legs and shorter in the seat. I have to take the new style pants to shorten the legs or end up wearing them out from stepping on them. Since pants of this size are hard to find I will most likely buy them again but will change to the ones with the elastic band at the ankles.

Simply put, the guy rocks.This new set by the Sons is a stylish revamping of their classic sound. All the old elements are there--the funky melodies, the wah-wah guitars, the back beats, the punchy horns (courtesy of Mic Gillette and Tom Saviano), plus Champlin himself is growling in fine form. There are no bad tunes on \\"Hip Li'l Dreams,\\" and there are several great ones, including \\"For Joy\\" and \\"Star Outta You\\" (a *terrific* indictment of today's cookie-cutter music scene).Recently, on \\"Chicago XXX,\\" Champlin has been able to break out with that classic band, penning and singing some of the best cuts on that set (\\"Already Gone,\\" \\"Better,\\" \\"Where Were You\\"); the Sons, however, seem to be his laboratory, and \\"Hip Li'l Dreams\\" is well worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip Li'l Schlock","review":"Absolutely dreadful.

Authors surely didn't play Starcraft before. Here is a quote from the guide (p. 17): \\"Vulture is a hovercycle that's fast, powerful, and very effective when quick response time is critical... very effective, when you are defending a sprawling base\\". Vultures are useless against everything except infantry. The \\"easy to follow general strategies\\" are general strategies, which is almost impossible to use against human opponent.

Ive been playing this 5 star rts game since about a month after it came out, and I learned volumes more strategy than this guide provided me with for $20, and I learned it for free! Anyone thinking of buying this book should just sit down and jump on some multiplayer games and watch the different strategies that other people are using. With the combination of the creativity of a good opponent(and there are plenty out there), and your own inspired imagination, you'll go MUCH further than this book or any help guide can take you! Not to mention that following these 'skimpy' strategies that are listed in a book such a bore.

When I first started playing the game I looked for as much help was possible. I found this book. This gave me the information I needed to at least survive the first few times I played. From that I have moved to a more dominating player. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know a little more about the game sooner. Also, the most helpful part of this book is the tables at the end. Once you have an understanding of how each unit works, you can use the tables to best fight them."},{"rating":"1","title":"another reason not to buy official hint books","review":"Just like all \\"official\\" hint books, this one has no real help. The only remotely useful thing is the campaign walkthrus. The unit info is basically what you get in the StarCraft Manual. Pick up the Multiplayer guide instead; the unit tips are useful in Single-player as well, and hop on the net for some walkthroughs. Generally a bad purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has the writer even PLAYED this game?","review":"Everything in this book is wrong, except for the unit stats, but even then some of them are outdated (but we won't hold that against prima). However, being how this was published 2 years after the original release of SC, you'd think that it would have some better multiplayer strategies than \\"always pay attention\\" and \\"a good defense is a good offense.\\" The single player strategies consist of \\"build cannons at choke\\" and \\"build big army.\\" Multiplayer strategy is a joke.

This book also tells very little about strategy, online or otherwise, and just tells you things you can read in the instructions. Don't waste your money on this book.

No way! The book does not teach any useful strategy for general games against the computer or, much better, against human players. The real fun of this game is to play against human people, and the book will tell you only nonsense things about this. I really regret I paid for such a crappy book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is useless.","review":"Sorry to rain on your parade, but this book is useless. The game is one of the greatest ever. But, there is little in this book (and less) than is in the manual Blizzard gives you, EXCEPT solutions to the campaigns. And if you follow the solutions, you are missing 99 percent of the fun. Prima usually does a real good job writing hint books that tell you how to play the game, but this book gives you nothing on general strategy, or explanation of the game itself. This book doesn't even have anything to say on the structures - the order to build them, etc. I had little trouble completing the campaigns before this book came out, and I am not the greatest player of games. So, if you absolutely must have solutions to the maps, get the book. If you want to have any fun with the game, don't. (And, I might add, the solutions I used were all different than what was in the book. There is no one solution.) Prima, you could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to do together during your engagement period","review":"\\"Before You Say I Do Devotional\\" is a devotional book focused completely on couples who are going through the engagement period.

Each devotional ends with questions to answer that are used to help get the communication going.There were a few devotionals in here that I either just plain didn't agree with or just didn't get anything out of, but that should be expected.Other than that, I would definitely recommend this book to all the engaged Christian couples out there.

Out of the nine, the last two were the weakest, but still a good short read.I was pleasantly surprised by Charlaine Harris's contribution. I expected a Sookie story, but instead received a good vampire/werewolf story with no Sookie in sight. It is alwasy nice to see another part of the world which an author has created.Jim Butcher was in true form with his entry.

All were very good stories and all these authors I read alot. The rest, sad to say, not so good, at all. But, I would buy the book just for the above mentioned. I think everyone would agree when buying a \\"collection\\" of short stories this is always the case, some good and some not so good. No need to be disappointed, unless they all stink.

I've read novels by most of the authors and enjoyed them more than the individual stories here, with the exception of Jim Butcher; I didn't like his Dresden books but thought the story here was well written and interesting. I really like the paranormal genre so this book was a dissapointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful","review":"This book has many bad/marginal reviews for a very good reason. It's awful. The first story is so bad it's enough to make you want to quit reading the book altogether.

I know that she can write short stories, I've read others by this lady. This time, it just seemed too fuzzy to come together as well as the others.But, the nicest thing of all was to read a book by multiple authors and not find one entry, not one mention of Laurell K.

Some worked fine, some worked just OK and some wouldn't play. Fortunately I have three DVD players in my house so I managed to take in all but a single hour's show. The series The Wire is absolutely the best HBO series, or any series, I have ever watched. It's story arcs and character development are outstanding and highly recommended. HBO I believe outsourced the preparation of the complete series to some third world country. They should be ashamed of themselves for marketing such an inferior product. By all means, I recommend purchasing a single year at a time so you can fully enjoy this outstanding series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best show ever - worst product ever","review":"I read the reviews warning me about the packaging and performance of the disks. I love the show so much that ignored them when I found this set for a great deal. Needless to say, I'm disappointed.

Just do not by this package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful packaging","review":"Stay *away* from this set. These discs are packaged in the worst way that I've ever seen any disc set packaged.Shame on HBO for putting out such a horrible package.Your discs *WILL BE DAMAGED* when you get them. Mine were individually wrapped in plastic in the cardboard sleeves and many discs were scratched.And to HBO : What's wrong with packaging the discs in normal DVD cases, or in CD cases, or any any of the proven disc storage technology developed over the last 25+ years??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control in manufacturing","review":"Obviously The Wire is a great show. The 1-star review is for the quality control during the DVD manufacturing. I'm on Season 2, and the DVD freezes up at places and won't play. I tried it on my computer and had the same problems in the exact same places. No visible scratches, and it's the first time I've played the DVD, so it's a manufacturing problem - not something I did. (Others have had this same problem - click on some of the other 1 star reviews to see).Not sure if the cardboard sleeves in the box had anything to do with this, but at this price, I expect better quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD's","review":"Great series, but the quality of the disks is poor.

I would like to watch the show without pieces missing. So, to sum up: Show Good....DVDs bad. I tried them on three different dvd players and my computer, so it's not me! Good luck, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible packaging, defective discs","review":"Arrived promptly from Amazon, shrink-wrapped. Discs are just shoved into cardboard slots.

I highly recommend The Wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Price - Terrible packaging.","review":"Not 5 stars only because of the packaging. Great price - $72 for the entire season is too good to pass up. The packaging is all hard edged cardboard and the DVDs will move around and get scratched. I bought separate dvd cases to hold the seasons in for this reason. Nevertheless, the wire still one of the greatest shows to be on television. If you can get a great deal, don't hesitate. Just expect to get a separate case for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Series","review":"The Wire is one of the best HBO series on television! Every season leaves you begging for more.

Period! I started watching this show after the series concluded, but its one of those shows that once you get started you really can't stop until you have seen all of the seasons. It provides a great social commentary that can be adapted to most major cities and not just to Baltimore. I love how it shows that all parts of a city are connected...from the drug market to law enforcement to politicians to the school system and also to journalists. Somehow the writers managed to continuously tie stories and characters back together that may have been absent for almost a season. It is one of those rare shows where not only does each season build off the past, but you can begin to see how all aspects of a city are connected and you can have lots of fun trying to predict how things will turn out.This is a complete series collection where price should not matter because you will enjoy watching all seasons for many, many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"We got caught up in the drama","review":"We got the Wire on recommendation of my son and watch all 5 seasons and enjoyed them but 5th was only 10 shows not 12 or 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series","review":"A very good series that needed more praise and awards. The first and third seasons were the best. Second season was really boring. The fourth and fifth had there moments but still good. It just shows what drugs do to people and why it is a losing battle that the cops cannot win. Politics play a big role in how they just do things for appearances. Nothing changes. A must see series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Santa... All I want is the Wire for Xmas","review":"Read the reviews... Simply put, this is an experience like no other. I feel lucky to have been introduced to this series in season 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Product - It's Defective","review":"The Wire TV series is great, but the box set is defective.

It doesn't matter if the product is for a goo show if it does not work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty DVDs","review":"This distributor is now working on the second try of getting me a functional set of DVDs of the wire. First, the problem was adhesive on the information side of the DVDs and missing DVDS (!). Now, the DVDs are scratched. You're better off going with someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very poor quality","review":"The series itself is interesting. As is typical with many HBO dramas, heavy on profanity; especially in comparison to shows on Showtime. However the disk quality is truly awful: freezes, shutters, skips.Unfortunately, I did not try to watch until it was too late to return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller won't reply to emails","review":"I ordered the entire 5 season Wire Series. I had watched Season 1 and got hooked. I was going to order to own and pass around to my friends. Once I received the series it took almost 2 months to get to season 5 where I discovered that one of the Season 5 DVDs was actually labeled wrong and was a repeat of a previous season. I understand that happens and ended up viewing those episodes on Amazon, but decided to contact the seller to notify and see if anything could be done. I've attempted twice over approximately 3 weeks now and haven't even gotten an acknowledgment of my email. I attempted to contact more as a notification since it had been awhile, but that the seller hasn't taken the time to acknowledge my email is disappointing and now is making me feel like I should have gotten a replacement DVD. I won't order from this company again and wouldn't recommend this seller any longer. Customer service is important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got my favorite show on DVD","review":"All of the discs play perfectly with non of the issues mentioned about some of the older editions. They also come in sturdy cases. It goes without question that the show is awesome. Good buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is the best series ever produced on television. While I cannot compete with the insightful and elegant comments of the other reviewers, I must add my congratulations to the writers and the cast and the directors for this surpurb drama.This series proves that television can be relevant. It only took 80 years or so. We need much more of this. Pure art. Pure relevance.A wonderful achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the best shows but horrible packaging","review":"very very good show. Had to give low rating based on packaging. Will have to put discs into a binder because packaging is not good for storing. Also it was quick delivery time but the way it was shipped was very poor. The dvd box set was taped together from the sender so the the box set box is ruined as well it was all dinged up and bent out of shape. It was shipped in a small box with none to very little padding or paper to protect the dvd box. Now to the box set itself. 1st each dvd comes in a thin plastic sleeve which is stored in a cheap cardboard fold out with a place to put each disc. Also disc condition is not great. I owned the third season of the wire before and that box set packaging was superb, HBO should have spent a little bit more to do the same with the complete set. I wish i would have read the reviews instead of just looking at the seller rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD has skipped tracks and imperfections","review":"I purchased the entire 5 seasons of The Wire. So far I have seen the first season. The final episode of the first season had multiple imperfections and skipped tracks, making it impossible to figure out what was going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior package","review":"As the show itself has reminded me, you got to watch out for inferior product, because you might just get swindled. So it is rather ironic that an awful package for an incredible show leaves me feeling like some of the unfortunate characters in the show itself. The discs are skipping, not playing correctly. And they're BRAND NEW. I read the one star reviews, I saw that many people have had issues with the disc quality. And yet I figured that I would be a bit luckier and not have any such issues. Well, I was wrong. Thank you American and Chinese heisters who are making an extra buck by selling a crap product, knowing that people will buy it anyway because the show is so damn good. So take heed of The Wire's wisdom and DON'T GET SWINDLED. Buy the seasons individually or watch instantly on Amazon etc. This complete series skips and messes up so much, it may as well have been illegally copied by some rogue drug dealer on an outdated computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest television show, period.","review":"Many have called The Wire the greatest dramatic television show ever made. I think it is the greatest television show EVER made, period. The depth in the story and characters can't be found in another show, and probably never will. The acting is incredible, from the main characters, to smaller characters. And it is also hilarious in parts, once again due to the suberb writing, acting and direction. Do yourself a favor and check this out, because the mold was broken after The Wire was made."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best show I've ever seen!","review":"This is a remarkable show! It is both extremely entertaining and thought provoking. It really makes you think about the war on drugs, our police and education systems, big city politics, the plight of the traditional blue collar workers in our cities, and the role of the media in all of this. It is also very well acted and produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype: The Wire is essential viewing","review":"If you haven't seen The Wire in its entirety you need to watch The Wire in its entirety. The praise it has received has all been deserved, and the various claims that it is \\"the best television series ever made\\" and \\"mandatory viewing\\" are not hyperbolic. The Wire is utterly entertaining, engrossing, and educational. Powerfully honest and culturally important, The Wire is truly essential viewing.'The Wire: The Complete Series' is a quality set of DVDs. The box is compact and fits easily on a DVD shelf. The packaging is relatively minimalist, which I consider a good thing, and the DVDs are perfectly safe from scratches (despite some people's claims otherwise).It should be noted that The Wire is unlikely to ever appear on Blu-ray. David Simon specifically chose the 4:3 aspect ratio, as you can read about here ([...]). The Wire is unlikely to ever have an HD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is in 4x3? WTF??","review":"So I LOOOOOVVES me some Wire. I was HUGELY excited to receive the boxed set.And then I put in a disc.It's all in 4x3: WTF?? People it's 2011 ...

Either the disks got scratched up in transit due to the flimsy cardboard holders, or the disks themselves have serious manufacturing defects.I returned one box set to Amazon only to receive another set with the same kind of issues. Oh, well -- an expensive lesson learned: just stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series ruined by shoddy boxed set","review":"I owned season 5 and wanted a complete set of what I consider the best TV offered in the last decade.

People will look back at this someday as a Shakespeare or Mona Lisa of its time. Masterfully crafted in its themes and emotions, the acting is brilliant. And if all that doesn't interest you, the plot is downright fantastic as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing show, terrible packaging with scratched disks","review":"The Wire is one of the greatest shows ever made for television. It is thought-provoking, complex, and incredibly well-done.The packaging this set of DVDs comes in is absolutely terrible. It is flimsy and completely incapable of protecting these valuable disks against damage during transport. I've gone through most of the DVDs in the package so far, and out of about 20 disks that I've tried, at least 7 of them have given me read errors. I have had to use special software to recover the data and make these DVDs watchable.Do yourself a favor and watch the Wire in another manner. I don't know if the single season DVD sets also suffer from the same problem. If not, they may be a better solution.I cannot believe that such a fine show is being distributed in such a shoddy manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible packaging ruins great series","review":"The DVDs in this are loosely held in thick paper cases. Rather than being held securely in snap cases most of the discs in the set shifted in delivery. The result was that about 17 of the 23 discs were heavily scratched and half the episodes were unplayable.I cannot promise that you will have the same unfortunate event as myself in your delivery but I purchased the set Brand New and it still came to me in worse shape than if I bought them used. Although it may be more costly this series is so good it would probably be worth it to puchase the seasons individually. Personally I have watched the entire series twice and it only improves with successive viewings. Just make sure you get DVDs that are better packaged than the ones in this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb in every way!","review":"This series was one of the best things I've ever seen on t.v. (of course, it couldn't have been shown on a regular network). The acting, the writing and the entire storyline were all extremely compelling. There wasn't one false note throughout the many seasons and I was particularly riveted by the actors portraying \\"Stringer Bell\\", \\"Omar Little\\" and \\"Snoop Pearson\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV Show I've Seen. Period.","review":"While I am not a TV buff and haven't seen many series from before the 90s, this is easily the best TV series I have ever seen. I have made my family and friends all watch it with me, and all are hooked. I started in the middle of season 4, but still became addicted and joined Netflix solely for the purpose of getting the rest of it when my local Blockbuster didn't have it. Amazing and totally worth the expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wire Complete Series","review":"Before I purchased this series, I did not think much of the reviews complaining about the packaging. If I had the money, I would have purchased the seasons one at a time. How right the previous reviewers were. The packaging is terrible and frustrating. My season 2 DVDS were scratched but Amazon was great with the return. I would have given the series five stars if not for the horrific packaging. It bothers me just to think about it. Great writing and acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series of the last 20 years","review":"Not much more to say than the title of this review. Give the show 2 episodes and you will not be able to stop. Well produced, written, directed, etc. Most of the cast is known because of work they got from their roles on this show. I am currently on a marathon, watching 3 or 4 episodes a day.Some of the creative minds behind \\"The Wire\\" are currently doing \\"Treme\\" on HBO. Also highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic series, inferior DVDs","review":"The Wire is beyond doubt the greatest tv series that I have ever seen. That's not the issue. Rather, I write this review to alert fellow consumers to the fact that this set is extremely cheaply produced. It is so bad that had I not spent the money myself, I would have concluded that it is a bootleg. Which begs the question- is it a bootleg? The quality of the recording is just poor. None of the DVDs play through without skipping etc. The box and other packaging is equally wanting. Again excellent content but disappointing box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really unfortunate!","review":"I am so grateful to have the opportunity to rate this product. The first in this set of discs was perfect, so I threw away the paperwork for returning any later viewed discs - incorrectly assuming the rest would be perfect. They were not! This poor rating has nothing to do with the content. I saw \\"The Wire\\" and it is a fantastic series!! But every disc that I bought was of such poor quality: lengthy sections dmaaged and skipped and not viewable. I tried the remaining discs (roughly 25 of them)in two televisions and three computers. They were all damaged! What a disappointment! Im sure the vendor didn't intend to do this (vendor was rated 100% satisfaction!) but charging high prices for low quality just isn't right! I hope this rating sends the message that quality control is very very important! If I knew who I bought it from, I would never buy again. Really unfortunate! Btw, I purchase quite a lot through Amazon and have had all perfect quality until this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome show","review":"Great writing, acting, and story.

Unfortunately, we began to watch the DVDs only recently and some of the DVDs can NOT be read on the DVD player or the computer, worst than that trying to read the DVD makes the DVD player and the computer do a very strange noise...!Besides, a DVD is simply missing!!So if you want to spare some money, don't buy this package! It's such a shame that people sell this product.I really hope that my review might help somebody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislabeled dvd","review":"The dvd's arrived in a timely manner as indicated by the seller; however, upon viewing the dvd's it seems that disc 1 of Season 5 is mislabeled. When I actually played the disc it showed the last two episodes of Season 4. So I now have two discs (one mislabeled) of the last two episodes of season 4, and no disc for episodes 1-3 of Season 5.

It was new and packaged and I recived it earlier than expected. I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Show on Television...But...","review":"By far, the best show on television. Even before I bought the complete set, I've watched and rewatched every episode a number of times.BUT, why did HBO have to ruin that with cheap packaging and full screen format. I'm sure that the could have put the DVD's in better packaging. The package it came in had a big UPS code flier thing glued to the back of the box and rips a layer off the box as you try to take it off. The DVD's are separated by seasons but are in bad cardboard holder that (could) scratch as you take out the disc. Also, I'm not sure how they divided up each season on to the disks... some have 2 episodes, others have 4, which I think was to the degradation of quality of the picture. It would also have been nice to have the show in wide screen, or in hi quality format.That all being said, watch the show any way you can (have a friend burn you a copy or something... the quality would be the same)... Then wait if a better version comes out in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO IT!!!","review":"Before I bought this i read the reviews on how bad the set was, stupid of me to go and buy this box set anyway instead of just buying each season individually. When the box set finally came I took one dvd out to see it had minor scratches, ignoring this I put the dvd in the player only for it to tell me it was unable to read the disc. I tried the other ones only to find out that they won't play either. Now Im pissed because I really like this show and bought it to watch but it is obvious that HBO doesn't give a F about The Wire or you because they would have put these dvd's in a normal dvd case instead of a piece of construction paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"the packaging... yeah","review":"This is either a five star or a one star thing, depending on whether or not you're willing to ignore the packaging and the associated frustrations. Frustrating to scratch the DVDs just taking them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping Disk","review":"I purchased the complete series for The Wire. The first disk has been skipping already. I will update if anything comes available but this was listed as new when sold but this might have been prepackaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific show. Terrible DVD.","review":"I should've read the other reviews before purchasing, but I didn't. That said, as soon as I pulled these out of the packaging and inserted into the DVD player they began skipping. The DVD's are impossible to watch in there entirety, which is extremely frustrating. Not only can I not watch the DVD's, I'm no longer able to return them to get my money back because the packaging has been opened.If you want to watch The Wire, do yourself a favor and buy the set season by season. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SET!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"The series itself is excellent but it doesn't matter how good it is if you can't play it. As many many others have found out the packaging and production of this set by HBO is horrible! Fully a third of dvd's have problems, skipping, freezing or not playing episodes at all. Had I the chance to do it over again I would definitely get the individual seasons and not the box set, at least from what I've heard those don't have any playback issues. FYI I have played the bad dvd's on two different players makes no difference. The only way I can get some of the worst ones to play is to play via my pc, as said buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Packaging","review":"This is a great show, but the other reviews that complain about the packaging and DVD cases are completely right. This is the worst packaging I have ever seen a DVD come in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality show","review":"It took me a while to get into this show, as it can be slow and detail oriented, but every time I got to the end of a season, I was very satisfied with that season. If you like Oz, I think you will like this show a lot. The fourth and fifth seasons of this show really make the box set worth the purchase; the politics in The Wire are excellent, and seem very real, which is very scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good TV, worst DVDs ever","review":"I own over 1000 DVD titles. Never have I had such a bad experience. I am just finished with season 1 which I managed to see after struggling with skipping and un-readability issues on some episodes. the 2nd disk of the 2nd season is unusable. I am trying to read it on multiple DVD players and computers and can't get more than a few minutes going. I wish I had seen the other reviewers reporting this issue. This also explains why amazon are not selling it - probably had too many returns and dropped the product.Ironic since each disk is individually wrapped in a nylon sleeve.While I am sure many of you want to own this series, save yourself the money and frustration. get it on demand on HBO GO for free if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every single DVD is scratched","review":"My girlfriend recently bought me a brand new copy of The Wire box set off Amazon.

Season 4 is by far the worst. Thirteen episodes crammed onto four single-layer discs. I've seen better cam vids taken from a movie theater (OK, not quite that bad). I can almost just about live with the vid quality of Seasons 1-3 and 5, but there are terrible and quite distracting compression artifacts with Season 4. That, and several of the discs have real trouble playing in anything but my computer. I have used WinX Ripper to archive the series (each season fits nicely onto its own single-layer BD-R disc in ISO form) so that if/when a disc becomes unreadable I can burn a copy onto a quality Verbatim disc that my player can actually read.As far as the packaging, I've seen lots worse (can anyone say 'Battlestar Galactica'?) I'll buy some nice sleeves for the discs and call it good.So HBO cheaped out on this one to make a buck. As Omar would say, you been played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Series","review":"The Wire is amazing. Season 2 is a little weak, but Season 3 is fantastic.

DVD Quality is Sub-par","review":"Please note: this review is not geared toward The Wire as a TV show (the show is FANTASTIC).My reason for giving 2 stars is that the DVD quality of this product is VERY poor. All of the discs we have watched so far have digital \\"crackling\\" happening where the picture on the screen gets all pixelated. Beyond being annoying it disrupts the viewing of the TV show.Buyer beware. You might want to pay more and buy directly from HBO...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series, dont buy this Complete Set","review":"This is a great series. One of the best of all TV. Right behind The Shield for me.My one problem comes with packaging itself. It's beyond awful. The discs are placed in baggies and as a result the discs are prone to scratching(Lost 3 seasons because of it.)Here's my advice, watch the series, but get the seasons individually. AVOID THE COMPLETE SET AT ALL COST."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Television Drama Ever Marred by Poor Packaging","review":"Bear in mind, this review may only apply to the 2008 version of this box set. A new version (seen here: [...]) has been released but I cannot speak to its packaging quality.As many have already noted, the packaging for this box set is rather poor and can result DVDs being shuffled and scratched during shipping. Of the 23 discs included, one of them was scratched deeply enough to affect playback for one episode. Thankfully, placing the DVD in my computer's DVD drive (presumably, a more competent and sophisticated drive than my PS2) alleviated the macro-blocking and freezing.But with that said, The Wire is the greatest television drama I have ever seen. The character development, pacing and the depth to which it explores difficult themes are remarkable. I cannot recommend this show highly enough. After the first 4 or 5 episodes of Season 1, you will be hooked (not unlike many of the wretched junkies flooding the streets of Baltimore)."},{"rating":"2","title":"wasnt all the way happy but it will do","review":"i ordered the wire the complete series after watching a couple episodes and was immediately hooked, it arrived couldnt wait to get a marathon going, but my viewing pleasure was interrupted by dvd that would skip or not all the way work, i watched what i could but luckily i could catch the other episodes some where else was going to send it back but decided to keep it the seller gave me a partial refund and i was ok with that... not sure why the episode skipped also the disc looked good could be when they were makinng the dvd set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"This is simply the smartest, most socially observant show I've ever seen. Ignore the detractors; The Wire assumes a high level of intelligence of its viewers (unlike almost every other television show available). It is worth buying the entire series.

Season 1 was perfect and just as great as I remembered. Season 2 and 3 I can't watch because of severe skipping and pixelation. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wire series","review":"A brilliant, thoughtful look at the inner workings of a city in decline. The series tells the story of Baltimore in the post industrial age in a very well rounded, multi-systemic manner. This is not a cops and robbers show, although both are the grounding for the delicately woven tale of how the current system fails everyone it hopes to serve, on many levels. This is a thinking man's show. Be prepared to have your assumptions challenged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't turn away for even a second!","review":"This series plays with the depth of an engrossing novel, with a very realistic visual execution. The series relies on character development and a plot that is so unpredictable that you simply can't turn away for even a second. What's amazing is that it manages to do all of this without the crutch of music or any fancy special effects.A word of caution though: you must start at the beginning of the series or you will never pick up the story.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most realistic show you're ever going to see.","review":"The Wire is probably the most unflinching docu-drama I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Each point of view is presented mostly unbiased and unromanticized. This show will not only make you think, but also appreciate your own struggle or lack thereof. For me it made me just a little more aware of the real war going on right across from our nation's capital."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb series","review":"The Wire was a very well done series and we recommend it to viewers who enjoyed the Homicide or Law and Order series. The Wire boxed set was a surprise gift to my spouse, and HE LOVED IT! We had missed several of the episodes when The Wire was on HBO, and viewing the box set filled in a lot of blanks. There have been two The Wire marathons (over the course of 2-4 weeks) in our home since the box set arrived! With each viewing we learned something new about the well-developed characters/story and the information sparked meaningful conversations about real life issues. While the series is based in Baltimore, the story could have been similiar in any U.S. city with a port, police force, inner-city school system, newspaper. Purchasing this series is well worth your entertainment dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wire","review":"This is one of if not the greatest series on TV.

I saw where I could have gotten for much less. i also saw that Target had it after all this time Target never had the Wire now all of a sudden the have the full complete series for $65.00.Well anywho....

The topic covered in the 5 season include the dru issue, the education issues, the police dept. and the city administration. David Simon is brillant in his interweaving of the strong political issues that are identical in ALL of them.I highly recommend the whole series and the extra footage makes it all \\"come to life\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift !","review":"I was very pleased with the item.

I tried to teach Comp. Architecture to a senior level BS class (in CS) from this book. The problem is that this book attempts to do too much and it wanders all over the subject area, leaving the students lost since they just cannot grasp the \\"big picture\\". This book gets progressively worse with every new edition! I had to extensively edit the contents to prepare lecture notes which could be comprehended. Halfway through the semester, when I came to the part on \\"microprogrammed control\\", I gave up and switched to Tanenbaum (Structured Comp Organization) instead. I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me about a better book on this subject. All the ones that I have looked at seem to be terrible in one way or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introductory book on computer structure & architecture","review":"Mano's book served as the main text for 2 courses I've taken this year (I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student). The book is quite informative. The chapter dealing with the basic computer (chap. 5) and the one dealing with assembly for this computer (chap. 6) are especially good. These chapters are full of details, and let you understand how a real computer works. The chapter about microprogramming is also good. The chapters about the CPU, I/O, computer memory and pipeline are less detailed, but give you a general feeling of how things work. Generally speaking, the book is very good, although it is not perfect; mistakes do pop up here and there, although they are not major. I hope a new edition will come out soon, because some of the material seems to be outdated (the estimated computation times used, for example, are just too slow -- one joked calling them mano seconds instead of nano seconds :))."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution! This book could hurt your academic career","review":"As a student with an perfect record (GPA:4.0)with but a single class to go until graduation, I felt so uncomfortable with this text that I dropped the course. The meandering and lack of technical elaboration was frustrating and confusing. I felt it a shame that any University would approve such garbage. It is enough to make one curious about whether money is being exchanged under the table between the book publishers and schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST Book I've ever seen...","review":"This is the worst book out there in computer hardware or architecture. The bad part about it is that it cost more than a good book. Computer Organization: Hardware and Software Interface is 80 dollars.

Don't waste your money or time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of data with no explanation.","review":"I am taking a Computer Science course and I had to buy this book.

It may be good for a teacher but is completely useless for a student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for undergrads","review":"This was the required textbook for my 300-level CIS course, and I found it to be highly disappointing.The initial few chapters are manageable, albeit extremely dry reading. Subsequent chapters offer a frustrating paradox: they seem to overload the reader with details, and yet not enough explanatory detail of the aforementioned details for reader comprehension. It suffers mostly from \\"stating\\" information instead of \\"explaining\\" it.This book is (perhaps) best suited as a general review text for people already in the know, although it may not even be appropriate for that task. Difficult to read, not enough examples/explanatory detail, unimaginative illustrations...all-in-all an inexplicable choice for an undergraduate textbook, and certainly offers help to neither professor nor student."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree With Hurwitz.","review":"Beethoven's 3rd Symphony happens to be my favorite piece of classical music. I bought this recording because I had heard rave reviews about Levine's work, but I am disappointed with this rendition of the 3rd.

I love this author, this series, and the this latest book just proves that Ms. Harris is an accomplished storyteller.Sookie is a wonderful character that I found myself rooting for throughout the book, her down to earth personality, and folksy wisdom make for a charming heroine. Her love life remains an interest without becoming the focus of the book, and the innovative vampire/were world just keeps getting better. Don't start this book if you have to go to work(or to sleep)...I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing :(","review":"i found this book sorely disappointing. The first four books were great, and then after that...the series seems to be going downhill. in this novel, there's too many things going on at once, too many characters running around. Especially new ones. Harris' established characters aren't involved in the storyline in any meaningful way, they just pop up here and there. She might as well not have written them in at all. I miss those characters, especially Eric and Bill. Those vamps were the reason i got into the series in the first place. With this book i found myself wholly uninterested in the plethora of new characters and was in anticipation of even a small cameo appearance of the established ones. I couldn't get into the story either...it just draaaaaged. And there were too many subplots. Plus, the ending was kinda disappointing too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing for years, still can catch up...","review":"I started reading this series when it first came out, and stopped (because of sheer volume of reading material at hand).A friend gave me this book the other day, knowing I had read some of the earlier books. First off, let me state, if you haven't read at least 2 or 3 of the earlier books, you will be LOST in this book. However, if you do have the basics of what's happened in the past, then...this book is just great. Fast paced, characters that grab at you, from first scene to last. Sookie is one of the most sympathetic series leads I've ever read, and she continues to be so. She's no superwoman, yet she holds her own amongst the monsters. This plot is very complex, and there's so much going on, that the book keeps you from page one.IF YOU'VE READ OTHER SOOKIE BOOKS this is a great summer read.(*)>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant get enought of Charlaine Harris","review":"She's captavating.

Mind candy for the person who enjoys a little fantasy in their lives. Charlaine Harris has the reader believing that vampires are people too, or at least they used to be, and in 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' style she brings some wit and wisdom to bare as we follow the barmaid who is 'stacked' on her adventures. The novels for the most part take place in Bon Temps; a southern community with a cast of memorable characters. And characters they are. These novels are a hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sookie Stackhouse Saga","review":"If you are looking for a highly addictive, great series of books, then this is it! These books from Charlaine Harris will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book was pretty good. I have read the almost the entire Sookie Stackhouse series, and have enjoyed the storyline in most. Some of it is a little redundant and although I understand that the repeat parts of the book are to remind one of what they previously read and also not to turn someone away who picked up this book by accident not knowing that it was in the middle of a series but it does get tiring. Also Charlaine Harris has great storylines but in my personal opinion is not a fantastic writer. She does not capture your attention like J.K. Rowling or Stephanie Meyer. But still a good book if you just pay attention to the storyline and not the writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Enjoyable, Although Not My Favorite in the Series","review":"Charlaine Harris returns to the world of the dead courtesy of the ever charming Sookie Sackhouse. Once again, Sukie is up to her elbows in vampires, werewolves, and shapeshifters who'd like to get to know her better, and a few more that would like to see her dead. Although still quite fun to read, I found myself missing Vampire Eric, whose involvement in the book is nearly a cameo. Can't wait to see the HBO series that's being developed around the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"sookie's back!","review":"Another great addition to the Sookie Stackhouse series from Harris.

Her love life is a mess, people are being murdered in her yard and Sookie has to go to New Orleans as she has inherited her Cousin Hadley's estate. This isn't easy as Hadley was consort to the vampire Queen of New Orleans and not everyone wants her there.I love this series. DEFINITELY DEAD, to me, was a really good story, and one that let Sookie grow and mature. The humor was there, as was the tension and suspense. But in this book, Sookie experienced emotional hurt and passion, both of I believed and felt. I did feel I was missing some information and learned some of the characters had been introduced in a short story. Even so, it didn't take away from the books strengths. The bigger problem for me is that I have to wait another year for the next book. For those who are fans of this genre, I highly recommend it, but start with the first book and read them in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely dead","review":"Five stars!!!!

Lead character Sookie Stackhouse is funny, poignant, intelligent, and just about everything else a lead character / heroine should or could be.#6 in the series is a page-turner, perhaps more so than any of those previous to it, and it was not only a good read, but entertaining.

Her characters are ones that I find have \\"personality\\" or at least developed some over the series.However, this book was just plain boring. The story didn't go anywhere at all. The whole missing braclet -- she didn't explain to the reader what was going on when she found it -- she told Quinn but we couldn't read about it for 40 more pages until she went to the reception. I found the whole vampire reception confusing. More back story should have been provided.I believe that even the author felt that this wasn't the best -- the last paragraph of the book sums up all the untold plots and story lines that were not covered.And, the very last page of the book encourages us to read something else for a change of pace. Perhaps this author is just burned out on these characters.If you are on the fence, don't even bother reading this one in the series. You missed nothing of any importance in Sookie's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I AM A BIG FAN OF THIS SERIES AND HAVE READ THE BOOKS TWICE...ALL BUT THIS ONE.

I didn't either. But, as with most things in life, I took it on faith that Harris was speaking the truth even though I couldn't remember some of the details. I'm not super crazy about all of the political implications and the kings and queens, etc. I really don't care about who needs to show deference to whom. Maybe I'm just too American. I get the feeling that Sookie feels the same about the whole thing, so we're on the same page. I do like that Sookie starts to stand on her own in this book. She's trying to make smarter choices.

I too thought I started the wrong book because so much was missing. After reading other reviews I found that there is some other story floating around out there that explains things. How stupid. My BIG pet peeve is that the author keeps giving background info on everyone and everything like we never read the first 5 books. I have been waiting for Eric or any vampire for that matter. Its all shifters and wolves. I want to read about the vamps. I find myself paging through not really reading just trying to finish it.

There are too many conflicts within this story for this to seem plausible. Dumping Bill for Eric, dumping Eric for ???? - not working.For the first 7 - maybe 8 books - the storyline was easy to follow, a lot of fun to read, the characters were realistic enough so that you \\"kind of expected to see them walking about\\" in your own neighborhood. The last two books have seemed like a \\"dash for cash\\" a type of capitalizing on the popularity of the characters and story.I do hope that Ms. Harris has a serious - make that a very intense - meeting with her editor and publicist to clearly organize a logical PLAN for the Sookie Stackhouse Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have reached Sookie burn out...","review":"I've been working on finishing this book for months now.

With each book I basically got more and more disappointed. And I guess book 6 has done it in for me. Still not sure if I will even finish it.

I've read books about individual players and most authors will let you live those players lives through events they faced over a period of years. This book is just way short on actual events. i.e. \\"Darryl's AA coach too easily looked the other way while Darryl failed to give 100%. They were awed by Darry'l potential etc.\\" I'd much rather hear about an actual game where Darryl failed to cut a ball off in the gap resulting in extra base hits and the following the game went out slept w/ X, Y and Z and did Q drugs.Not a terrible book, just very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although you get 3 CD's, this is overall a lackluster package.

As with any anthology film, it's a total mixed bag and the framing story ends up making no sense, but overall I enjoyed the experience. I also have to give props to a low-budget film that exhibits good old-fashioned indie ingenuity. There are some truly creative visual gags and old school practical effects on display.

The first and last films were pretty decent, though I could've done without the nudity in the first one (it was skating a fine line between horror and porn, mostly on the porn side). You don't need to show tits to make a horror movie, really, you don't. The one about the Skype convos was OK, it had some freaky parts, and a unique way of presenting the story. The 2nd honeymoon was a waste of film and time - completely worthless. The one in the woods was likewise worth skipping. The last film was pretty freaky though, and interesting. This could've been so much more with better filmmakers. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome idea, poor execution","review":"Great idea to have a collection of creepy stories seen through found footage.

The problem is whereas creepshow the stories actually had a full story. With these you fill like you only catch parts and there is no conclusion. Your just left going \\"What? Why?

I will admit, I can overlook most flaws with anthology's, but the main glaring one with this one is who took these segments that would have all been filmed on modern technology and spent the time to transfer them to an older film medium. I know this is nitpicking, but it seemed like an odd choice for the filmmaker to make.Segment wise, there were high points and low points (as there are with even the best anthology films), but the ones that were good really stuck with me and left me thinking about them almost a week later.This film is defenitely worth a watch, if you can ignore the flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time and money.","review":"I am a big fan of paranormal activity and the \\"reality horror\\" genre in general.

It's true, the stories within the story are slightly more interesting than the typical horror trope, but none of the stories make any sense or offer any real suspense or scares. No explanation is ever given for any of the stories individually or the overarching plot - in fact, I'd say the film makers seem to be taking advantage of the format of telling lots of short stories to keep from having to write motive for any of them.I wouldn't pay to rent it. If you want to watch it, grab it when it's on Netflix or borrow it from a friend.

Just a lot more low budget than that show was obviously.There is one story with a killer in the woods who kind of reminds me of Jason.

The tie together the body of text pretty well. I'm not any kind of engineer or photographer, so when the included visual aids bring the words to life like this, it makes the reading time valuable.What I really wanted was an all-encompasing text reference of our home planetary family.

It can also stand alone more than probably any of the other books, since the Pevensie children and schoolmates are only peripherally involved.Basically it is the Prince and the Pauper set in Narnia, with the pleasant undergirding of theological allegory giving it a sense of eternal significance. It has the usual Narnian talking animals, in fact two talking horses, Bree and Hwin fleeing Tarkanian captivity are the most significant characters after the boy (of the Horse and His Boy).

Eventhough in his past two novels, C.S. Lewis made me root for the heroes and had me so involved with the stroy I actually felt I was there in Narnia, this time he missed his mark. Shasta is trying to find out who he is. He travels to Narnia. Once in Narnia I thought the stroy would pick up and entertain me, unfortunately it did not. The only reason why I actually finished the book instead of abandoning it was the hope the story would improve.

From the squalor of Shasta's house to the plush luxury of the palaces of Tashbaan to the blinding desert to the beautiful sparkling land of Narnia this dramatization brings it all alive, and contrary to another reviewer, I do not think it presents a false or pernicious view of Islamic peoples (on the contrary, based on a reference from \\"The Last Battle\\" Lewis must have been much more tolerant than many people I know). The Tashbaan settings and people do give an impression of Oriental lushness in a colorful way and one must remember that this is a purely imaginary realm.The acting is superb (notably by the horses and the two children and the \\"real\\" prince-listen for his voice as Digory in \\"The Magician's Nephew\\"), and the sound and music are perfect.

They are clearly meant to represent Muslims, and C.S. Lewis denigrates every aspect of their lives: their food is terrible, their clothes are silly, they have no sense of humor, and their dark skin is not as attractive as the light skin of the Archenlanders and Narnians. It's a shame that Lewis is apparently unable or unwilling to write his Christian parable without putting down other races and faiths.

Ritter and family are on vacation when they are conned, kidnapped, robbed and terrorized. With Eric Roberts as a villain it sounds like it would be good. Unfortunately Roberts isn't as intense as he was in The Specialist. What's even worse is instead of being scary they make him talk with a twirpy voice that gets obnoxious really fast. What were they thinking? John Ritter is good as always but there isn't much for him to work with. It would've been nice to see him get more revenge than he does in this movie. The premise of is very similar to the far superior Kurt Russell movie Breakdown which I recommend checking out instead.

Keep in mind it's a low-budget direct-to-video movie and you get just what you would expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thrills in this thriller","review":"This movie was just plain bad. It's amazing how far Eric Roberts sank with this film, it is amazing he was ever considered Oscar worthy. The late John Ritter was a good comedic actor but drama was not his thing.

As far as Tripfall goes, Ritter and Hunter are a married couple on vacation who are abducted by Roberts, who is now type cast as the late night cinemax bad guy. The scheme is to force Ritter to withdrawl cash from the bank and well.....that is it. If you are a fan of any of the leads in this film I would not even recommend renting this. It will only lower your opinion of them. On a side note the extra's on the dvd include a trailer. It is hard for me to imagine this made it to theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRIPFALL","review":"ERIC ROBERTS AGAIN OUT DID HIMSELF IN THIS MOVIE.I WATCHED IT ON A PAID MOVIE SITE AND LIKE IT SO MUCH I HAD TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION.

I since bought three versions played by Pollini, Arthur Rubinstein, and Wihelm Kempff.

I tried to like the movie while I was watching it I really did but it just didn't seem to stick. The only reason I really even did watch it was because Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman were in it they are a couple of my favorite actors but this movie seemed like a train wreck until the very end it just got more and more pointless and dumb. The graphics were good however when they came out with a video game I thought that was a good way to go but to sit there and watch the movie was like torture I was with someone who actually liked it so I had to watch it from start to finish. If you think you might not like the movie don't bother to pick it up you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really??","review":"Dumb. Lack of decent plot.

On top of a ridiculous plot, a miscast lead, and a phoned-in Angelina Jolie, I would nominate this film for a Razzie. Don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"Pretty forgettable movie.

Yeah right your heart would give out if you had it beating that much. That's why people are supposed to have slow heart rates. Also you cant jump through glass 40 feet onto another building.

It bit off of Empire Strikes Back (Luke I'm your father), and it bit off of every other crappy action movie that was written by some fan boy. What I mean by that is this. Ok, you are a nerd. You are a geek who hates who he is and hates his life. Everybody picks on you and you are an outcast. But guess what?! Secretly you have super powers! Or you are a super assassin! Or you are really a cool guy! And now you get to live your fan boy wet dream. How many times can they do this same concept. The action was also just ridiculously over the top to the point of being stupid.

But, it failed. The story is almost good, but it seemed that the people behind this film wanted to focus more on ridiculous special effects and stunts. I had only slight attachment to any of the characters and didn't care for the special effects (too over the top).

Good special effects and all. Even the ending almost had me as if I might be watching an original theme/plot. However at the very end it comes up with the most lame ending of all. The main character says \\"I was once like you, pathetic..\\" or something close to that. First of all, since when do regular people need to become assassins? It makes it sound as if being a mother, father, policeman, doctor, sound bad. He already has a special gift that 99.9 percent of the rest of the world doesn't have. Second, the laws of gravity makes it impossible to send a bullet travelling at high speeds to spin into a complete circle?!?! FART!!!!Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor. I don't know how he got into this POS movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Lived up to my expectations!","review":"I actually rented this movie before I purchased it and it went above and beyond what I thought it would be. There was plenty of action, cool effects and the story wasn't too bad. If you want some serious acting and drama there are many other movies that James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman have starred in, check those out instead.Overall I had to give it 5 stars, simply because it was entertaining and I ended up having to buy it. Wasn't as predictable as most action movies are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted a great action flick with amazing stunts","review":"Wanted is a great action flick with amazing stunts. The plotline is pretty simple man is bored with his regular life, finds out his father died the gets dragged into a world he never thought was possible to kill the man who killed his father.

Only he finds out the truth and must make a choice to run away or kill them all and \\"let fate sort it all out.\\"I like the ending \\"this is me taking back control of my life...what have you done lately.\\" So if your looking for a great action flick with great stunts, and lots of fight scenes with guns, knives, and things blowing up then you will love this style of movie.

Unless you are a teenager don't waste your money renting it, rent something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"My biggest beef with this story was that Angelina Jolie got top billing and as far as I'm concerned, she was just a secondary character. I guess her status gets her top billing even if she has a three-second walk-on. She has a substantial part, no doubt, but James McAvoy is the real star here, and he did a pretty decent job.The story was certainly not what I expected! I thought it was going to be a conventional cops-chasing-the-bad guy type of thing, but instead it was about super assassins, with Matrix-like super powers. That being said, the movie was a lot of fun.Though I like Angelina Jolie, I don't like the fact she got top billing while the real star of this movie was tucked in there behind her name. This is the nature of marketing and show business, I guess. Overall, still a good movie and a great vehicle for James McAvoy. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy it.","review":"I love Angelina Jolie as an actress, so I was rather excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, it bored me so much I found that I was tuning out most of it, and I even dozed off at one point. The characters were all thoroughly unlikable, the plot was nonexistent, the dialogue was uninspired, and the action was very difficult to distinguish at times. The only time I remember looking up was when Angelina stepped out of the bath. I have to say, this is one of the worst \\"action\\" films I have seen in a long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time, Talent, and Action","review":"Wanted is a Matrix rip-off without a decent plot or any redeeming qualities other than high octane action, great special effects, and Angelina Jolie. If that's what you are looking for, this is for you.The plot - a wimpy nerd finds out his father was an assassin with special powers is whisked away by the fraternity of assassins his father belonged to, and trained to be an assassin himself. And eventually go after the guy that killed his dad.Basically this is just a thin plot for action sequences and Angelina Jolie to show off her assets (literally in one scene).But the plot is so bad and the acting so mundane that for me it took away from being able to enjoy the movie. It was a wasted two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Script looks contrived, uninteresting. James McAvoy used to have a peculiar nice voice. That is missing in this movie; may be he tried American accent and its bad. He looks like a fool. Angelina just cashed on her looks. \\"Look at me, I am beautiful\\" attitude. She did not act at all.

What a waste of time. The only reason you might want to see this movie is for the action scenes. And they are not event that good, they simply don't work, everything is predictable, looks fake, and way to stupid to make any sense. You can picture the guys on their CGI station \\"hey, let's drop a train from the sky, yeah, that's a good one!\\". Well, in a way, I must say that I started to laugh about halfway through, so maybe it wasn't that bad. Still I am glad this is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"While the idea of this movie was pretty good, the execution was poor.

I assume that's what I'm getting anytime I rent an action movie based on a graphic novel. So I set my sights low. And I'm pretty good at suspending disbelief. \\"Wanted\\" however, demands that one not only suspend disbelief, but expel it permanently.

I'm sure it plays better to those who know the comic book this was based on, but for those of us who don't have a clue about the comic; this film will bore you at times. The good news is the second half is better than the first and it does have the beautiful Angelina Jolie in it.Some will like this film more than others as you can see by the wide range of reviews on this site. It's not completely horrible, but I won't be watching this a second time any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just good fun!","review":"If you are looking for a movie that is entertaining, and has great matrixy special effects....you've found it. If you are looking for an oscar winning movie this is not for you. I do not go to the movies for realism..I live that every day.

It is not for all audiences since it has too much fiction, if you liked Matrix, you are on the right way. (not comparing of course)*The set, well it comes with some cool thing, first of all the solid package with a bullet in the middle, loved it! The cards and all are not that amazing, and the target where the Blu ray is placed is a little cheap.The best of all is the 3D film cell...just \\"amazing\\"! For this is the whole set worth it, besides the price can't be better.So if you haven't seen the film, you like Action and Angelina Jolie, just buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action Movie with Twist.","review":"Not a great movie but an entertaining action movie. Recommended and worth seeing if you like action and special effects. Again nobody gives a great performance but overall the acting was acceptable. If you are looking for realism or a strong plot then probably not for you.I looked at some of the negative reviews and obviously some people missed the point of this movie. The point is entertainment! This movie is based on a comic book! It is not a documentary! One reviewer was looking for \\"genuine emotion\\"?

But as soon as it started I was very uncomfortable. I am glad I didn't let my daughter watch this....since it starts out with a very explicit sex scene and language that I can do without. Did they have to use the language with every sentence? Was the sex scenes really necessary? The story line was awesome with the betrayal and twist, but would have been so much better without the language and sex.ANgelina was awesome in her performance as always. At least she didn't disappoint me as the others did. I wish that the producers and writers could understand that movies can be made and still be successful without all the sex and language.

You are helping lots of people around the world with your humanatarian efforts, but hurting just as many (actually many more) with your acting ability.

So please go help the thousands you do help with your outside movies work, and help the millions who love movies and stop once and for all. PS, I have now seen a bunch of your movies, and would request you send me a refund.

Office drone is plucked from his cubical cell life by a hot chick who drives almost as well as she shoots. African-American leader speaks in riddles and sends our reluctant hero into battle. Lots of killing without consequence. Lots of violent eye candy. Awakenings, betrayals, redemption. And wire work in place of a plot.

She is a wonderful actress & I have watched some of her earlier stuff, she deserves all the credit in the world as far as I'm concerned, she started out good & now is excellent. The action in it was wonderfully done. Angie's counterpart, the young man that she trains, has good potential, haven't seen him before now, of course having Morgan Freeman in it along with Angelina Jolie, made it a REALLY EXCELLENT MOVIE for me, ...\\"curve the bullet...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"good addition to my Blu ray collection","review":"Like I said, good.

I give it 4 stars because it could have a better story content."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked parts of it.","review":"\\"Wanted\\" was a movie that I really wanted to see last summer, but didn't get around to it. When I finally got the DVD last week, I was really excited to watch it. Then I snuggled down with my wife to watch it, she had me turn it off after a few minutes, so there are some down sides. First, the laguage is terrible. Second, there is some absolutely meaningless to the storyline sex scenes that we could have done without. Third, (and this is what I expected to be the only downside) it was a long way past being farfetched and silly, but I didn't mind that.So what did I like? When the story got going (when I watched the movie later) it was a lot of fun and the effects and stunts were very cool and exciting. The plotline, while silly, was interesting after the hero was finally ready to accept his destiny. And; of course... A.J. is always so amazing to look at, that believable comes in a far distant concern.3&*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"The guy who plays the lead is not the most likely suspect to be an action hero, however he does pull it of and well I might add.

I did not like how the plot was unfolding, and the acting seemed subpar. However, this flick made a huge comeback at around the 30 minute mark. Angelina Jolie gives one of her best performances, and the main character suddenly begins to become an awesome actor. The plot suddenly gets interesting, and you will want to watch it again as soon as the movie finishes. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun couple of hours.

If you want a main character to root for, not so much.Wanted has the kernel of a good movie in it. Unfortunately, the main actor just can't pull it off, and Morgan Freeman just doesn't do that much in the movie.However, Angelina Jolie is quite good. Remake the movie, make her the main character, and Wanted would be much better. Jolie's Final scene is perfect for her character. Unfortunately, the finale continues from them. Still not quite clear on what the point of the last line.

I like the action of the movie and 2. I think it's stupid. For me, despite some funny ideas and decent action (I liked the train scene close to the end), the movie certainly fits into the second category. Because there is just too much stuff going on where I didn't want to follow (mild spoilers ahead): the main characters believe that fate is written in a loom, bullets can fly in circles, some men can accelerate to 200 m/h by foot and slow down their subjective time but don't see crosshairs on the floor, etc., etc.My suggestion: save your time and money for better superhero movies like Spiderman, Batman, The Incredible Hulk, X-Men, etc., etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tr��s tr��s bon collector =D","review":"Arriver avec une quinzaine de jours d'avance.

If this movie held your interest then I hope you are under the age of 14, and consequently restricted from seeing anything but the previews.

It did clean capets but once turned off it would leak dirty water onto the surface it was resting on. I had to make sure I put it on the hardwood when I was done. I was trying to clean it out because it wasn't sucking as well as it used to. When I went to put it back together,I couldnt get everything to line up. We took it to a local repair facility and was told it needed a new housing, belts and labor for a mear $112. It is a gigantic waste of money and will be thrown out for a third time.

I wish I had read the reviews first. It is cumbersome to use and to change any parts. It worked very briefly but it no longer sprays water, yet the brush rotates. However, the hand attachments do spray. I now have to attempt to check the belt, since that may be one of the problems (according to the instruction leaflet) that is not making it spray. If the belt is fine, I am not going to bother to try and have it repaired. Not worth my time and aggravation. Just will research other cleaners.

It also brushed a handful of pet hair out of the carpet fibers that my Hoover never even picked up. I beleive that the roller brush instead of the round spin brush made the difference! Also, I was reading through the reviews and I was wondering why nobody bothers getting an extended warranty on such an investment. I bought all of my steam vacs at another retailer and purchased a 4 year extended warranty with them.

It was wonderful.Remember, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well on mildly soiled carpets...before it breaks...","review":"I've used this machine three times in the year and a half I've had it. Although this machine worked well on cleaning overall, I still had to work by hand on higher traffic areas. It is heavy and sometimes difficult to maneuver for me. It certainly still beats a rentable version, or paying a professional carpet cleaner if your carpets aren't heavily soiled. Unfortunately, shortly after its first year of use, I went to turn it on and it would no longer spray detergent. My boyfriend is someone I would consider quite handy, and he has taken it apart twice finding nothing visibly wrong or repairable to fix the problem. I would not consider this product a reliable investment unless you're willing to buy a new one every couple of years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not clean as well as it should","review":"I bought this product to keep up with a dog and a three year old. We had bought new carpeting about a year ago and we thought that this would be a good insvestment. The first time I tried it, I like it because it seem to clean well and consistently.However, when the carpet cleaned I saw streaks of dirt here and there. And now when I use it I have to make sure that I go three or four times over the same spot at different angels because it just doens't clean well.I might have a defective machine since it DOESN'T spray the solution evently. I have tried cleaning it but it still gives me the same problems.Do yourself a favor and go rent a machine instead of buying this machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy","review":"I originally had a Hoover, that was great - lasted about 7 years. I only had this Bissell for about 9 mos and the motor now has to be replaced. Unfortunately, I never registered my vacuum so I have no warranty info. Also, we found this vacuum was extremely loud compared to the one I had before. I did not have problems with leaking, however, I have to agree with another reviewer - that the dirty water canister is very difficult to clean compared to other machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete piece of junk","review":"This machine worked great when I first bought it. After five uses, it would no longer shoot out water or suck it back up. The belt broke several times. I clean houses for a living and it died on me and I had to rent a cleaner from a nearby store. Complete waste of $. Nowhere near me even sells the parts to fix it and I have to buy them directly from the manufacturer. Can we say 'scam artists'? Buyer Beware. Don't say that I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had this cleaner for 18 months. In the beggining I was so impressed with how well it cleaned. Then it started to not pick up all the water,my carpets remained wet for over 24 hours. then it didn't spray the water and shampoo out of the main sweeper, just the cleaning tool. Took it to a repair shop, they said that the pump was broken, and also the heater. It would cost more than $200 to fix. If I would have read the other reviews of this product I would not have purchased it from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough For Such A Big Price","review":"I bought this product last year. I've used it about eleven times. It looked like it picked up tons of dirty water but the stains still were visible.DON'T BUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this machine","review":"Like other reviewers mentioned----it will work great in the beginning, but soon it will be nothing but a repair project and a hassle.3 Tanks replaced, leaking water from everywhere, no suction, doesn't clean the carpet and just soaks it in water.We brought it to a repair shop to replace some parts ( seals and suction thingy).70$ later and it broke down 2 cleanings later. As for the suction: the repairman told me that it won't get any better.Calling the service was a waste of time, because they ask you to check a bunch of things on the cleaner ,only to tell you to bring it to a repair shop.It's sitting in the corner now, since it leaks water from somewhere and will be trashed soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice","review":"At first, this product seemed great. I used it on a rental property and it did a magnificent job. In actuality, I think the carpet was cleaner than when a professional did it. (A professional just goes over everything VERY quickly).The problem is, it is now just a very big, heavy, weak shop-vac. It stopped spraying out water and detergent after a very short time. I tried manually spraying the carpet in front of the machine and using the machine to pick up the water, but what a waste of time. I will never buy one again. It has been extremely frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for spot cleaning not for cleaning entire rooms","review":"I have only had great results when using the floor tool. When I try to clean entire rooms, it looks as if nothing was cleaned. The floor tool constantly falls off the hook when using it for floors and the solution mixer says I run out of solution when it's full, leading me to believe the solution doesn't even get mixed in with the water when doing floor cleaning. The hand tool works fine and that's all I can use it for now. Every time I shut the machine off, loads of water leaks from under the machine so I have to make sure it's off the carpet before shutting it off. Next time I will buy the little green machine or spot lifter instead and rent the Rug Doctor when I need to clean the entire room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleans great IF you can get it to work-","review":"Piece of Junk, Bissell customer service is even worse than there macbines. Go for the hoover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk - works short term only","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I'd rate this steamer as a short-term wonder only. Works great at first then won't mix the solution or won't dispense the water after a few uses. Motor burned out on mine after a little over a year. Used maybe 12 times, mostly on small stain clean ups. Hoover customer service is no help and they are indeed aware this model is a lemon. Don't buy it- go for the Hoover that's in the same price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes dangerous fumes to small children","review":"This carpet cleaner causes horrible fumes. It uses extremely too much cleaning solution. I had to open all the windows and doors to rid the house of the toxic odor. I have a small child and the fumes had him gagging. To make matters worse, it didn't even clean the carpet. Big disappointment, I am returning it to the store today and buying the Hoover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Does not have the lifting power of a hoover. Although it sound nice to have the seperate thing for soap it causes more work as you are constantly refilling both compartments. The heater is not much of a heater. But the biggest issue is the tendency to break. I've had mine for less than a year and have had to replace both a belt and a pump. It is now broken again. It's just not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This machine definitely has a reliability problem. Have had to replace many parts and now it won't mix the solution with the water. No part available for this problem. Do not purchase this machine, you'll be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I bought this machine and it cleans great but the water tank LEAKS BAD!!! I took it back and exchanged it for another one thinking that it was just that machine. The second and the third one both leaked in the same place. Needless to say I don't plan on buying anything else with the word bissell on it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dispoable junk","review":"used only one time, cleaned ok but next time wouldnt pick up solution from carpet.worse yet- nobody can repair these( in or out of warranty). all repair shops said \\"dont bother\\" as its really a \\"disposable\\" item . as someone else said, I'll never buy another bissell product. How about a zero star rating?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this item","review":"The first time I used this item the pump belt busted. I replaced the water pump belt twice during its first use. After the first use I cleaned the item as recommended. When I went to use it the second time the water and cleaning fluid did not pump out at all. I exchanged the item for another and had the same problem with the second. Cost of item is not worth the frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to rent a cleaner","review":"Just like the person that used it six times, mine worked great the first two times I used it. Since then, disaster!!! Does not push the water out because the tub will not secure in place. Bissell claims it's because the gasket needs cleaned. Did that and still won't work. The reviewer who stated the company knows about the defects is 100% correct. Spoke to 3 different people and all gave the same answer. When I questioned their quick response they denied it's a common problem...RIGHT! I'm waiting to see if they remedy or take a return. Thankfully my VISA company will back me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear of poor quality and design","review":"Bought a Bissel Proheat cleaner. Used it approximately eight times at various locations. A small piece of plastic used as a retainer for the brushes broke. It was impossible to just call bissell and get a replacement part. Instead, they advised to take it to an authorized repair facility, with a minimum charge of $30 to $50. Even after it was repaired, the supply tubing for the water clogged. As of this date I have not been able to make a repair. Unlike other well designed products, e.g. Panasonic vacuum cleaners, which are easily accessible for repair, this large, heavy and cumbersome machine is a waste of money and simply provides additional frustration in your life. Steer clear. I hear the Hoover machines are more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"This cleaner is a joke! When I first turned it on, it didn't work. After checking everything, the belt was not on. The belt came off 5 times before it stayed on. The upholstery hose doesn't work at all. Didn't know that until I had already wet the area. Zero suction, no matter what you do. Very poor job on certain rugs. You cannot get the water suctioned out. I bought a Bissell canister 15 years ago, and still works great, but wanted a new upright. The joke was on me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE-DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"August 11, 2008I purchased my Pro Heat about 5 years ago. I used it shortly after I purchased it and all was fine. This use occured over a single weekend.I pulled out the machine and tried to use it. Sprayer for the floor didn't work. I tried boiling hot water assuming the line was clogged, I tried pressurized air to clear the line...and nothing. In disgust, I took to a repair shop. It costs $30 for an estimate from Vac & Sew company. They just informed me it's about $109 to repair.Wish I had read the reviews for this junk beforehand. DO NOT BUY!I'll be taking a sledge hammer to mine in a ceremony of corporate shame for Bissel."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A PIECE OF CHEAP JUNK!!!","review":"This is one of the biggest pieces of cheap junk that I have ever bought. I'd rate it a 0, but you have to give it at least 1 star. I followed the instructions too the letter. I used it 5 times in a little over a year on my living room (15' x 18') and the hall. Right after the guarantee was up it stopped spaying. I ended up having to pay to have it fixed and the repair man said, \\"he gets 20 to 30 of these in every week to fix for the same thing\\". Now on the seventh time that I am using it the vacuum is going out and will not suck up the water. I've sense know 2 other people that bought one of these and had the same problems. DON'T waste your money on this pieces of cheap junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting a Dirt Devil instead","review":"I am not impressed with this. Sad to say I have only owned it for one year and already, after only a handful of uses, the water is just not sucked up to my satisfaction. The last thing I want is a lot of dirty water sitting still on my carpet. That just makes matters worse than before I cleaned. Also, I find the tank in tank and big pain. I read a lot of reviews on the Dirt Devil Platinum Force and I am going to spring for one for Mother's Day for me! I like the huge tank...I like the fact that tanks are separate...and I like that you can turn off the soap so you can do a once around rinse and vac only so as to get all the soap residue off the carpet. Leaving it on just attracts more dirt. It took me awhile to find one that can just rinse alone, yet soap, with just a push of a button. I am all for ease because like everyone, I am busy, so the less preparation steps, the better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell = BREAKS","review":"This thing breaks, that's all there is to it. What ever you pay for it, plan on paying double for repair bills. It gets clogged up underneath or in the hand tool unit , even when you run clean water through it after using it which is a huge hassel (note bissell also ryhmes with hassel).It cleans but its not worth the trouble. I had a repair man tell me that the dispenser should not be used because that is a defect in the design. You should rather , put the cleaner in the water section.In my opinion the product should be taken off the market with so many bad reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this, waste of hard earned money","review":"I have owned this machine along with two other bissell units, see the pictures I posted. They break,plain and simple. If you think it is worth 200.00 dollars to pay to clean your carpet once then this machine is for you.I think a bad machine should be taken off the market and this Bissell company know's these are crap.BUY A HOOVER YOU WONT REGRET IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after two years","review":"What a flimsy product! Bought this item at B*** B** for about 185 bucks including tax. I have a yellow lab and light hair on the carpet is an issue. I have used this carpet cleaner probably just over ten times, but less than 20 times. It uses lots of water and detergent, and constantly leaves lumps of pet hair on the carpet, which I run around to collect. Quite hard to use, but I was somewhat satisfied with the results.Then it happened last July 2007, the flimsy floor/tool dial's flap broke at the weakest design. The water did not circulate. I opened the top cover, and tried to glue it, but it did not work. Frustrated, I put it away. Yesterday I tried using it, this time handle does not want to lock to stand still. Overall very cheap construction and has quite a bit of design and operation flaws. I am in the market for a new carpet cleaner, but I don't know which brand/model I will go with this time. Oh well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad stuff from a good band","review":"I've been a fan of Jett since Bad Reputation was released; it was the theme song in a a group house I lived in in the '80s and was played about 10 times a day.But this album is awful, and there may be some truth in advertsing issues here. It does not contain her Hit List; it's some really poor covers of some other artists' semi-hits. Sounds like Joan was a contractual bind: album due, no material.You might want to buy this if you have to have everything she's done, but you won't play it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"Well, the CD title says Hit list, and these songs are hits from 70's and 80's. But Joan Jett couldn't deliver any of these hits as good as it should be, on all songs here, her vocals are very lame & weak. Musicianship sucks, I know Blackhearts can play, but here it's just a dissapointment, maybe, this album is the greatest mistake of Joan Jett & B's career. Avoid this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit List?","review":"Very disappointing. I picked this one up expecting a greatest hits compilation but nope that's not what this is. The title is very misleading. If you want Joan's 80's era hits like \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\" don't look here. Check the imports because apparently Joan's label doesn't want her real hits to be available in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off-Key","review":"Following the blast of energy that was UP YOUR ALLEY, most Joan Jett fans were a bit rattled to receive this thing from their idol, a covers-collection done without inspiration. \\"Dirty Deeds\\" proves Jett no longer is in touch with her punky roots(at least the horn section gets cut from the cassette-single mix). \\"Time Has Come Today\\" is very good, the Kinks' \\"Celluloid Heroes\\" is well sung, but the new version of \\"Roadrunner\\" is tired and the Sex Pistols'\\"Pretty Vacant\\" isn't threatening or rebellious--just off-key."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"If Joan Jett knew how bad these sounded, she would have bought the rights to this recording and burned them. Its not even close, and she hardly tries. Better to have left this one as a \\"shower\\" session. Love her other works, am a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan does some covers","review":"Joan Jett is a great performer and this project has all the ingrediants needed to be a winner. Joan is not a great singer, but her attitude shows through and she makes these versions her own. However, her cover of Dirty Deeds is probably the worst I've ever heard. In hundreds of garage bands I've played with, this song always comes up and gets played. Sometimes it sounds good, sometimes it was terrible. But that's a garage band. Joan next time do your homework. For one she leaves out over half the lyrics, and the backup chorus is so weak, it would almost sound better if it wasn't there at all. This version will have Bon Scot spinning in his grave for years. The rest of the album is great though, from CCR to Hendrix. Again except for Dirty Deeds, this would have been a 5 star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"joan and her 'covers'","review":"this is joan jett singing her favorite'cover'songs. but i do not favor any of these songs as great. the AC/DC cover is worth a One-Time listen. besides that you can throw this in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover tunes from one hot chic!","review":"Joan Jett is one hot heavy metal chic covering some awesome tunes.

I know you won't be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wheel Keeps On turning","review":"This album will please old rockers and young ones to. Joan Jett has done it again here.

On this disc the Fresh Sound label has collected recordings from three different broadcasts (one television and two radio) that Buddy made in Hollywood in 1956-57. The personnel changes from date to date but includes west coast veterans like Howard Roberts, Dick Shreve, Eugene Wright and Bill Richmond.

I was also hoping to get a better insinght in the regions past and present, and the book almost failed completely. It's arrogant to call this book \\"memoirs\\" when the writer was barely 35 or 40 (my best guess) when she wrote it.

I think the book is well written from the standpoint that the author leads you to believe for quite a while that there are separate people involved when in reality this lady was clearly a multiple personality; I found myself frustrated by Mr. Goetzke's inability to pick up that fact early on; this is a man who was the head of bank security no less. I found myself angry with the author as I would feel towards a woman who continued to take abuse and stick around for more; because of this I became disenchanted with the book and skimmed the last 100 pages because I frankly became tired of his descriptions of Lauren's multiple villainous characters emerging, while Mr. Goetzke indulged and tried to placate this lunatic.

The Adventure team ranks as the most durable team I have collected. All three are built well, and I have NEVER had a part pop off of them. (For minicons, that is saying something) These three also have moving parts that work well. Ransack has a tow rope that winds, Iceberg waves his shovels, and Dune Runner has his gun swing. All three look cool as vehicles. As robots, Iceberg and Dune Runner look cool and are mobile, but Ransack (the dark green jeep)is rather disappointing. In vehicle mode, fans most know that Iceberg and Dune Runner can move back and forth, but Ransack's tow rope unwinds if you push him forward.If you only get one minicon team period, I recommend this one. These guys are not ones to pop apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun music for the little ones","review":"Owen Duggan has done a fantastic job of compiling various styles of music (jazz, Irish ballads, classic children's songs) into one versatile CD.

To compare this with the brilliantly doomy \\"Holy Mountain\\" would be wickedly cruel, but I have no other choice. Sleep crashed and burned HARD on this one, and it seems obvious to me that their obessive fixation with pot has apparently destroyed every remaining brain cell in the band.Thumbing one's nose at convention is great if you can back it up, but these ridiculously long and moronic riffs are less exciting than watching a band tune their guitars. I don't understand how a band can go from \\"Holy Mountain\\" to this piffle! It is a great tragedy they will have to fight hard to escape, but they won't because they will end up face down in a bag of pot before they ever have a chance to strap on guitars again.

I also noticed this album doesn't have the twang that you would expect from a bluegrass album. Another added bonus is that there's no ear shattering country singing!

I was dumping a lot of clean hot water down the drain. It was nearly impossible to get the carpet shed/fuzz out of the tank because you cannot remove the clean water bladder. I also was not fond of the idea that the brushes did not rotate without the suction.

Since this is the 3rd edition one would have hoped the editors would have glanced at the book since it was written in 2001. The author (an immigrant from India) has a very strong anti developed-world bias. He argues vehemently against carbon trading and offsets, not acknowledging that these mechanisms reduce CO2 buildup. He wants instead, I think, punishment to be meted out to the developed countries for their success and rewards to be given to developing countries for their lack of success. He does not appear to want emission controls on developing countries, but prefers that the developed world gift the developing world with free solar power plants. For a no-nonsense guide, there is too much of this nonsense.I do like the chart on top of page 138 on tips to personally cut emissions (like becoming a vegetarian)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well ....","review":"I read this book with all the best intentions.

I was amazed to find that all four children survived, three of them very well. The book was a page-turner. As I flew through the pages, I continued to be shocked at the behavior of these parents and their common belief that they were acting in the best interest of their family. Their biggest failure as parents was that they did not try to keep their children safe. On the other hand, the parents were both very intelligent and did encourage their kids to read and gave them an appreciation for the arts. But these positive influences on the children were greatly outweighed by the neglect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous example of a child's resilience","review":"This book is beautifully written and a real page turner for me.I marvel at the intelligence of these children and how they survived such a life and came out on top!

The \\"glass castle\\" never materializes. They eventually live in an un-wired/unplumbed West Virginia shack. Although the parents make illogical, family-unfriendly choices throughout, keeping the family in perpetual poverty, with \\"what does not kill you makes you stronger\\" a recurrent theme, Jeannette and her siblings trudge on, and, become very, very strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"My childhood remembered","review":"I grew up poor (not as poor as Jeanette, however).

While much has been made of indomitable spirit, and lessons in survival, the lack of care that this pair showed toward their 4 children is truly appalling. The kids, including the author, manage to survive living in conditions which would get the parents arrested if anyone had been paying attention. How they manage, from a very young age, with no food and rarely any utilities, and at the end, no indoor plumbing, is astounding. The fact that the parents are obviously highly intelligent only adds to the reader's incomprehension. And the fact that the children continue to love these two dispite all, managing to forge contributory, successful adulthoods, is even more staggering."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see it...","review":"I read this book for my book club, and I do not understand why it is so popular.

The story touches on so many important issues but the one that always stood out to me is the issue of poverty in this country and how most of us are completely unaware of it - or we forget it exists. I can no longer open my full refridgerator or feed my baby the wholesome foods I give her without thinking of Jeannette Walls and her siblings and the struggle they had as children to stay nourished.

I did not want it to end.

Jeannette Walls writes so well.She put me in her shoes throughout the book, and what I felt was the younger children's complete trust in the parents and the later turn as the children grew older and the parents' disintegrated. I was so angry at the parents throughout...I couldn't wait to see how the kids would get out, or if they all would survive. It is the power of the three older kids to stick together and pull each other out of the mess their parents had made that is the miracle of the story. It speaks to the toughness of love and family in a way that a more conventional \\"growing up\\" memoir cannot. Bravo to you, Jeannette Walls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Review for Glass Castle","review":"Since it already had such good reviews, I just would like to say, \\"Ditto.\\" The Glass Castle shows real emotion and describes how an alternate lifestyle doesn't have to destroy the spirit.

By the time the children begin growing up and realizing things aren't as adventurous and great as they seem, the author has pulled you into their world, made you care for them, and you find yourself rejoicing in their triumphs, aching with their losses, and hoping beyond hopes that things will start looking up for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"This was a wonderfully written story of a dysfunctional family where that actually worked positively in the end.

I can't say that I liked this book, but at the same time, I could not put it down. I had to get to the end to see how the events of the book affected the main character's current life. However, throughout the reading process, I was frustrated and angry. How could parents like Walls' be so oblivious to the suffering of their children and not do anything about it. Reading this book was an emotional roller coaster- mostly of negative emotions. Through the pitfalls, though, the story was eye-opening to a lifestyle I've had no exposure to (thank goodness). As an educator, it was enlightening to think about the kinds of students that might be sitting in my classroom and the lives they may be trying to run away from.

Growing up in the same time period (circa the 1960's), and seeing some of the same kinds of folk around, was very familiar and a little harrowing - seeing what some of my contemporaries may have been enduring without me ever knowing. I read it as a follow-up to Ms. Walls' Half Broke Horses (a 'real-life novel' as she calls it).

I don't know why I changed my mind, but I so enjoyed this story. I thought it would just be depressing. Though the circumstances of Jeanette Walls' childhood are pathetic, it is told with great humor. She makes you understand why she loved her parents. They were both in their own right brilliant, yet not at all concerned about providing even the basics of a decent upbringing - food, running water, etc. This author was able to escape her parents' life, and overcome her many challenges, but she did so without bitterness, but rather, with an enduring love for all of her family members. Truly remarkable; I don't think I've ever read another book like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many roads lead to success","review":"A memoir told frankly and it seems to back up studies that claim much of our character is determined by our genes and not our environment.

You can escape into another person's world, laugh at their tragedy, identify with it, be happy it's not you. The Glass Castle does not disappoint. It follows the atypical nomadic life of the Walls' family. From their wanderings in the west, Arizona, California, Nevada, sleeping under the stars, roaming from town to town, ending up in the coal mining dilapidated town in West Virginia. The father, Rex, a drunk sad, pitiful, violent, and brilliant all at the same time. The mother, a free spirited artist, who raises her children with an anything goes policy.

I alternated crying and laughing out loud while reading. Rex and Rose Mary Walls were never cut out to be parents, and they did a tremendous amount of damage to the kids, but the positive gifts that Rex gave to his children when he was sober and loving and acting responsible, were things that most kids will never experience in their lives- EVER. I felt jealous of that. I wish them all well, admire them for surviving, and would love to see Rose Mary's art collection! I hope it is made into a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasure doing business","review":"Arrived in record time. Condition of item is better than what was described. A pleasure doing business with this seller"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Books","review":"I led a book discussion group for this book and the consensus was that it was a 'grab you and go for the rough ride.'We noted the influence of reading in Jeannette's life and wondered which specific books had influenced her to deal with her trials - since her parents offered so little direct help.Personally, this book absolutely captured the idealism, denial, and reality of living with addiction and mental illness in a way that many can relate.I would make it a 'must read' for teachers and social workers who can easily overlook the obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me a great gramma!!","review":"I was fortunate enough to meet the author at a function where she was the keynote speaker.

Canteloupes and grapes need refrigeration--where were they keeping those \\"crates\\" of canteloupes. I put it down when they were living in their last little \\"shack\\" out in what appeared to be the middle of nowhere, and mom was painting and sculpting and doing silk screens. Where was she getting those materials??? Maybe I missed some really important pieces of information. I was quite disappointed it it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Glass Castle","review":"This book was recommended to me and I am not even finished with it and I am not real sure that I will.

There are so many better books about overcoming abuse than this. It's a pity party with no redeeming qualities. Pass on this if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud - How can People Belive this?","review":"This book is fiction. How can intelligent people believe that anyone can remember precise details from the age of three. Let's begin with, it is inhuman not to respond to oneself being on fire - this is not how the human being is made. Here the author is 3 years old, remembers her dress and how she was forking those hot dogs while noticing fire ripping up her little dress and then finally letting out a scream. Right. The rest is even more stupid. This book was written as a get-even to an obnoxious, mentally ill and childlike, colossally selfish biologicalThe Glass Castle: A Memoir (Alex Awards (Awards))mother. Even the depiction of the mother as being overly-literate and New Age doesn't ring true. Oh, and all of the kids are geniuses who were able to read and speak like adults at the tender toddler age. Waste of time but I just perused after the initial fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"I got this book and was very disappointed. Although I was sympathetic towards the children, I couldn't help but wondering what was wrong with the parents and why weren't the parents eventually committed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Baloney","review":"I am just amazed as I sit here and read the reviews for this book. I am finding it hard to belive that many of the things in this book really happened. I am sure that they lived in poverty, and things were extremely rough. That the parents were not comventional parents, and that the children were actually more adult and responsible than their parents. That the parents were so immature or had mental illness was very evident. I just felt like I was reading one of those fishing stories, where the fish just keeps getting larger. It was intersting that this book was paired with \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" another memoir based on exageration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I am so sorry to say that this book is terrible, but it truly is. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have. The entire time I was reading it I just kept comparing it to Frank McCourt's truly wonderful and exceptional book, Angela's Ashes. I came away from The Glass Castle thinking that although quite a few people have had some trying experiences in life, only a true storyteller can turn that into a memoir, something worth sharing. Walls remains superficial and timid in her writing. She makes none of her characters even the least bit likeable and stays in this droning adult-trying-to-sound-like-a-child-voice throughout the entire book. Very dissappointing. It could have been so much better had Walls been a true storyteller instead of just a journalist and to do that you need to dig a little deeper, be a bit more vulnerable and true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I HATED this book. Only read it for a book club that is meeting next week. What garbage ... under the guise of \\"memoir.\\" As has been stated by others, no child that young remembers details as this author claims to have. What an insult for her to think readers would fall for it. Oh, wait. MANY did. I saw the author interviewed when the book came out. I saw and heard her mother. I know they are real people. I just don't buy this being a memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I must agree with everyone else who gave this book one star. If I could give it less, I would. The style of writing is extremely juvenile and the dialogue is totally implausible. For example, when her father comes to sneak her out of the hospital she asks, \\"Are you sure this is okay?\\" A three year old? Like another reviewer, I kept skipping ahead to see if it was going to get any better, which it did not. I only made it to page 31 before deciding not to waste any more of my time on this book. The only saving grace is that I got the book out of the library. If I had bought it this review would have been much more scathing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority Too","review":"I too am in the minority. I did not enjoy this at all. A third of the way through I stopped. I tired of the same old...Dad got drunk, Mom was painting, we kids we're on our own doing this, then Dad told me the story (which stayed with me for the rest of my life) blah, blah...really hated this.

Frankly, it just didn't do it for me. I question the authenticity of all the \\"memories\\" the author puts into her book.While I don't doubt she had a difficult and emotionally abusive childhood, she certainly takes literary liberties in calling this a memoir. Perhaps \\"historical fiction\\" would better serve the reader as to its purpose.Not great, not even inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"very slow start","review":"Had to read this book for school...wouldn't have chosen it for myself.

The narrative of The Glass Castle stirred my own memories of childhood and the sixth grade and a girl named Alice. I'd forgotten how threadbare her clothing was, how her skin was darkened by soot and dirt. I'd forgotten how invisible she was. Yet she was bright and cheerful and never complained of her lot in life. When the school bus would drop her off in front of that dilapidated shack she called home, I found myself wondering how anyone could live like that. Apparently, my Alice was lucky.

The reader feels such mixed emotions, ranging from parent/child relationships; mental abuse; dysfunction on many levels; love; abandonment. But most of all it portrays how the children can manage to thrive while enduring horrible situations - and raising oneself above it all"},{"rating":"2","title":"See through it","review":"Glass Castle is probably the best account ever written of a dysfunctional family -- and it must have taken Walls so much courage to put pen to paper and recount the details of her rather bizarre childhood - - which although it's like none other and is so dramatic - - any reader will relate to it. Readers will find bits and pieces of their own parents in Rex and Rose Mary Walls. Her journey across the country, ending up in a poor mining town in West Virginia and then finally in New York City, is a fascinating tale of survival. Highly recommend this page-turner of a book.

I admire Ms. Wall for sharing her story. Many Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"This story is simply amazing. Jeannette Walls�� story is something that has to be read to believe. The story of her childhood shows that even if you have a bad childhood you can still be anything that you want to be. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is planning on dealing with children; it helps show you that some children have to deal with a lot. The sad part is that if one child goes through this then it is very likely that there are more out there that are having similar experiences that we don��t know about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"The kind of book that gives you a new perspective, very human, the can of book you can really feel identified with"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My Goodness!","review":"I purchased this book in audio & listened to it in my car.

Jeanette Walls has written a most courageous, compelling, tragic, and at times hilariously funny memoir. I could not put it down and then couldn't wait to get back to it to find out what terrible situation would show up next and how the Wall's children would overcome whatever adversity presented itself. For all appearances these totally irresponsible parents some how instilled in their kids some amazing gifts, not only of survival and tolerance, but a real sense of what is right and good in an unfair world.Can't wait to read her next book.Bravo!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabs you from the first page","review":"Couldn't put it down and was sad when it finished.

It is well written and goes along with nice flow. The story is wonderful if not a little sad and frustrating at times. The authors parents did so many things right and so, so many things wrong.

It just never happened. She may be a wonderful journalist, but a memoir shouldn't be written in such a removed voice. Even the ending didn't make me feel anything but frustrated.

In leafing through the book, I also noticed that the print from page 245 to 260 is faded to almost unreadble proportions! I wish that I had not left a positive feedback before I had read the book.

Told so unapologetically, with no self pity....I've ordered copies for so many people because I think it is just a fantastic book with so much to offer.

Whats happening to people's taste in literature these days?? There is no way this is a true life story, little children don't talk, act and remember details like she's written and the parents just can not be that neglectful but quirky and smart at the same time. I don't buy it and you should not buy it either (the book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible","review":"I agree with other reviewers who have said some of the details in this book are suspect.

I smell a rat, and not the one living in the Wall's sugar bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Work of Fiction","review":"Truly a work of fiction; and, a very poor one at that. It is a sad commentary on our society that only repugnant dysfunction sells books. I agree with an earlier reviewer who brought forth the notion that this \\"memoir\\" eerily paralleled \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" in its phantasmagorical tenor. Were it not for the fact I was unfortunate enough to be obligated to read this \\"literary\\" monstrosity, I would never have voluntarily done so. Fortunately, I can derive my own conclusions as to the veracity of this oeuvre instead of weepingly sympathizing with the \\"horror\\" the author purports to have experienced during her incommodious childhood. Bear in mind that the author is a gossip columnist, a profession unknown for its veridicality and comity.This is a vile 'chic lit' whose non-existent qualities I refuse to extol as I am not a pusillanimous poltroon which many reviewers seem to be given the rave accolades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass Castles","review":"Although a close friend who has similar tastes recommended this book to me, I absolutely hated it. It was just awful, and I felt like I did when I was reading \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" I just kept waiting for some sort of redemption - something that would make me feel better for this poor kids - but it never came! I generally like to finish books I begin, but I believe this would have been better unfinished. I will never recommend this to anyone. Just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm surprised more reviewers weren't reminded of \\"A Million Little Pieces.\\"","review":"I see I'm not the only one who quickly questioned the accuracy/veracity of a child's encyclopedic memory. I hate being flim-flammed by such stories (especially since my family had its own Rex Walls) and would give the book no stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"writes with clarity and honesty................","review":"In The Glass Castle, Jeannette Walls tells the story of her amazing life. She weaves a brilliant and clear look at a life that would leave most people bitter and angry. She, however, writes with a clarity and honesty that would seem nearly impossible,especially as there is really no blaming and no self pity. It is almost as if emotionally she watched it happen to someone else, not her. She does not fail to write about anyones shortcomings,..on the other hand she also honestly portrays their good aspects even when they would have been easy to overlook or dismiss. This is an odd story because of this nearly detached, non-judgemental manner of writing, but it works brilliantly for the same precise reasons. The events happen, there seems to be no way to head them off and yet in the end the acceptance of the facts of the matter, the acceptance of parents that are narcissistic and misguided lend an aura of purity and purpose to the telling of the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Everyone who is interesting has a past\\"","review":"Although I shuddered at the neglect and selfishness of Jeannette Walls' parents who created unbelieveable challenges for their children, I grew to understand them, respect them, and admire the strength their children gained from them. Jeannette Walls does an excellent job of making the reader understand the complexities of her parents so that a fair portrayal of them surpasses the reader's ability to pass quick judgement. The reader concludes the memoir understanding how Jeannette can love her parents and respect them despite the living hell they put her through. Very pleasant style of writing. Simple yet profound. So meaningful because it is a true story of success that beats incredible odds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To The Hype","review":"The title, the reviews, and the blurb on the back made me believe that I would love this book. However, I did not. The writing was decent, but did not involve me emotionally. The story was boring and unbelievable at times (even though this is a work of non-fiction). Save your money and reread a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"This is one of those books that you cannot put down.

A must read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable memoir","review":"I liked this book, but didn't love it. This memoir is really just one anecdote after another, starting from a time when the stories are ones the author cannot have remembered, moving to Jeannette as an adult. Most of the stories were interesting, and many fascinating. This book brought me to a world that was new to me, which I enjoyed. I found both parents to be very interesting people - both mixes of great qualities and tragic flaws. The biggest flaw of the book was a lack of connection from one anecdote to the next. And, for the first half of the book, there was a sameness to many of the stories. I almost put the book down, thinking that I had enjoyed it but read enough. But I stayed with it, and found that sameness was less true of the second half of the book, as the children got older. Many of the stories and people in the story have stayed with me. I'm glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glass Castle","review":"This is perhaps the most fascinating book that I have ever read. To know that people actually have lived this kind of lifestyle as a child, under the circumstances that she did, and grow into the fine woman that she has become is amazing. It is understandable that Jeannette and her siblings could have issues as adults with their personal lives, but considering the dysfunctional family that they were raised by, they are remarkable people, and it is a remarkable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glass Castle","review":"This story was so good I immediately went out and bought \\"Half Broke Horses\\".

I was touched by the episode where her sister received her first glasses and realized that tree leaves had details she'd never seen.

Excellent author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority Report","review":"I seem to be in the minority here, but I could not finish this \\"memoir.\\" After the third (or possibly the fourth) \\"accidental\\" burning of a child, I had to tell myself that I needed to stop reading about this incredibly dysfunctional family. I had nothing to learn from them, except that somewhere, somehow, some authorities should have intervened to prevent this from happening (if it really did). If they stayed that far \\"under the radar\\" it is a sad commentary. I also read an interview with the author where she continues to excuse her parents' behavior -- sorry, that just won't work. These people are no role models, nor are they funny or even tragic! I love a good novel, a murder mystery, everything from Shakespearean tragedy to low comedy, but this did not show me anything from which to learn or laugh. I can only ask why so many people condone these parents' behaviors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glass Castle is awesome","review":"Awesome may not be the right word but truthfully, I can't think of the right one. I was torn between devouring it in a couple of sittings and savoring it so it would last a long time...like an ice cream on a hot day. It had me from the first page.

Read it and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-time Favorite!","review":"Oh my goodness! You're gonna love this book.It's one of the best I've read in recent memory. I love memoirs to begin with, but this one is so easy to read, you really won't be able to put it down. I read it in about 48 hrs., and then I passed it on to a friend, and within about a week, four of my friends had finished it & were raving about it, and want to have a book club meeting to discuss it!This book will make you laugh, and cry.

It is hard to believe a childhood could be filled with such hardships. It is an amazing account of how children must deal with mental illness and alcoholism. This opened up my eyes to a world I never imagined existed. What a great story and I am so happy the Author has gone on to find success. This is a book I'd recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy for all those who loved this book.","review":"I was stunned to see all the 5 star reviews for this book. I don't want to rain on the parade of all those who rave and swoon for Walls' memoir, but I couldn't resist the impulse to add my own two cents worth, just to provide a little balance. Quite simply, after reading the opening, I was astonished at the simplistic approach of the author. I skipped ahead, read a little, skipped ahead again, etc., etc. It didn't get better. There's something terribly wrong with most of the people in the book, but it goes almost unacknowledged and never explained. The writing certainly doesn't salvage the experience. I don't remember who recommended it to me, and it's just as well, because I consider it to be at best a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a personal journal that gets you on Jerry Springer","review":"I was recommended this book by someone on a plane - saying it was very funny.Maybe - in the German version she was reading. But the original English version was SAD, verging on depressing and not at all funny.Then, I started questioning how much of the memoir is true. Even if the story is told from a adult recollection of her crazy childhood, it is barely plausible. I read the whole thing, just to see how it ended. That her life changed for the better is not really explored. The story just seemed to wane - like the author was just too spent to provide insight or inspiration.I was hoping for redemption, or hope - like in the book \\"Come Back to Me\\". Unfortunately, I never found it in \\"The Glass Castle\\".If this story is entirely true, then I applaud the author's success in rising above her unfortunate circumstances. But I never understood what lessons she learned that deserve to be shared with a wider audience. So I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"This book is an accessible and inspiring account of a woman who overcame a terribly dysfunctional childhood. Knowing that she is now thriving allows the reader to fully engage and be swept along in this vivid story of loving parents who didn't have a clue about how to responsibly raise their children. It's a splendid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible story","review":"Walls skills as a journalist certainly shine through, as she tells her horrific story in a very matter of fact way. At times, it's almost shocking how detached she can be from events that made me gasp aloud, but it doesn't detract at all from the power of her story. It's an easy, but deeply engaging read, and I'm looking forward to reading her follow up, Half Broke Horses. My only complaint is one that happens all too frequently with books like this - she seems to have sped through the years of her life after breaking away from her family, and the reader really gets very little sense as to how she managed to come out the other side so well adjusted. Perhaps there's room there for yet another follow up book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A memoir worth reading","review":"A touching view into the perceptions of the homeless and life in Appalatia.

The book gives a good view of what life is like when parents don't fit that middle class mold that I thought was what most of us lived by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but inspiring","review":"Sad but inspiring to see how the children of parents who chose to be homeless and take their children on this journey found their way out of this life style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memoir - A sensitive rendering of a hard childhood!","review":"This is an amazing book about a girl whose parents are not living in reality! It is sad and yet, sweet at the same time. This is a great book - I saw her on CNN after the story about James Frey's false memoir came out. I am glad that I heard about her book and read it, because it really shows sensitivity, and perserverance - an amazing story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great memoir","review":"This is truely one of the greatest memoirs I've read, and definately touched me.

I had no idea what I was in store for when I cracked open the book, but I was pleasantly surprised at how profound Wall's story was. From nothing to something as the saying goes. It is an honest account of the hardships of being a child rotting in your parents shadow.I have never been a fan of memoirs because I always saw them as books of self importance, however, I will say this is the first memoir I would recommend people to read and probably last. Not because I still believe memoirs blow like the wind, but because I don't feel others will live up to this one. It is that good.Read it. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Believe","review":"This book is a testament to J. Walls strength and determination.

I just finished The Dollmaker and it's amazing to hear another spin on living in Appalachia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I just finished reading this book. I have to admit that it took me a little while to get into it.The book tells the story of a young girl coming of age. I felt it showed strong family ties within the children and their persistence in wanting to better their lives even when their parents do not. I was truly stunned by the parents and their selfish behavior.Even though it took me a little while to get into the book, once I did, I had a very difficult time putting the book down.Overall, an excellent book and well worth downloading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. Spectacular. A great read.","review":"It's been awhile since I read this. I read it about 2-3 years ago. All I can say is: For someone who was in 11th grade at a high school, failing English class, and had to read a book of the teachers choosing to pass, I'm glad I was given this book to read. It was amazing! I'm not much of a fan of memoirs, auto-biographies or... anything non-fiction for that matter. But this book captured me in the first couple of chapters. I couldn't put it down and even got yelled at during class for reading when I was supposed to be reading The Great Gatsby (which I'm not really a fan of either >_>). I couldn't believe how amazing this book was. I felt so sad and happy through-out the entire thing it really made me happy to know that she made something of herself in the end. It inspired me to actually do more than just the minimum for school. I passed junior year with A's and B's! I feel like this book impacted on me, in a way that not many things have before."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"Great book--although I many times wanted to strangle the parents! They may have loved their children but their treatment and neglect was child abuse. They were all fortunate that things turned out as they did. A great followup to \\"Half-Broke Horses\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"someone call child services!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The things these poor kids had to deal with growing makes me so sad. I loved the whole book except the end. It seemed to just stop. I didn't really like that. That is why i gave it 4 stars. It is worth reading though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memoir Apart From the Rest","review":"I don't usually read memoirs, and when I do, I usually stop 1/4 through. Most memoir authors only write their memoirs because of accumulated fanbase, but Walls is an exception.Walls has a story to tell, and her memoir tells it well. Walls has the gift of 'showing' rather than saying, something most modern writers do not understand. The reader is able to understand through Walls' eyes as a child. Through them, the reader understands the unconditional love and forgiveness that most children have for their parents, while being able to see the true flaws in their nature. In one scene of the novel, Walls and her siblings have been starving for days, when they discover their mother eating a large \\"family-sized\\" chocolate bar in secret. The children are able to see the flaws in their parents, but Walls also shows the ability to forgive and trust again after the incident.This is a well written memoir, and definitely one of the books I am glad I purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Against all odds","review":"Amazing, stents unable to care for their children , so the children had to raise themselves and sometimes the parents too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurous read but prepare to be restless!","review":"This entertaining memoir redefines the idea that whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger. With that, I applaud Ms. Walls for overcoming the obstacles that are her parents put her through. From the first page of her book (when this Manhattan socialite sees her mom digging through the trash) she seizes her audience. She doesn't make you pity her either; otherwise, it would have been hell to read this. Not many can claim to have had a similar childhood or such irresponsible parental units. However, while reading this book I couldn't help but want to finish it. Call it selfish but after hundreds of pages of poverty-stricken kids fending for themselves, I wanted to see some resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable and interesting","review":"I did not find myself questioning anything that Ms. Walls wrote in this book. It was believable and captivating from the very first page. I enjoyed the book from beginning to end, and it sure made me realize how lucky I was to have the childhood that I did. I'll never complain again!! Well written and hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys REAL non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost unbelievable.....definitley worth the read!","review":"This is one of those books where it's almost unbelievable. It's about children being dragged into a life totally uncomprehendable to them. It's definitely a testament to the fact that no matter what your upbringing, with dedication and persistance, you can break the cycle so-to-speak. I would recommend reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The glass castle","review":"The glass castle is a peek inside the chosen life style of some people in America.

The author paints a picture of her life and the lives of her three siblings and parents with the most eloquent literary brush. She takes us from the desert in Phoenix to the mountains of Welch, WV where the family lived in absolute squalor. What this family lived through is dreadful. Yet, the writer tells the story with love. Exceptionally told, this is more than just a story of a woman's hard luck life. It is a story of her triumphant survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it simple","review":"Best memoir I've ever read.

I don't know how parents can have their kids live like that though.","review":"This the story of Jeanette Walls. Her parents did not take very good care of her and her three siblings. Her father, Rex, was more focused on getting drunk than having a stable good job and her mother just wanted to be an artist. Once you become a parent I believe you should put your children's best interests before your own. I am glad that her and her siblings moved to New York City, however I don't think I would keep in contact with my parents after how they treated them and didn't take care of them. I thought it was a good memoir. There are always debates on what is true in memoirs and what is not.

Just too awful for words. We worked so hard to give our kids the best we could, protected them, cared for them yet we lost a son to illness, not from lack of trying.

What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The glass castle: a memoir","review":"This is a book that I cannot recommend to anyone. Tried giving it away to co-workers and/or friends and no one even wanted to read it. This is the written story of a family who apparently were so void of any compassion for man or beast, true character of oneself, and the lack of honesty in order to provide for the family. The true measure of the man in this particular family's history simply leaves this reader with a low fraction for counting. I do have to admit that I did not make it all the way to the end of the book. However: The original couple in this story, the \\"parents\\" having forged their way across America, dragging their offspring along with them; leaves a trail of broken promises, heartache, and dead animals.

Personally, I didn't find her childhood to be that disturbing, at least not compared to someone like my mother whose childhood was rather grim.What I didn't like about the book was the dry narrative. \\"First, we moved here and this happened and then we moved there and that happened and then we did this and then we did that, and then, and then...\\"I found myself skipping through a lot of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The book came in great shape.

This book is on My Favorites list."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my thing","review":"An interesting story.Her family's adventures aren't the kind I enjoy -- I kept expecting the inevitable Something Awful to happen, because the parents were clearly on a path to destruction. There's never really any such blowup, though; life just keeps going (albeit going way way downhill) and there's a certain detachment (even though the author certainly narrates lots of feelings about various events).Near the end, there's a nod toward how her parents inform her understanding of homelessness/the homeless, but it's not really delved into -- which is understandable, since it's not the point of the memoir.It's an interesting look at people who approach the world v. v. differently than I do (the narrator's parents) and people who grew up with v. v. different experiences than I did (the narrator and her siblings), but I'm not really compelled to recommend it to anyone (nor do I disagree with my initial sense, having read the bookjacket blurb, that I had no interest in reading this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verification?","review":"I agree with many, a memory going back to three years old is almost absurd. Also, has anyone bothered to verify her story? People have spent many hours on A Million Little Pieces and found many facts in his story false, but what about hers? Has anyone checked hospital records, birth records and asking questions? I think too many people focused on Frey's book and not hers, which maybe worth verifying before taken as true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting...","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book knowing that every word was true and yet so unbelievable.

She is such a grounded, down-to-earth, honest soul, and I genuinely liked her immediately. I know that sounds insignificant, but having gone through the trials she has gone through in her life, you would think there would be, certainly in close personal meetings, a wall. But there isn't. This is a testament to her resiliency, love for her family and belief that life is what you make it, not where you've been.

Immediately the story drew me in, and I could not seem to put it down. The writing was so detailed, so genuine, so heartfelt... I found myself becoming incredibly attached to the Walls family as I read. This book made me laugh, cry, and gasp (often all at once). Reading it right around thanksgiving as I did, I found it a very appropriate read for the time, as the holiday season approaches; this book is sure to warm your heart, despite the many challenges this family faced! I was very ignorant of the state in which so many people even in the U.S. live at this very moment -- I knew that many are homeless, but I had never imagined the trials the Walls family endured -- and The Glass Castle certainly opened my eyes to the fact that there is so much that we could be doing to help out others in need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I have a (fairly undesirable) habit of forgetting the details of a book soon after I finish reading it.

I loved it. Ms. Walls has a knack for making you feel frustrated with the adversity she has to endure at the same time you are laughing out loud at her descriptions of the situations that she has to deal with on a daily basis because of the terrible decisions her parents make -- over and over again. If you have ever felt that you were raised in a dysfunctional family, please think again and read this memoir. The fact that these children came out of this environment as normal,(I think) successful adults is an achievement in and of itself. I could not put this book down.

It's a book to keep forever and maybe lend out to your friends. It reminded me of my childhood, especially when Jennette tries to paint the house, or fix it up. I found her parents very interesting, loving yet letting the kids do what they wanted if it helped them. The four children are something else. A three year old makes her own breakfast or lunch when they had food is a story in itself. They are truely a proud lot of people. I didn't want to put it down and had no clue how it would end.

I didn't care much for the West Virginia part of the story, as I found the earlier party of Jeannette's childhood to be more interesting in both action and storytelling. I would love to see a follow-up to this book and learn more about what became of the author's siblings, how her parents adjusted to an empty nest and more details about the author's adult life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walls Is To Be Commended For Her Courage","review":"I admit - I didn't want to read this book. I had read the blurb and decided it sounded too bleak for my tastes. Having now finished it, I will say that it was difficult to read because of the content. The writing was excellent - honest and unembellished and I believed every word Walls wrote. I experience a range of strong emotions from anger to disgust to pity that have not been invoked by a book for a long time. It's one of those books you have to read portions aloud to someone else, because the subject matter is so horrifying. Regardless of how I felt, Walls should be commended as a courageous writer for setting her tale down and sharing it with everyone.

As much as you want to force them to get help and get better, sometimes that's simply not in the cards. Walls' book is remarkably gritty and endearing -- unlike so many other memoirs, she doesn't demonize anyone or put them on a pedestal. She looks at them with honesty, from all sides and writes about them in a way that makes them real people with all their beauty and pock marks intact. In the end, her tenacity and intelligence result in more than just survival, but you can never quite grasp how an amazing individual emerged from such a chaotic existence. I love that she did though."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Not only is Jeannette an extremely good writer, but I also found the content both moving and convicting.Her story made me realise afresh that you can never understand what a person has been through, 'til you read their full life history.

HArd to believe! Fabulous book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"This book was fun and easy to read, hard to put it down. It was fun reading about all of her childhood adventures. She really saw the bright side and the adventure in every trouble that came her way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Excellent writing!","review":"To be honest I didn't have high hopes for this book (book club choice). By the 2nd page I was hooked and couldn't put it down. Walls' matter-of-fact writing style and unique life story make for an excellent read. Every child reaches a point when they realize their parents aren't superheroes... Walls' version of this very common story is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent memoir","review":"I can't help thinking of the book and have been since finishing it a few days ago. Ms Walls's resolve and that of her siblings were their keys to survival. I think of this book with total amazement and this is one of the few times that I am at a loss for words. Readers, enjoy this one. The Glass Castle should be a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"You mean non-fiction, right?","review":"Give me a break! This is the most ridiculous piece of \\"fiction\\" I have ever attempted to read. The recollections she claims to have had as a child is so far-fetched I could not get into the book. Walls must have an eidetic memory to recall the detailed accounts she claims to have had. Does she remember her life as an embryo too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tough but worthwhile read","review":"Survival doesn't begin to describe the story Jeannette Wells tells of her childhood struggle. . . this is an eye-opening story for any mother, father, substance abuser, neglected child to read, if for no other reason, than to see \\"how the other half lives.\\" Oddly enough, there are remarkable parallels to \\"normal\\" lives and childhoods, of parents who maybe shouldn't have had the privilege and responsibility of having children. Wells proves them wrong, however, as her account is proof that poverty, prejudice and parental irresponsibility are relevant regardless of social class and some strong kids really can overcome all obstacles. I'm amazed, even angry, at the extent of her forgiveness in telling her story. I view it as a long series of mistakes to avoid repeating. Thank you, Ms. Wells, for sharing and teaching me so much about how life decisions impact one's immediate family."},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense good writing","review":"Walls writes with enviable clarity. She tells her story with a lack of self-pity, making her harrowing memoir all the more compelling. I couldn't put this book down - and I'm an easily distracted reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"You think your family is dysfunctional?","review":"It's amazing to me what some people can endure in the process of growing up, but growing up is what Walls accomplishes, telling her story matter-of-factly, without a single whine. This receives a high rating from me because it has stayed in my mind for months."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating!","review":"This unflinching look at love and pain while growing up with increasingly dysfunctional parents is captivating. I appreciated the honest, non-judgemental and unsentimental account that leaves readers to draw their own conclusions. This easily could have been a \\"poor me\\" book but is as far from that as her own Park Ave. lifestyle is from her parents' dumpster diving."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it before it became famous","review":"I have recommended this book to sooo many friends, family, acquaintances and even strangers at the book store since it was published-now that the word is out- I can curb my enthusiasm-excellent book, written well, humor. read it twice-a lot to absorb-makes for a great bookclub discussion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous and wonderfully written","review":"Jeannette Walls is a true story teller who knows how to choose the details that put the reader into the experience.

It had my interest from the very start! It was incredibly heartbreaking. It very hard to believe that stuff like this actually happened to someone. The book was very well written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Norman Rockwell!","review":"Somewhat my childrens story, although I didn't view it as an adventure, It was called having a \\"dead-beat-dad\\" who gave the family nothing but a bad time and a mother who was uneducated, worked for minimum wage and raised a family the best she knew how.But in this case the parents were very intelligent and why they chose a life of poverty is a mystery to me, although alcoholism may have something to do with it, ya think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in years!","review":"This book kept me up all night reading! Jeannette Walls story of her childhood is simply beyond belief. This book would have been a terrific Christmas present for many of my friends. Now I will give it out for birthday presents. This book is a \\"must have\\" for everyones collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book was excellent. Recently i have started to get into \\"memoirs\\" and Jeannette Walls memoirs was one of the best! Her parents...they give new definition to the word crazy! Jeanette cooked her own hotdogs at the tender age of 3 she was also caught fire by cooking those very same hotdogs at the age of 3...her family was always doing the \\"ske-daddle\\" from bill collectors so they were constantly on the move. Jeannete has two sisters and one brother. Her mom is a very eccentric woman who loves to paint and teaches her children to always be \\"self-sufficient\\" her father is a drunk but she loves him deeply. They move from town to town all over the mid-west to the west coast. They go from rats being on their kitchen counters and in their sugar bowls to eating \\"lard sandwiches\\" at her grandmother Erma's house. This is a book that will keep you interested from start to finish. Never a dull moment. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful !!","review":"This book is the heart of America and the American dream. I loved it so much that I think it is a shame for someone not to read it. I bought this book when I bought Whispers of the wicked saints and the two books together were the best that I have ever read. You heart will sing the praises of good literature when you purchase these two books !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the author?","review":"After a few chapters of this story of a frightful set of parents, alcoholic and narcissistic, I skipped to the end to learn little to nothing about the effects on the three children. The author seemed bemused still by her own survival and that of her sister and brother. So what was the point.I also began to doubt the author's honesty, not from the story line which absolutely no one could have made up, but by the details of her memories from so young an age.Someone helped her write this but that someone is not mentioned.Shocking but annoying.Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A harsh judgement perhaps.","review":"The story starts out as a compelling peek at a dysfunctional family. It soon degenerates into a narrative of poor decisions, repetitive mistakes, and cycles of poverty. This would be interesting if some of the characters actually grew. But no - the adult children in the tale actually aid and abet their parents' unhealthy and criminal behavior (with the possible exception of the son, Brian.) Despite Ms. Wall's (and siblings') prosperity and rise out of destitution, they continue to enable bad behavior in their parents, all under the guise of love.This was a confusing and preposterous saga of family life run amok. Ms. Walls did not have the good sense to feel embarrassed by her complicity in her parents' downfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a stunning book!","review":"This is the first Memoir I can remember reading and saying it was a page turner and one of the best books I have ever read!! Your heart goes out to the children of the Walls family but then you don't want to but you do you feel sorry for the parents. What a journey this family had from the West coast, to Phoenix, AZ, Texas, a small mining town in West Virginia and finally NYC! This book will be with me for quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Autobiography that Reads Like a Novel","review":"I'm really not much on non-fiction, but this book reads like a novel. Incredible what this woman went through as a child. Just shows the resiliency of children. So well written; you can picture every place and detail that is described. A book you won't want to put down, and will pass on to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"What an amazing, inspirational story. Walls paints a desperately vivid picture of her childhood that has you rooting for her from the onset. Great story. I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books","review":"I read Well's other book first and then read Glass Castle. This book was amazing. I read it on my Kindle. I could not put my Kindle down. I am happy that the family did so well. I want to know more about how they are doing now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every life has a story","review":"Warms my heart that Jeannette has accomplished what she has in life, those are pretty tough odds that she and her siblings dealt with as dependant children. I laughed at some of the phrases she told us her Dad used, I've known people like that, real characters, sad that he couldn't break the substance abuse chain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glass Castle","review":"Great story about an amazing life. Survival and courage are in every character.

I could not recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really suspenseful!","review":"I had to read this book for a college course out of four, and this one by far was my favorite. The author herself is telling her story about life as a child, and no one would have ever thought that such a famous author would go through all the things this woman went through. Makes you want to keep reading the whole time wondering what is going to happen next. By the end of the story there is a moral to be learned and how anyone really can go from the bottom all the way to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of my youth","review":"I feel that the Glass Castle speaks for a great deal of the people that were raised in the U.S. during this period of time. Some had it worse. Some had it better. Some were able to hide it better. Most of us just accepted it. I feel the comments about her parents are from people that have not experienced the life. Jeannette is no doubt a stronger person because of the experience. I loved the book and like many others was unable to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This book was a great memoir to read. You could almost feel the writer's emotions as you were reading the book. I would recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites and the story is one you won't soon forget. I admire the author for sharing the story of her childhood. It is truly inspiring to see how these children overcome all the obstacles put before them. I would love to give copies to all the people I know who let life's setbacks keep them from achieving all they can."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Read - \\"The Glass Castle\\"","review":"The resiliency of this author and her siblings will astound any reader. I have always thought that nothing topped the insanity of my childhood - until I read Jeanette Walls' memoir. It was a guilty read and I could not put it down until it was finished even though I had other work I should have been doing. I just had to find out what happened to that family! The whole thing - from beginning to end- was richly satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass Castle","review":"Wow... haven't we all held out for the moment we commence to build our Glass Castle? \\"Just as soon as\\".... we get the perfect plans, enough time, money, etc. FABULOUS book that was written (just like I'd like to write one!) to give us glimses into our own grandiosity, missed opportunities, fixed beliefs, and rationalizations. I saw EVERYONE in my family in this book; maybe the whole human race makes an appearance, but it definitely will come alive for anyone raised by alcoholics. Couldn't stop reading it and now can't stop talking about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read","review":"I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a fast non-fiction read. Definitely a page turner. Not an uplifting story per se but pretty good if you are in the mood for a tragic tale about a fairly messed up family and the problems that continue to haunt them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, heartwarming.","review":"Walls captures her childhood and all of it's trauma, not in a pessimistic manner, but in the way a good storyteller tells a story. I highly recommend this book. I found that after I started it, I could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I planned on reading this a little bit at a time and ended up staying up till 3:30am until I finished it.

I spent over 30 years working with families such as the family in \\"The Glass Castle: A Memoir.\\" So many times their lives were more like fiction, but the bizarre lifestyle was/is REAL.

Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glass Castle","review":"From the first page, this author grabbed me and I couldn't stop reading. I wanted to feel sorry for the family, but never once did I get the impression that they felt sorry for themselves. From struggle to success these kids are all surviors.

Despite the dark promise of the Library of Congress cataloging data--\\"children of alcoholics . . . West Virginia . . . problem families . . . poor . . . homeless persons\\"--Walls never dwells on her misery nor asks for pity, and is more often funny and wise. Ultimately, it's hard to beat a good story told by good writer. I would recommend this book to just about anybody who likes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a life!","review":"I can't imagine growing up the way Jeannette and her sibs did and it's amazing to me that she can be so civil to her parents. Hard to belive that this is non-fiction! I'm late to read this since I know it came out years ago, but was certainly worth it. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites!","review":"I read this memoir as a young teenager because my mother suggested it - little did I know it would become one of my favorite books of all time. I had nowhere near the hardships that she had as a child, and it really opened my eyes at a young age to a more darker side of life. Reading this book also gave me a different outlook on life as well, no matter how hard or nasty things would get, she pushed on and created the life that I'm sure she never would have dreamed of having. I defiantly would recommend this book to anyone really, just a genuinely great book on Life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pure crapola","review":"There's no zero-star option, so I am forced to give it a star.What a piece of garbage. Rent 'Joe Dirt' and get basically the same story, but with laughs.The popularity of this piece of unadulterated trash shows the complete failure of the American educational system. Critical thinking seems to be a thing of the past. If you believe that Jeannette Walls can remember every detail of what happened when she was 3 three years old, or that at age 4 she discussed with her slightly older sister the pros and cons of their parents' lifestyle, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.An incredibly bad book, and a waste of good paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent story.........","review":"I love to read memoirs.. because they are based on truestories..so I read quite a few of them..this book wasgreat..and very well written..smooth read. There are alotof great memoirs out there..Memoirs of a Geisha was fabulous..The Bette Paige story was very good, although it was not amemoir..it was non fiction.

I read up to 151 pages and still could not understand why the book was written. I have had the book for a month and I have not completed it.Most of our book club members have the same thoughts about the book. It goes over and over the same situation; leading you right back where you started. There were no twists in the book and now I would never attempt to read another memoir.I think the author could have left her past life in the past because there was nothing interesting about it at all.I do not recommend the book to anyone.The Glass Castle: A Memoir"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This book fell short of expectations in my eyes. I don't believe for one minute in the 20th century a family was allowed to live life in such squalor without any intervention. Either West Virginia is the most backwards place in this country or this story is a bit on the embellished side. The story would have been more believable had it taken place in the 1950's even the 60's but the late 70's, early-mid 80's, really?? I would never read another Jeanette Walls book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snail Shipping","review":"I purchased two different books from two different sellers. Both books were purchased at the same time, they were the same weight, for delivery from 2 different states. After paying $5.00 for shipping by regular mail, I was extremely disappointed to learn that a simple, light weight soft cover book would take over one month to deliver domestically. Now I know the US Postal service is slow, but something this light should not have taken this long. Needless to say, one book was delivered in one week while this seller (The Glass Castle) took 5 weeks. I honestly don't believe the seller shipped when he said he did despite my email questioning the shipping delay. I was unable to enjoy the book on my vacation and would highly NOT RECOMMEND using this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"great read","review":"this book by far is the best book i have ever read. after i finished it i saw the author on oprah. she was remarkable and beautiful. i would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all","review":"Just the title \\" The Glass Castle\\" sounds simple and shallow. I tried to start reading this and I couldn't pass the first pages. That is usually what I do with books, see a few pages and read here and there and I know if I will be able to digest it. That is what I do if I want to buy one anyway. It has worked for me. What does that title mean? Why a castle to being with? I have realized that anybody can write (?) and publish a book in this country. About anything. This book is no exception.And look at her, please, not because appearances show it all but she was a writer for a gossiper column, she is the vivid example of the American drea. Blank, emotionless and shallow.No, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing if True","review":"I read this book because I loved \\"Angela's Ashes\\". What I got was a story that suspended credulity and cause such a dislike of the author for capitalizing on such sordid memories (fantasies). To write about a father who was willing to offer his young daughter for his personal gain, the sexual abuse of one of the parents, and the willingness of a mother to bring up children while sitting on vast resources should be a source of embarrassment and have been kept \\"in the family\\". In fact, these episodes seemed to be made up to add a little spice to the boring narrative. There were no redeeming individuals in the book and no self-affirming experiences. The author should be ashamed of herself for capitalizing on the mental illness of her parents, if the story is true at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I get it. She was poor, but that is no reason to mumble on for two hundred pages. The book became boring and whatever theme the book was promoting was lost in a sea of irrelevance. A good author could have made this book entertaining. This author just made me want to burn every book I haven't read to make sure I don't read another book like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to continue reading","review":"It seems that most people loved this book, however, I barely liked it. While reading it, I didn't feel much real emotion or depth and it left me feeling very empty. In my opinion, the book just doesn't have any heart. If everything is true, and the author's family is as severely dysfunctional as she indicates, then it is a sad story indeed. For that, I applaud her bravery in writing it, but, as much as I normally enjoy reading a book of this nature, I can't find anything positive to say about it.While I really tried to like this book, I really did, I just couldn't seem to ever warm up to it. It was all I could do to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too depressing","review":"I admit I didn't finish this book. I just couldn't. Contrary to some descriptions of the this book, it is very depressing. I felt unhappy as I read it and angry at her selfish parents who let her and her siblings starve and do things like ride in the back of a U-Haul. At the end of each chapter I wondered what the point of this book is. I also got tired of the foul language. Call me old fashioned, but those are not words I like to fill my head with. I've read so many wonderful reviews of this, so I was expecting much more. I'm confused why I am one of the few that didn't like it. I guess it just wasn't my cup of tea. I'd rather read something more uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blowhard Alert","review":"Overrated. For a woman who considers herself somewhat as a guardian of truth, I am very suspect of the \\"truths\\" she claims in her memoir. This may go over big with the midwestern housewife crowd, but I suspect anyone with a B.S. sensor will be rightfully skeptical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Recollections of being a three year old? I do not think so. The author not only portrayed herself as a victim, but remains a victim. Through all of the disgusting, humiliating, neglectful things BOTH her parents put her through, she never said a word against them. Respect your mother and father.. PAH! Respect should be earned, and neither of them deserved one ounce of respect. You can buy a piano, but make your kids sleep on cardboard? You are able to, but will NOT work to look after your kids. The whole thing seemed to me to be just a story concocted for $$$, and has a vague connection to the actual events. When you know people who have genuinely experienced real hardship, it is hard to read the glorification of these despicable parents. I would not have finished the book, but it was chosen for a book club. I HATED every single page of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"The author is incredibly talented and relates her traumatic experiences in a matter-of-fact manner that makes this book incredibly disturbing. In truth, I could not read more than the first three chapters or so because it was so painful to learn of her experiences. Perhaps I am simply to faint of heart, but wanted to submit this review in case there is someone out there who might have the same disposition."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding, so far-fetched.","review":"From the minute I started reading the book, I new it was just not possible. Recalling memories from the age of 3 the way she did was so fabricated. Stories where never finished, it left you hanging wondering how this stuff can ever happen to a child. Very disappointed, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG the worst!!!!","review":"Ok if you're into a depressing account of someones childhood, buy it!! This book lacked a lot! It's horrible event after another. Things like falling out of cars, and eating out of bathroom garbage cans. It's horrible! I'm sorry, but please save your $9.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"A James Frey Wannabee","review":"I stopped reading this \\"memoir\\" thirty pages in when I realized it seemed all made up. No one has a memory that recalls this attention to detail, let alone remembering speficic dialogue at such a young age. It would be more believable if there were gaps in her memory or how she presented her life. Was she taking notes from the age of three or does she have a total recall memory? I just don't belive this is anything more than a work of fiction culled from other people's experiences designed to make the reader more involved than they need to be. The book is more believable as a work of fiction than non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book...","review":"This book was supposed to be for daughter's summer reading. Since we were going on vacation and I did not have a book to read I decided to read this book. I could not put it down. It was fast reading and held your attention.

You have a most incredible story.

I cried at times, just wanting to shake the parents and yell, \\"Grow up\\". And I was surprised that family services did not do much to help. The children survived becasue they didn't even know at first that their lives were so chaotic. They also survived because they supported each other. Thank heavens for that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read.","review":"Amazing story. So well written. Reads like she is sitting you down and telling you a story in your living room. Hard to believe she could be normal after her background. Funny and sad and heartwarming and tragic. Definitely read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"I was looking for a book that would be as good a read to take down to the beach after having read \\"The Help\\" by Kathryn Stockett and found this. Finished it in one night and sat up for next 2 hrs thinking about the book and the author's childhood. What is really reflective to know is that this poverty existed right in society itself but you don't see it, not till someone pointed it out to you and then you look at what you have in life and you thank your lucky stars on what you've always taken for granted, even the little things. I'm very impressed by Jeannette and her sibs in having a strong united front through it all and keeping a brave upper lip. What a strong bond!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read...awesome details. Honestly, a page-turner","review":"Definitely one of the best I've read in a while. I was impressed with the honesty about the living conditions and familial ups and downs. In some parts of the book, I was reminiscient of my life growing up in rural East Tennessee, but it was nowhere near as trying as this strong lady's upbringing. Thank you, Ms. Walls, for a glimpse into your life and a chance for the world to see the resourcefulness of people when necessary. I can't wait to read \\"Half Broke Horses.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it....period...the end.","review":"I read this book in two days and was unhappy during the small amount of time that I needed to put it down. Jeanette Walls' account of her childhood is captivating, detailed and absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!! I'm ready to start from page one all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible tale and a mesmerizing journey!","review":"My first thought was that these parents are so self-centered that they should not even be allowed to own a dog. There is no more demanding or important job than to parent children. The writer is someone who could have been on the Jerry Springer Show but chose instead to remember the gifts of her childhood as well as the neglect. It is an incredible tale and a mesmerizing journey. A compassionate reader will want to jump back in time and right the many wrongs done against these children. A reader with an imagination will see the incredible gift that these dysfunctional parents gave their children. An insightful reader will realize that these parents probably gave their children all that they had to give. The painful truth rings loudly: not all parents who love their children are unselfish enough to put their desires on hold while they provide the very basic needs for their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing but also uplifting in spirit","review":"Jeannette had a hard life, but managed to pick herself up and make a life for herself. She had the guts and determination to help her look after her sisters and her brother, too. Her parents, I feel, were selfish; even though I feel they loved their childern \\" in their own way\\". I know if I was raised in that atmosphere, I don't know if I could cope like she did.She tried to \\"make the best of a bad situation\\".The read is easy and fast. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Jeannette!! God bless you !!Excellent writing !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top ten books","review":"I have shared my book with several of my co-workers. This book is one of the best books I have ever read. Jeanette Walls gives dysfunctional family life a whole new meaning. She is such an eloquent writer. You feel as if you are cheering for everyone in her family to make it out. I think that is the wish of many people who grow up in less than stellar conditions. Her writing is very vivid. You feel as if you are living in her home with her. I don't want to ruin the ending, but you have such mixed emotions at the end. You are almost mad at her crazy mother, but then you just understand that is the life of someone who is clearly mentally ill. It would be a great book for a book club because it is an easy read and very easy to discuss. My co-workers and I have had several discussions about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"Jeanette Walls breaks new ground with this book. The formula was first used by Plato--write from the heart, purely, unequivacaly, all in. She reinvents the formula with vivid descriptions and dialogue that combine to take the reader on a journey toward understanding the bizarre predicament she lived through as a child, as well as the psychological motivations of her iconoclastic father and mother. The book is an easy read and I anxiously await her next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in 2008","review":"Walls writes with a keen eye and a warm heart, I could not put this book down. Easily on my top 10 list, I plan to give this book to those readers on my Christmas list. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a book of hope","review":"A deeply moving, unforgettable memoir of a truly hard-scrabble life. What I admire most about this book is that Jeannette Walls never paints her family as victims. Nor does she portray her unbearably narcissistic parents as evil (even though it would certainly be easy to do so--her drunken father, her childlike mother. Oh, how I was enraged in the scene where the mother hides the candy bar she's eating from her starving children!!!). Instead, she shows the world as she saw it growing up: the good, the bad, the hideously ugly.But mostly this is a book about hope and strength and finding the courage to overcome.In a nutshell, this book will haunt me for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe, it's not fiction","review":"Great book, enjoyed reading very much...You do not think parents can behave that way, but Jeannette Walls seems so open and honest about her family, struggles, and triumphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written. Loved it!","review":"Since reading, I have recommended this book to everyone I know. It is so well written. It is clear how one can love someone despite all their faults and despite making one's own life really difficult. It also is a perfect example of how adversity can build incredible strength of character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"As I started reading this book I had to keep reminding myself that the stories in the book actually happened. The Walls family lived a very interesting life (for lack of a better word). As I was reading through the book and learning about the messed up things that happened to the children because of their parents mistakes I kept wondering how the children would turn out. In the end I learned that it doesn't matter what cards you are dealt in life, it is how you play your hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass Castle","review":"I could not put this biography down. I felt so sad at times reading about the hardships endured by the siblings and the author! Growing up during the depression was difficult for our family, however, nothing to the extent of the Walls family. We had a loving roof over our heads and food on the table, even if some of our clothing were hand-me-downs. It is okay to be free-spirited, however, I found the parents to be irresponsible. Kudos to the author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Service","review":"I was very pleased with this book.

Very disappointing. It wasn't believeable that this was the memoir of a child, begining at the age of three. No one remembers that kind of detail from age three, or five, or even ten. Much of the story had to be fictionally created. I stumbled through about half the book and then skipped to the end to see what happened to the characters, not that I cared much. The parents were deplorable, not amusing or eccentric as the writer would have us believe. I gave up when the mother sluffed off Jeanette's report of the uncle who exposed himself to her and went back to her crossword puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"All About the Jungian Movement: Places, People and More","review":"You will enjoy reading this book!For the first time there is a telling of the tale of the Jungian movement from thebeginnings in Switzerland to every continent through places, persons, events andpublications. This book will leave you with a new and larger understanding of astory that was previouly known mostly in fragments. Included are colorful nuancesand first hand accounts, even a few never before published photographs, from theauthor who grew up in the midst of the Jungians and has been one of its mostprominent contributors.Whether you read this book for the fun and enjoyment of it or for professionalresearch, you will find a wealth of facts, insights and useful references to placesand persons you probably know and books you probably have read, and you may findyourself referring back to specific sections, places and persons many times.I recommend this book highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This is a must for every psychiatrist and psychologist who is interested in the history of psychiatry and psychology, and for every layman who is interested in these fields."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agree - definitive !","review":"Mozart's concerto K.491 is a truely great perfarmance, there is simply no greater recording of this work.

As you may already know, other reviews here report this problem. I purchased this set hoping that my copy would be fine, but this was not to be. There is a single-disc DGG set that contains all of these performances except for the 27th, and no reviews of that set report sound problems.Disc one contains the performances of the 8th and 23rd. Let me comment on the 8th. I am no authority on Mozart's piano concertos, but I listen to them almost every day and happen to favor the early ones over the later. I have had two versions of the 8th -- by Ashkenazy and Perahia -- and the Kempff version has become my favorite. For all the lovers of Mozart, it is a shame that there are so few recordings of his piano concertos by this exquisite interpreter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the mystery is unraveled","review":"I was diagnosed with Sarcoidosis about 1year ago and have gone through several resourses of information. Some have been helpful and some not. This is not the end all manual of \\"everything you'd ever want to know\\". But it allows the patient to communicate with their physician on a different level.

The picture quality is fuzzy. WWF No Mercy 2001 was a very good pay-per view event which was ruined by a bad and cheap VHS tape quality. It kinda reminds me of those old WWF Supertape VHS cassettes that I used to rent as a kid, only to be disappointed when I had to watch it on VHS and the picture quality was fuzzy. Pressing tracking didn't help matters as it is the fault of the manufacturer's for using cheap and poor quality tape material.

It's also a positive record. Too often I hear alot of rappers talking about how they rap about what they know as if they aren't capable of growing or progressing. Children and young adults are so impressionable and they need to know that you can rise above the ghetto life, the drugs, the thugging,the bling, bling,the harem of women, the chromed out cars, and do better. They need to know that there are other ways to handle life-deal with life. It's nice to hear a record that talks about making a change for the better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Call It A Comeback!","review":"First off, for anyone who's wondering, there's only one version of this cd, since he doesn't curse at all. My current favorite song is \\"Fa Ha\\", which samples Hall & Oates \\"Rich Girl\\". Other good tracks are the first single \\"Luv U Better\\" and \\"Big Mama (Unconditional Love)\\", which features Dru Hill. I totally recommend this album, especially if you liked his previous releases. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that a couple tracks sound corny, like \\"Lollipop\\" and \\"AFter School\\" with P. Diddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak stuff...","review":"This is LL's second straight bad CD and I blame the production more than anything else. LL is past his prime lyrically but he still raps better than 90% of the rappers today. Unfortunately rather than working with some real producers he chose the Neptunes. The Neptunes make me sick. they should stick to working with Nelly and Nsync. Their beats totally don't mix with LL's style. LL needs smooth, simple sound like from \\"Around the Way Girl\\" or \\"Hey Lover\\". Not these hard thumping, trying to sound hard but really not, beats the Neptunes use. The only very good song is \\"10 Million Stars\\" and a couple of other songs like \\"Love U Better\\" and \\"Paradise\\" are decent. The rest are almost unlistenable. This is a cd for the diehard LL fan who loves anything with the sound of his voice but otherwise, I would save my money because this album will only tarnish your opinion of one of the greatest rappers ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten is Terrible","review":"I expected a little more from Uncle L.

On a 1-10 this album IS a \\"10\\". The work with Pl Diddy is a great commercial hit, but tasteful, with the Rappers Delight and Rob Base 'samples' And if \\"Unconditional Love - Big Momma\\" didn't' choke you up, then you never had a grandmother. LL still fives us the hardcore rap style we were used to with \\"Throw your L up and 10 Million Stars\\" and then it wouldn't be LL without the niggy niggy nuts!!! Paradise is the \\"I need love\\" of the new millennium. FIVE STARS ***** This CD will make you get the other nine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This was a terrible waste of time and money. I skimmed through it looking for the interesting parts, and found myself at the end - it just isn't interesting. I loathed most of the characters most of the time, even if they didn't have any depths, just their actions were enough to make me hope they weren't successful - dull, dull, dull, too many characters, only reason it's an 'International Novel' is because it's set in Europe. Awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of my time!!","review":"Please, don't spend your time or money on this book. I struggled through waiting for the plot twist that would lead to the point of this book. It never came. The characters were vague and so underdeveloped that I couldn't quite decide who was likeable and who wasn't. Even the ending was unsatisfying. It ended so abruptly that at first I thought maybe I was missing the last chapter. This is the first and last book I purchase by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Going over much of the old ground found in her earlier books. Starts interestingly enough but the ending just drops from no where. Ms Johnson would definitely benefit from finding a new theme. The main problem, like many stories, is that the initial idea had some grip, but the author had no grasp of how to bring to a satisfactory conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I give up. I'd rather fold laundry than keep reading this book. Unlikeable characters, nothing but watching them wait to see what's going to happen, acting very selfish and dull while they do so. BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it could have been. . .","review":"For me, the main problem in this book was that I did not really care about any of the characters. They were not particularly interesting or likeable, and I found myself skim reading large sections of dialogue and description. The author's writing style, in my opinion, is distracting; I found myself reading some sentences several times just to try and understand the point. I finished the book, because I don't like to just give up on books, but it was a genuine effort to get to the end, and I will definitely not read any more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow.....","review":"This book was very slow-moving, and did very little to grasp my attention, and even less to hold it. The beginning started off alright- great setting, interesting descriptions which gave the reader an indication of upcoming conflicts...but wow did this book drag!!!I read three other books in the time it took me to read this one. Even when I was down to the last ten pages, I couldn't sit still long enough to see how it ended, and just waited until I had enough energy to stay awake for the last chapter.This book was a tedious read. I am a fan of Diane Johnson and was more than disappointed with this novel. The characters were either loathesome or poorly developed, and while the setting was ideal as the backdrop of a great story, the almost non-existent plot was dragged out for about 200 pages too many. Either this book needed to be one hundred pages long, or it needed a bit more excitement to keep me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"L'Waste of Time","review":"My reading group wanted something light for our January read so we selected this book based on a newspaper review in which Ms. Johnson is hailed as a Pulitzer Prize contender. I doubt this book is going to win her any literary awards! L'Affaire had unlikeable, boring characters about whom I was completely uninterested. The plot was silly and bordering on the absurd without being even slightly humorous. Don't waste your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isabelle Archer Lives!","review":"Thank you, Diane Johnson, for being a true heiress to Henry James. When clueless Amy meets a cross-section of European, Paris-centric, upperish-crusted, slef-promoters, she shows both brash courage at sticking to her principals of mutual aid, and an open curiosity at how to, if not fit in, then at least not stick out. Unfortunately, her principals and new wealth always make her stick out, bringing into question what American generosity and world-involvement really are and lining her path of good intentions with one corpse and a number of disappointments from those depending on her. If there's a flaw, it's in the unexplored character of the novel's surprise villain -- but when an author is juggling at least eight points-of-view as seamlessly as Johnson is here, well...I for one am in a forgiving mood even if it means a miss on perfection.Brava!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with 'plodding and dull' from Amherst, MA","review":"It's plodding and dull.

Just plain horrible... save your money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Story; Intriguing Genre","review":"This book contains a lovely story written in the rare genre of Lesbian Gothic Fiction. Although it is not as dark and heavy as some historical gothic fiction, it contains most of the elements of the genre. The other half of the story is a blossoming lesbian romance between the two title characters. This love story is dealt with in a very elegant manner; overall, the writing style harkens back to fiction from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Although the story does feel complete, my only complaint is that it was not longer, and that the romance was not explored further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful novel.","review":"This is, in my opinion, Segal's best writing. As is his way, he weaves fiction with portions of historical fact, and realism in locale which make the reading more credible, and imminently enjoyable. It moves through conflicts and peacetime; from Cambridge to Europe and the Middle East.It is a delightful journey of a handful of young people through their respective lives. It has unrecognized (by some, at least) and public triumph, the struggles, and uncertainties that we all have gone through. These members of the Harvard Class of 1958 start in very different places, move together in Cambridge, and then move away (and back together). The well managed story takes the fortunate reader right along with them.In this novel, I see friends (and acquaintances) from high school, college and law school.

You can just picture Segal stroking himself on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else...","review":"One needs to judge popular fiction with lower standards than great literature. Even so, this book is bad - really, really bad.The plot is predictable, to the extent that I spent much of my time playing \\"let's guess what happens next\\". The dialogue...well, no real people I know talk like the characters in this novel. And Dr. Segal couldn't write a realistic female character if his life depended on it (not that he does such a great job with the male characters).There is a \\"Forest Gump\\"ishness to the book with the occasional dropping in of famous people. I suppose that they are famous prevents them from sueing.Why did I read this? It's required summer reading for my daughter (may god have mercy on her soul)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This class fails","review":"Skip this over indulgent pile and read \\"Doctors\\" by Segal instead, better character development, better subject matter and better results."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"This book, and it has been a while since I read it, effectively aroused and stimulated almost every emotion within me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read","review":"This is definitely the best piece of fiction I've ever read. You can recognise yourself, your friends, etc. in each one of the characters. The theme is simple - LIFE. The language is wonderful in the way it shows the ups and downs of each of the characters' lives in a manner so lucid. I plan to read it again and again. A MUST READ especially for students/teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammar Lesson?","review":"I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Crutcher and have him sign any book from a large selection available at the signing. I chose Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes at random. The book started off well enough but I immediately was puzzled at some of the wording found within the text. Many sentences were quite awkward to read. My wife and I are both educators and were amazed at the poor sentence structure and vernacular used throughout. Many of the words I have never heard in the vocabulary of someone in their late teens (which is the age of the protagonist in the story). As the book wears on, Mr. Crutcher feels the need the raise the number of curse words per page. Seriously, in one particular chapter, the characters seems as if they have just discovered the word s***. The storyline about friendships changing as peer groups and personas evolve is a familiar, but welcome one. My fault is not with the \\"message\\" but the way the message is delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrational plot","review":"The main characters in this book are Sarah Byrnes and Eric Calhoune. Sarah Byrnes is a friend of Eric who has a severly burned face. Eric is a obese, unpopular student who confides his trust in Sarah. All of a sudden Sarah stops talking in the middle of class and is sent to a mental institution. This marks the turning point in Eric and Sarah's relationship and the truth behind Sarah's face.After reading this book I have several opinions about it. The book had a very strong moral which was \\"never give up on your friends\\". I believe the moral was a very good one. I also believe this book could help kids who are in similiar situations.My seond opinion is about the plot. I think the plot of this book was irrational andimprobable. The plot was also boring and made me feel like I was reading a Disney story. The only thing that made the book readable was the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The liberal stance doesn't annoy me; the poor writing does","review":"Probably the reason kids read this book in so many schools is they want to get these tough issues out on the table for discussion. That's great, but when an author is relying on controversy to sell his books, it starts to turn sour. The writing is nothing memorable, the flash-backs are confusing, and Eric is EXACTLY the same as all Crutcher's other heroes. Egotistical, athletically gifted and otherwise made of cardboard. Sarah is a slightly more interesting person, but Crutcher tries to make her an enigma by making her do out of character, confusing, motive-less things. All in all, if you want a WELL WRITTEN book that deals with the same issues, read A CATCHER IN THE RYE."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring!","review":"Sorry, \\"Staying Fat\\" fans, but trying to read the first chapters of this book was a horror! It's not a challenging reading level for me, but among the negative list is bad character introduction, unnecessary details (that make the book long and boring), and just plain boring-ness. I commend the author for creating such a good story idea, but he ruined it by writing the way he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it..","review":"I didn't like this book. It was too weird and spooky for me. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it! Still, my friend read it and enjoyed it, so maybe I'm paranoid.

Learning how to deal with those problems (teenage pregnancy, abuse, teasing...) are totally a part of a teen's life. Friendships are what count and if you're part of one that can handle the bumpy road--that's one to last. I suggest the reading be for more advanced readers because of the topic and the profanity. However, the topics raise stimulating questions about self-worth, respect, shame... Chris Crutcher's background with teens really shows of his understanding of their trials. It's a goood book, read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I get an extra star?","review":"I'm an ELA teacher. This is one of my favorite YA novels. After you get comfortable with the main character and hisrelationship with Sarah Byrnes, it's impossible to put this book down. The characters are new/strange and well defined. The issues are a bit heavy as is the language, so I'd keep it at 14 or older.This novel is TYPICAL Chris Crutcher; the novels are a little redundant, but there's comfort in knowing what you're going to get, and you keep reading on the strength of the characters and their dialog. There's a string of common themes in his books, great athlete who plays for himself and not that awful coach, abuse, death, shame, salvation coming in the form of a 17yo boy, 'us' against the school system.Overall, a Must Read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Four Star Friendship","review":"I think Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes is a good book. Although it is filled with obscene language, I think the story line was well thought out. I give it four stars, and I related to the story because I, like many others, was made fun of. The books main impact on me is how the two main characters become friends to overcome their abnormal appearance. The book was a bit depressing, but it had some suspense and comedy. I recommend this book to teens and young adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book was a good book for teenagers. It portrays feelings and times that many of those in high school go through. I had the opportunity to hear Chris Crutcher speak twice and through those experiences I learned that he is very sincere in the books that he writes. And this book shows. It was a book that I could not put down. I would recomend it to any Junior High or High school reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS VERY GOOD","review":"I think that this book is a little bit boring, but it has violence.

Still, even if I were younger, I doubt I'd like the book much better. The novel is chockful of dated humor that wouldn't have been that funny at the published date. Also, the characters are static and flat. The plot is unbelievable. It's one of those books that makes you step out of the story's action and say, \\"Hey, that could NEVER happen.\\" Examples of the downright ridiculous things about Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes: Sarah Byrnes, a sort-of heroine, is downright unlikeable depite her sympathy-inducing disfigurement; a student who went to great measures to keep her abortion secret decides on a whim to tell her entire class during a discussion; and police fail to find Sarah's father, who isn't really hiding at all but continues to live in his house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved Athletic Shorts but \\"adult HBO\\" in Sarah Byrnes... no thanx.","review":"I teach English and I'm always looking for books that will open the eyes of my secondary students.

Then on page 67 I find our dear hero staying up late watching (graphically explained) porno. Excuse me? And he explains that his mother permits it because she is always \\"completely open about sexual stuff\\".

Chris Crutcher sucessfully incorporates humor into his tale as he teaches his readers that we all have troubles in our lives. In Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes, Crutcher shows his readers that it is possibles to overcome our struggles while also showing them the importance of forgiveness, friendships and love. Crutcher's main character, Eric, is a truly likable character whose witty comments had me laughing out loud many times. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeowwwww!","review":"GREAT BOOK!!! The story of the grade-school freak who ends up NOT getting the short end of the stick for once...sounds like *my* life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. It well adressed many issues that affect not only teens but our society such as domestic violence and abortion. I think that it portrayed teen and adolecent life very well and accurately and yet had much humor and was not too serious. Each character was an individual and it is very easy to connect with at least a piece of every one.

But this is the most horribly written book that I have ever read. The characters are not convincing(the main character, Eric Calhoune, uses 18 year old slang, and occasionallly speaks like a phsycologist-very contradictory)and the writing is just BAD. The entire book is a puny cover up for Crutcher to get his ideas out. If you want anything that is remotely well crafted, go to another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"marrage is the death of hope!!!","review":"I thought the book was pretty good. The mixture of love and hatred make it a pretty good book. I strongly recommend this book.

Sarah has a grotesque burn covering half of her face and Eric is overweight. When Eric first joined the swimteam, he ate a lot of food so he could stay fat and convince Sarah that he was still her friend. When Sarah Byrnes is admitted into the hospital for not talking, Eric starts to think there is a lot more behind the burn than an accident with a pot of spaghetti sauce. Meanwhile, Eric keeps himself busy with an extremely controversial discussion class and swimteam. Later on, when Eric finds out the truth, he is almost killed.I liked this book's humor and the likable characters. I didn't like how it was so predictable during some parts. I would reccommend this book for a more mature group of readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be alot better.","review":"While I loved the plot, the way this book is writen makes it very hard to follow.

It's mostly about the friendship between a girl named Sarah Brynes(she has scars on her face and hands from being burnt) and a guy named Eric Calhoone.

I suggest you read it and finds out what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matthew's Review","review":"This book is great for kids. Its about a gril that gets burned and her best friend is eric.

Sarah was burned severely when she was three years old leaving her with an ugly face for the rest of her life. Her best friend Eric Calhoune is some fat kid trying to make it in life. Once Eric joins the swim team in high school and loses weight, he fears he will lose his best friend. When Sarah sits silent in the hospital, Eric tries everything to get her to talk. But when Eric finds out the truth of Sarah's burning and why she came to the hospital, her life is not only in danger but his as well. This book kept me on my toes the whole entire time especially in the middle of the book because it was so intense and kept me reading till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent music, not a very good recording.","review":"While a fairly decent recording of Verdi's Requiem, I can't terribly reccomend it.

Every Moen faucet I've bought lasts about 18 months and then fails. Nothing but junk. I'm on my fourth one now. One was the diverter valve to the sprayer, another the mechanism that operates the cartridge (on Christmas day no less) and another began leaking at the base of the faucet. I've just got my latest Moen 87434 faucet and guess what? Moen, for whatever reason, has changed the design of the connections to the household plumbing supply...same part number but not at all compatible with the previous product. So much for just throwing one out and throwing another in this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Touch","review":"Monique Haas recorded work by many different composers but she owned French impressionism. Her solo-piano recordings for Erato may be the best evidence of this artistry, but the preludes featured here on Disc 1 also stand out because of how well Haas was able to convey Debussy's submerged lyricism. The preludes show off her lovely sense of timing. Disc 2 is headlined by Ravel's two piano concertos, and both are worth repeat visits. What you may find stunning, though, is how successfully Haas was able to integrate both a Bartok concerto and Bartok's Sonatine into her musical universe. Compare her performance of either piece with the version recorded by, say, Zoltan Kocsis. It's hard to recognize that they're by the same composer, so thoroughly has Haas made them her own. Even if you own other performances of everything in this two-disc set, therefore, the package still wouldn't be redundant."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated gem from Joan Jett","review":"This doesn't get as much attention as some other Jett records, but it was one of her very best, right up there with \\"Bad Reputation\\". Not only does it contain the signature song \\"I Hate Myself for Loving You\\", but there are a few others that are almost as good, like \\"You Want In, I Want Out\\" and the rather explicit \\"I Still Dream About You\\". She also does a nice job with two covers, Chuk Berry's \\"Tulane\\" and Iggy Pop's \\"I Wanna Be your Dog\\". There isn't a lame or weak track on this whole record, just the straight-up, hard-driving rock that makes Jett a compelling performer. You won't sit still for long listening to this one, and the production is excellent, something not always true of Jett's recordings.

I didn't care for the Iggy cover \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\"(it's perhaps a bit too punk to be on a mainstream album like this). \\"You Want In, I Want Out\\" sounds just like \\"I Hate Myself For Loving You\\" (!) but \\"Desire\\" is full of beautiful longing and \\"Play That Song Again\\" digs deep into Jett's honest-to-God rock and roll spirit. She's been called the female Elvis. While \\"Up Your Alley\\" doesn't make a strong case for that, it's still quite decent. 'B'"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Jett's best","review":"I'd say this is tied with \\"I Love Rock & Roll\\" for Joan Jett's best album. It has a few more better songs than \\"Album\\" which is another of her's I really like. Up Your Alley is a solid CD full of good rock and roll and few-to-zero filler. Joan's vocal attitude shines on songs like my favorite, \\"I Still Dream About You\\" and the hit single \\"I Hate Myself For Loving You.\\" This one is a lot better than Good Music, Pure and Simple, the covers release, Bad Reputation, and the others.Standout tracks: I Hate Myself For Loving You, I Still Dream About You, Riding With James Dean, Little Liar"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The speaker connection was all messed up, so it made a horrible skipping sound.

You might get something out of it.If you are easily offended then don't watch it, but if you ever had any doubts, consider this: At the center of the human visual system are two potent feedback loop points (LGN) that provide the visual cortex 90% of the information we see which is generated by the visual cortex itself. Only a mere 10% of the retinal information is used in vision. This is why we can hallucinate and why eye-witnesses cannot be trusted. Once you realize that fact, then any witness becomes questionable, any gospel becomes hearsay from unreliable sources and even you should not just rely on your own senses. They can be fooled, easily.

Mr Maher is right on target with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't call it a documentary","review":"Maher raises some good points in this movie, but is arguably more stubborn in his own disbelief than the faithful are in their beliefs. Maher mostly wants to make fun of people in ill-humored jokes and make them look stupid by means of tricky editing and loaded questions. People such as Benjamin Franklin are misquoted. These things can be very deceptive. Bill Maher likes to think he knows everything that's in the Bible, but he doesn't, and therefore puts out false or inaccurate information which he then presents as fact. Maher has some decent conversations with some people, but more often he talks over them or cuts them off before they have a chance to provide a legitimate answer to his questions. If you like to watch people get poked fun at because of their beliefs, you may enjoy this film. If your looking to gain some kind of insight, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I liked the title and right after watching the trailer I headed to blockbuster. Alas, although he had picked up such an interesting subject and valid argument to cover he ruined it by very shallow argument, unprofessional sensor and editing and picking up very wrong people to prove his point of view.

What I found incredibly interesting was how a self-proclaimed rationalist wouldn't examine both sides of the argument. For example, someone who was truly rational would ask what the bads AND goods are regarding religion. Bill argues that religion IS only bad and ignores all the good that religion has provided society. So while Bill concludes that religion will destroy us, any \\"rational\\" person could easily claim that it has allowed us to survive so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and nothing new","review":"I was very disappointed when I saw this documentary. I have been waiting to see it for a long time and when it finally arrived it contained nothing intelligent or new.Bill Maher (who is relatively unheard of down here in Australia) comes across as rude, ignorant and narcissistic. As he interviews the various guests he apparently has no interest in there answers, only in making them look silly. He doesn't let anyone get a word in because he constantly interrupts them. This documentary does not have a lot of content but is merely Bill Maher talking and cutting people off. Even this would be fine if he had intelligent or well researched questions/opinions/thoughts but unfortunately he is an idiot!This documentary presents a shameful view of America to all of us living outside USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubt is humble, but Bill is not.","review":"I have never been more disappointed in Bill Maher as I have been in this program. While he makes some very strong and interesting points, his pompous attitude that he has the inside scoop turned me off. No religion has all the answers and some would say they have no answers but I would certainly have liked the opportunity to have seen some respect shown to those Maher interviewed, allowing them the opportunity to speak. In dialogue is where one learns of opposing opinions but all Maher seemed to give was his comedic responses and his dislike of anyone who thought different than himself.

My family watched this movie on Christmas day - which seems a bit wrong to some people - but I think we'll be making a tradition out of it because it actually makes a lot of sense to watch this movie on a religious holiday.

I find that our thoughts about religion and politics match almost 100%, so I try to follow on his work and make up for a lost time, ie time when I didn't know about him and his works. This disc is one of missing links so I bought it in a heartbeat.PROs:* Bill Maher in his usual mood to take on on religious nuts.* Various religious figures being put through some hard questions they don't have answers for.* Wit and humor striking against bigotry and ignorance. Hurray!CONs:* Too short. But I guess he needs to leave some material for other discs / shows.In truth, Bill Maher is saying what everybody else should know instinctively - that religion is pulling us down in the muck and that humanity will never truly be free unless we stop turning to religion for answers instead looking for them ourselves.Although short, this disc is something you will watch from start to end and over and over again. It's a good purchase folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"This is a documentary that needed to be made. A serious topic delivered with humor from Bill Maher.

We saw pictures of George Bush and John McCain and their religious beliefs mocked, but NOTHING about REVERAND Wright and his disciple, Mr. Obama.

But he considers only the violence, hypocrisy, and idiocy of religion while ignoring the compassion, charity, and inspiration. As much as I'd love to excuse this as entertainment or satire, Maher claims objectivity when much of the movie is selectively edited and downright cruel. If the billions of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the world should be discredited on the basis of a relatively small number of religious crackpots, then what do the actions of people like Stalin or Mao, who killed millions trying to purge religion, say about atheism?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary","review":"Bill Maher does not discriminate - he visits the extremists from all religions.

Maher should have come on stronger. There's nothing new in this documentary, but what was said/shown should have been a lot less white-washed and a lot more argumentative. I understand that Maher didn't want to collect death threats from zealots, but he needed to decide if he wanted to make a documentary about the hypocrisy of religion, or if he wanted to make a joke out of it.

He'd sit down with a Muslim, ask question, the guy would get 2 words out, Bill would interrupt and then cut to some unrelated movie clip for a laugh. In the movie's defense, it was pretty funny. But a lot of people take these issues seriously and I think they would have appreciated their side presented more clearly.What I liked about the movie is that Bill has researched these religions very well and he's very quick to bring up valid points to get his argument across. Unfortunately, the people he meets with aren't as quick.

People who agree with Bill like the movie, people who don't dislike the movie. There was no thought-provoking open discussion on the topic. This movie is just a thinly veiled rant about why Bill Maher feels that religion is unnecessary and harmful to society. This movie is clearly tailored to poke holes in religion and push atheism. Maybe Bill Maher has been playing in politics too long to understand what an open thought-provoking discussion actually is. Watching this movie as someone who truly does not know I found this movie to be a complete waste of time, and that Bill Maher is mocking my intelligence by posing as someone who doesn't know.

That can only be a good thing. For the wry atheist, this is alot of fun-rife with deserved mockery of its subjects, and should be considered on another level as an important pop media statement on religion and irreligion in a post-book world.I have to admire and herald a movie that is injecting little understood ideas about doubters and nonbelievers into the bloodstream of mass culture; it's critical that atheists assist believers into understanding that we too are greatly concerned with morality, if not moreso in some cases. We may laugh a little too loud at ideas we have come to consider as bizarre, and I must beg the forgiveness of the religious when we cannot suppress a grin or ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and thought provoking","review":"I will start by saying I am not a huge fan of Bill Maher however Religulous is a very good documentary but you must watch it with an open mind. The Christian (and other) faithful will call this heretical but the fact is, there are valid questions a thinking person should be asking regarding the \\"revealed\\" religions. Maher's approach limits the smugness he normally comes across with, with a more tongue in cheek style. There are some very funny comments and moments throughout the film while asking thought provoking questions. I found the movie to be entertaining.

Most of us grew up believing in Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, God--if one's family believed-- and the Tooth Fairy, but there came a time, usually in grammar school, that we put away childish things and began to deal with reality. For reasons still puzzling to psychiatrists many of us held on to the idea of old Jewish men in bedsheets flying around in the sky.

I think that the best way to approach this subject is to get the opinion of the religious, then to dissemble it using proof, and logic. However, that is not how this documentary approaches the subject. We often see Maher making personal attacks (in some cases VERY warranted) and often cutting the other speaker off without letting them finish. This gives the impression that he is a bully who wants to force others to look bad. That said, this is a very interesting video that is well worth the watch. The points and historic facts that he brings up are very important, and the way he shows that even religious leaders often don't have the answers to the most basic questions is crucial. Despite my criticism of the techniques used I still appreciate this movie as you can see with the 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"chip on his shoulder","review":"I usually love this sort of thing, but it was off-putting. All I kept thinking was \\"Wow, that is an enormous chip on your shoulder!\\" I am one who has considered and pondered the many religions and the difficulty of proving their claims. Many things are also ridiculous to me! I just couldn't get past his treatment of those who had a different opinion than his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Bill!","review":"Actually, I probably would have watched the rest of it but my wife said she knew all of this and got bored! So we have to give it two stars even though Bill is usually much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"Yes, Bill. We get it. Humans cannot prove God exists. Throughout this movie, Bill will successfully drive this point home. I like \\"Real Time,\\" and also enjoy Bill's standup. He is funny, and this movie is too. What I didnt like was the complete lack of respect in certain scenes (particularly the scene involving the small baptist church in a trailer). He barges up to the altar, slamming his hands down, telling them there is no God. I guess its just me, because this movie got a lot of great reviews, but what he did there totally turned me off for the rest of the movie. It's a funny movie, Bill is obviously smart and talks to many interesting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie but it fell short. It is hard to respect Bill Maher as a non religious person when someone says they used to party and sleep around and then they turned their life around, and Bill says \\"what was the problem before?\\" One of the worst points of the movie is that Bill obviously plays it in the \\"safe zone\\" and only goes after Christianity. It is easy to make fun of Christianity in our culture because we've had it shoved down our throats...how about exploring some other organized religions? He also should have talked to some religious scholars and not just crazy evangelicals. He is also one of those people that sees things in black and white- as in organized religion doesn't make any sense so that must mean there is no god at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow","review":"Maher's interviewees are either dim-witted or already on Bill's side. If you like this one, you'll probably also like to watch an hour and 40 minutes of somebody shooting fish in a barrel. There was a few legitimate laughs when Bill points out the hypocrisy in religion, but even these had diminishing returns as the movie progressed. If you hate religion and you're looking to fuel that fire, this is a good movie for you. If you are interested in a documentary that reflects reality in a humorous way, you're out of luck.Update:Put another way, this movie is the spiritually ignorant laughing at the spiritually ignorant with only a pretense of legitimate religious material - and thus only a pretense of religious humor. But, if you like that kind of thing, as many other reviewers apparently do, by all means stay in the shallow end of the pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood's smug view on religion,","review":"Religion can be good because it provides people with a moral compass that is higher than what surrounds them.

If you already agree with him (that religion doesn't make sense any more for his reasons) completely you'll love it. If you don't, you probably won't like this movie at all.I rented this movie anticipating that I would enjoy it, but was quite disappointed. Instead of being enjoyable in a humorous way, or in a serious and subtle/gentle way, it was a long rant by Maher. I know this is what he is famous for, but this rant made him come across as obnoxious and mean and made me WANT to disagree with him, even when I didn't. He also pushes every point too far, and therefore hurts his argument even more. Maher gets to speak with some very interesting and/or important people in this, but doesn't seem to really listen to them. His mind is already made up. Lastly, if you've ever had a college logic class, you'll recognize that he commits just about every logical fallacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Just didn't do it for me. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, the plot stinks and it's not worthy of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This movie is petty. Maher takes aim and shoots fish in a barrel. This movie is about as intelligent as some of the people it mocks. It doesn't attempt to enter into any kind of illuminating dialogue or investigation of religion. It only ridicules. If you're into that kind of thing - ridiculing people and their beliefs - then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This movie aims for a documentary style and is basically a series of monologues by Bill Maher that happen in interview-like situation.The guy got an interview style of a an annoying 9 year old. He wont let people complete their sentences acts dismissive and laughs stupidly at his own jokes. It's basically a big anti-religious ego-trip gone bad. We watched this movie in hopes of learning about stupidity of various religions, but instead we learned about Bill Maher's family and his idiotic interview style.Don't waste your time or money on this. This guy can't argue nor can he can't present a coherent story. It was a chore to finish the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Pretty good movie for nonreligious people. If you are religious... Stay away from it!!!! It has no start nor end, it's just an hour of laughing at the discrepancies on different religions. 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"All the good crazy is already taken.\\"","review":"That's one of the quotes I recall from the movie, where he talks about how increasingly loony religions have to get to top the prior crazy religions.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It's about time somebody poke religion with a sharp stick and ask questions. America is filled with a bunch of sheep that mindlessly follow myth. We're the most religious industrialized nation around with people who base their life on faith. Faith is the polite way of saying I'm going to believe this nonsense even though I have nothing to support such belief.I'm an Atheist and I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religulous Movie/Documentary","review":"Great work by Maher as usual.

A must watch for anyone who hasn't been completely brainwashed by the 'certainty' of today's religious dogma, well, perhaps for them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and so true.","review":"If you are very religious you probably will hate this video but I am not and thought it was great. All the points made in the video are exactly what I think. The people in this video are crazy and it is funny to watch them try to explain their religious beliefs to Bill Maher. I put this on in my house when people come over and they either hate it or love it. No in between. I highly recommend. I could watch this over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Told Me To Do This- It's A Miracle!","review":"Growing up Catholic, I totally related to Maher's commentary on the Vatican and church practices. Now, living in Utah...home of Warren Jeffs, gold tablets, and the wearing of \\"Jesus Jammies\\", it seems mind boggling that so few people lack a healthy dose of doubt when it comes to organized religion. This is a great documentary! I am amazed he had the chutzpah to speak out. If you are a fan of satire (ala Mark Twain, who called the Book of Mormon, \\"chloroform in print\\"), you'll LOVE this! See you in hell, Bill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good insight into religion.","review":"I thought this movie was highly thought invoking and brings up a lot of questions about religion, and I personally found it highly amusing how defensive some of the religious types got when they felt their religion to be threatened. BUT BEWARE this movie has strong one sided arguments and any intelligent viewer will take it with a grain of salt and watch it for what it is, a comedy, after all its listed as a comedy by Amazon. I would highly suggest this movie to any religious and non religious person alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upsetting, but pretty accurate review of mainstream religions","review":"If you are a religious fanatic this is definitely not for you. But then maybe you need to relocate to Iran or Afghanistan.I just hope that some Muslims at least embrace more tolerant form just as Christians and Jews have done in the past.But it is so easy to manipulate people who are blindly following \\"The truth\\" that a sleazy preacher puts in their heads..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good laughs, better logic","review":"I enjoyed Bill Maher's Religulous as, in Borat style interviews, he shows the absurdities underpinning organized religions. A great little DVD for open minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched with poor sources","review":"The main theme of this film seems to be \\"let's find the most ridiculous representations of each of these religions to prove our point.\\" I can find 20 of the biggest idiots in America which will show you that all Americans are loony idiots, but that doesn't mean that we are. The only good source is Francis Collins, and my guess is that his piece is so short because he didn't say anything ridiculous so it didn't fit into Maher's agenda. My guess is that he didn't try to get reliable sources or they just wouldn't speak with him.If you want a good laugh, then this film does a good job at providing some humor and showing some crazy people out there. But if the point is to really look at the validity of religion, this film is ridiculous - which is what I'm sure the goal of the film was - to show religion as ridiculous. It is a very biased approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Mahar is funny?","review":"Bill Mahar should have quit show business after the movie Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death. This was on par with that but not as funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I saw this in the theater and I didnt want it to end.

Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for anyone and everyone!","review":"This is an amazing documentary! I laughed. I cried. It stirs every emotion in the human spirit.

All he does is go up to simple, unsuspecting people and ambush them with insulting comments about their religions, which they are ill-prepared to defend. Did Maher really think he was so brilliant because he was able to baffle a bunch of truck drivers with some sophistic assertions about Christianity? Maher would have more credibility if he had the guts to match his snarky agnosticism against a real theologian with experience in apologetics. But Maher knew that he would have been the punchline in such a match-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hour rant","review":"Maher's mockumentary IS anti-religious. He says, \\"Religion MUST die in order for man to improve.\\" He interviews people, but rarely lets them speak because he is busy deriding their opinions. His criticisms are typically mean-spirited and arrogant. He says essentially, \\"I don't believe this so it must not be true. You should not believe it either.\\" The disturbing thing is that he suggests eliminating people of a religious bent from public debate and public policy making. I wonder what other people groups who have distasteful worldviews Maher will also suggest eliminating. I watched this video at the suggestion of a colleague. It was less than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Bill alright","review":"Hate filled smug militant atheism... expect anything else?Goes after Christians with impunity without diving into other religions too much.What about Islam, Billy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is a real Jerk.","review":"Well yes we all understand that religion and Santa Clause fill the same niche in the spectrum of human imagination.

He really did deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh, just watched this old movie and...","review":"Had someone other then Bill, say Carl Sagan, done this movie, it might have been a 3 or 4 star movie. I agree with the other reviewers that he was simply preaching to the choir. Also, I would have given it 2 or 3 stars had he actually pushed on his questioning of the Muslims he interviewed as hard as he did the Christian ones. He showed his cowardice a bit there. And it seemed after a bit as though he was intentionally picking the worst representatives of each faith. With the exception of the Catholics he spoke with. Oddly, they came across very well for their faith. Overall, had it not been free, I would not have watched nor recommended anyone else watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Horrible man makes horrible movie. What more need I say?

I am a Catholic (which is the same as saying I am a Christian) , and believe in the Bible. I thought this was going to be more serious but he did interview a lot of quacks. I think most of the preachers on TV take acting lessons before preaching, and people send them lots of money. they live high off the hog, so exposing them was good.All the people he interviewed save a couple were out in left field to say the least.Mr Maher , its not too late to be saved, and I pray you find your way."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about ridiculous??","review":"bill maher is just a self-righteous nauseating character that it is hard to take him seriously. he is trying to be funny, but he isnt.

Many of my best friends are still searching for their truth, and that's fine with me. They are good people.I understand that it's fashionable to slam anyone who believes in God, it's socially acceptable to many.It is not, however, to me. It is no better to make fun of a believer than it is to poke fun at a non-believer. How about trying this: let everyone think/believe what they want, as long as they are good people?Maher is a fool, and it should be pointed out that his intolerance is part of the problem, not a solution. He's jumping on the bandwagon and collecting his paycheck while mocking a whole segment of society simply because they don't agree with him.For the record, I feel the same way about those who call themselves religious yet mock and terrorize those who don't think as they do. They are ALL in the same boat.Maher needs a lesson in tolerance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Maher is an irrelevant individual","review":"I chose not to waste two hours of my life watching what is certainly another one of Bill Maher's attempts to cram his personal views and opinions down everyone's throats.Whether Maher is making one of his all-too-frequent visits to The Tonight Show in order to satisfy Jay Leno's left-slanted agenda, or any of his other undeserving television appearances, this overbearing piece of slime seems to thoroughly believe in his mind that whatever he thinks is right. And god forbid you have a differing view than Maher, because if you are not right in line with Maher then he will be sure to ridicule you with his smurky and arrogant manner.It's too bad that someone such as Bill Maher gets as much attention as he does. This man is completely irrelevant and does not deserve the least bit of attention. Except for perhaps a clip on the news about him getting crushed by a garbage truck.Maher and garbage, quite fitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling it straight on!","review":"All I could do during this video was either laugh or say YES!

Tactful, funny in parts, causes self-reflection and attacks paradigms accepted by people everywhere without reason or cause. A must for everyone to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worth your while","review":"What's great about this movie is that it is not trying to be disrespectful to people who do believe; It is just saying that religion is not based on facts, that the bible is not a hostorically acurate document and that religion is not your only option for having a happy and fulfilling life. Religion has been an overrated tool of power thru the history of mankind and Bill is asking the right questions to reveal just that. If you are not religious, you will see someone talking your language. If you are religious, this movie is not trying to insult you: it is asking you to think beyond what you have been told every sunday and be critical of those who try to keep you where you are. Open your mind and find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here is a better suggestion","review":"If you want to bash on people of faith, then you will enjoy this movie as it will support your presuppositions. If you want a movie that will make fun of others and asked loaded questions to people who are not really qualified to give you a solid answer, then you will like this movie.

I was curious and enjoyed watching Bill Maher do his \\"act\\" usually reserved for politics and politicians on the followers of an invisable all powerful diety. What he fails to point out in his \\"documentary\\" is many of us know the world was not created in 7 days, know no grey bearded old man lives in the sky but enjoy going to temple, church or mosque for the fellowship and sense of community it brings. Yes religion has been the basis for more killing and destruction than any other factor in history but not everyone who is religious is a killer.

I mean, who could have guessed that Maher the Bigot has a problem with organized religion. It's not enough that he has a disdain for people who practice their religion, he makes a movie mocking those same people because they haven't seen the \\"light\\" of Maher's featherweight logic. Maher was the kid in junior high that always had something to say, but could barely write his own name. Nary an original thought has passed from his brain to his mouth or in this case, his fingers. Listening to any counter arguments results in Maher using those same fingers to plug his ears and sing \\"la la la\\" much like the emotional 2 year old he is. I don't mind giving this film one star because while I was watching it, I was able to take a nice nap. A great cure for insomnia. THANKS BILL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad commentary","review":"While I agree with much of the agnostic sentiment in the piece, it adds nothing the discussion by taking advantage of those unable to defend themselves. Unfortunately Bill Maher takes up the same tactics that are employed by right wing gas-bags like Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh. They repeatedly take on 'adversaries' who are neither well-spoken nor well-informed. Although I delighted in his making a fool of one Southern Senator, I was embarrassed to watch most of other interviewees. I'm afraid Maher has fallen into the hands of the religious right who refuse to agree that \\"freedom of religion\\" also means \\"freedom FROM religion.\\" They could use this film as proof of the \\"God-less Left\\" who are attacking American values. Giving them such a tool is truly is the devil's work. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak.","review":"Bill Maher's knowledge of the Bible is absolutely laughable.

I'm not a theology major, but I could answer the questions better than most of the people he interviewed. Except in the instance of Ken Ham. That was just creative editing.This film will appeal to anybody who is weak in their faith or doesn't believe at all, so in that case it isn't a true documentary at all.

I thought Bill would have thought a little more about it and used his wit and sense to really take off on a theme that was given to him on a platter for exploitation.The movie was slow in parts, not properly welded together and did not appear to have a good development plan based on the topic. In fact, it seemed to even have lacked any solid thesis up front that would have helped to guide his efforts. Had he sat down and used the services of a proper documentary crew and planned the video the result would have been far different. It just seems like a concoction of events that he thought of as he got up each day.

The brilliant humor was interlaced with \\"wow, did they really say that?\\" moments.I thought the language (f bombs, etc) and almost constant sexual innuendo, gave this documentary its R rating, which is too bad, because other than that, it could be appropriate for a much wider audience.

I guess it was Cheryl Studer that lured me into this. And indeed her performance is good, more than capable but not great.This is not the best Otello of Domingo on record-for me that would be the one with Milnes and Scotto, a cast that I saw perform it on several occasions and each performance was rapturous. Two problems with this set: there is no chemistry between the performers and more important it is sloppily conducted. Chung conducts as if he is late for something and is hurrying to get out of the studio and on to his next appointment. The first act flies by so fast it seems to be over before it begins.Anyone want to buy a second hand copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Domingo is great again, but Leiferkus........","review":"Domingo is the greatest Otello ever. No matter what version you choose, he's a winner. But in this recording , Leiferkus has a sound voice that is annoying. He is an unbearable Casio. The Maazel-Zeffirelli soundtrack version has Justino D��az for Casio. He's diabolic, as Shakespeare wrote once: I am evil, because I am a man. (Son scelerato, perch�� son uomo)and the duet \\"Si, pel ciel marmoreo giuro\\" is a blood-chilling interpretation. Try D��az instead Leiferkus. And ultimately, try Jos�� Cura as Otello. Is the biggest surprise since Domingo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding Recording","review":"Domingo, Leiferkus and Studer all sound super human on this recording.

He makes the Bastille orchestra play like gods, and not even the Vienna Philharmonic under Karajan can eclypse them. Placido is also infinetely better than in his two previous recordings, recalling some of the vocal splendours he produced at his La Scala debut under Carlos Kleiber. Leiferkus was an odd choice for Iago, but he sings the role very well. The ever anonymous Cheryl Studer at least doesn't disgrace the set, though of course better Desdemonas are to be found in Renata Scotto and Rysanek (both RCA). This set is by a distance, the best Otello since the classic Serafin set. Much better conducted than Karajan (EMI), Solti (DECCA), Levine (RCA) or Maazel (EMI)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otello / Verdi, Domingo, Studer, Leiferkus, Vargas, D.

Graves, Schade, D'Arcangelo, Chung is a recording under the direction of Myung-Whun Chung who leads Orchestre et Choeurs de l'Opera Bastille on this Deutsche Grammophon recording from 1994. If one compares this with Von Karajan's recording with EMI from 1974 it is quite apparent that the one with Von Karajan is superior. The sound quality is a little better being that it is a Deutsche Grammophon recording. Domingo is amazing in his role as Otello. James A. Hepokoski's essay \\"'Otello' as Dramma Lirico\\" is a very well-written essay. Kenneth Chalmers has written the synopsis. The lyrics are available in English, French, German and Italian.

It also lacked the gross continuity errors and misinterpretations that routinely show up in the ST novels these days. (Well, they did use the 24th-century warp scale in a 23rd-century story, but that may have been necessary to avoid confusing casual fans.) Palmieri did a good job as editor, and the authors all did well too. There were a few proofreading glitches in the Steven Barnes piece, and Curzon's dialogue was too stiff, but otherwise it was one of the best stories. Overall, the anthology is intriguing both as a biography of an infinitely complex character and as a cross-section of Star Trek history. My only complaint is that I wanted to write a book about Dax's past lives, but Palmieri and company beat me to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read.","review":"The reason I got this book is that Jadzia Dax is my favoriteDS9 character, and the Trill species is interesting. Although it'snot the best trek book I've ever read, I only have one real problem with it and it was never boring at all. The problem I have with it is that in the Jadzia part, the author portrays her in the flashbacks as pretty much the same as she is on the show, and not at all shy and naive like she was supposed to be before joining. It had very interesting stuff about Trills, and complied with the show pretty well. But before you judge trek books based on this one, read the Invasion series, the Dominion War series, and Q-Squared."},{"rating":"1","title":"as disconnected as Ezri is","review":"This book was too quick of a read. For people as seemingly interesting as Dax's hosts have been, a ten to twelve page story about them just doesn't work. The lines are double spaced and the print is large. I felt like I was reading a paper from school where someone is trying to fill as much space as possible. The authors are relatively unknown to the Star Trek universe and it shows. I think if they would've put regular writers to the task, or even made the books a trilogy set, we would've had something worth while but as is, it's a short book that you gain nothing from.

I've always found Dax an interesting character. Jadzia was a beautiful young woman whom Captain Benjamin Sisko called \\"Old Man.\\" The reason he called her \\"Old Man\\" was because he knew Curzon, who shared his body and mind with Dax previous to Jadzia, as an elderly statesman and diplomat of the Federation. At any rate, the book follows the nine persons with whom Dax shared his life - from Lela Dax, a politician on the Trill home world, to Ezri Dax, a Star Fleet officer who did not want to be joined to a symbiont but was forced by circumstances to accept the joining.

The band that comes with the watch is nice. Had I not needed a dress watch, I would have kept the band it came with. WARNING: The manufacturer gives explicit instructions that you should follow.

If you are looking for a substantial watch, this is not it. But if you are looking for a minimalist watch, this is perfect.2. The band has grommets on it. When I bought it, the pictures on amazon did not show these. They seem to have put up more pictures that show the band. At first I didn't know how I felt about the grommets, but they have grown on me.3. Although not substantial, the watch seems to be very durable.

I would def recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great military style watch!","review":"I like this watch because it is simple, rugged, easy to read and doesn't need a battery replacement. Some years ago I was getting a new battery for another watch. The jeweler who replaced the battery said, \\"Of course, you know that when I open the case, the watch won't be waterproof any more.\\" Well, no I didn't know that but now I do. If you get a watch that has to have battery replacements, the gaskets are deformed when the case back is removed. I asked another jeweler about the most reliable watch brand. He said, \\"Citizen, based on the number of watches we get back for repairs.\\" I have a Citizen dress watch and it has been accurate and trouble-free for the last five years. It just doesn't make sense to replace batteries when you can eliminate this source of annoyance and loss of case integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"date adjustment feature failed","review":"I purchased this watch about 6 months ago. With this kind of watch, after any month with fewer than 31 days in it, the number in its day-of-the-month window must be manually reset to '1', in order for it to display the correct numbers during the following month. Today (at the beginning of December) when attempting to reset that number, I discovered that its date-resetting function no longer operates. While I've owned this watch, it hasn't been subjected to any trauma. The failure of its date adjustment feature seems to have been a spontaneous failure, in other words, which suggests to me that this model's mechanism for adjusting the date is of poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"Great watch, works like a charm.

After destroying yet another watch trying to change the battery, I decided to spend a little bit extra and get an EcoDrive that I've read so much about. I didn't want (or need) a chronograph, just something that would give me the time and date. This watch is simple and looks good. The band was a bit stiff for the first couple of days, but it has loosened up nicely. As many (many) people before me have stated, the band is a matter of choice on whether you keep it or change it out. I like the band for now, it seems like it's very durable but I can see myself wanting to change it for a leather strap sometime in the future.

The face of the watch looks much better than shown in Amazon's pictures. The canvas band is stiff and its looks don't do this watch justice. I immediately replaced the band with a black band (Hadley-Roma Men's MS3345RT 180 18-mm Genuine Silicone Diver Sport Watch Strap) which really compliments and dresses it up. The size and weight of the watch face is just right unlike many of the new watches that are too large and heavy. I just wish Citizen offered this watch with different bands (color & material) so that I did not have to replace the band on a new watch. This is my second eco-drive watch. It is great never having to worry about the watch stopping or having to replace a battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD, Rugid watch","review":"I purchased this watch from Amazon after a lot of searching and selected the Citizen Men's Eco-Drive watch and after only one week of wearing it I am quite pleased. The only aspect of the watch that is not perfect are the holes in the band. Because the holes are made of metal and the spacing of each hole is a little to far apart for my wrist so I might at some point purchase another band...but I'm in no hurray to do that. This is my second Citizen Eco-Drive watch and I like the dial face very much...it is very easy to see what time it is. Also the day and date are large enough to read...a very nice feature. As to the band, the holes are not perfect but the band material is tough and that's one of my original wants...a band that can get wet, from sweating or the rain and it's tough enough not to be bothered by moisture. Overall I feel it's a great watch and I am expecting this watch to perform like my dress Citizen Eco-Drive that I have had for seven years with no battery changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Watch","review":"I like this watch.

For the time being, it is just fine.What follows is not about the watch itself, but I'll add it anyway because it is about the buy: I wanted to order this watch from Germany. Amazon.com doesn't deliver watches to Germany. This watch is not in Citizen Europe's product range. For reasons I do not know Amazon.de and Amazon.com apparently don't cooperate on orders, so this watch is practically unavailable in Germany.I only got my hands on this watch by ordering it to a friend, and then have him send it over here, which costs me time, organisational effort, shipment cost and US and German VAT.

The Citizen brand and the EcoDrive were something that were a big plus. I've got a smaller wrist and I think the case size is good, big without being too big. I thought I wasn't going to like the band based on other reviews, but I decided to wait to buy a replacement band until I saw the watch. I'm glad I waited, it gives the watch a vintage, military look. At some point I'll probably buy a black leather or sport band and that will dress it up some more. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I've noticed under certain light, the watch face looks a little brown in the area that the EcoDrive gets it's power.

I was a bit hesitant for I had not owned a Japaneese watch before and had some reservations about the strap. I have been pleasantly suprised.

This is all three.I've had the watch for about a year now, and it has worked as expected: it keeps great time, the watch face is scratch resistant (great for me, because I walk into stuff constantly) and I love the day / date function. I love that it goes on despite being my handbag for a few days (deprived of sunlight), and I don't have to worry about batteries.But I think what really puts Citizen in a class of its own, for me, is what happened this weekend. I thought I misplaced my watch. Turns out, I left it in my jeans pocket, and threw my jeans in with the rest of my laundry. Not only did this watch survive the wash cycle, it also came out of the dryer unscathed. It works like nothing happened. The strap though, is a little crisper than usual, but otherwise it looks and functions like nothing happened.I don't think I'll be buying any other brand of watch from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but (for me) feels horrible.","review":"I got this watch one day and returned it the next. I loved the design, and the size was just right for my wrist (which is just under 7 inches in circumference). The design is such, however, on the back of the watch where the band attaches, that each of those four points rests very sharply against the wrist (particularly the top one on the righthand side). This is especially noticeable if you replace the existing two-piece strap with a one-piece nylon strap like the Martac Mil series. I'm ordering a different citizen watch that doesn't have these sharp points on the underside.This is definitely a subjective thing, so don't let it prevent you from trying this great watch, just don't be surprised if this is a problem for you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch!","review":"This Citizen is great for those who need a real watch without the bling!

However with this watch I think I do a little of both. The watch is extremely accurate .. gains only a few seconds a month according to USNO time service .. It's also a very handsome watch. I like the fact that I'll never have to replace a battery. I would prefer not having the \\"plastic\\" band sewed to the back of the nylon band, but have gotten used to that feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A watch... precisely.","review":"If you think you are going to lose a watch, but appreciate the facility a wrist watch provides, this watch is for you!I hate having to pull out my cell phone just to figure out what time it is, and that is pretty annoying, unless you are trying to give someone a message \\"You are wasting my time\\". This has exactly what you need, good sized hands, legible numbers and date/day. The canvas strap is nice since the leather ones, to my experience, have a shorter life. Plus these look great for students...Its an eco-drive, so battery life is much better, and its a citizen, so you can't go wrong on this one given its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang for the buck","review":"For $81 dollars, can't go wrong with all the features.

For the me the strap is too short on both models for my wrist. The strap looks \\"silly\\" with the metal eyelets in the strap. That being said the watch is masculine and functional. An excellent value for an eco-drive model. The case is a polished stainless steel which is the opposite of what a military outdoor watch should be. The case would be better served with a non-reflective matte finish. I believe this was a compromise by citizen to make it appeal to those looking for a fashion dress watch. Bottom line great watch, great value, a steal at this price given the eco-drive and quality of a citizen watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE WATCH, HORRIBLY UGLY STRAP","review":"WATCH IS NICE, WELL BUILT, WELL DESIGNED, HANDOSME FOR A FIELD WATCH.

Being in the military is is hard to find a watch that is tough enought to stand the rigors of training and still function as designed. I have found that in this watch. You never have to change a battery, it will fit on your wrist without catching on a military uniform, and light enough that you cannot feel it. I love the canvas strap. It can put up with water and oil better than leather. The only draw back is that it is very simple, i.e. no alarm or stop-watch, but if you can remember a starting time, you should not need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY RELIABLE ,EASY TO READ ,","review":"I LIKE THIS WATCH BECAUSE EASY TO READ THE TIME WITH DATE N DAY AND GIVES A RELIABLE CORRECT TIME /DAY N DATE AND I TRUSTED CITIZEN BRAND IS QUALITY.THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IT IS NOT LUMINOUS AT NIGHT/DARK ENVIRONMENT.......YOU CANT SEE /READ THE TIME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Was Looking For.","review":"This casual watch was a lot of fun to wear on weekends.

If I could change anything I would have prefered for the band not to have those large metal rings, but I still like the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seconds hand does not index and band is poorly made.","review":"Just got mine two days ago and I am very disappointed that the seconds hand does not index with the minute markings. It makes the watch appear cheap and substandard. The movement of the seconds hand is not crisp and defined and may be the result of a poorly made mechanism.The watch band is not to my taste and I would replace it if I were to keep wearing the watch but at this time I am considering returning it to Amazon since the poor indexing bothers me quite a bit. I don't sit there and observe the seconds hand but the fact that I know that it does not index correctly makes me feel that I am wearing a very poorly made watch.I am not recommending this product to people that are critical of quality and refinement in manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality control","review":"I order twice for the same product as a gift to my boyfriend and it bought us a lot of troubles. The first time we receive the product, the hand of the watch does not point exactly to the seconds, it is half way between each second. Besides, when we try to adjust the day,i.e Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the adjustment button will not turn and stuck on Wednesday. We returned the item and I order it again as a gift to send it to my boyfriend office. The package does not come with the gift message as it promised and this time the watch strip is defective. It produce a click, click sound when you try to put the watch over the wrist. I thought citizen is a named brand with good quality control and it turns out not."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"The quality is terrible. I've tried two of this model. The first one failed on the next day after arrival--the date/weekday wheels can no longer rotate. Amazon replaced it for free. But the same problem appeared in a few months. I had to let it sleep on my desk for several weeks until recently it fell off and the fragile glass cover broke into pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Eco-Drive - Fatal Flaw","review":"Citizen advertises Eco-Drive watches as \\"never needing a battery\\".This is not true.There is a small capacitor / battery inside the watch that will fail after 5-10 years, and it is not replaceable. It is also not covered under warranty.Basically, you need to throw away your Citizen Eco-Drive watch once it stops holding a charge. At first, a day of sunlight will run the watch for months, but the watch steadily loses power over time, until even weekly 8-hour charges in full sunlight won't keep the watch running for more than a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citizen Men's Eco-drive watch","review":"Excellent watch.

Service at Amazon is always great & reliable.Highly recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Canvas Strap Watch","review":"The Citizen Eco-Drive watch is everything I expected, a great buy for a watch of this quality. The canvas strap is too stiff and the adjustment holes too far apart. The strap is unconfortable on the wrist. I replaced the canvas strap with a leather watch band which make wearing this fine watch much more comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought in 2009","review":"I bought this watch in 2009 from Amazon and its probably left my wrist for no more than a month in that time frame except for when I purchased one for my girlfriend when we had to spend time apart, and she decided she'd rather wear mine than have a new one of her own. So now I wear the new one. Its obviously not very flashy and at this point, the watch shows some wear as scratches. I'm a healthcare professional, as is she and I wash my hands with the leather/canvas band a lot. On top of that were avid hikers and I'm a mountain biker. The watch goes everywhere I go and I don't find the band smelly at all. Maybe a little if you get down right close to it but why would you? I find that it keeps great time. Every few months i'll notice its a minute or two different from my phone and I'll change the time. I really couldn't be happier with this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool bots!","review":"i really like this mini-con team,the money you pay for them will be well worth it,i really like skyblast,so i'll give him a 5 on everything,payload is pretty cool,but i think that his legs come off too easily,and his arms are a little short,astroscope is probably the worst,his arms come off really ouickly,and lacks articulation,the requiem blaster is a cool weapon,i say buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"REQUIEM BLASTER!!","review":"The space team is really cool.

These are the worst - Don't buy this item!","review":"I bought Gril-O-Sheets to grill summer squash and zucchini on my grill.

I was glad I had already cooked my steaks and hot dogs before I put the sheet on the grill or the steaks and dogs would have been ruined. I don't know if I can salvage my grill; the gril-o-sheet melted down into my grill and has caused a big mess. My husband will have to spend a couple of hours cleaning and hopefully nothing was damaged beyond repair. The packaging says it is Proudly Made in the USA.

Easier to flip but even if you cook over low heat the grease drips down, flares up & melts the sheet. The label says should not come in direct contact with flame & that's why.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zuke","review":"I heard so much about the movie and soundtrack but never had a chance to watch the movie. I decided to get the soundtrack because of the Lose Yourself song and the Wanksta song. The cd turned out great.

My favorite songs on the cd are Rabbit Run by Eminem, 8 Mile by Eminem, Places to Go by 50 Cent, Wanksta by 50 Cent, Lose Yourself by Eminem. There are still many other great songs but these seem to have the most meaning to me, Rabbit Run especially. When Eminem says \\" Sometimes I just want to quit.. my life is just one big ball of ....

Songs by Eminem, 50 Cent, Obie Trice, Gang Starr, Nas, D-12 etc. You cant go wrong with it. There is a few weak tracks and ill explain which ones those are.

Why not put some good rap music in? Old school songs that may have inspired Em? For rap and hip hop fans, Obie Trice has to be one of the worst debut rappers since, well...Bizarre. The production value is fair, and that's saying alot. The album doesn't much follow the movie [as Eminem had promised], and besides the lead single, there isn't much to look forward to.

What makes me not give this cd a 5 star is the apperance of macy gray and boomkat, they kinda take away from the rest of the album.

Nas disses up Jay-Z hard on \\"Wanna be me\\" and Jay-z with Freeway shines on \\"8 miles and running\\". And how about rap veteran Rakim? and the inclusion of Ganagstarr. Of course there's all his label mates and newcomer 50 cent with his hit \\"wanksta\\". However what i found that stood out was Macy Grays track. She comes off better than Xzibit.

For me to benefit from this, I'd need to use the pause button A LOT!! For example, I loved the stretching segment, but Dr. Yang demonstrated the proper form one time and recommended how long to hold a stretch or how to work up to the extreme form. I probably would watch the students, then pause the video and try it out for myself. Time consuming and not the traditional \\"ride along\\" workout.

I was surprised at the number and level of techniques demonstrated. This may be a \`fundamental' video but it is definitely not superficial.Dr. Yang interacts with the students demonstrating the techniques and corrects them on the spot which I found informative and helpful; as much as or more so than the introductions to the various stances and techniques themselves. The students also appear to be diverse in their skill levels, making the instruction more realistic and applicable to the average viewer.I often found myself pondering how some of what was being presented would also apply to the forms of martial arts I have practiced. Although I do not plan to take up a serious study of Kung Fu, I found this video to be worthwhile and applicable across multiple styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Building Blocks for Kung Fu","review":"This is a great dvd. As mentioned by other reviewers there is not a lot of combat application nor are their full sequences--Dr. Yang has many other dvds that feature these! Instead, this is a very thorough presentation of the basics: stretching, stances, hand drills, foot drills and distance. The combat applications and the more complex forms cannot happen properly, efficiently, and effectively without these fundamentals in place. In particular, I appreciated the stance sections.The pacing is fast enough that this is truly a demonstration or presentation tool--not a workout video; trying to do the stances or drills for the length of time they're on the screen won't give you sufficient training. Rather, study the stances and drills and do them for the recommended time.Once again--another great training product from Dr. Yang and YMAA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and not that great","review":"I don't know what all the hype is about this brand of chocolates.

Also, Jillian seems like she's just kind of winging it every time she talks...like there is no script.

It stays warm for only about 20 minutes, but that seems worth it to me at this price. I like the seams throughout--the rice and other filling agents can't get all bunched up in one place. I do find it to be a bit too long than works for my neck and simply tying the strings together is not enough to have it fit snugly around my neck, so--though it looks a bit crazy--I just rubber band the extra and it fits fine. Also, it says it's for neck and shoulders, but that's just not so. Great for the neck, but doesn't even touch the shoulders. Worth it if all you need is for it to cover your neck or you have something else that's great for the shoulder area which might be a good idea to switch to anyway once this one cools down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped opened up after 1.5 minutes in microwave","review":"Liked in the beginning.

The machine is not heavy, isn't as loud as my Hoover vaccum cleaner, and does a decent job. My finacee moved into our apartment four months before I did, and the cream-colored carpet was clean then. Between him dropping food and drink onto the floor constantly, and his cat leaving hairballs all over, the carpet was badly stained by the time I moved in. While the Bissell didn't completely remove all of the old stains, the dirty water showed that the cleaner had done a decent job. I am pleased with the results for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cleaner","review":"This Bissell was great. I followed the directions and it was so simple. You have to get use to the trigger and letting go as you push and pull the steam cleaner. It took pet stains, baby stains and drink stains out of my carpets. I have a variety of carpet styles from thick pile/shag berber to low pile nylon carpet. I would recommend this to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone with kids has got to have one of these!","review":"After a year of baby barf, pee, and poop, plus whatever the cat decided to throwup on the living room carpet, I decided it was time to invest in a carpet cleaner. I did an extensive search on the internet for the best product, and the Bissell 2070 looked great. Just about all the reviews were positive, unlike a lot of other machines, so I decided to give it a try.I have to say I love this machine. Not only was it easy to assemble, it worked great. It's lightweight and user friendly, plus it didn't cost me an arm and a leg. And the best thing: my carpet is now clean. Resolve and a rag can remove stains and make the carpet look pretty clean, but it sure couldn't remove the nasty stuff the Bissell sucked up.What a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The little cleaner that could.","review":"I have used the larger carpet cleaners made by Bissel. This unit is smaller, basic unit that not have any accessories. Nevertheless, it does an excellent job of cleaning carpets. It's size makes easy to use and store. It's reasonable price makes it disposable. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What steam?? BEWARE!!","review":"The name of this product is TOTALLY misleading -- a LIE. I bought it because I wanted the cleaning power of STEAM - which it says right in the name! What I got was a tool for applying rug cleaning solution - who needs that? Resolve makes a good foam solution you apply with a 50 cent sponge. My respect for Bissell went waaay down. To add insult to injury, I have to pay shipping to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suction","review":"I really only use this if there is a bad spill or occasionally I'll clean the stairs with it. Once a year I have professionals come clean all my carpet. One told me not to put soap/cleaners on stains, always try hot water first. The soap will attract dirt in the future. Often I'll heat up water in the tea kettle and pour it on the spot then suck it up with this. This machine does a fantastic job sucking the water out of the carpet. Recently a cup of coffee spilled leaving a broad area stained. Poured the hot water on and used the Bissell to pull it up--stain gone, carpet completely dry. Prob. should have just got one of those little hand held stain removers but most people don't seem to like them much. This machine was easy to assemble and the tanks for water/dirty water are easy to manage as well. I'm not mechanically adept, either. It's lightweight and easy to push/maneuver. I've had mine for almost 3 yrs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell is the Best!","review":"I have owned this machine for almost 2 years and use it often. I am always amazed at how much dirt it extracts for such a lightweight small machine. I have one carpeted room in my house, which my dogs love ( the rest of the house is hardwood), so I shampoo it often. I have owned larger machines in the past and this Bissell shampooer works 10 times better. This quality machine convinced me to buy a Bissell vaccuum when my third Hoover died in less than 3 years total."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Apartments","review":"I bought this machine after reading all the rave reviews. I'm loving it. Easy to use, easy to assemble. I was a bit squimish about rental machines that have been used to clean baby puke and pet stains (I have neither) so buying was the way to go. I have a big apartment (by NYC standards) with wall-to-wall and can't imagine needing a larger machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love obscure manga..","review":"I borrowed this from a friend of mine, and I didn't think I would like it at first, but now I love it!

Cleaning the filter was a dirty job, but I found that doing it under running water works great and there is no dust or mess.Cons:Didn't pick up things as well as my old vacuum cleaner. Didn't have any of the extensions gadgets I really needed to get behind things or in corners. After using it for just over a year I got that funny burnt motor smell and it died completely.I guess it's not bad if you have a small place and no kids or pets, but for anything else I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this vacuum after researching for about three weeks after my Hoover died. Mind you that I do not own another vacuum and didn't vacuum for three weeks. I should also mention that I have two kids under the age of four and two indoor cats that shed all over. The day I received the new Bissell, I quickly put it together and vaccumed the entire house- all 1200 square feet of carpet. The dirt cup wasn't even half full. My old Hoover would be full after just one room so you can imagine my disappointment since this vacuum got such rave reviews here on Amazon. My recommendation- don't waste your money on this vaccum. There are definitely better ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this vacuum four months ago after reading numerous reviews. The first couple of times that I used it, I loved it. It felt like it was self-propelled, did a good job on my carpets (two German shepherd dogs) and is VERY easy to clean.However, the suction hose has terrible suction, it won't pick up ANYTHING unless the hose is right over top of it. And when I turn the vacuum on after dumping the canister, dust particles shoot out from either the front or the side (I can't tell where it is coming from). Also, dog hair gets trapped in the top filter and I have to pull it out with my fingers even if the bottom canister is empty. I had high hopes for this vacuum based on the reviews now I'm ready for a different vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell 35931 Not so great","review":"I am not all that happy with the Bissell 35931. The actual vacuum to me, has'nt any umph or power. It does alright vacuuming low carpet, but regular carpet, forget it! And hardwood floors or linoleum, you better be wearing shoes. Because if you are bare foot, your feet will have a nice loofa scrub from the back fire. As for the hose, the suction is awful and hardly picks up a thing. You have to be right on top of the object to pick it up. And the hose does not come with an upholstery attachment. Not worth the money. I am returning my 35931. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a crap!!!!!!","review":"I couldn't believe it. May be the earlier reveiws were biased, or someone purposely did so to boost this one.

I cannot, however, concur with the other reviews. I found the book to be dry and very limited in its discussion of followership. The focus is the continuum between leadership, management, team work, aupervisor, protege, mentor and follower. While this concept in itself is of value, the book really was not what the title promised nor did it leave me pleased with my selection. Even the focus of the book, the continuum between leadership and followership was lacking.These other options are available;* Followership: How Followers Are Creating Change and Changing Leaders by Barbara Kellerman* The Art of Followership: How Great Followers Create Great Leaders and Organizations by Ronald E.

So if you are taking photos to get a wide look at scenery or anything else, you won't get it.3. Megapixel count. The way it is 10.1 MP is by having that in a non 4x6 mode.

Seems, although the pictures I've copied to an SD card are in JPEG format, this frame won't acknowledge the pictures I've taken w/my Canon and other digital cameras. Went to software to see if I needed to Sync it and the software doesnt recognize/acknowledge the frame (only cameras). Also, cant get Kodak picture transfer software to work to transfer files via computer/USB. The Kodak website contact/chat room is closed and, of course, there's no \\"800\\" number to call anyone either. Should have done more research before buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Picture Quality, needs better wifi usability","review":"This photo frame has great picture quality, runs video and music files and overall looks good.The wifi works good but you'll want to be a more advanced user to get use out of it. I'm fairly geeky and I think I'll just stick with the card slot. The Kodak Photogallery software is also cumbersome. You can download it from thier site to try it out before you buy the frame.The documentation is minimal and poorly written. I was under the impression that I could copy files over the network to the frame and play them, nope. I also misunderstood and thought family and friends could email photos directly to the frame through my network, if it's there I couldn't figure it out. Maybe you'll have better luck with the wifi.Even with the preconceived misunderstandings, this frame is a good product and you can navigate (with proper premissions) your entire network and play all sorts of media files."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy, Happy, Happy","review":"Im in IT so, when I initially tried to hook this up, I looked into it too much and made it more difficult than I needed. After attempting to hook this through my home wireless network for a second time, it didn't take more than 5 minutes! Music and pictures are loaded and all is well! I have the clear frame in the mail as well so, that I can change it from the black. I love this product! Not having to worry about having enough storage space is exceptional and so worth the extra money for those with wireless networks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kodak EX 811","review":"This frame is very cool. They have some bugs to work out as far as updating software and the ease of set up. Once we got through that the frame is very cool. It has features we did not even know about. It goes out to our Kodak Gallary and gets pics to play. You do not just have to get them from the PC. Lots of fun to have and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I expected more from Kodak. The stand on the back of the frame is flimsy and the frame keeps falling over.

I have found that it will meet all my needs for a picture frame. I have not used all the features however I am writing this to warn buyers to be careful of paying over the msrp on this unit and the sv 811, many dealers are charging way over the asking price from Kodak. Check the Kodak site for the fair price. A fair price is around $ 169.00 some are asking around $ 199.00- 225.00the only problem I recognized right away is that the stand is not going to support the unit. I fixed the problem by going to walmarts and purchasing a picture frame stand, problem solved. update as of Jan 26th'Check the price at Kodak store they are going for 199.99 and I think this is high for the unit. I paid 166.99 at Amazon just about a mounth ago they will go down.

I am a network engineer with 10+ years of experience and this frame is the crapiest WiFi implementation I've ever seen.* Interface is real clunky.* The frame can not auto start and display pictures out of your kodak gallery without the need to go play around with the remote.* Technical support is a frustrating experience: Long wait and they do not know a whole lot either.* A very frustrating experience really... Too bad I can not give 0 stars on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good as it seems","review":"The Digital Frame itself works but the wireless capability is a disaster.

Pictures are good quality. Memory holds quite a few, but not as many as using the SD card. Remote works well and set-up is very easyMinuses - doesn't randomly sort pictures. SD card has to be pulled out and re-inserted each time it comes on to see pictures on card (this is the biggest minus).

Probably wouldn't pay for WiFi capability next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description.","review":"We returned the frame without even trying to load it.

It can be summed up thus: A group of wealthy British show-jumpers spend most of their time sleeping with their grooms, each other's wives, husbands, friends, and then occasionally, they compete in show-jumping competitions. That's about it for the plot. The constant sexual conquest games get really boring after a couple of hundred pages. Actually, I'm being generous: I was turned off on them before the end of the first chapter! Nothing much else goes on in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trashy novel","review":"If you are ever in the mood for a good trashy summer beach novel this is the one to read (no summer or beach actually required).

An excellent read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Before You Invest","review":"Jilly Cooper writes extraordinarily well. Her characters are well drawn and, at first, worth the time. The horse world scenes are well-done and are what drew me to the novel in the first place. At last, an adult horse novel! Unfortunately, it became too \\"adult\\". Midway through the book are 300 pages of increasingly graphic and obscene sex, which continues until the author completely abandons plot and character, then tacks on an ending to what was an interesting story. The book involves a considerable investment in time and money.

This book took me all over the place. To begin with, I am a horse lover. If you're not, you wouldn't like this story. The story was very long but I stayed wrapped up in it. There's a lot of relationships, hardships, sex-ships, etc. I have a feeling, I'll read the sequel to this one and soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art imitates life!","review":"This book is an incredible romance novel for anyone, but it is especially intriguing to anyone familiar with the hunter/jumper circuit both here and abroad.

A good friend of mine that has been around the circuit a great while let me on this little secret after I read the book. Very intriguing!

One of the most well-known folk tales in the Southeast Asia region."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AWESOME","review":"I like the grand Zefirelli traditional stagings of Verdi operas, but Wagner's Ring is a totally different kettle of fish, since it is located in mythical, not real time. That is where Robert Lepage steps into and delivers with a wallop. Worth every penny, believe me. The bonus disc is indispensable. Watch it before anything else. I had no idea of the risks the best voices in the universe take while walking up or sliding down a multitude of pirate's planks. This is a set of records I will watch repeated-ly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your handling of a replacement product was excellent, but.............","review":"Wagner's operas \\"the Ring Cycle\\" produced by the Met is exceptionally great! The company that produced the DVD's of the live production did a fine job, with one exception. All five DVD's offer subtitles in different languages, otherwise enjoyment of the performances is greatly diminished, bcause you don't know what the performers are saying. Four of the five DVDs have this available. One of them was produced erroneously, because the only subtitle available is in German. Deutchegrammaphone, who produced the DVDs, must have made this same error on the entire production run, because the replacement set you sent me had the same error. It is on the DVD titled \\"Gotterdamerung\\". Perhaps you could inform them of this error and they can fix it. Then you can send me that corrected version. I, and all of their thousands of other customers would be very grateful.Thank you.Bill Conlin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Opera","review":"Great opera, just finished the second one on PBS tonight. wish this DVD set has multi foreign language subtitle. so that more people in the world will enjoy this great production from Metopera."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing Ring","review":"I find it really interesting that as of this point, people have either given this five stars, or one! So, people loved it, or hated it. I LOVED it. I thought it was brilliant, had spectacle without detracting from the singing, and told the story in a new and exciting way. I have several friends who are \\"Ring Fanatics\\" (one did his dissertation on it) and they loved this production too. I love that they pushed the boundaries of live performance technology, and in my opinion, they had a ringing success. The projections look gorgeous on the BluRay, better than in the movie theatre. WAGNER'S DREAM IS INCLUDED IN THIS BOX SET AS A BONUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ring to be avoided","review":"I'm surprised that this production, which has gotten so many bad reviews from critics, is rating so well on Amazon. To me it was an overly traditional production void of any personality. It was empty, both figuratively of emotion and drama and literally with the stage set. I don't understand how it was marketed as spectacular and revolutionary when it was really boring and despite the gigantic Machine, quite a small production with not much going on.The singing is top notch but if you're not going to enjoy the visuals you might as well get yourself any other Ring Cycle. For now I recommendWagner: Der Ring Des Nibelungen [Blu-ray], with a similar projections approach but order of magnitudes better. If you're looking for the best of the best, getDer Ring Des Nibelungen [Blu-ray], easily the best Ring Cycle (at least until the L.A. Ring Cycle is filmed), or the Centennial Production if you can find it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rendering of Wagners Ring","review":"It took me a while to get used to the new staging but by the end of \\"Das Rheingold\\" I just loved it. The performances are all at least very good with Eric Owens as Alberich and Debra Voigt as Brunhilde being particular standouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunner.","review":"This production is one that will take your breath away. The controversial technicality of the staging paid off and then some, and the singing is some of the best I've heard. I have to say that Deborah Voight as Brunhilde was, to my ear, past her prime, though as an actress she looked and performed fantastically. Bryn Tervel is a terrific Wotan, and the rest of the cast are simple superlative. You have to see this production to believe it.

While I think it would do a great job for someone who lives alone with no animals, I (with two kids, and a dog)thought it left something to be desired. Even though I SWEPT MY FLOOR THOROUGHLY PRIOR TO USING, the steam basically left wet globs of dust/dirt/hair wherever it was when I stopped pushing it and started pulling back. (Picture vacuuming motion.) To avoid this I could only PULL which meant lifting it on every pass. Needless to say that got a little old. As long as your floors are basically clean already, this will work great. Anyone else might want to consider something that has a vacuum as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks","review":"I got this steamer about a month ago. First time I used it , it was great.

I have tried to use it several more times, (sucker for bunishment) and it still keeps leaking all over the place.

And for once I found something that everyone agrees works great! Now I find that Bissell has discontinued it! WHY??? It did wonders on my ceramic tiles and my wood floors. I loved the fact that it steamed cleaned everything. I even compared it to Hoover's bare floors steam cleaner with its brushes and it's own cleaner. That was harder to use and made my floors look dull. I even have the another steam cleaner that doesn't do as well on floors as this machine. Bissell doesn't seem to have a replacement to it either. Everyone should write to Bissell and request they start making it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so much better than a mop and bucket!!!","review":"I have had this steam mop for over a year now and I just don't know what I would do without it! I remember the first time I used it and it left a few streaks. I soon realized after using it a couple more times that it was only because of the built-up residue from all of the other chemicals I had used on my hard floors (hard wood cleaner) that resulted in the initial streaks. After only a couple uses, I no longer had streaks and my floors were the cleanest they had ever been. With two young kids, I wouldn't use anything but this mop on my floors. My floors never felt so clean, whether it's the bathroom or kitchen. The suggestions about the cord are right on, longer would be much better. If it gets clogged, just follow the instructions to clean head with vinegar, it's only happened once to me and I use it weekly! Love, love, love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapor-steam cleaners","review":"After much research on vapor-steamcleaners I purchased the Bissell steam mop. Being a teacher I wanted something that would clean my wood floors without chemicals in a short amount of time. Working full-time and being a full-time mom I wanted the best product available for a resonable price. The vapor-systems that are on the market are overwhelming. This product worked fine on my wood floors but I needed a more powerful unit for the tuff projects. I purchased a more powerful unit from vapor-systems and between my Bissell and vapor-system I am the cleanest home I know of! These are great products for the busy homemaker. I keep finding new ways to use my cleaners everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not what I had hoped for","review":"I have ceramic tile that is textured, not smooth, throughout my entire house. The dirt really collects in the little indentations. This steam mop does an adequate job at best, as it does not remove the ground-in dirt nor clean the dirty grout. I find that I need to spritz a little ammonia/water sol'n on first then bend down and scrub the really bad spots with a scrub brush. I have two dogs and their drool hardens into a cement-like substance that even repeated passes with this mop does not get up. I wish it had brushes on it as well, then maybe it would do the job (and save my back). It is about as powerful as a steam iron, taking many slow passes. It takes a little longer than regular mopping but doesn't push around dirty water like mops do. This steam mop is just slightly better than a regular mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaned the Finish right off the floor!","review":"The Bissell Steam Mop faded the finish on the hardwood floors.My floors have three coats of polyurethane. They are sealed hardwood floors. The steam mop is not safe for hardwood floors unless your floors were factory finished.I am now awaiting Bissells response as to how they are going to handle the $300.00 damage to my floor.

I just wish they made one that was more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love it !!","review":"I have had my steam mop for more than a year and it is great. It does a great job of cleaning my linoleum in the kitchen and it is especially nice in the bathrooms because it fits easily in the hard to get places,i.e. behind the toilet. I think that my husband likes it even more than I do. When he is at home, he will insist on doing the mopping. My daughter-in-law likes it so much that she had to get one as well. I use my carpet vacuum on the linoleum before I mop it and when I am finished there is no grit and my floors are beautiful. The mop is light weight and is very easy to operate. It is very uncomplicated plus there are no chemicals involved. If something isn't convenient, I won't use it. The steam mop is very convenient and user friendly. It would make an excellent gift for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mop!","review":"I almost talked my wife into getting one of those Swiffer Wet Jets but after reading the countless reviews on Amazon about how horrible Swiffer products are, I decided to check out this Bissell Steam Mop.We have hardwood floors and tile throughout our house and they definitely needed a good mopping. Wow did this mop do the trick! On one small tank of water, I mopped half the house. And it wasn't slow at all as one reviewer suggested. Perhaps the difference is that I kept a steady stream of steam going.In any case, I love this product. The pads are reusable and the only replacement part seems to be the filter.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the pad gets really dirty really quickly. If it came with two more pads, in addition to the two it comes with, you could switch out pads regularly and be sure you're mopping up the dirt and not spreading it around. So if you're going to buy this, buy two more pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it's weight in gold!","review":"I'm very picky about mops and cleaners. I hadn't found a mop that could do a better job than I could on my knees with a scrubbie and a bucket of Pine-sol. I read the reviews for this product and hesitantly decided to give it a try. It is everything that it promised to be. If mine broke today, I would run right out tomorrow and buy myself another one. I would also pay twice the price if I had to--I LOVE IT THAT MUCH !! I have five children and a farm, and we know pretty much everything there is to know about dirty floors. This mop is almost a miracle. I bought an additional 2 mop cloth thingys, and I'm glad I did that. Now I always have clean ones ready at a moment's notice, even when I mop every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!","review":"I have been dreaming of an easy way to really clean my hard floors for so long!

I have white tile with white grout and sealed hardwood. The first time I used it, I could not believe the amount of dirt the mop head picked up from my \\"clean floors\\". I changed the soiled terry cover about halfway through, as simple common sense would dictate. As with ANY mop, you MUST VACUUM FIRST. This is basic housekeeping knowledge. If you expect this mop to carry away large debris, forget it. Buy a vacuum cleaner or hire a housekeeping service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mop that really cleans","review":"I love this mop. After using it I know my floors are truly clean and sterilized. I have a dog, cat and toddler and this mop is the only thing that actually removes the dirt and build up from my tile and hardwood floors. Other mops I have tried only move the dirt around. The only downside is the mop pads that shrink when you wash them. I can still get them on, but it takes more effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"I LOVE THIS MOP!!!! No more chemicals (for the floor), and the pads are reuseable. Having 2 kids, they like to follow me everywhere, and not having the chemicals, I don't have to worry about them stepping on the newly mopped floor.

I couldn't be happier with it. I don't seem to have the problem with putting the pads on - maybe they improved them before I bought the machine.I live in a house in the woods with my husband and three dogs. We have no lawn - just dirt, weeds, leaves, stones and the river. So, mopping is never ending around here. I needed something that works well and is not a hassle to deal with and got both in this product.I would also like to say that Bissel has a very good customer service and they are very patient and helpful if you have questions or problems.I highly recommend this mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!!","review":"To start off, I would not even give this 1 star, but I have no choice!! I bought this 1 year ago and only used it 2 times. It made more work for me and did not clean anything. I have tile floors in the kitchen, laundry room and bathroom which is not smooth and all this thing did was put steam on the top. After going over it 6-7 times and nothing but alot of water, I had to get down on my knees and clean it. Also, it does not get very hot which I was told it would do. So for the last year this thing has been hanging in the garage, but this Thursday, it will go into the trash. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone wants to borrow mine!","review":"After reading the reviews I finally purchased the steam mop. I was so sick of mopping around dirt with a regular mop. I have about 900 sq ft of tile, so I recommend if you have big areas to clean, get the extra mop heads. 900 sq ft area needs a total of four heads, to get the job done. I used to have a problem with streaking and spotting - but I haven't had that problem with the steam mop. I haven't tried tap water. I just filled some clean plastic milk jugs at one of those distilled water machines outside the grocery store. So - for less than a quarter's worth of water - the filter will last longer - and you will be streak free. I love it!

Instead of cleansing steam, I got lots of hot water that was just pushed around on my tile floors and in the grout lines. I had to get a mop and bucket to soak up all the water, which by now was dirty and cold. I went through three pads in less than 1-1/2 hours only because of so much water and having to use a clean dry pad to get up the dirty water before getting my mop and bucket. Water turned to steam and little canister was empty within 10 minutes, had to keep refilling too often. This was the worse product I have ever purchased and I would not recommend it for tile floors of any kind. Did get a refund and was very satisfied with Amazon.Com and will purchase again from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great - Expect a 3yr Life","review":"This is a great product that works as advertised. My wife and I bought this about 4-5 years ago and is has worked very well getting our laminite wood floors clean. We have two large dogs and two kids so our weekly or twice weekly routine is to use the bare floor attachment on the cannister vacuum to pick p all dog hair and larger particles. We then heat up the Bissell with distilled water and put the mop-head on. It usually only take a couple of minutes to be ready to go.Pros:- Heats up quickly- Really does steam the floors clean- No residue- Very little excess water on the floor and when there is, it can be taken up quickly- Stores well in the broom closetCons- Ours broke down after only 3 years. We liked it so much and there is nothing else like it so we will buy another one- Cannot take up everything.

This is the first mop that I have ever liked... I no longer need to use any cleaning product on my kitchen floor. My hands will not dry out anymore from the chemicals I had used. The HOT steam really cleans and sanitizes just like the product claims. The Terry Cloths are very well made and easy to clean in the washer.( I wish they were a little easier to put on after drying them, but I have gotton the hang of it.)

I know that my floors are clean after I am done with this, so I can recommend the item. I only give four stars for two reasons:1- Getting the terry cover on is a pain. Takes several tugs and the pull string thingy doesn't work very well.2 - It doesn't leave floors with that shine that you get with murphy's soap and you have to go over some spots with a towel because you get water droplets that, if left to dry, cause spotting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working just after warranty ended","review":"I've owned the steam mop for just over a year.

The last time I saw it was five years ago in college. I thought it was even better the second time. Let me start by confessing I have not read the books, so I can not present such a critical review as others, but maybe that is for the better. If you want to see a good enjoyable movie then this stands on its own quite well. In an age of countless blue screens and special computer effects lets take a minute to remember when a great movie like this could be made with \\"real\\" people, minimal action, and (god forbid) subtitles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I read the book first","review":"I have no quarrel with the acting or filming which is very good.The major problem here is with content.1) The Neanderthal weren't cross fertile with modern humans ( cro-magnon men).2) In fact from bones found in Neanderthal camp fires, they ate humans.3) The sling, like the bow and arrow, were later in the stone age;spear throwers were the height of technology closer to this era.I think that a more authentic representation of Neanderthalsmight be in order. Apparently if not at war with them from 40000 bcto 28000 bc, humans at least did not associate well with Neanderthals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I have read all 5 of the \\"Earth Children\\" series, which are wonderful books. Jean Auel is one of the best writers I have ever read. I've read the complete series at least 6 times and look forward to the 6th and final book. As for the movie, it may be the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen. In my opinion, an hour and a half simply isn't enough time to capture the true context of the story. Perhaps after the 6th book is released another try at a screenplay should be made. Maybe a mini series would be appropriate so there would be enough hours to convey the story line properly. To be fair to the attempt at a recreation of the story in film, the effort was there. I think with the modern special effects this could be a well made movie. Even though the movie was a disappointment I still love the series and learned a great deal about the ancestors of our time from Jean Auel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom's review was classic!","review":"As a deep and true Auel fan, I was embarrassed for the movie, even, as they say, for a part played by Darryl Hannah. How do you *do* a movie like this effectively? Hollywood, I have to give you credit for trying, but I vote that it didn't hold a candle to the book. Still trying to get her latest novel! Thanks, Tom, from a tall blonde! How hysterical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"Having read all of Jean Auel's books on pre-historic earth a minimum of 3 times each, I was extremely disappointed in the \\"movie rendition\\" of \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\". Seems as though the only things kept from the actual book was the book title and names of the characters. A real disappointment. Ms. Auel's book deserved better. Someone should take the whole series of books and make a TV mini series from them and keep it true to the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"now I understand why it was 3 dollars","review":"I bought this movie because I was reading the series and was interested to see what it would be like.

I thought it fit pretty well with the story. However, a couple major aspects made it painful to watch. The movie attempted realism but completely disregarded major things.All the women had shiny and freshly shaved legs. This was a large distraction from the period the directors were trying to create.Also, there was too much of a sense of the 20th century. The characters movement was at times very modern as was the quality of speech.The directors could have done a much better job with the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"have read the books and enjoyed the video","review":"the video is well done. it follows so much of the book, which i'm happy i read before seeing the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine job, but needs the sequel","review":"They did a fine job making this great book a movie, but it needs the sequel so you can find out what happens to Ayla.

I am going to watch the second movie now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for it","review":"I did not think the movie did justice to the book. The movie omited and changed very important things like the birth of Durc and how she was sentenced to the final death curse. Those things were the basis for feelings in the following books. If they wanted to move to the next book, it could only be worse, because of the lack of attention given to vital parts of the movie. Granted, they cannot include every detail, and naming each plant would have taken up too much time, but I think it could have been done with a little more care for the story line. If I hadn't already read the book, I would not have been interested in reading it after the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have the book?

I got the movie after the book. Big mistake. This is less then a poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful book, disappointing film","review":"How can I count the ways that this movie is disappointing? First off - the main character in the book starts off as five years old and at the end of the book is about 14...Daryl Hannah is beautiful but way way too old to play the part of Ayla. That is the most obvious to me. When this movie came out I was excited because this is one of my favorite books of all time, but I was bitterly disappointed...The book is so wonderful that it deserves a much better film representation than this one. I heard that Jean Auel (the author) got the movie rights back, so maybe someday we will see a better effort on this story and the other books in the series. Personally, I think that this is a story that would be better animated, especially with the Pixar process...I thought of that when I watched \\"A Bug's Life\\" with my nephew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big plusses, Bigger minuses","review":"The cover art is great and Daryl Hannah can't help but be beautiful. The music is full of portent as it highlights the arrival of a superior being. Unfortunately, the movie is difficult to watch: enough to make one throw one's hands up in dismay with the realization it isn't going to get any better. Where is the acting? Not the high school kind, how about some real acting? How about some material or direction for the actors to work with? Buy the soundtrack CD if you like, but don't waste your money on the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film ever!!!","review":"This was the worst movie based on a book I have ever seen! I love the Earth's children series and was very excited when i found out Clan of the cave bear had been made into a movie. I was very disapointed! The film makers involved took a great story and ripped it's soul out. They butchered very important story lines, and the Characters were badly directed. What was left was a poor excuse for a story. After wasting 90 minutes of my life on this film all i could do was BEG for it back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse","review":"I would say this movie made an honest effort on trying to make a movie adaption of this classic book. However, it falls far short of doing the book any justice. About half of the book is cut out of this screenplay and it loses almost all of the atmosphere that the book created. All that is left is a hour and half movie that tries to make up for a lack of script and life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as good as Planet of the Apes","review":"This film is visually pleasing. It has many great shots of natural scenery in northwestern Canada. Drawn out and boring. Recaptures your attention when it's unintentionally funny. Quest for Fire is a much better film in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did they stray so far from the book storyline?","review":"If you don't read the book this may have been a decent movie when it was made in the 80s. It was not what I wanted since the book was one of the best I've read. I can't imagine why they would change it so much because it would have been better if they followed the storyline.Maybe there was just not enough time to really capture the essence of the book. I certainly do not agree with the changes they made and the only redeeming factor was Daryl, who was far too old for the 12 year old girl in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful analysis","review":"David Broder takes a serious and thoughtful look at the initiative and referenda process in the US. After developing several case studies from a variety of states, Broder grapple the tough issue of achieving a balance between direct popular control and the Constitution's representative framework. He does a good job of letting both sides speak for themselves rather than imposing his own arguments on people from both sides of the issue who often make their points quite elegantly. While some reviewers are obviously distressed by Broder's rejection of some of their views, I think most readers will find this book an excellent starting place for discussions on initiative and referenda's contribution to democracy and its many meanings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Initiative?","review":"Broder presents the origins and history of Initiative and lays out many negative aspects pertaining to its modern practice, based on his own perceptions and conclusions. He apparently does not see any good aspects, now or in the future. A dim view indeed, as if it were not possible to improve the process at all.The most galling point taken by this reviewer is that Broder does not acknowledge that the people are sovereign and have the right to legislate directly, even if they do not always have the means or process in place to do so.This type of one-sided presentation could serve as a catalog of wrongs to be fixed and might be useful in that respect. However, the shortcomings of the Initiative process have already been addressed in the Direct Democracy Initiative proposal by former Senator Mike Gravel and the Philadelphia II organization. Broder mentions this effort but dismisses it based, apparently, on his foregone conclusion that Initiative is dangerous at all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armada Super-con Optimus Prime","review":"It frustrates me to hear him refered to as the \\"scaled down\\" or \\"matrix-less\\" Armada Prime. I'd like to think of the $ version (which I also own, regretably) as the deluxe model, or the toy company's current pride-'n-joy. However, this little Prime cements a theory of mine that the best Armada toys can be had for around $ or less. Next to the original Optimus (or the current re-issues of him and his Powermaster self), this is all the Prime you'll ever need. Posable, portable and bearing a striking likeness to the original, Supercon Prime provides the best update of the classic character in 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ravel","review":"I won't waste time writing about Bolero other than to say it is a great performance. It speaks for it self. The other works on the disc hold far more interest and here Boulez and the BPO are glorious. The Mother Goose ballet sounds creamy and rich without losing its chamber music like textures. Boulez and the BPO color this ballet and play it to the hilt. It comes of not as a show piece for the great BPO but as music...music the orchestra does not encounter often. They make the most of their chance and then some with this performance.The other 2 works on this disc get the same kind of care. Both are great performances. The playing is unequaled and Boulez show's that he is not the cold condcutor that many make him out to be.This is a classic disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Finest Ravel Digital Recording","review":"Pierre Boulez leads the Berlin Philharmonic in vibrant, exhilirating performances of Ravel's most notable orchestral works. I doubt I have heard the Berlin Philharmonic play with as much passion as it does for Alborada del Gracioso, Rapsodie espagnole, and Bolero. Their performance of the Ma Mere l'Oye is also quite passionate. Boulez proves he is one of Ravel's foremost interpreters on this amazing CD. These splendid performances are greatly enhanced by some of Deutsche Grammophon's finest digital sound recording. If one is searching for the finest recording of these popular Ravel works, then this exceptional CD is it. I thought Haitink's and the Boston Symphony Orchestra's Ravel recording for Philips was the current cream of the crop, but Boulez and the Berlin Philharmonic have surpassed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad to Be True","review":"It's hard to imagine how anything this bad gets released.The plot, script and direction are below freshman level.When Sheedy isn't looking bored rolling around in bed she looks downright dowdy in a Kmart wardrobe.In fact she looks terrible and sounds worse.Martinez has the false intensity of a soap opera star.

(I like the camo pattern)I normally wear XL size, I can tell you that the XXL Jacket is not what I would consider a generous cut (like some of the others may have implied). The stuff sack that comes with it is totally useless since it is far to small to accomodate the XXL jacket and pants (it might be OK for a small or even a medium) the zipper appears to be plastic (at least it won't rust) and the snaps do pull apart very easily in the vertical plane. They seem to be a bit more sturdy in the horizontal plane.I think if you are looking for something for very occasional use in light winds they will probalbly be OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits like a Tent","review":"I purchased this rain suit after doing a lot of comparison shopping. I decided that for the price, it was a great deal, but it turned out to be a great disappointment. First of all, the material is very unusual looking for being waterproof. Think fortified paper towel. I didn't even bother to test how effective it was though because the jacket fit like a hot air balloon. The chest area was fine, but the sleeves were large beyond reason. Generous fit is one thing, but I probably could have fit my body through the sleeves. I had to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Jacket","review":"Purchased for trip to Alaska (in summer). Fortunately didn't have to use it much. Kept us dry, while being very light and easy to pack in a bag. Even with a small suit for me at 5'8\\" 150lb, they are on the baggy/bulky side, but it does make it easy to throw on over sweaters and whatnot. Only complaint, is that when the hood is up you can't hear much cause of the crinkling around your ears... it's the nature of the type of material though, so you can't do much about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, with customer service to match","review":"The very first time I took mine out of the package and tried it on, two of the seams separated.

Needs to be longer, even a parka style with cinching waist would help, just to provide extra coverage. An XL on a 5'8\\" male and can't sit down with out the jacket lifting in the back leaving an area to get wet. Can't lift arms over head for any normal activity with out jacket raising up as well. Cinching doesn't help either. No pockets in jacket or pants, which stinks but is probably for waterproofing purposes. The jacket on the zipper also seems to leak pretty bad, left a wet spot all the way down the front of my shirt. The compactness and weight are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice and waterproof - until the zipper breaks.","review":"My husband had a pair of these and the zipper broke. I got ready to buy a good rain suit and thought it was probably just a fluke about the zipper. BUT - the third time I wore mine, the zipper on MY jacket broke.Loved them at first - they were lightweight and didn't make me sweat inside them, and they blocked wind and water. Shame about the zipper because it negates all the benefits!I won't buy anything made by them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vacuum to avoid","review":"I wish I had read the reviews of the Bissell Digipro prior to buying this vacuum. I would have known that debris gathers in the floor nozzle, they hose is very flimsy and tends to break, most of the exhaust escapes around the edges of the canister, the suction is quite weak and it is virtually impossible to find bags and even more difficult to find any store or internet site that carries parts for this model. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews and had to learn all of this first hand. Despite having spent several hundred dollars, I've learned from my mistake: The Digipro is going in the trash and I'm going shopping for a new vacuum. It might be an Eureka or Hoover, both of which we've had good experiences with, but it won't be a Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"I bought this item in october of 2004, used it 4 times and hose disconnected from the handle.

I have two other Bissell products (the Pro Heat 2X carpet cleaner, and the SpotBot) and have been happy with the performance of both. Unfortunately, the DigiPro did not live up to my expectations. There are some nice features, like the telescoping feature of the wand, and the unit is less noisy that the old upright. And I sort of got used to the heavy wand and the clunkyness of it. But now I find that the genuine Bissell vacuum bags have such a flimsy built-in gasket, that air leaks in at that point and there is no suction at the end. Bissell customer support was not helpful and are not aware of any problems. I will try to find the non-Bissell vacuum bags that I bought once before that had a stronger gasket, and save my pennies for a new vacuum that actually does suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carpet attachment clogs easily","review":"The carpet attachment has clogged twice in the handful of times I've used it.

Took it into the repair and they stated the switch had shorted out the circuit board, a common problem when the unit heats up which this product does. They want $145.00 to repair so it's out to shop for another brand and it will not be a Bissell product ever again.I agree with the many reviews here that his product is of a very poor design and not efficient for what you pay for it. I would not recommend this product at all. I will now see how good Bissell customer support is to see what they will offer to repair or replace this poor product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great...not for multiple pet households!","review":"I read reviews of this machine on another website and decided to purchase it. I have been very pleased with its performance. It is quiet and I like the auto adjusting suction control; it does not tear my rugs apart. My carpet gets very clean and the adjustable wand is great for my bare floors and stairs. My problem is, that after 6 months of use, I noticed dust and cat hair flying out of the powerhead. I checked and the power head connection was completely jammed with cat hair and other dust and such. It took many attempts to finally clear it. It is working fine again, however I must check for jams on a regular basis. I would not recommend this machine for someone who has more than one furry pet, or someone who owns pets with a great deal of hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This vacum cleaner has good suction and cleaning power, design is pretty good, but in our 2 year ownership, changed already:HoseTelescoping wandBelt and bulb for power brushNow the power brush connection is melted so it does not work, the hose is bad again. Parts are not cheap either so guess what not worth to change those again.Will probably buy miele since the price for this one and parts are already up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Hmmm, I've given this vacuum cleaner three months, and I'm getting a new one. It has a variety of settings, but it doesn't have good suction on any of them. Kudos for a convenient handle that makes it easy to get in out of the way places, but once the nozzle is where you want it to be, it still doesn't suck anything up. The nozzle rolls right over specks and lint on the carpet, and it doesn't pick them up. Yes, it's quiet, but that's because it hardly has any output."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 years later and VERY little suction","review":"I liked this vacuum when I first bought it... but I have a dog with medium length hair and the motorized head gets clogged very easily and loses suction quickly. The suction is okay if I stop vacuuming every 2 minutes to pull out balls of hair that get stuck at the turn between the motorized head and the arm. If you don't have pets, this may work for you... but BEWARE if you are expecting the vacuum to clean up dog hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewer has a good point, HEPA of very poor design","review":"The Reviewer makes an excellent point! This unit will not provide HEPA filtration of exaust air. So if you are buying this unit due to allergies or based on the procaimed HEPA filtration you would do best to pass this unit up. However as a normal vacuum, the unit is very good. Due to its small size it is very easy to manuver through tight spots. Suction is very good as well as the power head. The hose is of poor quality and tends to kink, but all in all a good vacuum. They just shouldn't claim HEPA filtration as the previous reviewer (mictrik) has pointed out so well. These days it isn't hard to find vacuums with HEPA filtration so passing this unit up wont be to big of a loss. Fix this issue and Bissell would have a true star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay while it worked...","review":"I have a large dog and a two cats, and this vacuum had a tendency to clog up with the fur. The suction was as good as a much more expensive electrolux vacuum, however I have owned the DigiPro for less than a year, and the beater brush in the power head has completely stopped working. (And the machine has certainly not been abused.) It is not worth the $200 plus price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock!","review":"I bought this digipro in January 2005. Used it about 4 months and the hose disconnected from the cannister. Apparently the only thing holding the hose onto the cannister are the small electric wires that make the floor attachment run and wrapped around the hose is black electrical tape. For $250 you would think a company as well known as Bissell would have more pride in the workmanship that goes into thier cleaners. I will never buy another Bissell product because they are shoddy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell 6900 Digipro Canister Vacuum","review":"I purchased this vacuum 5 months ago and it already is giving me trouble. The hose attachment to the canister does not stay attached and it does not have a floor brush making it difficult to vacuum around furniture. I would not recommend buying this vacuum. It is cheap plastic and I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Broke","review":"The first time I used it the hose came apart. Bissell sent a new hose and it's been working great ever since. The vacuum is super quiet and does a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"We got this vaccum to replace a Hoover upright. We have had it for almost 2 years and I find myself going to the broom or Swiffer for my hardwood and tile floors more than this vaccum. The bags fill up super fast and the darn thing starts losing suction when the bag is only 1/4 full. And the bags are very small. Needless to say, having to change bags this frequently is expensive and a royal pain. It is horrible on our rugs as well, and we don't have \\"fluffy\\" rugs but fairly standard area rugs. It doesn't pick up the dog hair at all (we have a short haired breed). We are looking for a replacement right now. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover 12 amp is better.","review":"This is not a bad mcahine but does not have enough suciton power.

We get a map of the Vietnam-Thailand-Hong Kong undersea cable system, 4 pages on how Sprint's network operates but only 1.2 pages on how the internet architecture works (pages 186-7, that's it, unless I missed something).Also some of the data on the internet seems old. There is no mention of ICANN for example, which now runs IP address space allocation, protocol parameter assignment and root server system management functions (according to its website... Another organisation is named in this role by the book, the \\"Internet Architecture Board\\", however I believe this is now defunct or has been subsumed by ICANN - a search on Yahoo turns up nothing for this body.Disappointing as a sourcebook for internet technical knowledge. I think the book tries to appeal to too many audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chung's view is sharp and modernist","review":"Since he is such a good Shostakovich conductor, it's easy to anticipate that Myung-Whun Chung would take a bleaker, more angular view of Romeo and Juliet than most. His style in Prokofiev is ultra-clean, with sharp, staccato attacks in the winds, but slowing down quite a lot for the tender romantic sections devoted to Romeo and Juliet together.The result is different and for me a bit too mannered. Chung's slow pace doesn't seem danceable, for one thing, and the sharp attacks feel overly aggressive. Others disagreed when this album was released, and despite its short runnning time of aobut an hour (compared to 78 min. from Michael Tilson Thomas), one Gramophone reviewer put this CD at the top of his list. I grant that it's certainly very good, and the Concertgebouw is all that one could hope for."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great buy!!!","review":"I had this for my first son and we even brought this with us to Aruba!

It's great because pools at hotels (especially in the the beach in the summer time) are packed. This float allowed me to stick with my little guy!

Anyone with any interest about Great Britain's queen -and her family- definitely should read this book. Although not always flattering, Sarah Bradford has portrayed HM The Queen as a real person, with real, everyday type problems, whose entire life has been dedicated to service to her country, but at the expense of a stable family life. At certain points, it's as if the queen would happily trade in her extravagent, royal lifestyle just to be like everybody else (one of her subjects).The sources Sarah Bradford uses for her book, along with her own thorough, detailed reseach of HM Queen Elizabeth II, make for fascinating, non-stop, reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly sympathetic, detailed view of the Queen","review":"Sarah Bradford, an accomplished and very thorough biographer, offers a highly sympathetic and detailed account of Queen Elizabeth II's life up to the mid-1990s. The book sparkles early with fascinating accounts of the Queen's formative years, particularly those during the scandal involving the Duke of Windsor and her father's subsequent -- and highly successful -- reign. In her presentation of Queen Elizabeth's reign, Bradford's biography is occasionally bogged down by an excess of names. The Queen's fondness for horses is also presented in extensive detail. Nevertheless, this biography is successful at providing a peek into Queen Elizabeth's life and offering insight into the Queen's dedication to her role as Queen of Britain and the Commonwealth."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WAY!!!","review":"I must say this was one of the kindest books to QE2. Well why shouldn't it be? It is written in coroperation with the palace. So if this woman wrote anything negitive that looked damaging to the Queen, well it would be removed. Don't belive everything you read. This book is just palace mumbo-jumbo. The author makes some bucks and the palace has a nice look to it. Good job, but not real.Read Kitty Kelly's The Royals, that was banned in the UK by the Royal family. Why? Something to hide Queeny!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances, Great Value of Kubelik & Dvorak","review":"Those on a budget might seriously consider getting this two CD set of Rafael Kubelik conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, in lieu of the multiple CD set of his entire Dvorak symphony cycle. These are electrifying performances every bit as good as Sir Colin Davis' readings with the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Admittedly, the sound quality might not be as splendid as those of recent vintage, yet this is a set worth acquiring. With regards to the quality of the performance, Kubelik's 1960's account is as fine as the latest I have heard from the likes of Abbado and Harnoncourt. This two CD compilation concludes with Kubelik's celebrated version with the Boston Symphony Orchestra of the tone poem Moldau from Smetana's tone poem cycle Ma Vlast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality for a low price","review":"I have bought several of these over the years - some for gifts.

This is by far the worst one I have ever encountered. It is utter nonsense! Not only do some of the lists not make any sense, (What are gay and lesbian names and what qualifies a name as such???) but so many of these names are complete works of fiction it is laughable. If you want a name that is made up, don't waste money on the book, make it up yourself. The so-called definitions are ridiculous to the point of being offensive in some cases. A little research goes a long way! I don't know who paid her to write this book, but they should get their money back. As a matter of fact, I should get my money back for buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of money","review":"Please do not waste your money on this book! It is such a joke. Unfortunately, the premise of poring through 50,000 names appealed to me. What the book's jacket didn't mention was that the names are all unbelievable and obviously made up. I can't even count how many times she makes up compound names (Joanielee or Stacielee or Phoebelee) to fill in space.Do yourself a favor and find a good baby name Web site instead. It will save you lots of time and you won't feel like a fool for shelling out $19.95 for this piece of garbage!I can't believe this book made it into print.

As someone who is very interested in names and onomastics in general, I can honestly say I have no idea how this book was ever published. The meanings are atrocious and can't be anything further from reality. I saw the name \\"Choicey\\" meaning: One who chooses\\" listed in this book. Excuse me? Choicey isn't a name. It dosan't exist, nor should it. If you could give a toss less that your child's name is just an adverb, or a juxtoposition of letters from someone's last failed scrabble attempt, then by all means this is the book for you. For those of you who want something meaningful, with some history... Who don't think naming your child \\"Spidey\\" is a good idea...then only buy this if you want to make fun of it.

I wish I could give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply terrible","review":"not only does the author make up names (why are tedshawn and tedwayne in here, but not tedsteve?), but she makes up their derivations as well. if you're just looking for a huge list of names, you'll have better luck looking in the phone book. buy one of the books by satran instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and hard to read","review":"I have to agree with the other negative reviews for this book. I bought it last night because the one other first name book I have was put out by Oxford University Press and includes a disproportionate number of Celtic names.I thought this book would help me flesh out my list of possibilities. No such luck. As many others have said, there are so many names here that are made up, extremely rare, or simply bizarre, that it's very hard to spot the good ones in the mix.What's more, in listing so many invented names, the author vioates the very advice she gives earlier in the book. Finally, I found her section of \\"fun lists\\" to be unsupported and arbitrary, and her etymologies to be incorrect.As others have said.

Some of the cool, unique names I found (just found out about upcoming baby on Friday, went to the bookstore Saturday and spent the rest of the weekend with the book!) are Talmadge, Lowry, or Belton for a boy. Or Aylwin, Mischanna, Iverem, or Ophira for a baby girl. I thought the name lists were helpful too as they helped me imagine what kind of person Bayard or Hyacinth will grow up to be.

The lists in the front are bizzare, and quite often end somewhere around M in alphabetical order - like there was some arbitrary list and she ran out of room for more variety. Reading through all the names with my husband last night, we just kept looking at each other with quizzical expressions on our faces. It felt like even the author got bored creating her own lists.
