Borrowed my buddies timing light made by another company, and it worked like a charm . The inductive pickup is large I assume to accomdate large diameter wires, but with standard size wires there is too much space for it to proper pick up the signal.

The neckband can be uncomfortable due to hard plastics without any insulating material.Overall, I find the sound quality to be poor and not up to standard.

No visible damage to a wire, it only produces sound on the left side now. Oh well, they're fairly cheap, sound great, and lasted me a few years. I just bought my 2nd pair of these today.

Also the sound is much more detailed and clear than on a pair of Koss headphones I own.A great value. I do wish there was a volume control - I think this is required on \\"street\\" (around the neck) headphones.Lastly I wish the PMX200 (not PM200) - were available - they are \\"street\\" style headphones that are closed.

They seem to not fit right on my ears and allow a great deal of ambient noise in which in turn causes me to have to turn up my music to compensate for it. The sound quality is just OK. I will probably end up giving this set to my kids and finding another set for work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope your head is huge!","review":"These ear phones have no adjustment options, so unless your head is quite large, these will be uncomfortably loose fitting and distracting should you move your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice headphones","review":"Okay, so these got to be the loudest headphones I've ever own. If you are trying these for the first time, you should definitely set the volume down by about 30% of \\"normal\\" volume. As far as the values, these are relatively cheap for the high sound quality. They are very light and comfortable on the ear for those long hours of wear, or for my everyday 30 mins ride on the CART to classes. Very easy to put on and the cord is single strand so no clutter. The range is incredible and very crisp, clean. The bass on these phones are weaker compare to the Sony's, but the bass actually sounds cleaner and non-distorting. Take your music to the next level with these bad boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping...","review":"The unit looked decent on my head (or so my wife says) and that is where the good review ends. The headphones did not seem to fit properly on my ears. I have a 7 1/4 hat size, not really big and not really small. The sound was heavy on \\"tin\\" and light on \\"boom\\". They actually sounded scratchy and distorted even on low volume. I had purchased a pair of Sony MDR-G57G sports model headphones for my wife a few weeks ago and they look, feel and sound great for about the same money. My suggestion is to get something different.

Just had to replace last month due to ripped ear foam and malfunctioning sound. After nearly 2 years of abuse I've put these PMX60's through, I have a good handle on their performance.Strengths: Attractive design, extremely comfortable (can easily wear 4+ hours), fantastic mids and highs, low price, durabilityWeaknesses: Not foldable, lows could be better (break-in improves them slightly, but street-style headphones aren't going to get you world-class bass)Bottom line: I'm re-buying after 2 years, and I guarantee that you'll do the same. If you're looking for quality sound from an inexpensive set of headphones, don't think twice!UPDATE 2011-11-22Foam again ripped on the 2nd pair, probably in 2009.

They also make cymbals sound horrible, maybe a little bit tinny?Sure, they look cool, but you can find better sound for a lower price.I also own a pair of Sony MDR-Q22LP's and they sound much better, and cost less. The cord is also longer on the Sonys and they also fit better. My head is a bit small, and the PMX60s are always sliding down..Totally NOT recommended for exercising in. If you want something to exercise in, get the Koss Sporta/PortaPros. Much better sound quality, and have a better fit.If you're willing to go $10 more, the Senn PX100's are also much better.These are getting 2 stars because the cord is very thick and they look cool. The sound is mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like tin?","review":"Then you'll love these headphones. I'm coming off a set of Sony cordless mdr-if230 headphones. The Sony blow these away. The sound is not isolated enough. If you squeeze the headphones against your head, you get better sound. They are very tinny. Also, everyone who sits within 70' of me can here what I'm listening to. Cord is too short. They're probably good for jogging or working out, but if you like good sound, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality, but HORRIBLE build quality.","review":"I've purchased this item numerous amounts of times because of the superb sound quality. Unfortunately after owning my 3rd set I can no longer recommend this product to anyone. These headphones sound GREAT, and since I love loud music these were perfect. They bleed ALOT of sound, as in people can hear if you crank it up. But after breaking my 3rd set I can't stand it anymore. Nothing provoked it this time to stop working. The left ear started scratching a bit, then it completely died. And it's not my iPod's fault. So while it's a very good pair of headphones, it really doesn't last long at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"good sound quality but","review":"i love this Sennheiser headphone. the sound is rich and the frequency range is broader. stylish design though the band doesn't fit the back of my head quite well.the only annoying thing is the slight buzzing noise. you can hear that if you turn off the sound. since i usually listen to classic music and use low volume, sometimes i can tell this noise from the music. kinda annoying! but if you listen rock, pop or other genres at high volume, it is not an issue. i guess that noise is from either background of the signal on my computer or interference of electromagnetic wave around me. maybe the company can do a little improvement to filter that noise though it will raise the cost. overall it is an excellent headphone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for exercise","review":"These ear phones won't fit in your ear if you plan to exercise.

The earphones fit right on my ear.The sound quality reminds me of the Creative headphones that used to retail for about $15 (and now sadly discontinued).If you're going to spend 65 bones on a pair of headphones that are going to get really sweaty, spend it on the Polk Audio version. Or tell Creative to bring back theirs which looked remarkably similar and had the same audio performance and fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has longer cord","review":"While the technical specs continue to say the cord is only 1 meter long, and Amazon buyers used to complain about that, both the unit I bought last June and the spare this February are about 1 and a half meters long. The cord length problem apparently was fixed.The only reasons for less than five stars are that as a books-on-tape listener I can't tell if these are really worth the extra money over the similar $9 Phillips over the ears model. They also seem to grip my large head a bit more firmly than I might wish.----------UPDATE Aug 2010: Just bought another directly from Amazon and the cord from this \\"Made in China\\" unit is still 55 inches long while the product spec still says only 1 meter (about 39 inches) and Amazon itself say 3 foot (36 inches)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Don't believe the good reviews! These headsets are awful!!!!! There is no way to adjust the fit, and it would be a miracle if they fit you correctly. Absolutely the worst headsets I have ever owned, no reduction in background noise, I wore them one time on the subway and threw them out when I got home. I couldn't hear the music on my iPod because of all the background noise.

Don't get me wrong, they work just fine and the sound quality is just great. My disappointment is in the advertising on Amazon.com. It plainly says that the headphone cord is 6 feet long - which is exactly why I bought these. I wanted headphones that I could wear at work (plugged into my speakers) and still move around a little at my desk. The cord ACTUALLY measures less than 3.5 feet - shorter than the headphones I was trying to replace. I would have bought headphones that were twice the price to find a set that would have had the length. I'm very, very disappointed in Amazon (or whomever is responsible for the advertising)."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of a waste of money","review":"they were kind of a waste of my money to me. the sound is too poor of quality for thirty. the treble was good but no bass. if you want good sound quality get earbuds they are the best especially the MDR-EX51LP and the E2C. if your buying these for running id get the sony brand they are cheaper and are the same sound quality but if you want good sound quality for running get clip earbuds. earbuds are probably better becauseallthe sound goes into your ear and none of it is lost. clip, behind the neck, and lightweight headphones arent good because the sound goes into the air. so yeah like i said i would get earbuds, clip earbuds, or the big studio headphones with the ear cushions, the sound isnt lost. if your low on money though and want to spend less than twenty or maybe even ten try MDR-E828LP and HA-X570 and MDR-J10 for good sound under twenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wast e your money!!","review":"I read a few reviews on here about this headphone and the few that wrote the bad side about this headphne was true.

Usually lighthearted, moving and entertaining, Sally has left me perplexed and slightly bored. It opens with an astonishingly raunchy sex scene which could bode well for the rest of the book. Sally doesn't want the chap to fall in love with her, but he does, and she basically goes nuts and runs off. What is perplexing is that it's never really clear why........I ended up skipping a great chunk of fairly snore-worthy stuff where she runs off to an elderly aunt in Mull (riveting - not) and going to the end to confirm that yes, they did end up together. There's a sort of vague reference to someone who broke her nose in the past, but she'd moved on from that......honestly, a massive disappointment.

The quality of the photos leaves something to be desired, many look as if this volume was done by scanning the original pages with a pixal-ly deficient copier. On the other hand, it has reasonable views of such well known aircraft as the Gotha Go345 transport, the Faucett F-19 and the Swedish J-22.There is also a good section on the world's aircraft engines. As is well known, the secret to designing a good plane is to start with a good powerplant. It is much easier to understand the aircraft if one knows something about the engines.

Unfortunately, the screenplay doesn't hold up well with the film degenerating into meat splattered against a wall in what is basically a slasher film. While there are good performances, the film is not memorable.

I heard the song \\"Don't Cha\\" while flipping through the channels trying to get to Comedy Central (the only good basic cable channel) and I felt like sticking my head in a bear trap. Why? Because the sound of my own death would be much more enjoyable then listening to five seconds of this...this, I dont know. Anyone who calls this music needs to stop and actually realize what they're listening to. And Busta Rhymes? He was good when he was yelling \\"woohaw!\\" in the ninties, but now he's just a crappy has been. So seriously, how the hell did these people get a record deal?

It is, however, very sexy. This is one of those singles that sells because it aired a lot for a brief time, and it has a very seductive video. I'd suggest that you see the video, if it turns you on, you'll find yourself buying the CD single. If you don't ever see the video, I'm thinking you're not going to be impressed by hearing the song. These are, by the way, the same Pussycat Dolls who do a pretty good cover of \\"Sway\\" in the otherwise forgettable remake (J-Lo) of \\"Shall We Dance,\\" and again, it has a pretty sexy music video too."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEEEECH","review":"Pop tarts making horrible re-makes.

Will it sell well over a million copies? Yes. What's even scarier is the fact that this song was out not even an entire year ago and folks are eating this up as if it was new. Two words: Tori Alamaze. And Busta Rhymes adds nothing to the song either. Busta has been washed up for quite some time now. Yeah, he was tight at some point, but he's garbage now and this is coming from someone who had respect for Busta at some point (I have his first 5 albums).

They are like a watered down version of the Spice Girls, only without being self aware of the cheese factor, which makes them bar far, dare I say it, lamer.Top that off with them trying to break through, with someone else's recent break through song . . . and you have a recipe for disaster. This new version's vocal lacks the gritty honesty of the original vocal, by Tori Alamaze. That is what made the original popular. The music has been over produced and now sounds terrible. Not even a cameo by Busta Rhymes (probably his weakest to date) can save this sinking ship. A&M; records has made an awful choice and should bury this single and re-promote the original.

There's nothing wrong with sexually strong women, but give me a break, how monotonous can you get? Plus, they all sound like they're about to fall asleep while singing.The beat is sloppy, with random instrumental sounds every four seconds.

Well that of course and a few minutes later it's over with. Those are the only redeeming qualities of this song. I expected a bit better from Nicole (used to be in that girl group Eden's Crush). But nah its not appealing, not happening and i dont care for the vocals in any form. The message behind the song is something that i normally wouldnt care about but in this case.

I guess when you have been put in a situation like the one they are singing about you will understand unless you are the \\"girlfriend\\". But to all the haters of this song, Tori Alamaze gave up all of her rights to this song after a short period of time when the song did not immediately become a hit. She did not even write the song! Can you believe Cee-lo wrote the song and he knew it would be a hit so he recruited the PussyCat Dolls to \\"redo\\" the song and now the song has become a success. In case you havent noticed at the end of the video Cee-lo makes a brief cameo. So PCD didnt steal anything from Tori Alamaze, they were simply given a chance to make a hit song by the person who wrote it because the initial singer couldnt do it. And thats the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"No I Don't","review":"This version is really bad. I really don't know why everyone is so into this version when Tori Alamaze's version is so much better. It's so sad that she won't get any recognition for it due to these women. This version wouldn't be so bad if they took out that horrible sax riff or whatever instrument it is during the chorus. It truly takes away from the song. Busta Rhymes please get out of this song! You add nothing to it! I had really considered buying this version after everyone has raved over it so much but that would be senseless when I already own Alamaze's version. I listened to this version on the radio the other day and had a much better appreciation for the version I own. Tori Alamaze's version is definitely more soulful,sexy and has that \\"oomph\\" to it that this version just doesn't have.

Look at Gwen Stefani's Hollaback Girl and Missy Elliot's Lose Control. They don't make sense at all. But everyone is always dogging on pop music. At least pop music is real music. Rap music is not real music at all. U know what they say, Those who can't sing rap. I hate how rappers always dog on pop music as crappy music. I wouldn't talk.

But Dr. Dre said \\"Sex sells\\", but I'm glad that I didn't buy their full length CD. As for Busta Rhymes, he does absolutely nothing to this song. Not even his fast rhyming can save this song. Although if you're one of those people who listen to those radio stations where they play a lot of mainstream music or watch MTV alot, then you will love this song and probably their CD.

I will almost certainly rewatch Inside, which is just a great, fun horror movie. It has a real slasher sensibility. It's super gross, sure, but it isn't hopeless like Martyrs was. It just feels like everyone involved is having so much fun. The crew, I mean. Not the characters. The characters are decidedly NOT having that much fun.

As far as the 'gore' raved about in this film, it really wasn't anything special with respect to gore type horror films. Really nothing any more, or anything new, than one would expect from this type of film. Certainly even an old film such as the Exorcist far exceeds the 'gore' factor of this film.

Honestly, just an excellent film. Very re-watchable. There's one super lame scene involving CGI, but they knock it out early, and it's also accompanied with some practical FX. Once this movie picks up, it simply explodes off the screen. This is the only movie in a long time that had me crawling towards the screen with my jaw dropped and giggling out of sheer awe. By far the greatest work Dimension Extreme has (or, in all likelihood, ever will) release. Simultaneously can't begin to explain it, but also can't say enough about it.

It is a simple plot and a somewhat surprise ending that made sense. some could figure it out early on in the film. but the gore is some of the most realistic I have ever seen.... and not for the squeamish at all. well done effects. very creepy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best Horror Movie I have Ever Seen!","review":"I had high expetations going in to this French horror movie from all the hype it got on the internet. Usually this leads to disapointment but in this case the film was even greater than the hype.It is perfect from start to finish and never drags. As another reviewer points out, it makes the Saw franchise look like Disney films. This is an absolute gore fest and very brutal throughout!I've seen tons of horror movies and it takes a lot to make my jaw hit the floor but this succeeded a good 3 or 4 times.If you are put off by subtitles, this is the one horror movie you need to suck it up for! Besides, there isn't a ton of dialogue, after all it is a slasher movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I haven't spent so much time in a movie moaning \\"oh come on now\\" in quite a while.It was clearly not thought through.I am a huge fan of French cinema, especially the horror/thriller genre, as they usually hit the nail right on the head, but I was blown away by how ridiculous this movie was.*spoiler alert*A woman lying on her back, choking on blood, uses a knitting needle to pierce her throat to let the blood drain out, and then tapes the spraying hole closed with masking tape?Unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile, Boring Nonsense","review":"I like horror and I don't mind gore if it, like nudity or sex, serves the story in some way. This is just a mean-spirited, ugly movie that lacks imagination so it attempts to make up for it with gruesome violence. If that's all you're looking for in a movie then a) good luck with that and b) enjoy this thing. It's pace is excruciatingly slow and it succumbs to nearly every cliche you can imagine--the killer, who is simply an averagely built female, somehow manages to be superhuman for no good reason, or rather everyone else is transformed into a weakling when convenient for the \\"plot\\" (and I use the term loosely); everyone she kills is equally stupid in some way or other; the revenge plot that is often repeated is repeated again here. Just an awful, dull, unpleasant, derivative film that deserves none of the accolades given by other viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop watching...","review":"I didn't know what to expect. Wow! This film was sick and disturbing yet at the same time I could not turn away. **Small Spoilers** Ok, the main Character was not that bright and should have left the house. Police were absolute morons. Overall this film was infact disturbing yet something a bit different. I enjoyed it because the gore looked very real, the acting was decent (well watchable) and it was creepy as hell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let there be Blood","review":"Yes, this is everything this movie is hyped up to be. Pure unadulterated brutality. It is shocking, gory, suspenseful and incredibly well done. The camera work, acting, effects, music all make this one of the best horror movies made period. And the ending.........If you are serious about horror on every level, you can't do better.Between this and Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door, there comes a time when you really do reach the pinnacle of extreme horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"5-Star Reviews = Viral Marketing for a stupid film..","review":"Inside is a tribute to the \\"Idiot Plot\\" - that is a plot that would'nt work unless everyone in the film is a halfwit. This bloody, pointless film is about a pregnant woman hunted by a crazy person in her home. She locks herself in the bathroom while the crazy person stabs at the bathroom door with a knife and screams.But then things get really stupid. The killer is a woman who weighs maybe 120 pounds - she kills four full-grown men! 2 of them are armed cops! One of the cops is in the house when the lights go out, so he goes into the basement to turn the lights back on! Yikes - now THAT'S stupid..Of course, none of the cops called for help when they were OUTSIDE and they noticed that something was wrong - double Yikes..Skip this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subs","review":"It would probly be a good movie if the thing was in English it sucks when you have to read what they say"},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU WON'T FEEL A THING","review":"The first seventeen minutes are okay. Then there's a shock sequence that turns out to be a dream. Why? Because these guys know zip about sustaining tension. All they really have here is a concept film. Meanwhile two truly unnerving French horror films have come out in recent years without attracting much attention: IRREVERSIBLE and I STAND ALONE, both directed by Gaspar Noe. After INSIDE has disappointed you, try those."},{"rating":"1","title":"subtitles suck","review":"i wish i had read that the movie was all foriegn. so if your into that, this might not be bad for you, however i can't read and watcha a movie at the same time. sucked in my opinion, but then again i only got threw 30 minutes of it before i was bored with reading the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"I read all these glowing reviews and immediately pulled out this movie and watched it. Wow what a waste of time, this movie was so sub par I just can't believe all the positive reviews for it. Low budget / limited locations doesnt have to be this bad (see [REC] for example)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The French has outdone the Asians","review":"Considering that this was not a big talked about movie, I was expecting low budget, in return I received my money's worth. This movie has more gore then any Asian, Italian, or American horror film I have seen in decades. The acting is very believeable, the gore very realistic, and story line extremely twisted. I'm a strong gore hound and this movie actually made me gag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very gory horror flick.","review":"This is definitely one of the goriest if not the goriest films I have ever seen. I have seen just about all of the foreign and domestic horror films and this one just about tops them all. So, if you are a fan of splatter films this is a definite must see. Good storyline too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"Being very familiar with Paolo Conte's music for years, I was looking forward to a dvd from him.This is an old TV show recorded and now available on DVD. Sound quality is only stereo, studio audience is acting lethargic, background music is played from a recording over loudspeakers to which he sings and is really bad.The few pieces he sings and accompanies himself on the piano are so/so.I suffered through the show and returned it for refund the same day. This DVD does not do Paolo Conte any justice. His cd's and life recordings are much better and I have enjoyed his music for years.Alexander"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't come close to the 1978 original release.","review":"This collection in 1978 contained Don't Cuss that Fiddle, Crime still don't pay, and Welcome to 2003. Three great songs not available anywhere else. And, the only reason to buy this title (WAS). This pathetic release isn't worth buying. Why did BMG/RCA leave out songs? And then have the nerve to give it the same title?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An average outing from Mr Minasi (aka EXCELLENT)","review":"As per usual, Mr. MINASI et al. have created a book which lets us learn more and enjoy what is being taught. Not your typical dry text, nor your typical 'Linux for those of you who really don't like solaris/HPUX/BSD anymore' book, this one takes a look at Linux from a PC administrators perspective. Not everyone knows the ins and outs of UNIX, which many authors seem to presuppose. Nor does the book pander to those who can't find the any key, which seems to be the other kind of linux book out there.My only beef with the book is the 'proper pronuciation' of linux. You say potayto I say potahto... who really cares?I have accumulated more of Mr. Minasi's books than I care to admit, and constantly have only the highest of praise for them in the classes that I teach every week. If only other authors could do what he does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have","review":"For anyone taking the leap from Windows into Linux, this is a must-have book. It translates Linuxnese into Windownese with clear explanations and examples. Most useful book I've ever bought. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant,","review":"This book is just brilliant. Im a Windows NT/2000 administrator and I wanted to get a grasp on Linux,I have looked at other books on Linux, but this book cuts out the waffle and explains it in terms I already know, saving me so much time.The sections on DNS, Sendmail, Apache and Firewalls are just outstanding.What I like in a book generally is that the Author should explain it to me like Im a two year old, which really fuels my interest and then load on the technical info, its re-inforced then and so much easier to apply, this book does just that The result - when you pick this book up, you just cannot put it down.Buy this book you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Win Admins wanting to learn Linux","review":"This was one of the first books I picked up when I decided to take the plunge into Linux. Being an MCSE and Windows administrator, I drastically improved my understanding of how Linux is similar, and differs from Windows. If you're a Windows guy or gal who wants to make sense of Linux, I highly recommend you pick up this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"This book has it all! Being a Windows 2000 administrator this book knows where I'm coming from. Explains the information very good. The only problem is the book isn't laid out as nice as I would like it to be so I have to do a little more hunting for things than I would like to. Overall an Excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming from Windoze...","review":"...this is a great start/introduction. The \\"Dummies\\" and \\"Visually\\" books were too simple for my needs but this one explained everything from an NT standpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Cocktail party bluffing ! Dangerous in reality !","review":"At the start of the book the author does actually mention Party talk, but intimates the book will take you deeper if you want, I am afraid it fails badly, and is far too shallow for real world use, it provides just enough info to get you into real trouble, but no mention of the critical word troubleshooting. Linux is a constant state of troubleshooting,this book is only suitable for a casual Desktop user, useless for a real world sys admin, I don't know what the other reviewers saw in it, howerver it was the 5 star ratings that attracted me - more fool me ! the book relies heavily on Craig Hunts book Linux 24/7, which again is a poorly written and confusing attempt to explain a Linux server setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly a good book","review":"It's a great resource to have, coming from the Windoze world. For a beginner in Linux though, gets a little too deep and spends a lot of time on Xwindows. This may prove very useful later, but for now, I just skipped most of that. Would I buy it again? Absolutely. I've got mine filled with sticky notes to note key pages for troubleshooting, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I always thought that a decoder ring was something that you got out of a box of cracker jacks. But Minasi's offering is no prize.The problem: Minasi tries to cover every popular distribution of Linux in just 500 pages. He generalizes, much to the frustration of the novice user.Indeed, there is useful information contained within \\"The Secret Decoder Ring\\" , but as the reader you often feel that you need a decoder ring to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Settles some issues, brings up more","review":"I agree that this is a book that has been needed for a while, but is incomplete and somewhat misleading.For one thing he completely glosses over both the free and commercial versions of the ASP engines (Apache::ASP, mod_perl, ChiliSoft), and spends little time in explaining something as essential to the Open Source and Linux movements as _make_. Also, he completely misses the point of Linux throughout the book, attributing Linux's success to free as in beer, vice free as in speech and the licensing and fair use issues.The major contribution this book makes is as a bridge to the Windows script kiddies. Linux and Unix admins beware! More of them will know where to go in your file systems now!Marginally fair to good as an intro, but dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattered Dreams rox!!!","review":"Shattered Dreams is the only song I've heard, so I don't know if its a 5 or 4 etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untitled","review":"I love the sound of Johnny Hates Jazz & this CD.

If I were you I would pass on this book if you're looking for a help with DHTML. You'll end up spending more time searching on the web for answers and references rather than this book.The book does cover DOM, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. But what I was looking for was straight DHTML. The title really threw me off. Theres more pages devoted to DOM then there are for DHTML."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately Very Fat book ,but Not For Beginners","review":"I bought this book , and i wait it about 1 month for arrive to me , but i am not lucky , the book contains more than 1300 pages , but i didn't find any thing benefit for me .I advise any one in beginner Level to keep away from this book .you must save your money ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for IE, not for NS","review":"Im a semi-professional DHTML developer, and i have tons of books from Microsoft on IE, i dont need another one, i want NS, lots of it, and while it has some, its mostly IE.

Hope they learn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Reference","review":"I own Danny Goodman's JavaScript Handbook from circa 1996. That has nothing to do with this review other than to say this guy has been doing this stuff for a long time. This is a great reference book to have handy and has good examples of each tag, element, or keyword in HTML, DOM, CSS, and JavaScript."},{"rating":"1","title":"as it says, its just a reference","review":"i was rather disappointed with this book. i learned dhtml better from the tutorials you can find online than in the 150 pages it devoted to applying dhtml. if you're looking for a reference book only then i guess this is probably the best choice out there (probably the only choice) but if you're looking to learn dhtml like i was then either wait for a new book or learn from the tutorials online that have real examples you can actually see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive doesn't say enough!","review":"Danny Goodman has out done himself with this book. It is one of the simplest reference manuals to use, and the most comprehensive. I am an experienced developer and this is a great resource, although it definately too much for beginners. I will always rate this book as a must have in any web developer's personal library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference","review":"This is a great reference manual. It is definately not a how-to book. A must for anyone that needs to generate multi browser support for DHTML pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a must-have reference for any advanced web design","review":"If you want to do anything more than just plain HTML, this book will help you a lot! Javascript, DOM, DHTML, and Style Sheets are all covered in excellent detail here. This is the best book on the subject I have seen yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Webmaster Must Have!!!","review":"I can not tell you how many times I go to this book, especially for the CSS reference. It allows you to quickly see what is browser compatible and what is not - even with insight to work arounds or recommendations for implementation. This is not a book to learn DHTML, so if you are not familiar with HTML, Javascript, DOM, and CSS, don't expect to learn it from here. This is for reference only (like the title says).This book is outstanding and consolidates all your references for DHTML under one cover. Since I bought this book, I find myself less and less going to the W3C site and other popular refence sites searching for information I need quickly.When the app guy comes to me and asks me a question about the client side browser, I can quickly give an answer without delaying his production and my work.Thank you Mr. Goodman and O'Reilly for this wonderful book. Now, can you just get Netscape to get compatible, that would be something!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the definitive reference for HTML","review":"For me the most useful part of this book is the 100 or so pages of HTML specification. It specifies the elements, attributes and values accepted by HTML 4.0, IE and Netscape browsers. This is worth the price of the book.The CSS/DHTML sections are somewhat harder to use. I sometimes have to look several places to find what I am looking for. It is a better reference than guide or tutorial. If I was going to work on a complex DHTML project I would look for another (perhaps newer) reference.There is also a large Javascript/DOM reference section that I never use. I prefer \\"Javascript the Definitive Guide\\" for this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's clear the fog!","review":"I believe the difference between those who loved this book and those who hated it is this: how often do you work on web design? For \\"in-my-free-time\\" developers or beginners I say this, \\"when you have gotten a fair background in development and want to finally move into serious application, buy this book.\\" For professional web developers like myself I say this, \\"add this to your library right now!\\" I have retired my Javascript and HTML books and I don't care if I ever see them again. Now the only books in my library that I use with regularity are this one and \\"ASP in a Nutshell\\" and \\"Developing ASP Components\\" -- all from O'Reilly. I carry this book with me EVERYWHERE!! BOTTOM LINE: If it's a hobby, it might not be a very useful or exciting read, if its your job then give yourself a break, buy this book now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date and overpriced.","review":"The reason this book ranks so high is that it's a thick, expensive, convoluted cookbook of singular examples without any real coverage of the subject matter.In other words, its a marketing dept's dream!This book hasn't been updated since 1998, and hasn't kept pace with technology...., the last chapter on DHTML is entitled \\"Looking Ahead to HTML 4.0\\" We're beyond HTML 4.0 and on to XHTML, XML, etc.!The fact that this chapter ends on page 163 should tell you something. The Book is 1073 page long! The remaining 910 are poor references for HTML 3.2, Javascript 1, and CSS 1. All of which are out of date. And where is the analysis of the Document Object Model? Oh, I forgot, it gets 2 pages! The DOM IS WHAT MAKES DHTML POSSIBLE..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work!!! (2nd Edition)","review":"This book (2nd Edition) is a must have for all people working with DHTML. First part of the book is like a tutorial explains the basic concept of DHTML and the esssentials you need to know, and the second part of the book is a complete reference of HTML, DOM, CSS, and JavaScript. I spent two days reading the first part from knowing nothing about DHTML to become well knowledged to start my project. This book also covers the latest browsers including IE 6.0 and Netscape 7 and provides some guidelines and suggestions regarding cross-platform support. This helped me a lot when dealing with events since IE and Netscape behaves quite differently in this area. I'd definitely recommend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Topnotch DHTML Reference","review":"Got to give credit where credit is due, and that is why I am writing this review. Every since I purchased the book, I had used it numerous number of times, such as checking for browsers compatibility, css syntax, properties and definitions, etc.... After putting this book to good used, I can certainly tell you the one thing that is undisputable of this book is that it is EXTREMELY WELL INDEXED for once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it seems","review":"Well here is the story:My friend and i work as web designers. Well we desided to learn some dhtml and starting looking through books, then we desided to buy 2 books, so that when we'd finish them we could exchange. Well I bought this book and my friend got \\"DHTML and JavaScript\\". I was really excited, because i wanted to learn some DHTML and learn how to use layers. CSS was not really my concern because i already read many online pages with tutorials and i know it pretty well(SO as javaScript). Well, when i opened the book i was really disappointed beacuse the book dosn't even talk about layers. Just CSS and JavaScript which was complete waste for me. Well when i looked at my friend's book, that book really got me interesting it has a very good coverage of both Layers and how to use them combined with css and js...The book also included a very good reference table for css commands. I think that \\"DHTML and JavaScript\\"(isbn: 0130863343 ) book is a much better deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Too Big","review":"Once upon a time I got annoyed with huge computer books. Acres of text signifying nothing but a cop-out manual listing. This was Goodman's book on HyperCard.Now he's done the same to O'Reilly, a series I cherish for their completeness of coverage, brevity and quality of index.This is a monster of a book, but this doesn't tell me about DHTML, it enumerates the subject, a task performed far better in Webmaster in a Nutshell, or Web Design in a Nutshell, or the individual texts on HTML or JavaScript from O'Reilly.I have to carry texts with me, this one won't travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indespensible For Web Developers","review":"This book truly is a definitive resource for DHTML development. I originally read this book when Ajax was taking off as an acronym and a movement. I am VERY glad that I read this book to set a solid background in the Javascript and XHTML underpinnings of Ajax - moving on to Ajax topics has been straightforward after digesting Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Reference.This book is VERY hefty but the time taken to read it in detail will definitely pay off for you. I cannot think of a relevant topic that was not covered in great detail.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book","review":"From the beginner to a well-seasoned programmer, this book adds a lot of value to your collection. The book gives you great examples and reasoning behind the different techniques that should be observed while creating any website. Plus, there are very detailed chapters devoted to HTML, DOM, CSS, and JavaScript references. I would definately recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have this book always on my side","review":"I have this book always on my side, and when I started to learn DHTML I used a lot. Now I used less often but I still using it every once in a While. Actually I need to buy a second copy because the first one is so wear out that it started to lose pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible, Third Edition","review":"The finest review of this book I can give is simply this: I bought the first edition in 1999, the second edition in 2003, the third edition in 2007, and as long as Danny Goodman and O'Reilly keep up the good work, I'll buy the fourth edition in 2011. There is no more indispensible book available for the Web GUI professional.One caveat: This book is not for beginners. If you don't already know how to build a modern DHTML/CSS/JS/Ajax interface, this book will likely be a waste of money. Moreover, if you're looking for how-tos and recipes, look elsewhere. This is a comprehensive encyclopedia of the DHTML universe, nothing more and nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most definitely definitive","review":"In scholarly works, the word definitive often gets used with the frequency and permanence of a political promise. In this case however, it should be capitalized, underlined and bolded, because it fits. Of all the hundreds of books that I own concerning web development, this one gets used as much as all the others put together. I can count on my fingers the number of times I found something in another source after failing to find it in this one. It is the only reference book that I have ever required my students to buy, and is the only book where I purchased two copies, just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Songs","review":"Does anyone really need to know how to say nice purple tie? I wanted to learn basic italian, but what I got instead was annoying songs that got in the way of learning the language. My kids were laughing so hard at the lame songs that we forgot what we were trying to learn! While it was good to have the book that goes along with the CD, the formate and the some of the first lessons were not where I wanted to start out (scrambled eggs vs fried?). The lessons did get better as you went along. If you don't mind learning italian Sesame Street style, then this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bertlitz Rush Hour Italian","review":"This set of CDs were upbeat and told a story while teaching common Italian words. It provided all the elements for learning, a story, music and multiple voices. Although, I listened to it multiple times, it was still enjoyable. For a quick study of everyday Italian I would recommend this CD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helpful and Kids learn from it too!","review":"This is a great introduction and easy to listen to. The songs really help reinforce the language. One hour is just enough but not too much. My child has learned a lot from this CD and sings some of the songs! I would advise this for children over the 'teach me....' series by Judy Mahoney (although they are good too) but usually skip over a lot of the last chapter, 5 as it is a little 'romantic'.. in a veiled way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequacies","review":"This book had two main problems.Firstly, the original page numbers were repeated in the text in three different formats: a straight number, a phrase such as 'page 23', and both of these enclosed in brackets.The lack of cosistency I found very distracting.Secondly, none of the original illustrations were included. The text refers to various illustrations to explain the author's descriptions but none of them have appeared in this electronic version.

Like we're stupid). And as for FOX just trying to balance the left-leanings of the other networks, what a crock. Even if the other networks are slightly left-leaning (as most educated, unselfish, concerned about the environment and social issues can be labeled), they are NOTHING like FOX. FOX is virtually blatant about it! All I can say is, GO SEE THIS DOCUMENTARY and make up your own mind. It is freaking amazing and will blow you away, just like Fahrenheit 911 !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right-Wing Marionettes Revealed!","review":"I was horrified, entertained, and glued to the screen.

It's damn creepy is what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not journalism and not revalatory...","review":"Surprise, Fox has a republican bias. I suppose no one in the country could figure this one out.The fundamental flaw with this documentary is that it points the finger at Fox for all sorts of reasons, while comletely ignoring the fact that all other stations do the same thing to promote whatever agenda they want to promote.The reason Fox stands out is because it is the only station that does not have a leftist bias. And it's getting better ratings than any other news network. I mean the leftists are right all the time. How could anyone not have a leftist view point, much less give higher ratings to a station that has a republican view point. Obviously, those that watch Fox are knuckleheads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy.","review":"This was a poorly done documentary. Liberals were never upset with biased journalism when the only people who ran journalism were NBC, ABC, and CBS. However, now that there is a popular alternative to the liberal media, people have shown artificial anger at Fox News. Fox News is popular for a reason -- it shows a point of view that most Americans agree with. It may be biased, but so are most of the other channels. If one wants to diversify the number of sources from which they receive news and information, that would be a smart and wise choice. However, to say that the fairness doctrine must be imposed upon Fox News would emasculate the purpose of the program. Yes, Fox News will continue to upset the liberals, but we live in a free country with lots of choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELLING THE NEWS","review":"THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY...BUT RATHER A BIASED COMMENTARY...HOWEVER IT IS TRUE....AM NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH FOX NEWS..HOWEVER WATCHING THE MAJOR NETWORKS ONE CAN SEE THE HYPE THAT IS GOING ON, AS THE FILM POINTS OUT.YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH TIME TO GET THE STORY IN AND GRAB THE AUDIENCE ....NETWORK NEWS AND THE CABLE CHANNELS ARE ENTERTAINMENT.....THEY HAVE BECOME THE NEW VERSION OF THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER....NOT REAL NEWS...BUT GRAB THE AUDIENCEWATCH WHAT YOU SEE, BUT BE AWARE IT MAY BE HYPED...FROM ALL SOURCES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigots' delight","review":"If the Good Lord Himself started a television network and peopled it with His angels and saints, the devil could easily make a DVD like this about His leftist or rightist or upsidedownist leanings. Fox is biased, sure.

The reviewer obviously hates conservatives and Fox news, but it's okay for him to be biased. In fact, the really funny thing is that it's okay for Dems and liberals to be biased all they want, but when Fox or any other broadcaster portrays things with a little bit more reality and truth, the Dems get their underwear all in a bundle.And NBC, ABC, and CBS are NOT biased towards Democrats?!?!

But the examples over bias proved by the filmmakers are compelling. I will never forget hearing O'Reilly yell and yell and yell at a young man whose father died in the 9/11 attacks.

True, you have every right not to like any channel if you feel like it, but you don't have the right to trash or question the integrity of Bill O'Reilly or anybody else just because their political beliefs differ from yours. Keith Olbermann spends almost every episode of his Countdown show on MSNBC trashing O'Reilly and the FNC. No wonder MSNBC is dead last in the cable news ratings and Fox is still number 1.

As I was watching this I fealt like this wasn't telling me anything that I didn't already know. This whole documentary was ultimately underwhelming in the sense it is preaching to the converted and will be ignored by Fox News loyalists.

How am I to believe that this is a fair criticism when it's being put on by two organizations that dislike Conservatives. Furthermore, Greenwald has started the new millennium by making no less than 5 anti-Republican/Conservative movies.This film doesn't even give Fox the chance to defend itself, and it doesn't imply that any other media source could be bias.

ALL news networks are biased, and their slogans are all misleading. CNN calls itself the Most Watched News Channel, when FOX NEWS beats it in the ratings fairly often -- often enough to discredit that claim. All the major news networks are owned by conglomerate corporations such as AOL-Time-Warner, therefore, all are biased. Plain and simple.

Other than that, you hear from a variety of far-left sources like the Orwellian sounding \\"Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting,\\" a news watchdog group that only complains about conservative or alleged rightwing bias in the news. Another key figure is MediaMatters \\"CEO\\" David Brock, a self-confessed liar and ex-hitman for the Clinton hating right, now a convenient subordinate of the George Soros Empire doing the same exact thing.

Their shows are full of angry men ranting about and whose testosterone level is only exceeded by their seeming hatred (for what we're never quite sure) of the evils of the liberal establishment (we're never quite sure who they are either, but we're led to believe its anyone who dare to question the just cause of the ultra-right wing of the Republican Party).FoxNews - it would be laughable only if it weren't so dangerous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"I read the reviews and thought this video would have some groundbreaking report but it only really proved that O'Reilly is an ignorant, noisy, bigot and that Fox News has a political agenda, which can be said for CNN.

But even more troubling is FOX'S ADHD approach to news, which it shares with every other cable news network.

The project seems to have relied on a simple prospect: that the best arguments against Fox would be presented by Fox personnel themselves. Using a system of 24/7 observers, and keeping a complete record of Fox News broadcasts recorded using a system of DVD recorders, the production team was able to compile a damning record of shoddy journalism masquerading as network news.The pacing of the film is brisk, and only occasionally moves a bit too too slowly. The documentation of the Fox News's complicity with what could only be described as a propaganda machine is irrefutable. This documentary is well worth the watch. The average citizen may never look at television news the same way it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Media Bias Exposed","review":"If you've been one to dismiss claims of media bias as inflammatory, this is the movie for you.

The level of partisan bias literally made my jaw drop. Anyway, this documentary exposes how this type of bias is implemented by actual memos, talking points, reinforcement, and threats of firing (if reporting is not sufficiently partisan). The bias is not even really \\"conservative\\", it's more like cheerleading for whatever the corporate elite would find favorable.

Instead, reviewers should focus on Outfoxed and its merits or lack thereof. Listen, I am a fan of McDonalds (both the company and the fries), but I thought Supersize Me was excellent. Do I agree with everything in Supersize Me? Of course not. But do I think it was an entertaining, well-constructed documentary (of sorts)?

It doesn't really matter what you think of Fox, but Outfoxed is a waste of an hour or so of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"lying liars on the left","review":"the loony left has an excellent teacher in michael moore. deceive through selective editing to prop up your agenda. liberals hate fox because they are no longer able to control the debate. it's really as simple as that, and like a spoiled child that always gets what they want, when you finally tell them no, look out. for years we heard if you don't like cnn, network news, etc. start your own network. now that conservatives have a more balanced point of view the left can't stop crying. liberal's remember the day when there were almost no conservatives on tv, and when they were represented, they were always out numbered and usually shouted down. fox has changed that. the left's mouth-piece al franken said it best, respond to conservatives with scorn and ridicule. say it often enough and people will believe it [ especially those that only pay attention when it's time to vote ] this is propaganda at it's worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fox Has Truly Been OutFoxed","review":"The video is a serious effort to expose the reality that Fox News is the American Pravda. Conservatives will cringe at the notion but facts are facts. Although the video clearly has a viewpoint, it presents its viewpoint through the firsthand expierences and knowledge of former Fox producers and other employees.The video is important because we are entering an era where both \\"wings\\" - right or left - seek \\"news\\" presented from an opinion based or philosophy based perspective. True journalism - the doman of the traditional skeptic - is shunned in favor of validating a partisan viewpoint. Fox set the trend. The others are following."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fox Is Like Any Other Cable News Channel","review":"Fox news is no different from any other cable news channel; it sucks! Sure, it has a right-wing tilt, but as a conservative I'm not impressed. Like any TV news station, network, cable, or otherwise, it resorts to shock journalism and tabloid sensationalizing.I found Fox News offensive long before I detected any bias; it's loud, noisy, and obnoxious. And they aren't any good at their bias. Their lineup is full of conservative lightweights like Sean Hannity. I miss the good old days of Crossfire on CNN when Pat Buchannan had it out with Micheal Kingsly. Sure, they were two extremeists, but at least they were smart.OUTFOXED seems more obsessed with coroporate control of the news, intstead of the overall dumbing down of it.It's sad to see our country looking to ANY TV NEWS for their information. Take some time and READ FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"was there ever any doubt?","review":"Really a very good analysis of Fox News and the right wing slant of Corp owned news. Fox has proven itself again and again to be anything but \\"Fair and Balanced\\".The movie picks Fox apart, calling it on the lies and spin that it calls \\"Fair and Balanced\\". A great look at how neo-cons have suckered in people into believing what they want you to believe. I would also like to recommend FAIR magazine for those who are really looking for a balanced look at todays news."},{"rating":"1","title":"unable to focus in low light","review":"As the owner of a bigger, more complicated digital camera for \\"serious\\" photography, I purchased this camera to bring along with me in my pocket to parties, happy hours, etc. BIG MISTAKE. This camera will not focus AT ALL in low light. I sent it back for exchange, thinking I had a lemon, and received a replacement that was just as bad. I called the manufacturer to complain, and was told \\"a camera at this price has limitations.\\" Like being unable to focus?!?! I would expect this from a cheesey, no-name brand, but not from Konica Minolta (who now, in my opinion, rank with the cheesey no-name brands)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I bought the X31 to replace a dimage X that I had used real hard over the last couple years. Great sized-camera, and it took amazing photos! The dimage X was awesome, but couldn't handle the rough usage I put it through, with the lens cover finally wearing out. The lithium battery life was also lame. I finally had to replace it and made the mistake of buying the dimage X31.The only good thing about the dimage X31 is the use of standard AA batteries, although the batteries don't last long. The exposure/focus is just horrible as compared to the dimage X. The silly toggle switch is lame. The menu is just plain difficult compared to the dimage X. Also, the toggle switch between the video mode and still mode is placed in a stupid location.DONT BOTHER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst camera ever","review":"I have a Dimage Xt as does about 5 other people I know. We all love them. So, I recommended the X31 to a friend. That was the biggest mistake I have ever made.The X31 is a piece of trash. It is unable to take focussed pictures inside a dimly lit bar. My Xt had no problems taking pictures in the same situation.If you want a camera that takes pictures in focus, you should avoid the X31."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I was hoping that when I pay a good amount of money for a product from a well known company which has a reputation in photgraphy, i'll get a camera that can take pictures. With the x31 that is hardly the case since the camera doesn't know how to focus. If you plan on taking pictures anywhere other than under glaring lights or the midday sun, buy another camera because the camera will just get confused and give you that little red dot telling you it can't focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Book but Coan's Attack on Chapin's Family Are Sorry","review":"Coan did a mediocre job writing the book. Provides some insight in Harry's life. The book might have even gone over well if Coan did not constantly slam Harry's widow Sandi at every opportunity in the prologue and epilogue. His actions showed NO CLASS which Harry had a lot of. I imagine Harry Chapin would roll over in his grave if he saw it. If he had problems with Sandi, he should have left them unspoken. I do not recommend wasting your money on this book. I sure wish I had my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coan's writing style and self-absorbed attitude does not do his subject justice","review":"An accurate sub-title to this book might be: \\"How I screwed Sandy Chapin\\", as the author continually makes disparaging remarks about her. There's an irony in this author fairly gloating over the fact that he won a lawsuit against her for attempting to halt the publication of this book and then, as he mentions the lawsuit she won against the trucking company who's vehicle stuck Harry's car, suggests that she donate some of the funds to WHY-because \\"They could use the money\\".Whatever bug Coan has up his posterior gets in the way of his biography of a fascinating, insightful and very human man we knew. It's my hope that the family, who continues Harry's causes, will one day write a better biography than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of a Life","review":"I had no idea that this book existed, so being a die hard Chapin fan I snatched it off the shelf when I saw it. While an interesting read it could have used a bit more polishing. Learning more details of Harry's story songs was a positive, as was learning what really turned his personal life around. His music always moved me, but I was more touched to learn that the efforts to save his marriage was why he became such an effective activist. It did seem a bit overlong at times, however, and Coan's refusal to even mention 'the widows' name as he slammed her in the introduction seemed mean spirited. If he had told us a bit more as to why there was a fallout between them it would have been more constructive. Still, if you loved Chapin's music, as so many obviously did, and do, it's a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating even for one who doesn't know the music","review":"I bought the book because I knew my brother liked Harry Chapin. Before I gave it to him I casually thought I'd read it. I was amazed by the man. It is a great read if you know his music. I did not at first but have since bought all his CDs and read the book again. It is even better the second time around. Buy it if you can. At least ask for it. They may reprint it. Every Chapin fan should have it. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry still Rules!","review":"If you are a Harry Chapin fan this is a must read. Even if you aren't a Harry Chapin fan, you just might be after reading this account of his interesting and amazing life. This is not a puff piece. This shows Harry for what and who he really was. It was one of the few books that I have ever read that was hard for me to put down after I had read for awhile. His early life and tragic death are clarified. Some of the later chapers are a little dull when it goes on in too much detail about his charitable works. However, overall, I rate this as a 5 star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album I own.","review":"My wife and I loaded up the CD carousel and held a female vocalist face-off. No one could touch Margo Timmins. There's more to her voice than just \\"pretty\\". It's definitely that, but it's filled with other nuances that touch one in ways one can only hope to be touched before one's time in this life is up. If they don't play this in heaven then I'm not interested in going. Thank you, God, for giving us Margo and Trinity Sessions. Buy two, give one to someone you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophmoric? I think not....","review":"Trinity sessions, released in 1988, followed the Cowboy Junkies first album, \\"White Off Earth Now.\\" This is one of those few albums that now matter how I try, I cannot find the words to describe it. Right up front the listener is confronted with Margo Timmons' voice on a traditional piece called \\"Mining for Gold,\\" and from there it only gets better. \\"Misguided Angel,\\"\\"200 More Miles,\\" and Hank Williams' \\"So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" are only a few of the highlight of this album.... And there are no low points... none at all. Margo Timmons is one of those rare gifts given to humanity. Her voice cuts like the sharpest of knives, and soothes like the coolest of salves. Micheal Timmons plays the guitar not with virtuosity and technical ability, but more like a master sculpter who wields his hammer and chisel, knowing precisely when to strike hard or gently.You gotta hear this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Original!!!","review":"The Trinity Session is a CD you must buy!! The songs are enchanting and the lyrics are full of meaning. It is an unusual style, but it is a great break from the usual sounds of songs today.

Also, the vocal elements were overwhelmed by the instruments on some tracks. Not unhappy with the purchase though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"The one word I would use to define this album is \\"lugubrious\\". I had read a lot about it, so I bought it, listened to it, and I won't be listening to it a second time.The album is static. There are no changes in tempo. Every song is slow. There are no changes in dynamics. The volume never changes. The songs are indistinguishable to me. There is very little range in Margo's voice. The vocals run in a range betwen middle C and middle G.The pluses are 1) Margo Timmins has a nice voice, albeit in a limited range and 2) the harmonica playing is well done. Other than that, I'm at a loss to understand the appeal of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothin' happening","review":"This was recommended to me but sorry, it just didn't do it.Skip this and find something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisite gem","review":"A mesmerizing selection of songs...mellow and hypnotic and one of my top five favorite albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasure for ears","review":"The sultry voice of Margo Timmens live recording at the church The Holy Trinity in Toronto. This is Blue Grass/Folk from the highest level.

So I,am glad with these album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboy Junkies, The Trinity Session","review":"As an artist, I tend to produce a better product when I can listen to soft music in the background. This group is very talented. On this particular CD, a single vocal artist is featured. However, every member of this group has their own unique style which I'ver heard on other recordings. I'll be purchasing them soon also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best, too lifeless, undynamic","review":"Hipster favorite \\"Sweet Jane\\" cover is very good, the rest of the record a bit lifeless and undynamic. It's all in the same vein. Lugubrious mood throughout. Many love the recording and they should be credited for the attempt at a minimalist ambient sound. But there's a constant sibilance to her voice that annoys me and, again, I think the fragile set-up compelled the lack of dynamics. Some of the songs are suited to the sound, but not all of them. One Soul Now is an infinitely better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Misguided Angels on this one","review":"I also first heard \\"Sweet Jane\\" on radio, during a pleasant soak with a glass of semillon.Searched for weeks to get the vinyl (yes, that long ago). And what a magic collection this is.If you thought that listening to Percy Sledge or Aretha or Parvarotti or Piaf was listening to the voice of God, prepare yourself.The whole structure is loose, blue, soulsy cowboy, with more than a touch of junkie. And sung by an angel.In the words of Shakespeare: \\"An admirable musician! O, she will sing the savageness out of a bear.\\"Too bad we can only rate up to 5 stars, I would have give many, many more for this excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album","review":"The Cowboy Junkies was a fantastic band, and this is a fantastic album.

Can't think of anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions not enough","review":"Good singing but intrumental skills not up to par with those of average alternative band. Meldoies almost pleasing and lyrics a bit pretentious. This band could do so much more if it put its trust in the right producer who's willing to hire some good studio musicians to lend a hand. Sincere effort but better producing needed on next CD. Songs a bit typical of average Alt band- sincere and idiosincratic at best, second rate at worse. Also, cover art looks a bit amateurish - musicians should stick to music. Then again, this is not an art review."},{"rating":"1","title":"No expiration date","review":"The item itself is great but I would suggest ordering from fitrx or muscledepot instead.

And then he's up there testing how hard he can push down on your arm and touching your right side of your head or the left to tell if one side of the brain is off. I don't beleive this works. The cost is not worth what you get. Not much. I recommend Joel Osteen or Glenn Harrold for changing the way you think is a much better investment. PS.

Everything here is great, but it doesn't include some of his most popular gospel songs, like \\"Crying in the Chapel\\" and \\"How Great Thou Art\\".

I'll just add a couple of things. :) One thing (and I know it's the wildest of pipe-dreams) is that I would love for someone to reissue this CD with the cover art Jim FitzPatrick painted for it. Despite the fact that, IMO, the art was some of the best Jim ever did for Lizzy, the record company decided to go with something more \\"modern\\" and \\"metal\\". From what I understand, Phil Lynnot was NOT pleased with that decision. One other factoid, for those who give a damn: \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott once listed \\"Cold Sweat\\" as among his top ten favorite songs.It is such a CRIME that this was the last Thin Lizzy album. I just watched the \\"Live and Dangerous\\" DVD on the 4th, 22 years after Phil's death. What a great band.Rest in peace, Philo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hammer of the gods","review":"This almost sounds like a live record; it flows with two crescendos; begininng and middle. Lynott, along with Hendrix, was the only black musician who took white rock head on, and won. Love the anglo dual/duelling guitars, poetic prose, song painting, 50's through 80's lineage, and how 'bout that rhythm section?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out with a bang","review":"I found Thin Lizzy to be either tired or hit-and-miss during the Snowy White albums. Thunder and Lightning was not so much a return to form as an evolution into something different. The higher energy numbers like \\"Cold Sweat\\" and the title track had more power than Lizzy had shown, and even something moodier like \\"The Sun Goes Down\\" still had a dark energy beneath the surface. In a perfect world, there would have been no need to Lizzy to split after this effort, clearly there was life left and the new blood John Sykes brought to the band had to have helped.I'd seen the other reviews criticizing poor sound quality on the Wounded Bird release, but with no extra tracks on the Import Version I couldn't justify the higher price. True, this is no remaster, but if you're like me and have only had this one on vinyl for 20 years it's good to have a reasonably-priced version you can listen to without \\"dragging out all the gear\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some quality stuff here...","review":"Is it the best Thin Lizzy release? NoAm I glad I purchased this? YesDoes it have some quality Lizzy stuff Yes!I'd much rather have given this release 3.5 stars.Big complaint- The sound quality on the Wounded bird reissue really drags this disc down.The rundown- Okay, there is some generic \\"metal\\" stuff that goes on here.At times the band is trying to mine territory done a tad better by Judas Priest or other 80's hard rock/heavy metal bands.Took me awhile to warm up to this disc.I'm probably in the minority here, but I enjoyed 1980's \\"Chinatown\\" and 1981's \\"Renegade\\" albums a bit more than this one.That said we have some great tracks here.\\"Thunder and Lightning\\", \\"This is the one\\", and \\"Bad Habits\\" will get you going. \\"The Sun goes down\\" slows things down but is a great smoldering track.This was the last Lizzy disc I purchased to round out my collection.This disc also took me the longest to digest and get into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...","review":"Frankly, I'm shocked by all of the praise this album has received on this site. This is basically 80's schlock-hair metal with no hint of the Thin Lizzy that reigned supreme in the mid-seventies. Lynott sounds tired; probably wasted.

Everything else sounds derivitive, forced, and just plain boring..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving the best for last","review":"Must have for all Lizzy fans.

It turned from hard to eat to \\"I can't wait to eat this after my workout.\\" I highly recommend any of you with a high-powered blender to try this. It makes two giant bowls with all that ice and fruit so you can eat it all or save some for later (If frozen overnight nuke it on fairly low power for a minute and it should stay ice-cream like.)

It makes me feel better after drinking it, but that could be psychosomatic. It costs a bunch, but it comes in nice packets, which specify servings and nutrition information. You could probably achieve the same thing with one of those big buckets of questionable off-white powder, but then you don't get the impressive packaging and presentations. I mean, if the things is psychosomatic, then every little bit helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible \\"diet\\" taste","review":"Nutritionally, Myoplex is pretty good. It has a good ratio of carbs to protein, it's low sugar, and contains some vitamins and minerals. However, the taste leaves a lot to be desired. Drinking this stuff mixed with water or milk is one of the most vile tasting concoctions I've ever tried. The taste is so cloyingly artificially sweet that it makes any diet soda seem appealing, and I hate diet soda. If there was ever such a thing as diet Yoo-Hoo, this is how I imagine it would taste. I need to throw in a few scoops of peanut butter, or chocolate powder, or yogurt, or whatever I can find in my cupboard to get this stuff to be anything close to palatable. I'm definitely going to try another brand as soon as I finish my remaining packets...or maybe before."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This album is only 20+ minutes long and doesn't start to cover the career of a truly great singer.

My interest in buying the book was for possible linguistic comparison, but the author only names a few native gods and gives very little in the native languages.The author prides himself in identifying his allegience to French methodology.

I've studied/practiced the Course off and on for many years, and I've seen first hand how incredibly easy it is to become very new-agey and completely run the wrong way with the Course's teachings. Studying any of Dr. Wapnick's writings is like having the blinders lifted from one's eyes in this regard, and I believe \\"Journey Through the Workbook\\" is by far his best and most important work to date. This set has completely transformed by understanding and practice of the Course; I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth study of the ACIM Workbook lessons","review":"These 8 volumes of commentary is a wonderful in-depth study and review of the 365 days of lessons in the Workbook of A Course in Miracles.

This work should not be attempted, however, until the Course student FIRST takes the 365 day workbook lessons one day at a time.

Must read.","review":"In my 30 yrs of school in music, philosophy and art I have never found a more comprehensive and consistent ideology than in \\"A Course In Miracles\\". It is the best book I ever read and will ever read. The Metaphysical teachings of Jesus in ACIM, is truly the most remarkable and effective \\"life-guide\\" I could ever have imagined to find. Kenneth Wapnick's workbook for ACIM, is the perfect companion to ACIM's teachings. In it, Kenny highlights and ties all of ACIM's 3 books into one comprehensive, mind-blowing understanding. Godspeed... For those who want to leave this illusion of life and wake up in God, One forever..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrated with ACIM poetic form and proliferous pronouns?","review":"In the light of over a dozen language translations, many have asked when is there going to be a translation in English. These sincere but frustrating requests are asking for an untangling of the poetic forms, the proliferous and confusing pronouns and the use of every day words that have different meaning in the Course e.g. miracles etc. I personally read every volume word for word and hylited in outline form and was transformed. The \\"Light\\" has truly came on. These 8 volumes helped me SO much. You also could sample the single volume clarifying the Manual for Teachers if you choose to start off slower. You will see what I mean in reading it that Ken Wapnick has offered, at last, a clarification in easy to read English. It has taught me to say and mean \\"I love you\\" to all living things\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Burgh espouses a Lebanese flavor","review":"This album is worth it if only for the incredible duet \\"Lebanese Night\\" (with Lebanese singer Elissa). The melody is instantly pleasing while the lyrics are extremely poignant. It's wonderful to note that Chris De Burgh, not unlike such artists as Sting (\\"Desert Rose\\"), is finally experimenting with Arabic music in a way that creates a truly global sound. Elissa's vocals on the track only add to its haunting quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Burgh keeps it fresh after 27 years","review":"You would think that after 25+ years in the music business, having amassed a personal fortune estimated at nearly $50 million, Chris de Burgh might be ready to hang it all up and head to beach pictured on the cover of \\"Timing is Everything\\".Or, at the very least, you might think he'd simply throw together a few half-developed tracks and call it an album.Wrong on both counts.De Burgh is still in great voice throughout the 11 songs on \\"Timing is Everything\\", and his lyrics still have the ability to paint vivid pictures of love, war and compassion.The opening and closing tracks (\\"Guilty Secret\\" and \\"Save Me\\", respectively) are the album's weakest. Not bad songs, necessarily, but they just lack the depth we have become accustomed to from De Burgh.The rest of the album is absolutely excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Secrets\\" from your healthcare team!","review":"As an oncology nurse I am constantly looking for resources that will be helpful to my patients.

The grill surface is huge so feel free to cook for an army! The real plus is the simplicity of the design and construction. Parts are easy to replace but that probably won't be necessary. A lot of bang for the buck. I found the ash receptacle very easy to clean. It might be awkward for grandma to move around but this is no behemoth that is frightful to negotiate.

He resorts to many of the same pitfalls that he sees in Eurocentric authors by presenting the East as the sole site of pre-1800 civilization. I understand that he is trying to undermine Eurocentric arguments, but by being so obviously one-sided he is defeating his own cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic","review":"This book is very disappointing and not up to the usual scholarly standards one associates with Cambridge University Press.

The CP9150 is actually a CP9145 with extra cables and a case. (Not mentioned in advertising). When I inquired about getting a cable (not included) for my 91 Talon, I also asked why I could not read the fault codes on my 2000 Cadillac STS and 99 Chevy Conversion Van this is what I understood the Actron technicion to say: \\"This unit is not capable of reading and will not read problem codes for ABS, Body, Drive Train, Transmission or Motor, only Gov. regulated emission codes.\\" I certainly got the wrong impression from their Ad.

Patrick Moraz helped pioneer the world music genre. He has a good amount of Brasilian percussion and rhythms not heard this half of the globe since Sergio Mendes and Astrud Gilberto! John McBurnie and Viv McAuliffe (who I heard of through Anthony Phillips) providing vocals makes this more accessible to the mainstream. It's a long-running practise in prog and sometimes blues where it's one person's name on the front and someone else singing (like Rick Wakeman for starters!). Some of what we've heard on \\"Relayer\\" is here as well.Moraz says the album is really one piece, but he segmented it to make it more convenient. After this, he would leave Yes and have a solo career, as well as a stint in Moody Blues which ended in legal acrimony.Originally released 1976 by Atlantic Records in the US and Canada, and Charisma/Philips Records for the rest of the free world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant masterpiece from Yes' most innovative keyboardis","review":"The Story Of I has been with me for 23 years.

The only downside is that for the grill to fit into the case you have to remove the T handle to reduce the total length.

If it does break, the handle will not stay attached rendering the handle un-useable. Time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit the grill well","review":"The case is too short in width to easily fit the grill. It is very tight and you have to work the grill down into the case slowly at each end. It will not rest at the bottom of the case but gets stuck halfway down so the cover is difficult to zip closed.

I may very well fit if I just had the BBQ and no base. But I think almost all of these cookers are sold with the retractable legs, and this case will absolutely not fit if you have those. I think the same thing happened to the buyers that previously got my case as the box it came in was taped up so it was obviously sold before. I thought about taking off the base, but that is not a simple job and completely unpractical to take off the base, store, put base back on when you use it.If you only have the top part this case will be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first accessory you should get for your RoadTrip Grill!","review":"Why doesn't this just come with the grill? This case is a must have if you own the RoadTrip grill. You're going to get your grill dirty and this case keeps it all enclosed so there's nothing getting your car/truck dirty. They could have made it a little bit bigger, because it's pretty tight getting the grill in there. It has pockets to store the grates, but no place to put a propane tank or the regulator. But it's very well made and looks like it will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Grill fit perfect. Excellent way to store it when it's not in use.

We purchased a new Coleman Road Trip Grill, Model No. 9941A (the Blue one) in July. Although the ads say that this carrying case with wheels works on all Coleman Road Trip Grill models, this is simply not true. We could not get the grill to fit in the case with the stand, let alone the two side tables and the tank. This carrying case must only fit the older grills that are red in color and have the older fold-up stand. Coleman was not helpful at all and it took two emails and several weeks before they even acknowledged my questions and concerns. I returned the carrying case as it is of no use to us if we can't get the grill in it.

By leaving the stand extended and shortening the leg, and then placing it in the bag and collapsing it, to fit almost perfectly.Coleman needs to put directions in and on the box.Another issue that I have and a few others also have, is the fact that one end of the bag will not zip around the chrome handle on the grill. I am thinking this might be a variance in sewing technique, making some bags slightly smaller. I cannot imagine another reason that it works for some and not others. I am not going to remove the handle on the grill.

Seems like it would be more of hassle to use than not use it. We will be returning the carry case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman Road Trip Wheeled Carry Case does not fit grill","review":"The case it great, but it does not fit the Coleman Road Trip grill we have, handle sticks out the top and it is unable to zip. Very disappointed in Coleman and it's misleading advertisement for this case. Love the grill however! Next time, make the grill lock shut so you can roll it without the grates falling off, and make a case to fit it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman Wheeled Carry Case","review":"I am not impressed with this product.

The good thing is that they paid for the return postage and issued a complete refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessity if you have the grill","review":"Personally, I think this travel case is a necessity if you own the grill and intend on taking it in the car. I use my grill for tailgating every home game on Sunday's and I keep it stored in this bag both in my garage and in my car (when transporting it). It's great! It is easy to put the grill into and easy to open and close the bag. It also keeps any grease that may fall out of the grill (although I don't think that's ever happened to me) and more importantly, it contains the smell of a BBQ while it's in your trunk.The only reason I am not giving it a 5-star rating is because I think the bag needs some form of taller handle that allows you to easily stroll the bag without having to bend down a bit. It's not like your back hurts, but it is more of an annoyance than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned","review":"It does not fit the Coleman grill with the wheels and handle.

The grill fits really well and gives me a warm fuzzy knowing that any grease not cleaned will not end up where it should not (on the camper or the truck). It has handy wheels that make moving it around real easy, and getting it down from the pick up with the built in handles also makes things easier. The extra grates that we have bought for the grill fit in the pockets and storing the grill brush with the grill is another plus. It seems really well constructed and I expect will last us for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T FIT ALL coleman grills","review":"I like the cover with its inside pockets and the velcro straps and wheels. However, it does not fit all the grills as the description says. The handle sticks out of the case if you have a Road Trip LXE (red grill) so you can not zip it up all the way. I kept the case because it does protect it better than nothing and it does give us a way to store the extra grills, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for improved Portability","review":"This case is I think a necessity if you own the LXE. I saw reviews complaining about the large handle not working with the case and quickly realized that all you have to do is press the little spring loaded button in and pull out the handle and throw it in the case with the grill. It is almost too simple and if you own the Roadtrip you will realize that toting it around is not easy as the wheels and handle design make it impossible to pull behind anyone larger than 5 feet tall. That is where the case comes in, it makes the grill so easy to pull around. I keep my tongs, fork, spatula and scraper, and a large tray to grill veggies on in the compartments.The only problem I noticed was a smell, the new chemical smell mixed with cold air in our foyer closet where it is kept made a smelly locker must, it has been about 2 weeks and it is about gone, I don't know if that happens with all of them but it wasn't too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made and durable.","review":"I received this carry case and was immediately impressed with the construction of it.

All I can say is I really *do* enjoy this album -- and after having listened to it many, many times, I'm convinced that the lovely Miss Delpy will murder someone within five years. In bed. With a knife, or perhaps an ice pick. Now if the Beach Boys'd pinch one of her songs, it'd be absolute perfection!

There's absolutely nothing in 'Julie Delpy' (sorry but she chose to make it eponymous). No voice, except a long and monotone litany throughout the album. No music, except poor, very poor compositions. No lyrics, except depressed sentences but where you feel she didn't really 'believe' what she is singing. I don't know, it's like she's making it for the gallery, to show she's a sad & unhappy person who deserves a better life, which I am sure she's not.

Everytime I hear him hit a bad note, it makes me wince. Same goes for Mike Portnoy. He is an excellent, innovative drummer, one that I look up to, but he goes a bit overboard with his singing, for his vocal abilities are very limited. Otherwise the musicianship is good quality.

One thing that I don't like is that it has to charge for 16 hours before you can use it. However, the signal strength is exactly what they said it would be. Set up is very easy, but if you don't use a Motorola modem (cable) then signal strength isn't very strong and it can fail on you in the middle of a conversation. It works excellent with the SB5100 Motorola modem, and will not slow down your internet.And if you want another IMFree in addition to the one you already have, you DO NOT have to buy a new starter kit, you can buy a companion. A companion contains just the IMFree and no base, and it is easily registered to the existing base."},{"rating":"2","title":"From A Teens View","review":"I think that this product is a very good tool to have a round the house.

They sent me the URL to an FAQ, which told me that the working range for these things is 150 feet. Very frustrating. It seems they did not even read my question.

It has the option to select service at the splash screen, but for the time being, only has AIM. I recomend this product highly. Also, numerous reviews have stated that the computer can be off. It MUST be on while using this product. It communicates through a program that must be running on the computer.

Marguerite Feitlowitz has interviewed and probed into Argentina's past with an ear toward the language used and its effect upon the victims of the Dirty War. As a person who has studied and written about this time, I was fascinated to read her approach. The language used by the torturers of Argentina was sinister and telling; she has solved the puzzle of their words and let the world understand their aims and goals.

But I'm giving it 2 stars because the sizing is way off and the fabric seems plow quality. We ordered a 9-month outfit for our 7-month old (who is of average to just-below-average size), and it doesn't fit. We will have to buy a separate shirt, and the pants may still fit when we need it next week, but they'll be a little tight...and his legs are normally still fitting into 3-6 months pants!! Sigh. The hat completely didn't fit, even when it arrived when he was 5.5 months. Sort of expected that, because his head circumfrance is on the larger size, but was a little surprised, given that it's supposed to fit a 9-month old. So we had to buy a new hat. All in all, I would probably suggest buying the knickers/suspenders/tie separately (if that's an option) and trying to find a shirt/hat elsewhere.

If they don't recognize the man's brilliance immediately as in \\"Oh him... amazing voice\\" they are either too young or have no musical taste whatsoever.This is a classic selection of Matt's work and absolutely ridiculous value at the price Amazon.com are offering. Pick any song at random and you will realize that this man was literally second to nobody in this world. Like Jack Jones (another of my fave singers) Matt was his own man and never walked in anybody's shadow.Who knows, maybe if he'd been born on our side of the Atlantic, he could have soared even higher, but as other fans have said, it is actually very gratifying to know that we always knew him for the genius that he truly was."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding voice. no one sings love songs better.","review":"I wish we in this country had the opportunity to share his music as much as his fellow brits.

Before The Beatles invaded America, British singers were not too popular. Monro's smooth style and phrasing are similar to Sinatra and Jack Jones (for comparison purposes), and his accompaniment mostly from Johhny Spence are first rate.Monro went on to become a worldwide sensation (except in America) selling out concerts in Europe and especially in the Philippines.This 3-cd set is a great introduction and if you like the aforementioned Sinatra and especially Jack Jones..........this cd will grow on you. Monro not only sang the great song standards.....but also introduced songs that were new (for the time) which have become standards.highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very close and worth it for the price","review":"Yes, the magnificent Matt Monro distinctive sound is slightly lacking, but the price for this great collection makes it worth it. I have been a MM fan for well over 40 years so I know the best MM sound. I do not know why these CD's are not perfect, ie. careless recording, old masters, etc. I am happy nonetheless. I now think that I have all of his recordings. My guess is that a perfect CD set (3 CD's) of this music would cost between 5 and 10 times the Amazon price. I ripped this music onto my computer at the highest quality and it is just fine to listen to. I highly recommend these CD's to all MM fans, but act quickly, Amazon only has a few left.

It really takes you back to the 1800s, and what life was like for the elitists of the day. I loved Mark Browning. Although, I have to say that Caroline is right for that day and age. She would never wait around for a man like that in the modern world. I liked being reminded that things like the telephone and electricity hadn't been invented. Let alone a firehouse! What we take for granted in modern times! Again, very good story. Eugenia Price is in her own class with this one. I've never been to Savannah (and I live in Georgia,) but I can't wait to go, now.

I was even more disappointed to learn that there was a sequel so I wasn't even granted an end to this dull novel. The first few chapters were interesting and held promise but then the story just lost its charm and plodded along . All the characters (except for Osmond Kott) were basically the same--loving, caring, good, noble, beautiful. I found Price's writing to be too flowery and idealistic. She needs to spice things up more to hold my interest. I do not recommend this book unless you want to learn a little about the South during that era. And if you're looking for a romance novel--go for the ones that have real passion in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eugenia Price continues to showcase her knowledge of Georgia","review":"While \\"Savannah\\" is an excellent book, Eugenia Prices' writing history of Coastal Georgia started long before now.

Although I didn't finish \\"Savannah\\" until after my trip, I found it provided a good historical background on the city. It wasn't among the most compelling works of historical fiction I've read, but the characters were interesting and the book provided a valuable perspective on Savannah at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries.Visitors interested in the city's beautiful buildings should consider taking Jonathan Stalcup's \\"Architectural Tour of Savannah.\\" The easy 90-minute walking tour included many of the places mentioned in the book and was doubly interesting because of the connections."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic L&R release.

Boy, was I mistaken. This album far exceeds any expectation I could have ever had. A true 80's psychedelic masterpiece. The only problem? The CD reissues never were the same version as the album. Several different mixes on different releases, always diluting the stew. Until now. Here it is the original mix, in the original running order AND all of the various mixes (well, most of them due to time constraints) and B-sides too!As Jack Kirby once said:\\"Don't ask, just buy!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved sound for a good record","review":"It's surprising that both \\"Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven\\" and \\"Express\\" will only be reissued in Europe, and not the United States. Love & Rockets have never been popular in Britain, we need these CDs HERE!This edition consolidates 4 fairly different remixes from 3 different markets. (UK, USA, Canada). It doesn't include the (superior?) US mix of 'Dog-End of A Day Gone By', a major oversight. Oops! The budget for 'remastering' the album may not have been high - the new sound is louder but not as detailed as I hoped. That said - it sounds far better than the old mid-'80s CD master.The real test will be the remastered \\"Express\\" - a much more exciting album. Except for 'Inside the Outside', most of this album is slow-tempo in the Bauhaus style, with a small hint of the 'poppy' melodies they would soon adapt. Still, a good record from a band that seems to be slipping through the cracks in recent music history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who writes all these five star reviews???

Of course it always helps to have one of them a Special Forces, Black Ops or SEAL and someone in the government (or the Whole Government) as the bad guy(s). I like series books too - as long as they're all previously published. I hate to wait. My favorites are Anthony DeCosmo's \\"Beyond Armageddon\\" and Richard Phillips' \\"The Rho Agenda\\".Having said that, I think I hit pay dirt again with Bob Mayer's Area 51 series. His first book in the series, AREA 51, has a good group: Special Forces guy, free lance reporter, archeologist and (Nazi) Physicist (eclectic group). Flawlessly bring them together to challenge a mad (?) Air Force General in charge of Area 51 and you got a great story line.I just started REPLY.If you are interested, the order of the series goes something like this: Area 51; Reply; Mission; Sphinx; Grail; Excalibur; Truth. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Start","review":"The first book in the Area 51 series is a fun read.

I can't believe this is the same book everyone else is reviewing. It's not a bad book, but it is certainly not a 5-star book.Area 51 attempts to explain every mystery in the world, like Atlantis, the Great Pyramid, Easter Island, UFOs, crop circles, cave paintings, the creation of the atom bomb, the Nazis, and your wife's latest haircut. The large amount of mysteries described and supposedly solved with a single common solution really stretches the believability factor. The plot, while action-packed, is silly and unbelievable. The characters are static, two-dimensional, cookie-cutter stereotypes with no growth or development whatsoever.Area 51 is a quick pulp novel with not a lot of depth. If you just want a quick mindless read, it's okay. If you're looking for something with a bit more meat and believability, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !","review":"Facts and Fiction intermingle to tell one hell of a story!

From the file menu, choose Open Image Sequence. 2. In Open dialog box, locate and select any one of the sequentially named files and click Open.\\" etc. etc. As I said, QTPro isn't rocket science. I followed this guide and had a problem. I clicked on the sequentially named files and it wouldn't load more than 2 images. Why? The book didn't give me any clues.

There aren't many instances where I'll not finish a book, but I'm debating not finishing tis one.

I have noticed that many people say he is a very good writer, but this book certainly dispelled that allegation. The writing in this book is mediocre at best and the story itself is completely stupid. Anyone who has ever backpacked knows that the chances of seeing 3 mountain lions, I believe 5 bears and a plethora of other wildlife over the course of what, 3 days, is just not realistic. The story is so transparent that i wanted to grab the supposed hero of the book and choke him for being so terribly stupid. If a madman is chasing you and you manage to knock him down, Make Sure He Stays DOWN. This happened I think 4 times in the story. In addition, if the madman gives you a compass and tells you to go in a certain direction, Go a Different Way. There were so many plot holes and contradictions it was astounding. Everything was so improbable. Really a terrible read. Spend your money on anything but this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written past reason ... and then some!","review":"Based on the many positive blurbs from other well-known writers that appeared on the cover, I picked this one up thinking it might be a grand introduction to a great writer I had somehow overlooked all these years. Having read it now, I feel that neither the introduction or the oversight was all that grand.Matheson takes a classic thriller idea -- one man hunts another in the wilderness -- and loses it in a wild, untamed land of unlikable, unbelievable characters and less-than-possible plot twists. Despite being well-written when it comes to style, HUNTED PAST REASON is not written well enough that one suspends all reason or disbelief to get thoroughly lost in the story.If you're hunting for a good thriller, you're on the wrong trail with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A totally predictable retread.","review":"The title says it all, baby! This story is so old that Alfred Hitchcock would call it derivative. Can't understand why this rotten old story was published.

By halfway in, I found myself hoping that the \\"bad guy\\" would be successful in his quest to off the whining, moaning, holier-than-thou \\"hero\\". My God, this was a terrible book. The absolute capper for me was the episode with the trapped mountain lion. How lame can you get? This appears to me to have been a \\"Outer Limits\\" screenplay gone terribly wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, mindless, boring","review":"Reading this novel was like watching a B suspense movie.

It starts out okay and then there is a part where the writer must have said \\"Oh [...] I have to finish this thing!\\" and started cranking out the flat downhill ending.I gave this book a low rating because it was written by a supposed master writer. Was this a first novel I might have given it three stars. I was really hoping for a surprise plot twist or clever ending, but man it was dead on predictable; crazy vet, soft liberal, bad guy dies as many as three times only to return again, and the damned repeated talking the animals down, what was that all about - maybe once but three times? I have also backpacked a lot and sighting bears that many times in so few days seems too much.

This was far fetched and not worth much more than the $1 I paid for it at a dollar general."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd known","review":"... how lousy this book was. I wish I'd thought to log in to Amazon and read the other reviews before being sucked in by the Matheson name in an airport bookstore. I wanted to throw the book down the air-flusher.It was like a bad dream I couldn't wake from. I kept waiting for the REAL Richard Matheson to appear -- the one from I, Legend, Hell House, Stir of Echoes. But know, some James Dickey wannabe has obviously taken over his mind. I found the plot to be tired, and the sex/violent scenes to be gratutious. Now, mind you, I'm not one to shrink from erotic horror and I've even published vampire stories, (including a short-short I dedicated to Mr. Matheson), but this was simply hack work.Next time, I'll buy a classic from the airport bookstore, and wait to log on and read the reviews at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Beyond Reckoning","review":"If bad writing were a crime, Richard Matheson would be on death row.As it is, I feel like I've done hard time by reading this book.Mr. Matheson uses the protagonist in this book as a vehicle to float every left-leaning, New Age theory imaginable: he's pro-reincarnation, anti-gun, anti-violence, pro-animal rights. And the results are almost laughably absurd. After the main character has been sodomized and beaten and is fleeing a psycopath in the forest, our hero stops his escape to rescue a cougar that has been trapped by a fallen log. Why not brew a little latte' while you're at it? And after the psychopath rapes the protagonist's wife as a prelude to murdering the hero and the hero gains the upper hand, the protagonist refuses to kill the pyschopath \\"because that would make him like the psychopath.\\" Huh?It's this kind of muddleheaded thinking that the reader must endure thoughout the book.

Also, Bob seemed to recover pretty darn quickly from such a horrific attack.NOT recommended by me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I must admit that I've always wondered why Matheson's books are considered classics in the horror genre. For the most part they're readable, some even stay with you for a while, but classics? No. So all I expected from this one was a moderately enjoyable read. I didn't get even that. While the writing was competent, it was extremely repetitive. Either Matheson was afraid the reader would forget what he'd said ten, or even five pages back, or he kept forgetting that he'd already told us something.

So to say I was looking forward to the concert DVD is a serious understatement.In this show, their sound is great, as always. But there's something about the conventional style of direction and the remoteness of the large stage (singer/guitarist Joey Burns normally is MUCH more animated and connects with the audience a lot better) that gives it a \\"PBS Pledge Week\\" feel. It seems more like a recital than a rock concert. The only thing that's consistently watchable is drummer John Convertino's amazingly expressive, dynamic technique (it's like he treats the sticks like paintbrushes).The music is awesome and the extras are really nice, so I'll only take one star off.

In addition to the examples already given, here are two more: On page 328 he states that The Band played the Carter Baron Amphitheater in Washington, DC on 16 August 1976. The actual date was 17 JULY 1976, and there was a King Biscuit Flower Hour recorded there to prove it, complete with the correct date. Also, I saw The Band on 18 July 1976 at Music Inn, Lenox, MA, where they were late because their equipment had been delayed from DC the night before. Then on page 384 he states that The Band was opening for Crosby, Stills and Nash on their Florida tour the first week in March of 1986. That would have been a real trick, as David Crosby was in prison then. I saw three of those Florida shows, and The Band headlined all of them, no CS&N. Their final show with Richard Manuel was March 3, 1986 in Winter Park, FL, something Hoskyns managed to get right.

The colors don't completely match, but hey, what can ya do! It's a lot better than that saggy tent I had before. The only downside for me, was the thickness of the fabric/foam. Trying to bend it around steep angles and large bumps (where my rear speakers protrude on my Jeep Cherokee Sport) gave me unsightly creases in the end. The creases don't really bother me though... mainly because they're out of my view. It just kinda bugs me that I couldn't get it perfect.

Additionally, I counted seven black stains about 1/4 inch diameter all over the place. They material was not rolled nicely either.

The six-panel format used consistently throughout the biography is an excellent frame for telling history. The evenness of the presentation suggests that a flat and neutral point-of-view is used to tell the story of an apparently controversial figure. Not that you should necessarily trust such an assertion about Brown's telling, but it is highly effective.It strikes me as highly unfortunate and typical that I have to come to this fascinating bit of Canadian frontier history this late in life and in such a format.

The griddle heats evenly, but because of its size needs a large burner to operate effectively. That's the only caveat, and I don't consider it a problem.

For some reason I have to crank up the receiver quite a bit when playing records through the Pyle Pro, though the sound is quite good.

It was a little difficult to come to this conclusion because there is no power light on the unit and I do not have a voltmeter. But the hint was there; the adaptor didn't become warm as is usually the case. I borrowed a friend's adaptor and the unit itself works fine. I considered buying another adaptor or returning the whole package. However both these options would have cost me more than what I initially paid for it!!

Boy, was I wrong or awfully forgetful. This truly has to be the dullest opera that I have ever witnessed or have ever heard. It truly is a \\"one tune\\" score with no exciting arias, ensembles or choruses.The signers come-off as interesting as dish-water--not even Olga Borodina seemed to be too inspired. Dessi has always bored me to tears and in this opera, I almost broke down in hysterical sobs.

Hinges and latches seem to be very solid. The hinges hold the lid upright when opened. The locks on the latches are not really \\"locks\\". They will help keep the latches from accidentally opening while handling, but that is about it. They don't feel solid at all, but I bought this for safely storing/transporting my fragile eye pieces, not for security. The two layers of foam with pre-cut, tear out squares makes it easy to custom fit an opening for fragile items. It is a LOT cheaper than a similar \\"eyepiece case\\" from most any telescope manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful premonition of things to come!","review":"This Raleigh, NC quintet with their beer-swilling faithful from old Wake Forest shows their technical prowess in their first release. Since recording Extended Play, the DTB boys have matured and gelled into one of the most engaging bands on the east coast since the likes of Dave Matthews. Randall Kirsch's voice shows impressive range and strength with that catchy hint of Georgia, and how Jay Doyle's fingers keep from bleeding we'll never know. His infectious guitar is pure talent, poetry in motion, in a Hendrix sort of way. Bass man Bolton is an imposing presence, sometimes fading into the shadows because he never misses a note and makes it look effortless. This is rock 'n' roll at its finest. And it's getting better all the time. Each member has his spotlight on the CD, showcasing their talent and sucking the listener into their web. The next release should go through the roof!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hitch cover","review":"This is a good product. It appears to be well made.

I think this one will terrify any parent in particular. I think he's right to say it is his scariest book in his own opinion.What the frightening part of the book is, is not the gory parts or the suspense, but the idea that love on its own can be dangerous, and that many parents would do, if it were possible, what Louis does in this book to bring back a lost child, and many husbands and wives would do it to bring back a spouse.If we were given the choice, EVEN IF we realized what would happen-how doomed and grotesque it would be-many of us would do it just to see our child or spouse again-that's the scary bit, that aspect of human attachment. It's really a much deeper and more spiritually interesting book than its popularization in the movie or from what people vaguely know about it might suggest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not know this was a Book Club Edition","review":"Very upset when I opened the package.

So what if you could bring a beloved family pet back? Would you be willing to call upon ancient cursed burial grounds? That is the question Steven King asks us. This novel is simply terrifying. What strikes me though, is King's trademark of putting slices of humanity into all of his books. I just about broke down crying when I read the part where Louis and Gage fly a kite. I don't know if King has any kids, but if he doesn't he sure knows what a good father-son relationship is like. Getting back to Pet Sematary, the morbid subject matter of ressurection will keep you turning pages well into midnight. I sat up reading it around 1:00 AM and didn't stop until I had read the last page. Then I didn't fall asleep until about 3:00 AM because I was so scared.

And while I did enjoy the book, I wouldn't say it was his most \\"scary\\" book.Overall, I enjoyed the plot, the characters were interesting and there was a lot of suspense. I'll have to read more of King's earlier works though, to say if this would be up there with \\"his best\\".

I remember I was in middle school when I checked it out from a library. I was looking to get scared (which I am rather easily), and this book did not deliver.Although it was quite some time ago that I read this book, I remember its problem was that nothing happened throughout the majority of the book. There was build up here and there, but it always fizzled out. The book just seemed to go on and on and on. Little 13-year-old me was not frightened or amused.As far as I can tell, Stephen King is over-rated. Now in my mid 20's, I periodically return to him, but have always been dissapointed. His stories are page turners and his characters are interesting, but he seems to have a habit of falling short.If you want a \\"junk food\\" read then go ahead and read this book.

I thought the book was great. The storyline, while slightly disturbing, was absolutely enthralling. I was always keen to keep reading to see what happened next!King's use of descriptive language is exceptional. It's something a lot of others lack. I did, however, find at times it was a but too descriptive and rambley in parts. He also has a tendency to split sentences when describing things which at times can be confusing for the reader (I can't really explain this properly but anyone who's read the book should understand what I mean.This book is quite chilling and makes you imagine what it would be like if a Pet Sematary really existed.

One awesome read!","review":"This book was excellent. It started so slow that I thought it was going to be a horrible book, but then as I got further and the action picked up, I realized why it had to start so slow, I could literally picture the whole book in my head. The charecterization and setting descriptions may make the book a bit slower in the begining, but it really helps the book later on. I'm not scared by movies (well, very rarely) but this book REALLY scared me and I couldn't put it down. I don't know, maybe it was because I knew where the book was going, but still hoped it didn't go there. That may not make much sense, but I can't think of a better way to explain it without spoiling the book for you.

Frankly, I believe them. It has everything a horror fan could want: death, sex, zombies, ghosts, and blood. It tells of an ordinary family man who moves to a rural Maine community to start his new job. When the next door neighbor shows him an ancient Indian burial ground located behind a local pet cemetery, things start to go wrong. And the man will soon discover the price he has to pay for messing with forces that are far too powerful for human comprehension.

The book starts out all nice and things slowly go to hell for the people in the book. I kept hoping that they would stop the downward spiral, and at the same time knew that they could not.

The Stand and It have nothing on the this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn decent read...","review":"I had been planning to read this book for years and never got around to it. I'm glad I finally made it happen. It's a decent read. It's not as much horror as it is suspense and weirdness. It's the typical Stephen King creepiness. If you like his other stuff you will certainly dig this as well. (The dig reference will be funny after you read the book). It can be slightly \\"long\\" and inactive at times but tolerable. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of King's lesser works","review":"\\"Pet Semetary\\" starts out very spooky, and then about half way through it loses its way and becomes kind of a freak show. The plot turns on extended action by one character (the father of the dead child) that just does not seem convincing. After seeing what the semetary does to the unfortunate creatures buried there, I found it unlikely that even in his profound grief the father would try to resurrect his son. King has written some great books, but this one simply doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Cheap!","review":"I only gave this book 4 stars because it didn't come with a dust jacket.

I enjoyed it, but at same time all the screaming and cacophony that occured in parts jangled my nerves. It's one thing for a horror flick, but this was a bit annoying.The music and sonic interludes, such as trucks running down the highway, further decreased the overall dialog time and created a deeply abridged version, forcing some fairly important parts to be left out. The original music and some of the spooky ghost sounds were good, though, and added a lot to the mood.Overall, it was enjoyable as a change of pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Sematary","review":"Louis Creed and his family moved to Ludlow,Maine.They meet their neighbors Jud & Norma Crandall.

The story is laid out like the author has a generic outline for \\"book\\" and simply has to fill in the pieces. The character and place-setting descriptions remind me of when I'm watching a really terrible movie and they throw in some schmaltzy tear-jerking soundtrack to cover the fact that they flubbed the scene.

I've found that the movies adapted from his books are better, which I find unusual since the books are usually better. I remember reading this book in one sitting because I couldn't believe it was so bad. I didn't even find it scary. But how can you write gory and scary scenes as well as the movies? Is this a trait of the genre? I've read 'Carrie' and 'The Stand' which I thought were better. Again though, the movies were better.

Then it gets interesting when a kid dies following a car-pedestrian collision. This is followed by more inane chatter between the characters ad nauseum.The bottom-line is: Stephen King has about 5-6 terrific plot points he failed to exploit in this tale about zombies. The plot points jolt you, and then nuthin much follows until something new jumps out of the bushes and screams 'boo!'It woulda been a horror classic if King stuck with one theme...like...zombie kid spills the beans on everyone and everybody. Maybe the cat could spread the zombie virus around by scratching people.But this book isnt worth fooling with unless you like mind numbing chatter and being frustrated one time too many.My other gripe with the book is, the seams show.

Here is a beautiful family ripped apart by the death of their son. As Louis, the father, is slowly going insane with his own grief, he buries his child so that he may live again, rising from the Micmac Burial Ground. no, this book is not a book where people pop-out from behind walls.

However, that is not to say that \\"Pet Sematarty\\" is bad. I enjoyed it. A lot. The beginning is a little hard to get into (it took me about a week to start back up)but once you start getting into the first couple of chapters, it gets a whole lot better! The movie is just a load of crud. It's very different from the book. but that's just me. The book explains so much more to this very complex and diabolical story. I found that I couldn't put it down!

I realized that the book is very well crafted.It builds up to an unforgetabble climax that will leave you amazed. From Louis Pascows brains hanging out of his head, to Juds endless stories about the pet sematary, it all builds up and scares the hell out of you. If you haven't read this book, do it now.

I felt that I had been a bit shortchanged, because I believed that King could do a lot better. Once I had finished, my mind kept going over the possibilities with the pet sematery and its certain 'magic'. It was a good idea for a plot, just not greatly executed.

This book was so vivid that you could actually smell the rancid animals and see the decaying bodies. Another one of my \\"must read books\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest King book ever","review":"This is the one book Stephen King wrote that he admitted scared even HIM. And I can see why. Giving a person the power over death...but at a terrible price....this is the heart of the book. This reminds us that some things are best left alone, and that playing God is not something to be trifled with. Dr. Louis Creed and his family find this out all too late.It's a great read, but it's disturbing in a way I can't explain. It hits that visceral fear button and hammers on it. If you're a fan of TRUE horror, you need to check this book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best horror novels ever written.","review":"I've read Pet Sematary three times, and, being an avid Stephen King fan I am apt to say this is definitely his scariest book (followed close by The Shining). By making us care with very real characters, King makes us sad and horrified by the sense of unavoidable destruction of an happy, all-american family. We can't help but read while the characters make very unwise, yet very understandable choices.Stephen King delivers in Pet Sematary a stunning performance, making this a very fast-paced story with no boring parts. Like in The Shining there is no conventional bad guy, but an evil place with evil purposes that corrupts people, like the poor Gage Creed, making the horror much more psichological than physical. So this is most definitely a must buy to all people looking for a great horror novel- you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most TWISTED Book Written","review":"Another one of Stephen King's scariest works.I have read a few of Stephen King's books including Thinner and this is the scariest by far.See if you can read it alone in a bedroom without thinking of Zelda, or read it at a funeral without thinking of Missy Dandridge or Gage and read it at the doctor's office without thinking of Victor Pascowand his brains seeping out of his head, and at an intersection without thinking of Orinco. A superb book.Hats off to Stephen King.I loved this book so much I got the video-which is twice as scary!!!A must buy.Enjoy,and remember, \\"A man's heart is stonier than..\\",well;you'll find out"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the first Stephen king book that I have ever read.","review":"It has to be ranked 12 out of the 15 books that Ihave read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary!","review":"While this book didn't seem as scary to me as it did to some people, it's still pretty scary. Basically, if you bury something in the burying ground behind the Pet Sematary it will come back to life, so Louis Creed couldn't resist the opportunity to do that when his young son died. Read it, it won't dissapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop whatever it is that you are doing and read this book!","review":"Stephen King's books are never disappointing. Some of them seem to drag on and on until getting to the meat of the sandwhich. This book is different.This book had me wondering in the first hundred pages, but then things start picking up. The characters make what seem like mistakes, but are really just mini plots for a higher power.One mistake, involving a cat, has consequences that lead on to the last page. This book is a book that all 562 pages are worth while.The last sentence sends shivers down my spine. With an ending that pushes you over the edge of your seat, this book is worth 7.99. This is a must read for Stephen King fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book but very confusing","review":"I read the book pet sematary by stephan king. I didnt get the concept of the book because it switched to differant places and it was hard to understand where it was at in the story. It would change without even saying it changed. This book is about a doctor who moves to a new town out in the country and he lives acrossed the street from a guy named Jud Crandal and his wife. They become friends and the doctor is at Jud's house every night having a beer. One day Jud takes the doctor on a hike to a place that will change his life forever.

I don't think that King can actually write a book that is not entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moderately good King","review":"One of King's earlier novels, Pet Sematary presages some of the later works that focus on a married couple (Bag of Bones, Lisey's Story).Unlike Cujo, which I found to be much more believable (and hence, much scarier), the ghoulish elements in Pet Sematary seem more than a little absurd. That being said, it does have it's chilling moments, but they seem to be a little perfunctory and the element of surprise is never really developed. You know when Gage is going to return with the obligatory scary scenes. But you never know when Cujo will show up.King's writing in this is very good. The extended scene in the cemetery (the human cemetery in Bangor, that is) is truly excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on Stephen King's Pet Sematary","review":"i read the book pet sematary for my class here in school and i thought it was an excellent book. the descriptiveness that king uses throughout the book left me with vivid pictures of every gruesome detail, and the skill with which he writes left me hanging on every word he said, waiting to see what would happen next. Some would say that what Louis (hes the main character) did what was entirely predictable, and they would be right. however, i hold that it is not what he did but how he did it. predictable, but entirely enjoyable none the less. i reccomend this book to all who enjoy reading King's works, and even if you don't i still recomend it to you. after all, it beats the heck out of some mushy romance novel(blecch)...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabs you by the throat","review":"This is one of King's most thrilling novels. Grossly enchanting and poweful, this book is a fast-paced read, revolving around a magnetizing story built with SK's most effective imaginative hardware. I borrowed it to a friend who's not into King and he couldn't put it down; he said it was great. If you've never before read anything by King, this is a good starting point.

It took nearly three weeks to arrive, which is somewhat understandable since it's not an Amazon product. The questions were elementary with a low difficulty level that really did not compare to the format of the actual state exam. While purchase of this cd is good for someone who wants to brush up on their paramedic knowledge base, it may not be the best for individuals who only begin reviewing for a state or national exam a week or two before the test date. Additionally, the new ACLS and CPR guidelines are not included and the med math questions are of minimal help in test preparation.

There are no original jokes, and the main subject of the movie - softball - completely gets overshadowed by the dragging plotline - if you can call it a plot line.

It's not the worst film I've ever seen; in fact, I did laugh hard probably a half-dozen times. The problem with the film is Artie Lange himself. It's really nothing more than his stand-up act set on a baseball field. It's crude and offensive, but generally not in a funny way. If you're looking for offensive humor that's actually smart, wait for 'Borat' on DVD.I listen to 'The Howard Stern Show' on Sirius, and really enjoy Artie Lange's contributions to that program. He just doesn't fit the acting mold. Artie's kind of a poor man's John Belushi, in the same way that 'MAD TV' (from which Artie graduated from in the 90's)is a poor man's 'Saturday Night Live' (which made Belushi a star). I wish him well in future endeavors on the big screen, but I hope the results will be better than 'Beer League'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"Artie Lange is one of my favorite comic talents, so going into the movie, I knew what to expect.

I really do, but I could not get into this at all. I'm aware of the troubles he was having when he filmed it. The jokes and dialogue are hard to follow at times. This was pretty weak. Nonetheless Artie rules as a comedian. He is one of my favorites of all time and I totally recommend his book \\"Too Fat to Fish,\\" but not this movie. His other work, \\"It's the Whiskey Talkin\\" makes me laugh myself silly the whole time I watch. Long live Artie Lange. Lock up the beer league master in a vault and never let it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is really %$^@#","review":"This movie Artie Lange's Beer league is probably one of the dumbest and most boring movies I have ever seen. It seriously has no funny parts what so ever.

It's about what I expected for my money. It's an OK romantic/comedy which is heavy on the low brow humor and light on the romance. The cast does what it can with what it has to work with. Ralph Macchio has seen better days,but it was good to see him in this harmless, goofy movie. The DVD transfer looks good and the are some extras to fiddle through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"I am a Howard Stern fanatic and a softball fanantic.

Wait until it is on sale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Stern Fans....","review":"I am a huge fan of Howard Stern's radio show. Even though I am not particularly fond of Artie Lang's contribution to the radio show I wanted to see this film due to Stern's saying he laughed alot of lot when he watched it. I really wanted to like this film but unfortunately it was pretty bad. It has been 2 weeks and I still wonder how is it such a bad film gets made and break even.I give it 2 stars because I was able to endure the film but I was not enjoying it and the end could not come soon enough. It wasn't so bad that I had to turn it off before the end BUT I definitely wouldn't have been oppossed to it.Bottomline- If you are \\"curious\\" about this film and would like to see the film as I did, sure, that's fine...but if you are looking for more than fulfillment of your curiosity then don't bother. Then on the other hand if you are a Lange fan you will see it no matter what I say so hope you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great jersey classic","review":"you simply have to love artie lange. it's no masterpiece, but it sure is fun. here's hoping for more films from this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont Listen to the Haters The Movie Is Worth Watching","review":"This movie was funny and is definitely worth watching.

And I wanted to like this flic so much.Profanity can be very funny, but one has to have some sense of how and when. There's none of that thought here, just endless F-words, from charcters you would never associate with, much less relate to. I think Artie's appearnces on Letterman are some of his best, and he's actually funnier when he knows he can't curse.I sure hope he finds someone who knows about scripting a comedy when he does that pilot for Fox.....As for this DVD, it's a very painful viewing experience.

Many of the reviews stated that Dr. Goodpet worked even better than the prescription strength enzymes so we thought we'd give it a try. Within 2 days of giving Dr. Goodpet to our dog he had relapsed into having 6-7 bowel movements a day and they were very loose and watery. We immediately went back to giving him the Pancreaved and things got straightened out so he was only have 2 solid bowels movements each day. I do not recommend changing from the prescription strength enzymes to the Dr. Goodpet if you are having success with the prescription medication. The money saved is not worth the negative effects the change may have on your pets health and well being."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible, well-balanced account of a time and culture","review":"I heard about this book while the author was still gathering the interviews. I eagerly awaited it's printing, and it was well worth it. \\"All Ages\\" tells the story from the ppl who lived it, not by someone who just watched it.

It's simply OK. Not well put together and mostly interviews put to paper. Anyone want to buy my copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy entertaining history","review":"This is a very easy read. Fast paced, really no slow dry stretches that I so often find in history books. I had hoped Duby would include more of the actual primary source, which is the biography of Marshal commissioned by his son after the Marshal's death. Duby speaks to the biography and pulls out pieces here and there for color, but I would have liked to have read more of it. Having said that, this was one of the most entertaining and interesting books on knighthood and the Plantagenet era that I have come across. Marshal was a true player in the historical events of the time, and his rags to riches story is very engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"I really do not understand what the other reviewers see in this book. The author goes way over the top writing just to see how many flowery words he can put in a sentence. As a disertation on chivalry I found it fair but disagree with a lot of his conclusions and found several instances where he later disagreed with himself. As a biography of William Marshal it is a poor attempt to clarify one of the great men of his time. I have yet to find a top level biography of Marshal but I would not recommend this book as a starting point. The author would have done more service to Marshal if he had just translated the poem he based the book on instead of trying to explain it to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great treatment of the realities of 12th c. knighthood","review":"Georges Duby knows the original sources about French and English knights better than anyone else alive.Here he writes about one of the premier English knights of the 12th century, a man who rose from poor knight to Earl of Pembroke and Regent of England, a man who made his fame as a champion of tournaments in their early days as rough mock battles.William Marshal was so famous in his own time that a poetic biography was written about him: the first biography ever written in French.Duby brings this document to life, and gives us a feeling for the days when \\"you found the champions under the horse's hooves.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Not for consumers","review":"I am sure there is nothing wrong with this memory, but be advised that it is NOT for the consumer market; it includes error correction code (ECC) and so it is not supported by most personal and business computers.

There were many things that I didn't like about that:1. The towel I used was too big and would hurt my neck after awhile (I leave my hair up for a while before I dry it).2. If I moved my head the towel would fall down and I'd keep having to put my hair back up.3. I didn't have enough towel bar space for another large towel.I was going on vacation and didn't want to pack a bunch of towels with me, so I got the hair turban. I love it! It's very small, but does the trick. I have shoulder length hair and it covers it perfectly. The loop and button closure are very simple and you can move your head all around and upside down and it won't move.If you have very long hair, these probably won't work for you, but you probably won't be able to use any turban since it won't cover all your hair.If you have shoulder length hair or shorter, I definitely recommend these turbans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good house music, fine voice","review":"Liz Torres' albums are hard to find but she really is a house diva.

The most interesting of all the Gnostic writings to me! This should be read with the \\"Sophia of Jesus Christ\\" in the Nag Hammadi Library, by James Robinsin. The miracle of the Bridechamber spoken of in the King James Bible, is further explained in this book. This is written for easy reading and understanding. Also, read \\"Four Gnostic Gospels, by Elaine Pagels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gnostic scriptures","review":"This is another well researched book by author and modern theologian Elain Pagel.For the unitiated it provides an intriguing insight into the gnostic influences in the letters of Paul.Together with her other excellent works it adds to an understanding of apocalyptic sources and it's relevance to understanding the real message of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening!","review":"The gnostic interpretation of Paul provides a clearer framework in which one can grow to understand his pivotal works more truthfully, and therefore come to know Christ in a new and radically dynamic way.

However, this is not a reconstruction of the historical Paul, as the book itself states, but a study of gnosticism and their interpretation, so it is best read with a copy of Paul's authentic letters and a copy of the Nag Hammedi libary close by. And to correct another reviewer( yes I do read other reviews), St.Valetine and Valentinus are not the same individual, Valentinus lived in the second century and St. Valentine died in the year 269.

This stylistic genre is composed of only the finest of musicians (usually). Requiring a thorough in depth analysis of their instruments and true understandings as how to play synchronized with one another. Battles is on a strong progressive note here, and succeed in making some great off the walls music. The single \\"Atlas\\" is quite the oddity, the music feels 'outside the box'. Overall 'Mirrored' is one of my favorite albums, but some songs really seem to be lacking in comparison to the first few tracks.

Either bone dry funk-prog (90 Day Men), or mechanical experiments in dynamics (Slint). Battles works to hollow out what little human elements existed in the latter, and fills in the gaps with a group of noises that would make Dan Deacon or Tom Waits blush. There was no shortage of reviewers who lined up to praise this demented Disney music, so I could be wrong when I say it's not even worth the time you just spent reading this review. Seriously, go buy a 90 Day Men, Slint, or even a Polvo record instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange. Familiar. Noisy. Melodic. Robots.

Difficult, a challenge, but worth the effort . . . and one day I'm going to finish every last puzzle in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & easy to understand.","review":"After completing my first Will Shortz book I went back craving more. A person who doesn't understand cross words, Will beautifully describes how to do these fun and addicting games. I use it to numb my mind and help me relax after a long day. And I've heard that number games are a perfect before sleep activity. Keep the puzzles coming Will. This is a great activity for even the math challenged. I love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff","review":"You have to think so it's a good thing and something to entertain and or keep you occupied especially on long trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sudoku for beginners & others","review":"This clearly written Sudoku collection is perfect for beginners. Each page is in large format, with plenty of room for notes and possibilities as you learn the Sudoku process. Shortz explains the process of finding numbers in the beginning of the book, and gives a practice grid to work on with tips. Shortz is the master puzzler from NPR's Sunday program--you cannot go wrong with this book, and it's likely that after completing all 100 puzzles you will become as addicted to Sudoku as I am.It involes logic, and once a grid is successfully completed, I have a sense of deep satisfaction and peace.Try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Nat King Cole's sleepy material","review":"The late Nat Cole is one of those treasures of American Music. He was a great Jazz pianist and singer, no doubt. Also a stylish balladeer with great albums but with some neglectable ones.This EMI twofer shows two sleepy albums. One with a great repertoire but with such boring honey and sleepy arrangements by Gordon Jenkins. Another with neglectable material and arrangements.Two songs are featured originals: Edward Redding's 'The End of A Love Affair'and Jack Segal's 'I Keep Going Back to Joe's. Great songs.Here you'll find Mr. Cole at his best in vocal performance but ...A Note on UK's EMI twofers: it's incredible that we could ever have the opportunity to listen to such old and rare material. EMI has issued a long series of CD twofers in a memorable initiative to show all the splendid material by splendid artists never before released in CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"in real it looks different","review":"well, it looks good at the picture, but in real it looks worse. the colours are different a bit, and the red one is too annoying.

This purchase was actually for other people who do not have the car remotes to gain entry, esp. family or repair person. So far though I am enjoying it. My brother installed it and I did not hear any complaints about how it went. Usually I do when things go wrong. P.S.

More like dirt.","review":"I've been using this sand for quite awhile for my hamsters, and my most recent box has an awful texture to it! It's like dirt now, and it has an almost damp feeling to it. It's very unpleasant, and my hamster seems to agree. With the dampness I'm feeling, I'd imagine it would actually be unsafe for chinchillas.After a little digging, it seems like this isn't just a bad box. Super Pet has actually changed the sand. But why? Why change something that was perfect? They have the only Chinchilla Sand that is sold in most US stores, and they ruined it. Super Pet ruined one of the few decent products they actually produce. I guess they just want to continue their reputation for being a pet company that makes mostly bad, low quality and unsafe pet products."},{"rating":"1","title":"dust not sand","review":"This is the second time we bought this product.

Same packaging and it says dust free sand but it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinchilla sand","review":"I bought 4 boxes of chinchilla sand, saving about 1.00 per box as compared to the pet stores. Box arrived in good shape but a box within had come loose. Product did not spill out but the broken box (holding 5packets) was an inconvenience. Still recommend buying this way though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use if you love your chin cuddly soft!!","review":"I rescued a chin who that came with this sand that was used for his dust baths.. The person who owned him didn't know any better, but this made his fur so coarse and horrible to touch! The chin looked a mess and I threw this out immediately!! Almost a month later, his fur is still recovering from the sand. Do not buy SAND for your chins to bathe in. Also, make sure the dust you buy is unscented as well- chins have been known to get respiratory problems from that. The best dust to buy is Blue Cloud or Blue Sparkle, almost all knowlegeable breeders will tell you this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic?","review":"Yes and no. For the uninitiated to Arthur's work, I would say yes. But, for a veteran listener, it still does not measure up to 2000's Come to Where I'm From. But, really, is that fair? What record in the last 10 years could measure up to Arthur's masterwork?This new record is superior in every way to his last CD, Redemption's Son. It seems Arthur has been into some sort of 80s synth whirring sound of late, but to my surprise, it works. You have these up tempo beats and melodies with the usual Arthur themes of scorn, depression, absence of a Lord that loves him, etc.. It is such a great contrast, the pseudo-happy beats, falsetto voice and depressing lyrics. A perfect Arthur combo.Buy this record and love it, who knows how many more records Arthur will make? His depression is downright alarming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill after \\"In Ohio\\"","review":"Joseph Arthur's latest effort substantially lacks the sublime ambience of his previous endeavors. One can listen to \\"In Ohio\\" over and over and over while continuously marveling at its beauty. It's terribly unfortunate that no other song on this album emanates a similar raw, aesthetic element which is immediately apparent on Arthur's past travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"another win from a great artist","review":"I picked up Arthur's first album on a whim, not really knowing anything about him. Boy, what a find! It stayed in my CD player for weeks. This, his third outing, is every bit as solid as his first 2 efforts. Standout tracks for me were, \\"Can't Exist\\" with it's can't-resist-singing-along chorus, and the title track, with it's creepily beautiful melody. Buy everything by this man!!! Also, if you like this, check out Alex Lloyd, an immensely talented Australian singer-somgwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Redemption's Son... but close.","review":"I am a very recent convert to Joseph Arthur, and therefore do not have the same emotional attachment to his work as many of his loyal fans. For this reason, the fact this album seems a bit more polished does not rub me the wrong way. I love the new feel of the album, but it didn't hit me as much as \\"Redemption's Son\\" did the first time I heard it. Sure, I may have higher expectations now, and I have only listened to \\"Shadows\\" maybe half a dozen times... but I just don't think it is as good. Time will tell.It's probably uncool to say this, but my initial highlights are definitely \\"Can't Exist\\" and \\"Even Tho.\\" I know the depth and beauty of the more laid back songs will hit me with each listen, but these two are early standouts. Not a big fan of \\"I Am,\\" but that may change with time also.In conclusion, this will take some getting used to for the diehard Arthur fans, but is a great introduction for those unfamiliar with his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Disappointment To A Rabid Fan","review":"I'm been a huge fan of Joseph Arthur's entire catalog; in my mind he's the best artist in music today. In two years his CDs have never left my CD changer. That said, this album is a major disappointment. I suspect that Arthur is reaching for the mainstream success that has eluded him so far, as this record sounds much more radio-friendly and is missing many of the more inspired moments of \\"Redemption's Son\\".I thought that \\"Come To Where I'm From\\" and \\"Redemption's Son\\" each showed a polishing of Arthur's production talents over their predecessors; \\"Our Shadows Will Remain\\" shows what happens when a record is \\"over-produced\\".That said, this album is light-years better than the other crap that passes for innovative music these days, so I'd still recommend buying it. Just don't expect \\"Redemption's Son\\", Arthur's (and the decade's) greatest musical achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great micro-crystal litter!","review":"#2 on my list for ScoopFree + Forever litter tray compatible litters! Litter Pearls Micro is #1, but it's a tad more expensive... For similar results and less $$, I'd totally recommend The Ultimate Cat & Kitten Litter.Good odor control, economical (for crystal litter), 4lbs bags are easy to store in my small apt, and it lasts ~ 3-4 weeks depending on the age/size of your cat. I used it in an experiment to find the best litter for the ScoopFree without having to buy the EXPENSIVE disposable trays... I loved that it was soft on his paws (it's not chunks), and I *barely* had to stir it. My Siamese took to it with no problem and even likes to play in his litter box when I put a fresh pouch in! The only negative with the litter is a minor cosmetic flaw; it turns progressively yellow-er as it becomes used (although, one could say that makes it a wonderful indicator!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHANGING THE FACE OF COMEDY","review":"It is no secret that Chris Rock is a genius, a talented story teller and a hilarious person, but this piece of work is absolutely stellar. He addressed serious issues without kids gloves, the brilliance of it is that people laughed even though he was not treating the matters addressed lightly. He completely changed the face of stand-up comedy with this one. He did what others before him dare not do one of which was to address the glaring issue of ignorance amongst fellow black people. I am black and I appreciated this because this is what we all think but never say for the fear of being labelled stuck up or traitors.

About thirty minutes into the show I wanted to turn it off, but having paid full price for the dvd I decided to stick it out. Parts are amusing, but in general this show just isn't funny.

I just don't think he is funny at all. Besides, his stuff is too row and somewhat uncivilized. He cannot manage to say things really funny. To curse and to swear is not funny. It just shows how bad our culture has really gotten. Chris Rock is not helping the American society in any way. Without cursing, swearing, using tasteless racial slogans, he can hardly manage to say anything for more than one minute. Don't get me wrong, I am also a colored person myself. I am travelling in Europe right now. In Bergen, Norway, I went to the Riks Theatre, or National Threatre to watch an amazing stand-up show, which is the best I have ever seen for the last few years in Europe.

It's fun to see our hamster climb through them. I got them to connect 3 cages and a tower. I was able to do it with only one kit. You will want to lay it all out before putting together because they are a little difficult to take apart; I just kind of twist and pull. But you don't want them to come apart too easily or you might have a little furry creature roaming around in your house. :)Lastly, the longest tube cannot fit through a top opening in a cage because of a tab on each end. I believe this is meant to keep it from falling through. So you need to use a smaller straight tube from the inside of cage to connect to through the opening to the long tube. Just fyi because it took me a little while to figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little hard to take apart, but great otherwise!","review":"As others have mentioned, these are a little hard to take apart and snap together. However, this is a minor issue, as it's not extremely hard or anything. They seem fairly sturdy, so I'm not afraid of them breaking. I would rather they have a strong connection than easily falling apart. Also, they connect easily and firmly to both my CritterTrail habitat AND my Habitrail habitat, which is what I wanted.

This is actually a textbook you can learn from, and it is clear that the author's ability to present his knowledge to beginning programmers is due to his being an actual teacher of college students - and not some trainer-for-hire for large corporations.This makes a tremendous difference in the presentation of material.

Smith, who has evidently made much effort to study eastern and western philosophy in addition to physics, is able to do something so many other writers fail to do. In this volume, he succesfully separates good science-quantum mechanics-from bad metascience-the Cartesian dualism that splits the mind forever from the body, in addition to the embarrasing pseudo-philosophy of many physicists). If anything, this book shows how fallacious it is to assume that science has totally replaced philosophy.

Suze Tye has a really gorgeous set of eyes which come through even as an evil nurse. The animated skeleton with smoke love making scene was original, but not clever or well done. They could have placed the animated characters into impossible positions. The beginning scene of parents attempting to bribe the teacher reminded me of the movie \\"Serious Man\\" where the bribe became a moral dilemma for the Jewish teacher, unlike this movie.

I have thoroughly enjoyed it and Christopher Lees take in the events and people who have shaped British History. I found this to be a nice balance of fact and opinion. It is also pleasing to now know where terms like ‘cabal�?and ‘boycott�?come from. The four star rating is a reflection of the fact that I found the period from about 1200 to 1600 rather heavy going and struggled slightly keeping up with who was who. Overall I'm extremely pleased to have read this and would certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Made","review":"I never wrote a review before because I always believe products are hit or miss, but this game is poorly made it cant be played properly. The game can be educational, but with the white clips coming undone and and the pictures constently falling off you will get to frustated to finish. I guess things are not made like they used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality makes this fun game very frustrating","review":"There's no doubt this game is lots of fun and my 4 1/2 yr old and 6 yr old have lots of fun playing it. HOWEVER, the very poor construction of this toy is beyond frustrating. The initial assembly of the game took a great deal of time punching out all the flimsy cardboard cards and inserting them into the tiny plastic flip-card holders. Once you pop the holders into all their individual spots, they do nothing but continuously pop out. You can't flip two of them up or down without having at least one pop completely out or becoming askew enough that it won't flip properly. \\"Mom help me put this back together\\" is all I hear after every round and often during each round. Maybe the other versions of Guess Who are a little sturdier, I personally don't know, but I would definitely pass on this Littlest Pet Shop version. I could possibly accept this kind of quality from a $5 game, but not for the $14.99 I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Littlest Pet Shop Guess Who Game....Great Game!","review":"Bought this as a gift and was very well received!

In my childhoodthis was one of my favorite books. When I startedmy own family I was constantly going through interlibrary loans to find this book. My childrenenjoyed it and I loved sharing something with themthat was a fond memory from my childhood.This book not only teaches the alphabet, italso brings to life some histotical references that canhelp children to appreciate the past as well asthe history of older members of their families.Indescribing the various items related to the doll,Annabelle, we are transported into the treasuredworld of a young girl allowed the priviledge ofexploring her grandmothers special treasures, anactivity that used to be one of the wonders ofgrowing up.I would recommend this book to parents andanyone else who might like to take a short tripback in time to their childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book for my little Annabelle!","review":"My daughter is 5 months old and her name is Annabelle.

Get this for a lucky girl","review":"Absolutely lovely alphabet book. I, an adult, find the illustrations gorgeous, but the reason I picked it up at the bookstore was my memories of adoring all things Tasha Tudor when I was a child. I found her illustrations magical, transporting, wonderful...the reason to buy this book is that you need an alphabet book kids (OK, girls) will love, to make the alphabet a thing of beauty and joy, and this text has the perfect rhythm and rhyme to draw in a preschooler/young elementary-schooler. You can always get the other Tasha Tudors out of the library (maybe buy A Time to Keep to help you respect and start your own traditions).The reason for 4 stars not 5 is, A is for Annabel is awfully old fashioned, full of words with which your young one might not be familiar. I find that a selling point but not everyone will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krishnamurti's Teachings Are Clouded & Muddied","review":"Reading this book was pretty much a waste of time. Krishnamurti is a brilliant speaker & crystal-clear author, but in this collection of dialogues & writings, it seems that the publisher is intentionally trying to shroud simplicity in a guru's mist. The cover of the book, a black background with Krishnamurti's disembodied head floating in the middle, is fairly representational of this work. A thinker's simple thoughts are edited so that one gets a mysterious impression of what should be simply clear. Trying to make him a mystical guru ruins his work & message. This book was obviously intended to be targeted to those seeking \\"generic Eastern wisdom.\\" Definately the worst Krishnamurti title I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and fun","review":"This is unique music.fun, surprising, sometimes funny, sometimes complex,but again - great trip =)love it!

Phone delays are 20 - 30 minutes before you get a human, they will not let you talk to a supervisor, and will do nothing to rectify the situation. I offered to do the install myself - they refused. Communication by email is even worse - they took three days to respond that they could not find my account and made it sound like it was my problem. If you have not yet bought a DirecTV system - don't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no stars would be more adequate","review":"Not worth losing all the benefits and features of the TIVO for a few HD channels. I'm returning it and going back to my TIVO...I am now considering changing to cable since I am so upset about this whole issue. They charged me $299.00 for this piece of junk which is worthless to me. I would highly discourage anyone from getting the HD DVR reciever if you have owned the TIVO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your while.","review":"I switched from a DTV Tivo to this sad excuse for a piece of equipment. Like the other reviewers it continues to perform in the most sorry of states. Sound lapses, pixel issues and one they haven't mentioned. The thing will record a show just fine, however it will just continue to record on and on after the end of the show. Seems they can't get their machines to work with their guide reliably. The result? You lose some of your recorded shows due to lack of space on your HDD. Pretty annoying especially if you lose something like Heroes or Lost. Nothing but frustration at best is how I would describe it. I'm going to send it back and get a Tivo again. Did anyone mention the lousy program guide? Coming from a DTV Tivo to the DTV guide is horrendous. Navigation is so counter-intuitive and tedious that it is like unpaid labor. I look forward to removing this clunk from the living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glimpse of greatness...","review":"This is Whitley's masterpiece. Everything about this record is done masterfully from the production, song selection, and material. Whitley's silky voice was at its most tortured on here. Unfortunately, it was released a few weeks after his tragic death. Some of the songs on here are made even more meaningful when you realize that he was living these songs at the time.It's chilling to listen to them.\\"I'm Over You\\" is a great country song. When you keep in mind that Whitley was about to drink himself to death, it sends shivers down your spine to hear him sing,\\"You heard I'm drinking more than I should that I ain't been looking all that good. Someone told you I was taking it rough, well why they making those stories up. I'm over you.\\"It's just a great album that anyone who calls themselves a country fan should own. Artists like Whitley only happen once in a lifetime, and unfortunately...when a star burns that bright, it often burns out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This album helped me approach singing in a much more intimate way. I really listened to Keith Whitley and he has a knack for sounding like he is in the room with you while he sings and it is due to that fact that he does not strain his voice while singing. Something to be emulated. Great album. Marg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent B Grade","review":"Much like its predecessor, this is a good B grade movie.

Also, we were overcharged. We have spent way to much time (not a toll free phone number) trying to resolve this mess. They told us to contact the manufacturer to get the missing parts. We did contact the manufacturer but they told us that since they sold the hitches to AutoParts Way, (and AutoParts Way has our money) and AutoParts Way sold it to us that we would have to get the parts from AutoParts Way.We are currently trying to work with AutoParts Way to get this resolved. Will report on how that goes as we find out. We are hoping that this is not a scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! NO parts included.","review":"Under features it says \\"Includes removable drawbar, pin and clip, hitch receiver cover and easy to follow instructions\\" However, when the one I ordered arrived, in late June, 2010, just the bar arrived, not even wrapped in plastic as other reviewers said. There was a very deep gouge in the tube, too. I used the call me feature to talk with customer support, and explained the problem of no Included parts. The lady gave me return instructions, and started the process to send another hitch \\"kit\\" to me. A week later I got another hitch, same situation, not wrapped, no \\"Included parts.\\" I refused to accept delivery from the shipper this time. Amazon got both hitches back, credited my account for both hitches, and case closed.

Don't believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described or pictured,","review":"I saw other reviews stating that this hitch did not come with the draw bar, pin and cover.

Come on Amazon, update the description. BTW, it went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Assurance Measures","review":"I ordered this Hidden Hitch along with the Adapter. However, the hitch has a hole that was punctured inward where the the adapter should fit. This has caused the adapter not to be able to be inserted where the pin lines up.

If he challenges himself more as a writer and a wordsmith and deepens his thinking, he will be under serious consideration for the Nobel. He is a humanist. And his writing is great humanist writing, but his ability (again, my humble opinion) has not yet matured. *ALL* of his books so far are worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambiguous Tale of Coming of Age and Holocaust","review":"Thomas Moran has made a wonderful debut as a fiction author with this compelling, chilling, moving tale of Niki Lukasser growing up in Nazi Austria with a Jew, Dr. Weiss, walled up for his own protection, in the barn. This is an unusual story but it is created and built up in ways that make it believable. No good deed or bad will go unpunished and betrayal is an always quietly lurking shadow among the people. The relationships are complicated, particulary the child and the man in the box, and the author makes ambiguous all the various choices of the characters. There is no black or white, good or evil, just people making good and bad decisions, often for very personal and odd reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stockings","review":"They arrived sealed and brand-new.

Wes was just one of those guys with incredible talent and terrible taste in music. If you are a jazz purist this is a close as Wes gets. otherwise its that easy listening Verve stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!","review":"I look at Wes Montgomery now as an icon, an influential jazz guitarist who was really incredible as the title goes The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery. I have for so many years considered Jimi Hendrix to be the greatest guitarist of all time, I still believe this but I feel Wes Montgomery was way up their with him. And as of now I am learning more about jazz guitarist such as Joe Pass another incredible jazz guitarist. This CD has everything on it from the starting up beat tune Airegin which to me is the most complicated jazz guitar song. I also loved D-Natural Blues. As the cover on the back of the CD reads \\"ever since its initial release in 1960, this album has been a consensus choice of musicians, critics, and knowledgeable listeners as a matchless example of the talents of one of the finest jazz instrumentalists of all time. Strongly Recommended!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Wes","review":"Years ago I had read in a jazz magazine how some top jazz guitarists were influenced by this album, so wanting to find out more about Wes I bought it. This was also my first Wes album(CD), and I was blown away!All I had heard before was some of his more \\"pop styled\\"songs. I started buying a lot of him, but I still don't think there's a better one. Every song is great, the band is great, and I like the sound of his guitar better than a lot of his others. This is got to be in the top ten of all guitar records! In my opinion, an essential jazz recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible indeed","review":"I hate technique for the sake of technique. No worries here though. On his breakout release (and still his most popular), Wes Montgomery demonstrated dazzling technique but always kept it in service of the melody. This is one of the most consistently excellent, assured, and relentlessly listenable jazz albums of all time.\\"Incredible Jazz Guitar\\" may seem an audacious title but one lesson will reveal that to just be truth in advertising. Any fan of the electric guitar, whether a jazz fan or not, needs to own this CD. Mr. Montgomery has a relaxed picking style that accomplishes the rare feat of being technically superb and highly accessible at the same time.Forty five years after its release, \\"Incredible Jazz Guitar\\" is bound to make a strong impression on any guitarist who hears it for the first time. But it will move any fan of great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have CD","review":"Wes Montgomery's unique style is a total trip to enjoy the sound of the jazz guitar on this CD. Specially West Coast Blues and other masterpieces. Definetly a must have for jazz lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail the Great One!","review":"Wes achievs the impossible with apparent ease on this one. His chords and octaves and even single line play will continue to be analyzed by guitarists for a very long time.

One family member had high school French, the others no previous French experience.This was a terrible way to prepare for a trip to France. The dialog goes by too quickly.

Compared with the Italian version, the French was truly awful. I found it difficult to understand the male narrator (he tends to mutter under his breath), which made it extremely difficult to pick up on the nuances of French pronunciation and speech. The female narrator's singing ability was on par with a shrieking opera diva. I've found the Living Language Complete Courses in French much more helpful and thorough."},{"rating":"1","title":"idiotic","review":"I'm not a big fan, anyway, of the concept of learning in your car.

Otherwise, stay at home and use anything else besides this idiotic course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, but not in a good way!","review":"There is way too much going on here to really be able to successfully learn anything. For each topic there is a discussion/scenario followed by a song. The \\"characters\\" are too silly to be taken seriously and the music and singing are absolutely horrendous. I found myself actually distracted by the whole thing, which is not a good thing when driving. It grates on your nerves like a dentist drill and you find yourself unable to concentrate on anything. They lost me for good when the song \\"colors of my life\\" was half way through. It's difficult to learn with all this chatter, singing and music going on.I don't know who their target age group is since it's hopelessly childish, yet with adult themes (such as going to work and dating).

I expected more of this awesomeness with his solo stuff.I expected too much from Kaskade.This album was an impulse buy in faith, that at least one @#$%ing track would be worth listening to. Alas, there is not even one. All of the tracks are flat, soul-less, and pedestrian. How this guy stays in the spotlight is anyone's guess. It sure has nothing to do with talent, that is for sure.

While he starts mainly with the Belzers, there are protraits of some of the other Hasidic sects, including the extreme Reb Arelach Hasidim whose women shave their heads. The chaper on sex is worth the price of the book. An absolutely riveting and brilliant book which is essential for anyone who wants an understanding of the ultra right wing Hasidim, who, by the end of the century, may outnumber other Jews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was ordered...","review":"The picture and written review for this product indicated it was a 4GB class 4 memory card, but received a 4GB class 2 memory card.

The Ultra II wrote at ~10 MB/s and the Ultra wrote ~8 or ~9 MB/s.Excellent card overall. No problems. Paid $12.99Other notes:I'm wondering how something like a Transcend Class 10 would compare. I'd be willing to test it against this card, since the SanDisk Ultra series speeds are close to higher class ratings.I gave it 4 stars because it performed slightly slower than my older SanDisk Ultra II, but it probably deserves 5 stars because both cards perform significantly faster than their Class 4 rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"...another great deal!","review":"I ordered the Sandisk Ultra II SDHC 4GB for my Nikon S630.

The plate that holds the neck to the body was crooked. It must have been crooked on the drill press. There was a crack the width of the guitar body. I couldn't tell if that was because of the extremely poor packing job by both the guitar manufacturer and Amazon or was a manufacturing defect. The amazon box was way too big and there was little cushioning of the boxed guitar. There was no padding in the guitar box itself.

I do not print directly from camera to printer so I did not need the screen. My last printer was an Epson from about 2002 and did a good job, but it used cartridges at a high rate when printing photos. I bought the 5200 partly because of price ($150) but the quality of the prints is outstanding. Using a photo editing software program like Photoshop Elements allows great creative control, but for 4x6 grab shots and event documentation, the software with the printer is excellent. Checking 'vivid photo' gives poster-like bright colors but does not seem artificial. Highly recommended. The only drawback is that the 5200 does not use the same cartridges as the 5000, they are slightly different, and because this is a low-volume printer the cartridges are hard to find on the alternate ink-jet vendor sites where you can find decent inks for $5-8 each, about half the Canon price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging ruins our Christmas!","review":"I can't tell you how excited we were to find a mint condition Tripoly game in a special edition tin.

I love the Onion, and look forward to reading it online every Wednesday morning. While I enjoy reading the articles, I thought it was a cheap copout to use up multiple days of the calendar on the same article. In my opinion, the point of these calendars is to have something new to laugh about each day. Who is going to stop mid-sentence on Monday and then pick up the second installment Tuesday, only to stop, mid-sentence once again, until reaching the final conclusion Thursday or Friday? Doesn't the Onion have enough captions, in the news, infographics, statshots, news in brief, etc. to fill up a calendar? There are plenty of these in the calendar, but in the next two weeks, three articles take up nine pages combined.

They are best friends Misty and he and when Pearl Harbor is attacked and all of the Japanese have to move to camps Hart and his father take Misty and her mother in to live with them. While living together Misty and Harts relationship expands and they become lovers, but can there love survive the turmoil of war? This is a brutally honest story of war, family, and first love. I highly recommend this story to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Divine Whine","review":"The Divine Wind is a beautifully written book, there's no doubt about that. The descriptions and setting is written wonderfully. However, the plot is way too similar to \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\", has rather dull undeveloped characters, love with hardly a mention of the actual falling in love and a selfish and self-absorbed main character (Hartley Penrose) you dislike after a few chapters- who unfortunatly narrates the entire thing.

The book, although dry, is well written and well researched. Drawing upon primary sources it does a satisfactory job of presenting the stated thesis. However, the author really reaches at points (especially in the final chapters) to connect the subject he is discussing to the cold war. Some of the subjects discussed, for example the Civil War Centennial Celebration, took place during the cold war, but were not nessesarily connected to the cold war. If you are looking to build a foundational knowledge about cold war facts and history I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"This book is the worst book i have ever read.

When his investigation crosses paths with teens of the town, one of whom is his live-in girlfriend's son, it becomes personal for Joe. Once again, Oleksiw has depicted small town life in New England with a clear eye to the contrast between traditions and worldliness, and all that is encompassed therein, both good and bad. Her characters are real and you know them; they live down the street. The plot is real; you read about it in the newspapers, and the idea that it could happen in your town, maybe with your own children terrifies you. Beautifully written, A Murderous Innocence keeps the reader guessing through twists and turns until the final chilling outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT non-stick, but otherwise a good pan","review":"I bought this pan because it was non-stick, plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel.

It was not easy to get it off, I had to scrape it off and it took time and a bit of muscle. Definitely not non-stick. The air cusion works from preventing the bottom of the cookies from overbrowning, which is not exactly a great idea since the top of the cookie become significantly more brown than the bottom of the cookie, which sometimes is moist and not quite holding the cookie together.On the up side, this pan doesn't warp if you are baking at 350 degrees of below.I am returning this item, I wanted non-stick and this definitel was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative book","review":"Very useful book for everyone, who has something to do with model portfolios.

She is also sought after as a play doll as she has many more accessories than the average doll and the tiny Koala bear is really adorable. They were especially generous with jewelry this time! The doll of course is not really dressed for a safari but then, all those people who shop at Bannanna Republic mostly are not going on a safari either. If the clothing did not mirror real life trends in fashion, the dolls would not be popular.

After reading it I felt like I was just beginning to wake from a lifelong sleepwalk. I realized that distinctions I assumed were real--especially the distinction between me and not-me--are arbitrary. This Vedanta-inspired book echoes the insights of Taoism as found in the Tao Teh Ching. It explains how concepts can exist only in contrast to their opposites. \\"All can know good as good only becaue there is evil,\\" as Lao Tzu says in the Tao Teh Ching.

When you read it, life seems ok. No worries, no cares. No consequences for your actions. No justice. Watts wants you to believe that you are god. You are not God. Did you create yourself? Watts would say that there is no Self. But if there are no individuals, there is no justice. I don't want to be associated with very evil people.

Not in a frame of artwork, but in seeing reality more interestingly and indiscriminately. The author teaches, in his classic almost inadvertent style, to turn the world upside down and see it as being right side up. The structuring of our eye loosen up when we change the grids of longitude and latitude of mapping our world into a freeform chaotic wonder. The simpleness of every moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, Moralizing Condescention","review":"I love Alan Watts. I thought \\"The Way of Zen\\" was the best book on Zen, Buddhism, Taoism and Hinduism that I ever read. \\"The Book\\", however, was a major letdown. Although he has a few nice points and metaphors this book is basically a rant against a stereotyped 50's America.He goes on interminably about how everything is known only in terms of its opposite (what it is not), that everything is relative then states there is only one \\"IT\\" in the Universe, the Ego is the root of unhappiness and this is THE way to look at things.What if I'm happy with being a self-centered ...? Basically, \\"The Book\\" is a thinly veiled hindu/buddhist derived metaphysics and ethics without the religion.I also agree with the other \\"Moralizing Condescention\\" reviewer who said this philosophy is very burgeois and one should read Dr. Watts descriptions of Buddhism (like \\"the way of zen\\") rather than his preaching of buddhism"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alan Watts, \\"The Norman Vincemt Peale of Zen\\"","review":"I first read Alan Watts's books 30 years ago.He got me interested in Eastern thought, but after I gained more knowledge I realized he was quite glib and shallow. His argument in this book is that the ego personality is an illusion.To progress we must get rid of it and realize our true self, which is at one with the universe. So far so good. However, Watts oversimplifies the task.He seems to think that by reading this book one will get a flash and see the truth and all will be rosy.He doesn't explore hard reality of ditching the ego. He doesn't mention 'the dark night of the soul' true mystics usually experience. Genuine self transformation requires dealing with the subconscious mind, but this vital aspect is not investigated by Watts. For example, most people have psychological complexes which tie up psychic energy. Until these complexes are resolved, development is thwarted. Watts does not explore this important issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mass of riddles that goes nowhere.","review":"In \\"the Book\\", Alan Watts, rambles through endless snippets of ideas, thoughts and occasional factsthat he has come upon in his life. To give him his due, he has read widely and so has an admirable bagof these snippets. But he then rambles on - now and then starting with one of these snippets and beginningto develop some thought from it but then quickly dropping this process and jumping to a new snippet andstarting all over again.The entire book is just a long collection of these rambles. If you like to hear someone ramble on withno direction but presenting you with a lot of interesting observations, then this book is made for you. If, instead,you wish to learn something of the vast Universe we live in and our place in this Universe, look elsewhere.It's amazing that so many gave this book 4 and 5 stars - absolutely amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!!!","review":"I can't believe that someone could give this great album only one star.

This is of more relevance in the present IT revolution, where the synthesis and analysis of domain knowledge plays a crucial role. Ultimately this intellectual capital is what makes a country strong in economy. In a sense this can also be linked to collapse of the asian market (asian tigers) which was just a production economy, but not an intellectual economy. The policies in these economies in hand with the conglomorates never gave an opportunity to harness the human capital, which was a serious drawback.Public policy makers, governments etc., should make a note of this. It is not just important to open up the economy, but it should give a serious try to harness its underlying human capital."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoking Chips","review":"I have tried many different brands of smoking chips and in my opinion, Luhr Jensen is the best.

Each outfit also includes extra touches, such as toys and baskets, to complete the theme for each outfit. Unlike the dolls, the outfits are on a lighter weight paper and must be cut out with scissors.A nice touch is the packaging of the book, which has inside pockets for storing the dolls and clothes.

Not so surprisingly, oversimplified means erroneous for much of the time. Especially, when it comes to giving examples for what abstract theory holds, the author comes very close to misrepresentation. Take for example his definition of the Other as \\"collection of all the words and expressions in a language\\", his constantly naming of \\"unconscious as foreign to the self\\" and this ridiculous (fictious) example of Einstein remembering the words of his father he heard when he was in pre-language stage.

It was the Everwood pattern at Toys R Us. As noted, the buckle could slide back and forth to accomodate different positions. When the buckle is all the way forward, there is a metal piece exposed with a sharp hole cut out of it. It is the perfect size for a little one's fingers to get caught in. I did not buy this seat because of this. I will check other patterns to see if they have the same defect. The deluxe model in the store was okay (the fabric covered the hole) but we didn't want to spend an extra $20 for a cupholder and headrest, neither of which we would ever use.

The seat has held up well. You can remove the fabric portion of the seat if need be and wash it. It has a great safety rating for a car seat in it's price range. Unlike some of the other reviewers I didn't have any trouble with the strap adjustment knob in my small car. The seat is easy to install if you read the directions, and like the other reviewer I would suggest taking it inside to adjust the straps before you install it. I plan on using this seat until my daughter out-grows it, and buying another one if I have any other children."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"Do not waste your money on this carseat. The chest clip just snapped in half because of the cold weather after only 1 year and the chest clip is not replaceable. In fact, Evenflo refuses to replace the carseat.

HORRIBLE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Car Seat!!","review":"We have owned this carseat for over two years. It is really comfortable and safe. It has padding in all the right places. We have used this carseat rear facing and forward facing. It has been user friendly and comfortable both ways. Our son sleeps in it all the time. It is easy to wipe down and clean. Our son has been sick in it (enough said). The number one thing we LOVE about this carseat is that it is a piece of cake to get your child in and out!! Why doesn't everyone make a carseat with the easy to tighten and release harness system this one has? In my husband's car, we have a cheapy brand seat. It is such a pain to buckle our son in it. Our only complaint about the Evenflo one is that it is bulky and heavy. This is good safety wise, but it takes up most of our back seat in our Ford Explorer. And, it does not transfer easily from car to car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car seat....great price.","review":"After reading some online reviews, I went to the store with the intention of purchasing a different car seat. However, after messing around with several, I decided to go with this one. I admit it was a little heavy, but it will not be moved from the vehicle it is in. I found it extremely easy to adjust and it installed without a problem. After all, it doesn't take a PH.D to install a car seat. I can't believe anyone found it difficult. My 7 month old looks so cozy in it. The fact that he can be rear facing until he is a year old is great! Definitely a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT GREAT.","review":"This carseat was to heavy, to big and just overall a hassle.

My eight month daughter enjoys sitting higher so she can see out the window and she also has better access to play with her feet now. I don't like how difficult it is to turn the knob to adjust the straps. I've had a hard time with that. We actually ended up buying this carseat and the Graco Comfortsport for our other car. After using the Graco one for a day we returned it back and exchanged it for another Triumph seat. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy, bad slipcovers","review":"I have been using this carseat for my 16 month old since she was about 6 months. I hate the strap system, it is really hard to loosen and tighten, and the slip covers are only held on with elastic on the arm rests, so my daughter is constantly pulling them up and scratching at the styrofoam underneath.She has also had her arms caught in the strap holes more than once, especially when she was smaller.It is also very heavy and awkward to manouver in and out of the car. The hooks for the latch system are also hard to open when you want to remove the carseat from the car. I have seen Britax seats that have much more sensible hooks.I would invest the money in a nicer model, if i had it to do over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable and perfect!","review":"We bought this car seat to replace a 3 and 1 seat that did not work at all. This is a fantastic car seat. I can't really think of complaints - except that there is no cup holder. You can adjust the strap length/tightness with one hand - which is on either side (very handy) instead of being in the front - which is hard to get at in my car. My son's head NEVER falls forward when he sleeps which happened in his other car seats all the time. This car seat actually reclines. It has lots of room for him - even with his winter \\"gear\\" on - but is still safely secured. The buckle is very easy to use and never tangles. It is very comfortable. It is also very easy to adjust the height of the straps. This is a great car seat and very affordable - worth every dollar! This style (fabric) is not the one we bought - we had the one with the infant head padding and it was grayish - but not the DLX model. This one is pretty much the same though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to love, harder to clean","review":"From the moment we got this in 2002, when our son was about 8 months old, I have loved this car seat. We are now 2 and 1/2 and I am still in love with it. The only draw back is taking the cover off to clean. Make sure you have some time and patience but it is worth it. Since my son did not eat alot in the car, I did not have to worry about taking it off that often. I am going to hate when he grows out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm really happy with my purchase!","review":"This car seat is the best for the price you pay. It's just as good as the britax which sales for $299! It fits in my SUV perfect and it also fits \\"snug\\" but it fits in my husband Z28 camaro. We bought this car seat when our son turn 8 months.We kept it rear facing until he reached 20lbs. He has plenty of growing room and you do not have to take it out to move the straps. Thats what I love most about this carseat. It's very easy to install and very easy adjust the straps.I really believe you would be completely satisfied with this carseat.This color also matches perfect with my grey seats in my SUV, so thats another bonus you get if you don't want some colorful carseat!Over all it makes me feel like my child is safe. It doesn't move when install properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this thing!","review":"Shoulda bought the Britax...probably will still...The straps are the worst part on this thing.

I really like the knob so I can get my daughter snugly in place and know that she's not going to move around very much if we get into an accident. The one area that I'm a little disappointed in is that she has already outgrown it and she is a few months shy of her 3rd birthday. The next size up carseat is for over 3 years.

I contacted the company, EVENFLO, and they recommended that I \\"dispose\\" of this seat (that I paid $120 for) because there was nothing they could do. I have to say I am shocked and outraged at this company. You hear all kinds of stories about baby products and why parents did or did not like them, but with this one, the bottom line is that seat defective. And, the company won't do anything about it.

First of all the shoulder harness has two overlapping belts which are a pain to adjust.

The characters of Mulder and Scully are cardboard cutouts of the M&S we know and love on TV. In this book Mulder only opens his mouth to fire off lame wisecracks and Scully is boring and bland. Don't even get me started on the rest of the characters. The only reason I even bothered to finish the book was to confirm it didn't get any better. I've read X-Files fanfic on the Internet that surpasses this book in every way (plot, characterization, dialog, and writing). This book is complete brain candy... but it doesn't even taste good.

I half expected Donnie to do a Rick \\"Nature Boy\\" Flair figure four leg lock also.Whatever.Donnie showed a lot of passion in the film, but the story line never built it up to present a reason why he was so angry and why he comes across as a rogue cop.It seems like lately, all of Donnie's movies have him as a fighter, but not as a lead character even though he's sold as such.Beyond fighting, he's got a long way before he makes a movie where he convincingly comes across as the lead actor (minus big name supporting cast) where he can carry a film all by himself like Jet Li has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMERICA'S CRITIC","review":"donnie yen is just awesome and i love the dragon dynasty collection! no more to say than get this movie it is entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow - Cheap Fealing - Low Quality","review":"I just purchased this Webcam Live Pro and I am very unsatisfied with it.

There is nothing holding it to the monitor but gravity. I was considering trying the Live Motion webcam but after getting this I don't think I will. I wouldn't recommend this product. Too back I bought a few of these for family members because it had a good price and rebate. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"I do video chats often, so I like to update and buy new webcams every two or three years. Even though according to the specifications this webcam is superior, its quality doesn't come close to my old Logitech QuickCam Zoom. I've played with its configurations but it made little difference.What's nice about Creative's webcams is that unlike Logitech's, you can download and install only the driver (that includes the advanced features like face tracking) without the applications and useless integration with Windows Explorer. But this advantage does not compensate for the poor quality.I use my webcam in the evenings, in a well lighted room. It is possible that in daylight it would perform better, but I believe that Creative should have done better.Now that I have higher appreciation to my old Logitech, I'll return this one to the store, and maybe buy a new Logitech when I see a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Picture Quality. Smart Tracking Needs Some More Work","review":"Overall a high quality webcam that produces excellent image despite the poorly lit room where it is located. The smart tracking that suppose to keep you in the center of the frame regardless of your movements does not work always as expected. I don't care about that feature that much as the ability to produce a high quality image is more important to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Webcam","review":"Installation was breeze, picture is good as expected.Based on my experience with other web cams and this one.

I received it, and proceeded to use the CD to install it on my computer, using Windows XP Security Edition. The instruction manual was not very clear, and it took 4 attempts of deleting the install, and reinstalling it until it finally worked. There is no clear way of telling the user when it is installed properly.Additionally, there is no tutorial with the product, so you have to self-teach the user on the various tasks that the Cam can do,I finally got it working, and have discovered all the points, so I am now happy with the product.During the install and self-teach episodes, I was very tempted to send the product back, and to buy a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little Web Cam","review":"We bought two of these, one for us and another for our daughter in MT.They were easy to instll and use.

I use the webcam at night mostly, and this webcam doesn't work very well in nighttime lighting. When exposed to artificial light, it doesn't know how to handle the brightness well automatically, and you have to change some of the configurations, specifically in the brightness, to adjust to your indoor lighting. The webcam should do this for me but it doesn't do a good job of it. In the daytime, however, it works great and the transmission is a lot smoother than at night. With nighttime usage, I get a strange ghost trail from any movement, whereas in the daytime there is none of that at all. I do not use the facial autofocus very much or very often, but it does work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not compatible with vista and beyond. avoid","review":"Creative WebCam is no longer compatible with Windows since XP.

I got tired searching and finding the compatible driver of this cam with windows 7 but no luck. the cam is great but Creative's OS support for newer Windows release is very poor. I wouldn't buy any products from Creative anymore. I like the cam, it works fine with my Windows XP but when I upgraded my system to Windows 7, the cam's life ended unexpectedly because Creative did not release compatible driver for windows 7.

The manual didn't have the answer so I logged a question via email. I tried it twice because both technicians just referred me to the manual or provided a small amount of information that was completely unrelated to the question.I opened a call and after being on hold for 10 minutes was told that they don't support remote monitoring even though it's part of their product. I asked to talked to a supervisor, was put on hold for another 5 minutes, and then was told by the same person that the supervisor is just going to tell me the same thing. When I requested a call back he agreed and started to hang up. I asked what phone # he was going to use and he gave some # that wasn't even close to mine.This product may be good once you get it set up, but I'll never buy another product by this company due to the extremely poor customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent image quality","review":"My brother in Germany keeps commenting on how nice the picture quality is compared to his webcam. I don't use any of the fancy features or the software that came with it, just for Skype video phone conversations.

It is the collection of great should-have hits such as Keep It Right Here(my #1 favorite), Rebel Son, Backstreet Love Affair, When Seconds Count.Why Is This Love became only top ten hit should be the mystery of the 80s. My theory is: by the time When Seconds Count was released, pop rock style became the norm so their great work buried among the heap of pop rock works.When Seconds Count was my #1 favorite until they released Too Hot To Sleep which made me almost forget this album even existed at all. Waiting for THTS to come up for my future review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another milestone on the highway of AOR","review":"Yes. Another Survivor album and another great slice of US AOR. Many critics underrated this album and accused the band turning soft after the Vital Signs. So what If they did? This album is definitely a classic and every track is a killer. Just like a juke box every song sounds like a potential hit. Jamison is at the top form and Peterik&Sullivan just reach the highest level of melodical perception with the capability of launching a full frontal attack in every way.This album makes my day all the time and will sure make yours too.

Sure, it's very slick, very 1980s and cheesy at times with the amount of synthesizers used, but still an enjoyable listen. Very addictive album, and a good follow-up to Vital Signs.

Light in the Piazza was terrible. Who wrote this, and why? The music is forgettable and creates cognitive dissonance. The lyrics are boring.The scene where the handicapped gal implodes at a dinner party was excruciating to watch. And not in a good way. The play is fractured and confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully Boring","review":"The music is beautiful and there are a couple of nice songs, but overall pretty much a snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"HO -HUM","review":"The score for this show makes dogs howl and cover their ears. And the lyrics for this show makes those same dogs wish they had fleas. Is this show romantic, a comedy, a drama or a spoof? I would guess a spoof with lyrics such as...naked marble boys rhymed with corderouys--after that the well runs dry...but wait! We don't need intelligent lyrics..we can always pad every number and I mean every number with oooohs and uhhhhs and more ahhhhhs than heard in a throat doctors examining room. And then fate dealt me a crushing blow.............I was in NY with a friend last month and we had seen a few shows but had a free night. I was horrified when she suggested this show but after much cajoling I was dragged kicking and screaming to the theatre. Ha! She was snoring in her seat by \\"Passagiatta\\" so we left at intermission and went and had a pizza. So the evening wasn't a total waste and the pizza was delicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Boring!","review":"I brought the CD on a recommendation of a friend who saw the show in NY and simply raved. I found the music quite pleasant but 15 minutes into it I found it had become just wallpaper music and several friends thought the same when I played it over to them.

I see how people can say that the score is beautiful but it's boring and like half the songs are sung in italian. I don't speak italian so that turns me off of those right away. The rest are just so-so the only song I ever listen to is \\"Statues and Stories\\" but that one song isn't worth the 15 bucks I spend on this snoozer.Either save your money or go get the other Tony nominees from this year. Spamalot, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, or Dirty Rottin Scoundrels. Or from last year's Tonys Avenue Q, Wicked, The Boy from Oz, Caroline or Change.

(I have tickets for Sept. 24th.) In the golden age of American musical theater, a hit show spawned instant hit songs which were already very familiar to theatregoers when they entered the theater. I was sorry to find out that there is nothing in The Light in the Piazza that can become a hit tune. The lyrics don't even rhyme. This may turn out to be an effective show in the theater, but the plot and the actors will have to prop up the weak music. The cast album to me is a bust. It demonstrates that the score for this show cannot stand on its own. I'll go back to my cast albums of South Pacific, My Fair Lady, West Side Story, Gypsy, etc. These albums reveal the shows as works of genius. The Light in the Piazza is not a work of genius and the cast album demonstrates this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Musicals of the Millenium","review":"Not only does this show lack tune, but it lacks decent lyrics. With songs like \\"Let's Walk\\" and \\"Statues and Stories\\", not only are the lyrics repetative, but they have no rhyme.Adam Guettel is no tunesmith and no wordsmith either. How his score won the Tony of David Yazbek's genius \\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\\" score is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are these people listening to?????","review":"The majority of the reviews for \\"Light In The Piazza\\" speak of the beauty of its melodies and bringing life back into musical theatre. I'm sorry but I don't know what CD these people are listening to!! The show, onstage and on CD is plodding and utterly boring. There is not one song, and I use that word sparingly, that stays in your mind. I'd compare it to really bad Muzak...and let's face it, Muzak is bad to begin with. Don't waste your money...go buy a Richard Rogers musical and enjoy the beautiful songs and melodies...His grandson needs to listen to his shows and stop trying to be in a medium where he clearly is over his head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Musical Theatre","review":"Like many people, I was drawn to Light in the Piazza by its amazing reviews. It was only after I had purchased tickets that I saw the performance on the Tonys. It didn't bode well. As a whole the c.d, much like the production, is over-dramatic, overly sensational. The music has been called \\"lush,\\" however I think it leans more to \\"trying too hard.\\" It is all far too overdone. The music also lacks any sort of conflict or passion. All in all, a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable","review":"A very forgetable Broadway show.

Also dug the electronic weirdness used in the background on tunes like \\"Wives Of Artie Shaw\\" and \\"Hiding Drugs In The Temple\\". Sort of reminds me of vintage Hawkwind. Funny, how I haven't seen that mentioned anywhere else. Overall, you get nine (9) cuts of trippin' mind music, JUST the way you like it.

It's also mighty valuable for us all as we go through the beginning of a new millenium. They give well-reasoned and well-supported arguments for their conclusions about the lessons we learn by studying history. They also have a charming sense of humor that comes out well here as well as in the larger works.I've listened to this several times on the library's copy and finally decided to have my own so that I could listen easily from time to time.

The plot itself is still interesting. But I couldn't slog my way through the overly complicated writing style to get into it at all. Mr. Clegg seems to favor flowery, overconvoluted prose and I had to read every sentence twice to actually figure out what he was trying to say.

Sunday Girl and I Could Fall In Love With You are catchy and easily draw you in. Erasure has always been top-notch at crafting love songs, and they don't stray too much from that territory this time either, Sunday Girl being one exception. After having listened to Andy Bell's solo album and being very impressed with it, I was hoping some of the guts from that album would be present on this one, and I can see that there are some. However, after Sucker For Love plays, it seems much of the album takes on a softer tone. I usually play the faster tracks and skip the softer ones till I'm in that mood. They are all well-crafted songs and as a whole the album is a work of art. Sure to please those already familiar or new to erasure. However I'm still hoping for the next album to take no prisoners and get more edgy."},{"rating":"1","title":"THREE STARS","review":"UPDATE: After giving it a few more listens, I have to say it sounds a little better. I'd upgrade my star rating for this to 3 stars if it were possible.I've been listening to Erasure for over 20 years, seen them perform live a number of times, and after the sublime and beautiful \\"Nightbird\\", it is disheartening to report that this one just doesn't measure up to their previous efforts. Technically, the music is very well produced. The problem is that there is hardly anything that stays with you after listening. I've heard it once, and will likely give it another chance but it's pretty sad when you have to say that about an Erasure album. L.A.T.E.O.T.W is a disappointment, and boring at times. There's little magic to be experienced. If anything, this album sounds like a collection of sub-par b-sides. The packaging for the limited edition is alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid One For Erasure","review":"Fully eight months after the release of LATEOTW, I have to conclude this is one of Erasure's best - right up there with the likes of \\"Cowboy\\", \\"The Innocents\\" and \\"Chorus\\". It is even better than 2005's well regarded \\"Nightbird\\". That I didn't recognize this earlier is no surprise. For a band as venerable and prolific as Erasure, each new release must compete for the affections of its fans with a dozen others that over the years, have reached legendary status.Initially turned off by the first few tracks (the overly upbeat \\"Sucker For Love\\" and second single \\"Sunday Girl\\"), I found many of the remaining songs and competent remixes from the Storm Chaser EP to be a brilliant return to form after repeated listenings. Although no song here moves me quite like \\"Fingers and Thumbs\\" or \\"First Contact\\", I feel I have finally seen (as it were) the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Erasure album in many years","review":"These songs really get stuck in your head, and many of them are upbeat - something I've been waiting for since Cowboy 10 years ago. Sunday Girl, I Could Fall In Love With You, Storm In A Teacup, Fly Away, and Glass Angel are my favorites so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Stage--Different Lighting","review":"Long time Erasure fan straight from the 80's. I have collected and collected. I have gone out of my way to get import singles before internet purchasing was an option. Erasure is my favorite. They are the only repeat artists in my collection, so it was with saddened heart for me that when I listened to this I heard all my favorite music with completely different words. Some say masterful. I say Huey Lewis and the News on this one. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"After the return to form with Nightbird and the change of pace of Union Street I was looking forward to the new material. Unfortunately this just doesn't cut it. The supposed dancier tracks sound as if they were written by an early 90s euro band and that Erasure hasn't moved on. Clearly with their eponymous album and Nightbird this is not the case. \\"If I Could Fall In Love With You\\" is a high point as it's the type of track they do so well. However, \\"Sucker For Love\\" sounds like a failed Eurovision song at best.I guess I'll have to go back to listening to Nightbird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tip-top pop","review":"If you like your music poptastic buy this album now. Regardless of whether you've bought Erasure before this album is a stand out piece of fun pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those with truly dry skin","review":"I don't normally have dry skin, but my skin gets on the dry side in the winter time.

I mean don't we all know that to be successful you should cater to a niche market and provide top quality produce and service? After all, that's the final message of this book in a nutshell, cater to the niche and cultivate a loyal following.Still the stories are short and decidedly pleasant to read, so it's impossible for me to give this anything lower than a 4 in rating.

It's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting for Eno fans","review":"Honestly, Phil Manzanera doesn't strike me as anything fantastic. Bill MacCormick is another story. Rambling, funky, incredible bass lines! Check him out on Roxy Music's \\"Manifesto\\" album (I know it must be him, even without looking into it).And this CD is interesting for Eno fans, of course. Great to hear a slick, live version of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" sung by Brian, and some synthy covers of \\"Sombre Reptiles\\" and \\"Baby's on Fire\\" (Manzanera's solo on the latter doesn't hold a candle to the original Robert Fripp firestorm, though).Trippy and great in its own way.

However, this disc really isn't all that great. I couldn't look at all those 5 star reviews without saying something.Four tracks here are from Manzanera's wonderful Diamond Head disc. Not that the live versions are bad, but there really isn't a one that's better than the studio version. Some are just OK, clearly not up to the originals. As for the songs from Eno's solo discs, it would be unfair to expect anyone to replicate the incendiary guitar work from \\"Baby's On Fire.\\" I can't believe anyone would really prefer this version over the one on Here Come The Warm Jets. \\"Somber Reptiles\\" is an exceedingly odd choice (even for this bunch) to put on a live album.Completists will have to have this, but frugal shoppers should stick with the studio versions of these songs & call it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who have never heard this","review":"If you have never heard this, please do the following:- Buy it.- Do not read anything else other than these instructions (including the case notes and song order) until after you do the next steps.- Put the CD in the player.- Wear headphones.- Adjust the music to a comfortably loud volume.- Press \\"play.\\"- Close your eyes, and just follow where it goes....If you do that, you will get to experience (within the first five minutes) the serendipity of the best segue between songs you've ever heard. This is essentially what I did with the vinyl, and it was like a shock to the spine.Oh, and the rest of it is just as nifty as everyone says.

I was lucky to put my and on it!Hum! my favorite track on this record is \\"Third uncle\\", how come, because I had a gothic trip back in the '80s and this song was a reprise by Bauhaus and I did not know the composer was 801 back then. Starts with the famous amercian native notes done by a lonely bass then comes the other insturments nicely arranged.Second favorite \\"East of asteroid\\", wow wow for the bass and the drum, everything is impressive in that song.\\"Tomorrow never knows\\" is better than the Beatles' one\\"Sombre reptile\\" is a freaky-happy ambient song\\"Baby on fire\\" is different and nice, I like the bass but honestly he is not my favorite singer\\"You really got me\\" is a joke, we all like the song, the Kninks one was nice, The Van Halen one was the end of the world, this one is stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply another faceless progressive jam band","review":"This does not live up to superfans' 5 star ratings. These are merely tunes off Manzanera's and Eno's solo albums. They also include remakes of a Beatles' song and Kinks. I'm not a big fan of remakes but these guys do a competent job and enliven these tracks. Nice bass playing in the style of carp and some cool keyboard work but it never seems to gel.

It was hard to stay concentrated at work, and by 6 p.m., I was ready for bed. I don't drink soda or coffee, so maybe people who have caffeine in their systems won't have the same side effects. But after four days of crashing every day around noon, I stopped applying the firming cream and the scrub. Within a day, my drive/sharpness/energy levels were back to normal.

Which does exactly as the jar says - keeps us fat girls WANTING to be slim, but failing miserably.I don't know what everyone is saying on here - maybe they have much more obedient cellulite - but my fatty tissue doesn't listen to rhyme nor reason and want to take over the world after it takes over my body, and no amount of cream is going to make my fat change its agenda.The cream does go on cool, and it may be tingly, but all that tinglyness does absolutely nothing in dissolving our fat. The cream MAY smooth out our appearance, but if we put any lotion on our drier areas, then of course we're going to get a smoother appearance there. Don't need this jar to tell us that.Overall, a disappointment. Mainly in myself for having bought this thing in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good moisturzer, not very good results","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I really don't see the results. I used it continuously for two months along with the love handler and the fatgirlsleep, and did notice a difference, but I've had far better results with seaweed soap and exfoliants. Give it a shot, but don't count on a miracle.Edit:Sorry, I did say both. What I meant was that I noticed that my skin was more moisturized (which plumps up the skin making cellulite softer), but I saw no real benefit that could not be achieved from any good body lotion or oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big FAT help","review":"I was extremely skeptical with this product, but I admit the name hooked me. It tones, tightens, and gives you less giggle and wiggle. Plus there is no medicine smell. The best part is the cost. You won't break the bank getting rid of the jiggly stuff. You can't beat that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stuff","review":"I'm nearly forty and I'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight. I got this cream, and have been using it along with MBT trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer. After one month, I'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously-lumpy legs. I can't say that it would work wonders alone, but as an add-on to an exercise program, it seems to be helping quite a lot. I've done weight-loss programs before, and they've never addressed the cellulite issue. This is the first thing that has seemed to work. And it's great moisturizer, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down with cottage cheese!","review":"I am not extremely fat (yet), but I just turned 29 and even though I exercise 5 times a week, my thighs are starting to become rebellious cottage cheese factories. So I figured I'd try this product. My first fat cream ever. The product smells like menthol/mint but is not terribly offensive like a skunk or sweaty jockstrap or anything. And it takes a long time to absorb, compared with regular lotion, so you have to walk around your neighborhood pants-less for about twenty minutes longer than usual...putting you at a higher risk for a complaint or even public indecency charge. Walk quickly and get back indoors to examine the results. This miracle whip is pricey - when used as directed for 2 wks, I've already gone through an entire bottle. But I think my thighs do look a little smoother. I'll give it another month (two more bottles?) before making my final judgment. (Coincedentally, I've also replaced all the lightbulbs in my house with dimmer ones and that helps tremendously)"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great.","review":"This cream seems to work better than the $65 brands.

After a few uses every time I would use the products, it would turn red and blotchy in the spot that I applied it. I kept using it though because I realllly wanted it to work. It totally ruined my skin! Now, if I am in even a little bit warm water, my legs and bum flare up and turn bright red, keep in mind this isn't just hot water(everyone's skin turns red in hot water right?) this was in warm water too.

Has anyone else noticed that the video you can download has Alex standing near the girl in the scene where she starts destroying things but in the Wherever You Will Go video (that is, the new one) all you see of Alex in that scene is a quick blur?

Each are threaded through a central hub so that eight 3\\" lines stick out from under the weedeater. The hub spins & the lines cut the grass. When they break off they have to be replaced. The replacement is either to buy the line, and cut each piece & thread them through the hub or buy additional hubs.

This album is an interesting look at the writing process of the man. It is basically a collection of demos that Howe worked on before they would become heard in full form with Asia, GTR, and ABWH, as well as on his solo albums. Therefore, if you're a fan of these bands, it is quite a treat to hear songs like \\"Red and White\\" (what would be the basis of \\"Birthright\\" on _ABWH_), \\"Never Stop Learning\\" (would be used in \\"Brother of Mine\\" on _ABWH_), and \\"More About You\\" (what would be used in \\"Quartet\\" on _ABWH__). In addition, \\"Rare Birds\\" is known as the unreleased track \\"Vultures\\" from the original ABWH Sessions and the version on this album alone arguably justifies buying the CD. Howe sings on about half of the tracks, and it should be kept in mind that these are more or less \\"advanced demos\\", but for all of those who have followed Howe's career, this is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Went on like a glove.","review":"Got this to fix a leaky fluval 405. pop this sucker on and no leaks.

I am a fan of Tasha Tudor and just wanted to own some of her works. Again, as with the other books by Tasha Tudor, the illustrations are a bit disappointing. They are more sketchy than I would like. The colors are not vibrant, more washed out than anything. The children are not cute enough. I am a fan of recipe books and own the classics like \\"Better Homes and Garden\\", \\"The Joy of Cooking\\" and \\"Betty Crocker\\" cookbooks which include just about any recipe on this planet worth making. There were no recipes that I would try. Nothing new. This book wasn't as bad as \\"A Time to Keep\\" or \\"Corgiville Fair\\", but it did not meet my expectations.

Holst's Mars, the Bringer of War: I find the King Crimson arrangement way more interesting than that of the E L & P, several years later. Cat Food: really funny song, Greg Lake & Pete Sienfield score here! The Peace themes are cute, I like the instrumental one. Cadence and Cascade: quiet ballad, pleasant to listen to, although not quite memorable. But the album overall is: The fact that In Court came first should not make any difference. And personally, I like Pictures of the City much better than 21st Century Schizoid Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"It tastes like chicken.","review":"Funny chicken, that is. Needlessly pretentious and overwrought chicken. And if anything could possibly be worse than the music, it would have to be Peter Sinfield's lyrics, which cause me to expectorate that aforementioned chicken with a violence bordering on the projectile. I can't believe this nonsense is still in print. Please do your duty as a citizen and help speed along the process of forcing this album out of print by NOT buying it. You will be amply rewarded for your efforts in the mercifully Kingcrimsonless afterlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SECOND ALBUM","review":"I had to give this album 5 stars to bring up the average a bit. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. True it is not as good as \\"In The Court\\" but how could they have topped it? Pictures of a City in my opinion is worth the album alone. I would agree that this album is strikingly similar to ITCOTCK except for side two which is much more experimental (Devil's Triangle) and pointed to things to come. The title track is a beautiful song that I think is one of KC best. Cat Food's humor is out of place on this album and should have been replaced by a more appropriate theme. A great thing about this album is that it has Greg Lake's singing. In my opinion he had the best voice in prog-rock, and KC was never the same after he left. KC's artwork has always been interesting and this album is no exception. It really adds to the feeling you get when listening to this album. If your into early KC or progressive rock in general, I would definitly grab this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore Slump, But It's Still Crimson and Still Worth It","review":"As someone else pointed out, Poseidon is very similar to In The Court... In a way, this \\"biggest weakness\\" is also its \\"biggest strength.\\" For fans of the original band personnel, most of those guys are still around for album #2. It is not a stylistic or thematic departure, and some people like it when bands release multiple versions of the same album (AC/DC springs to mind...) Fripp's acoustic playing here is often better than on the first record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crimson's sophomore effort truly a schizoid album.","review":"Following the ground-breaking first album, In The Court Of The Crimson King, this second album by King Crimson was more of the same, yet completely different. Retaining all but one of the original members, the album's first side is chock full of mellotrons, saxes, flutes and Robert Frippian guitar licks, sounding like it could have been Side 3 of the first album. The second side of Poseidon, however, is an altogether different animal. With its jazzy overtones and the \\"let's see how far we can push the musical envelope\\" philosophy of Devil's Triangle, side 2 is definitely a precursor of things to come on Lizard and Islands. And like those subsequent albums, Posiedon is an exciting, mysterious musical journey from start to finish..."},{"rating":"1","title":"great album title, great artwork, horrible songs","review":"i just don't like this album at all...larks' tongues in aspic fits better for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"The common buzz with this album is that it is too much like the first, In The Court Of The Crimson King. That may be arguable for the first--well, I was going to say side, but now we have to say half.For the second, this is just not true.\\"Cat Food\\" is King Crimson moving forward at warp speed, with Keith Tippit's jazzy improv panio. It is a perfect song, and nothing like anything on In The Court. \\"Devils Triangle.\\" is Fripp working with a mellotron in far more dissnonet ways than on Mach I.And even if you listen to \\"Pictures of A City\\" or \\"Cadence And Cascade,\\" it is more Crimso expnading on ideas they laid down than copying them. \\"Pictures\\" has more complicated stops and has a funkiness thanks to Peter Giles tight and chunky bass work. \\"Cadence\\" with its light flute and accustic guitar, is far from the trippy keybords on talk to the wind.The title track is a copy. Ok. Ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid performance with one sparkling gem","review":"Although it copies much of the format of the excellent five star \\"In the Court of...\\" this is still a very good album and indeed, \\"Cat Food\\" is in my opinion the best track from both these albums.

The Streaming Media Handbook covers in short the production process, but just as an overview. It covers how to prepare web pages to display streaming content, but just as a tool to test your streams. And what is more important then learning how to start streaming. How to connect a video source to your capture card, adjust your encoding tool, and configure your media server to receive a streaming signal? I definitely recommend it! I found helpful charts and product comparison, and a detail break down of software and hardware, showing the pros and cons of each streaming technology.

This 1974 swansong is unbelievably ahead of its time, and continues to gobsmack new listeners to this day. An influence on such '90s acts as Primus, Quicksand, Tool, Living Colour, Soundgarden and Nirvana (echoes of the title track's riff can be heard on Nevermind), RED is full of punishing guitars, cruel time signatures and dangerous intellect: like a Harvard professor's idea of heavy metal. Even the mellower \\"Fallen Angel\\" features a stabbing on a New York sidewalk, accompanied by blaring, Kid A-style brass, while \\"Providence\\" - with its horror movie violins - should never be listened to while alone in the house. Radiohead? Shmadiohead..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you hate this at all...","review":"You would still love that you hate this album.Progressive rocks pioneers show their true colors again. This album cooks! unbelievably talented as they always are and have been King Crimson and the dream team that made up this particular lineup of Bruford, Fripp, Wetton, Cross and dominated 1973 and 1974 with Larks Tounges In Aspic, Starless and Bible Black, and ofcourse Red.This album is so well rounded and unique it beats description under any \\"one\\" lable. King Crimson are certifiably one of the most intricatly critiqued bands you will ever try to describe ;)... Have fun owning this album and at the same time, trying at all for a decent interpretation of this fusion, jazz, rock, metal album. Hybird as it gets... Listen to Fallen Angel and be left weary with this monsterous rock classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting album, as well as a great one","review":"Red is by far one of my favorite Crimson albums, while the album works musically it also works visually, not in the realistic sense of things, but rather in the abstract. A song like the title track is the height of a \\"visual\\" song. Fripp's guitar playing is more droning, as is the album as a whole. Possibly influenced by drone notes in certain types of Indian music, the album has an eastern feel to it as a whole. Another interesting point is that this is one of Crimson's balenced albums. Obviously COTCK is not balenced as a whole, neither is LTiA. However this album balences quite well. Rather than focusing on the songs as a series, or group, the pieces work individually. Stellar performances as usual from Wetton(his best sung album)Bruford and Fripp. High praise to Marc Charig, Robin Miller, Mel Collins, and David Cross as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the perfect introduction to King Crimson","review":"This is not only one of Crim's best records, but one of their most accessible- if you haven't heard Crimson yet, Red is possibly your best choice for a first purchase. This is excellent, progressive, and very accessible heavy rock with a bit of psychotic improv thrown in for good measure. Starless is the album's biggest highlight, and one of my favorite compositions in all of rock music. It just builds up to an amazing climax that puts me in a state of total euphoria every time I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of Rock","review":"Red was the very first KC album I bought. Now, I have the entire studio collection. I was deeply impressed by the whole album. Starless is the most precious stone in this jewel box.I still cannot understand why the production quality of LTIA and SBB is so inferior in comparison to the crispiness of RED.Thank you Messrs. Fripp, Wetton and Bruford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine.","review":"This album is one of the finest that progressive Rock (if you can live with that term) produced in the mid 70's, and is still one of the most powerful albums of all time. I heard it when I was 15, and 15 years later, it still elevates my blood pressure. GET THIS CD. Then, check out Live performances on \\"The Great Deciever \\" and \\"The Night Watch\\", both released in the mid to late 90's to see how this band could blow away anything that came before it, and still blows away anything since. To quote a reviewer, \\" Crimson makes Primus look like Michael Bolton\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Word (Or So We Thought)","review":"It's too bad KC split up after this effort. After releasing experimental albums like Lark's Tongue and Lizard, King Crimson finally found their niche on Red. Robert Fripp lets loose on guitar. John Wetton sings his best on this and plays some great bass (he'd later form Asia around the time Crimson reformed in the 1980's). Bill Bruford's drumming sounds more out of control than on Yes. Ian McDonald returns with his reeds (sax and woodwinds) and David Cross gives the album an avant garde feel. You have heavy metal influence on \\"Red\\", jazz improvization on \\"Starless\\", and even a ballad \\"Fallen Angel\\". The opening track \\"Providence\\" is eerie, but not overbearing. It'd be almost another decade before Robert Fripp would reform KC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Blowing Material","review":"This is still one of my favorite KC discs, and deservedly so. Not much I can say can expand significantly beyond what others have already written here. This is a classic, and to those who say this is just \\"noise\\" (especially regarding \\"Providence\\"), I say this: Just go back to your Britney Spears records and leave us prog rock people alone, okay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red a fitting epitaph for '70s-era Crimson","review":"Red is probably the strongest album from the Fripp/Wetton/Bruford axis - and sadly, it was their last. A stunning mixture of early Crimson (wafting mellotron, saxes and oboes) with the brain-damaging intensity of the later Crimson (killer Frippian guitar, booming Wetton bass, Bruford's percussives), Red turned the intensity up a notch, as symbolized by the pressure gauge on the back cover. Ian McDonald was ready to rejoin the group for real, but it wasn't meant to be. Guitarist Robert Fripp - keeper of the kingdom - disbanded Crimson after this album was recorded, and the band would lay dorment for over five years, until reincarnated into a completely different line-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable rock metal jazz progressive","review":"This album is sensational. Very hard rock is combined with a jazz influence to pummel you before such a thing was considered. But, be flexible, \\"Providence\\" slows things down and has a violin dancing and jumping around in a way that just can't be put into words. I am a hard rock/metal fan and I can't say enough good things about Red. Oh, and to give some background, I didn't wake up yesterday and buy this, I bought it on LP in 1975 and was amazed then, as I still am now. It has its mellow, slow moments, but the power in them is overwhelming. Actually, to sum it up, the power of this music is overwhelming. If you just let it in. There simply is no greater example of what was termed \\"fusion,\\" that fleeting wonderful meeting of hard rock and jazz. The musicianship is stellar - guitar, bass, drums, vocs, there is no weak point, I just can't say enough about this creation. This music is intense, and completely original - and it works man, it works!! Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beastly heavy, awesome album","review":"I love this album like I love all of king crimson's albums, the only complaint I have is that Wetton's singing is kind of irritating on \\"one more red nightmare.\\" (his singing is actually kind of bad in general, he rushes things a bit). however, the beastly riffing heard on that song more than makes up for it. \\"starless\\" is beautiful and dark, like many Crim songs. This ranks among their heaviest works, it might even be their best. I recommend new fans start with \\"In the court of...\\" \\"discipline\\" and this album. Then get \\"larks tounges...\\" and maybe \\"starless and bible black\\" This cd is definitely one of their best, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that it IS their best. It is definitely in the top 3, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAARGH!","review":"Can we please lose the association between this album and the Band Flotsam & Jetsam? Should we punish one of the best bands to come out of the trash being produced in the 1990s by mistakenly listing this album among their works? This album relates to a comedy duo in the radio days and has NOTHING to do with the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"I had heard nothing but rave reviews about the Horrorist, and had heard his über-hit \\"One Night in NYC\\", so I decided to check out the rest of his album. There were only about five songs that I could stand listening to more than once. Most of the beats are alright, and if this was a strictly instrumental album, I'd give it an extra two stars. What I think ruins it is Oliver's \\"singing\\". It is either a shrill screaming, à la Atari Teenage Riot, or it is in his storytelling style. The screaming songs are without a doubt terrible; \\"Ich habe die Macht\\" is by far the worst. His storytelling songs are much better, but lack replayability. Once you've heard \\"One Night in NYC\\" several times, I found it getting old.The best tracks on here are \\"It Goes Like This\\", \\"One Night in NYC\\" and \\"Mission Extasy\\". Absolute worst, hands down, is \\"Ich habe die Macht\\".

I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of a legend","review":"This is one of the best debut albums any band or performer has ever released. There's not a bad song among the collection. From the rocking and relevant 21st Century Schizoid Man to mellow songs like I Talk To The Wind and Moonchild. The mournful Epitaph and the commanding The Court Of The Crimson King. This is such a moving album which bring up so many moods. While groups like Yes paint pictures of places with music this music takes you there. This album is something that belongs in EVERYONE'S collection. This IS a must have. The sound has never been better thanks to the new remaster from the original tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut album","review":"This album is a classic, as far as I am concern, this is one of their best of the seventies, my other choice would be \\"Red\\". I am not a fan of the band (see my other reviews) but I really like this one, it has what was clearly missing in the following albums and that is....emotion.This cd is full of great melodic and emotionnal moments, I just like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good for prog rock","review":"I am not a prog rock fan manily becasuse the songs are way to long and i have yet to find a singer of this type of music with a good voice. Greg Lake does have a good voice i acutally knew his later band emerson lake and palmer before i even heard of King Crimson. I like all the songs on this cd the length does not really bother me. Accept moon child most of it is just boring noise i skip it at the 3 minute mark. The one thing i notice about this cd that it really is not that heavy like the bands that were influence by them songs are. Actually some of this sounds kind of folky. I can imagine someone like Nick Drake singing I talk to the wind. The title song was the first song i heard of them it played on the radio and i quite liked it so i picked this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still scarey","review":"This work blew my mind when I was in junior high school and it still does 25 years later. The musicianship is top notch and the songwriting is brilliant. Pink Floyd surpased this work in all it's paranoia, but it took them quite some time. 20th Century Schizoid Man still fascinates and repulses. The saxophone on this cut is quite agressive. Greg Lake's vocals are so crystaline and Robert Fripp pulls out your spine with his Les Paul's fret work.."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!","review":"I'm not going to go into the technical stuff here, as others much more knowledgable about such things, have already done so. But if you somehow have never heard this classic musical adventure then don't delay, be daring. Get it. Great progressive rock with wonderful instrumentation and haunting vocals. The sound is amazing, spectactular, fantastic. If you perhaps have an earlier version and you are on the fence about purcasing this. Just upgrade, man. Just upgrade. The DVD is so cool. There is a double disc much like this one out there that is 2 CD's. But again the DVD is very, very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Prog rock? then you must love it.","review":"I could not believe it that it is the first album of King Crimson. That time Prog rock was in its formation state and this album made the path. out of 5 songs 3 are my all time favourite. 21st century, epitaph and in the court of. In my point of view the Prg rock went to its max height with Thick As a Brick by Jethro Tull, but if there were no 'In the court of crimson king' it could have been too tough to reach that height.Listen to it. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely must listen to for fans of ELP or King Crimson","review":"I had never heard the music of King Crimson until I heard a snippet of the song The Court of the Crimson King in the movie Children of Men. I heard Greg Lake's voice and knew I had to have that song! I am a big fan of Emerson, Lake and Palmer, as I own several of their albums.So I tracked down the song and album and was surprised to learn that he was once a member of King Crimson. I bought the album and it's good. I don't know if I'll try any of their other music but might, especially if more of it becomes available as Amazon MP3 downloads. I don't usually buy CDs at all.Anyway, if you are a fan of Yes, ELP, Jethro Tull, or Rush, you might like King Crimson. And if you are a fan of ELP, you should definitely check out this album as Greg Lake sounds awesome on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step In The Right Direction For Humanity.","review":"This is, as a matter of fact, not opinion, the single greatest musical achievement ever produced for the priviledged men and women of this planet whom can hear audible noise. BUY IT, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR PITIFUL LIFE AS YOU DARE NOT IMAGINE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mix","review":"I actually think the inverse of the other comments. This 5.1 mix sounds much more dynamic than that of Red--whose stereo mix I preferred. This cd will never sound this good again and that is a guarantee. It should be mentioned that on both titles the stereo mix is of higher resolution (96/24 as opposed to 48/24), but \\" The Court\\" 5.1 really seems to have its own life, consciousness and existence--it is more free and unpredictable (like the way music sounds when you hear it live) and really keeps you on your toes with the surprises literally lurking around every turn. This is the way 5.1 should be!! Don't even hesitate to buy this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Important King Crimson Album","review":"In the Court of the Crimson King is one of the founding albums of the progressive rock genre.

I put on the record the other day reminded by the fact that the recent movie \\"Children of Men\\" had \\"The court of Crimson King\\" in the movie, and I was also reminded of how much I had loved this record in my young college going days.

There are other albums that don't grab me much anymore that I loved back then, but this still has an enigmatic and otherworldly quality that makes it a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"prophetic rock","review":"Reviwers here primarily are evaluating the musicianship and emotional mood that the music creates, which of course is penetrating and great.The most important theme though I believe to be the lyrics.Written by Peter Sinfield in 1969, it gives a fine sense of where the world is headed, the musical equivalent to George Orwell's 1984.Substitue Rothschild for the Crimson King, and you have an allegoricalscenario similar to the Mozart's Magic Flute where freemasonry was exposed.The fire witch was left standing in Dresden on Ash Wednesday during the firebombing of February 14, 1945 when several hundred thousand people perished.With Epitaph the plot and mammon's destiny are unveiled, with the prayer of hope left hanging by a thin thread ... are we there today ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This music has it all - light and shade , sweetness & menace","review":"This band made me rethink rock music .The eye catching cover makes you wonder what the music could possibly be like . The album explodes into the first song and the band is in charge from then on .The lyrics are way out there , but suit the music well .It is an ambitious album which largely succeeds .The band are quite different and they create worlds in which the songs exist .I would ask that prospective listeners take a chance after listening to excerpts of the tunes - some are very heavy in tone , others are like lullabies .

It amounts to little more than pretentious little boys who have no understanding of rock and roll at all. The result is tedious, self indugent, crap posing as meaningful rock music. For your own sake buy The Velvet underground and Nico, White Light/White Heat, The Velvet Underground and Loaded and you will have four perfect examples of rock and roll.

Sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Help me! (what the guy on the cover is yelling)","review":"And I sure sympathize with him, as being trapped into this album must be one of the worst tortures one can conceive.Back when this album was issued, most rockers spent a lot of time immersed into a dense smoky cloud created by various substances, so I can understand how they enjoyed it (they would have loved the noise of a passing train too). Unfortunately, as soon as you listen to this thing in a reasonably sober state, the truth is revealed: this is 100 percent pure crap. Self-indulgent, badly structured, terrible crap.But if you are one of the diehard fans of this album, don't feel bad: there are a few prog rock albums even worse.

If you cannot at least appreciate the totally original quality of this recording - you don't necessarily have to like it! - you are missing out on something important: that modern (rock) music can be every bit as new, challenging, arresting and intelligent as anything that has gone before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnum Opus","review":"This is easily King Crimson's best CD.

My brother bought the album back in 1969, then went off to Vietman. Me & my sister were 9 years old and we would sit and listen to it constantly. The words were comforting somehow. They have stayed in our minds all these years, but it always haunted us because we never paid attention to the artist or album name when we were young, and had no idea who sang it.

I was shopping around FYE, looking for the deluxe edition of St. Anger and a Carlos Mencia DVD and this caught my eye because the cover was weird. So since it was like $4.99 I bought it because it was a good deal and \\"influential\\". Gee whiz it was bad! King Crimson are lame Creed ripoffs who try to make \\"art rock\\". Hey King Crimson, leave art rock to the masters like Nickelback and Staind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I simply had to write a review of my favourite all time album. It is over thirty years since I discovered its genius and originality and this has never worn off. As close as you can get perfection. They start with the awesome power of Schizoid man. The band's collective musicianship weaves its way through jazz and rock. What a drummer in Mike Giles, what a saxophonist in Ian McDonald, what a guitarist in Robert Fripp, what a ..... After this you need a rest and find it in the beauty of I Talk To the Wind.Then we have the epic Epitaph and the dreamy Moonchild. All of this comes together in the momentous Court of the Crimson King. Rock was never better. Crimson never bettered this debut offering. If you have never heard it you may be thirty years late but it will have been worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant work of art","review":"The rich, bold, and deeply textured structure of each song on \\"In the court of the Crimson King\\" reflect a variety of styles and a sound unique to only King Crimson. While many people favour the heavy, brash, jazzy benchmark tune \\"21st Century Schizoid man\\", the lesser known acoustic titles compell me. The soft, mello woodwinds in \\"I talk to the Wind\\" ease tension with their beautiful voices. And the almost renaissance quality of the album's title track flows gracefully throughout the acoustic peace. Moonlight and Epitaph are wonderful tunes as well, presenting a blend of acoustics with jazz, and comeplete the album's outstanding sampling of genres. Any fan of Pink Floyd, or Spirit will appreciate the conceptual nature of this work, and enjoy it's gentle ballads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the day","review":"I had a fairly adequate stereo which was centered on a Thorens transcription turntable with an excellent stylus. It always cheered me up to hear this album played at moderate to somewhat loud volume levels. I won't get into the progressive rock chicken and egg debate, for I also appreciate many of the other groups mentioned but KC has a very special place in my hierarchy of rock bands. They made several other good recordings, again duly noted in several reviews but I always have liked this one the best.For those who have not heard this I would suggest attempting to hear part of it at least prior to buying as I realize this particular genre of rock can be considered an acquired taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - in the court again...","review":"This KC masterpiece has been a standard in my collection - one that just does not collect dust like so many things this old (and younger!). The remaster makes us bong-ers appreciate the finer points of this CD that is a head trip from start to finish. It really set the standard for so much progressive rock, even today with bands like Dream Theater and Spock's Beard. Always nice to hear the REAL thing, albeit for the umteenth time - heck, a masterpiece is a masterpiece. And a great foundation for other prog rockers to build upon.Get it NOW if you don't own it - and revel in the fact that they took the time for a remaster of the classic!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still just as Heavy!","review":"I was in High School in '69 when this first came out.

Schizoid Man has been stuck in my brain for 35+ years , I think it really was the original get down hard core rock song (in the same class with Janice singing \\"Ball & Chain).

The issue is a bad power module. Sony Customer NO Service was not helpful in resolving this issue the first time after I had the camera for 1 week. It took them 6 weeks to return the camera, eating up the 90 day labor warranty and causing me to have to purchase the extended warranty so I would not have exorbitant labor charges if it needed to be fixed again.Do not purchase this camera if you want to be sure to get pictures at those important times in life.

Not that there's anything really wrong with them (they seem to come from a similar philosophy, after all), but it makes you wonder.With that out of the way: This is a great camera, well worth the price tag.

I can't see how this would do ANYTHING helpful--especially for me, as I was looking for something to give SOME type of support for my wrist. This had ZERO support. Plus, if you wear it on your right hand, the black logo/text is on the top and looks bad. I would return this except I have to pay to return it--so I'm out the $2 to ship it to me and probably another $2-3 to send it back and that's over half the cost of the stupid thing.I would NOT recommend buying this unless you can try it on in person.

I also know that this is historically a landmark album. I just think it's so boring!The instrumental pieces have nothing going on, no strong melodies... for the most part they are just noise.The song \\"St Elmo's Fire\\" is the only tune with a little substance but other songs with vocals like \\"I'll come running\\", \\"Golden Hours\\" and \\"Everything merges with the night\\" range from unremarkable to down right boring.Maybe when this was produced these tunes were innovative.

This album is arguably his best (and my favorite). Great instrumentals, excellent production values, and his distinctive voice all make this a wonderfully complex CD. Heck, even some of the names of the instruments used on the album are interesting (\\"Spasmodic Percussion\\" and \\"Uncertain Piano\\", to name two).

This album also displays the newly created musical genre (which I give him huge credit for) ambient music. I think maybe only Tangerine Dream and Mike Oldfield in the early 70's were the only other musicians who had an eye on this phenomenon now called \\"Ambient\\"...however their albums from the 70's now come across a whole lot more dated in comparison to Eno's work.

Kodak has really let us down with this camera. When it works it is a great camera. The pic quality is great, the movie function is pretty nice as well but something is inherently wrong w/ these cameras. I have returned mine 3 times and every single camera has had the same problem. There is something wrong w/ the power source/batteries. The camera when new will typically work well for the first couple of uses and then it will start to power off like the batteries are dead. YOu can test the batteries and they are fine. I just received my 3rd camera yesterday and it is doing the same exact thing that the other cameras were doing. 3 out of 3 cameras w/ the same problem obviously means that your chances of owning one without any problems is not good. If I could return it for a full refund I would but now I have had it too long. MY LOSS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"Pictures from the Kodak are not quite up to scratch. At 'best' resolution, the prints are unimpressive and indoor shooting is almost a complete no-no on this camera. The lag on the shutter action is enough to \\"lose a moment\\", and the red-eye flash mode is a tad simplistic. On the plus side, the av-usb connector for a direct tv slide show is absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, the lack of an adapter/DC connection takes a heavy toll on battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed.","review":"I bought this camera last December based on the reviews of some people here. What a mistake! 2.2 Megapixels is not enough for taking pictures indoors even in daylight. I had some pictures printed by OfotoNow and came back dull as ever. That was pictures measuring 6x4 and in the best resolution for the camera. Now I find it hard to believe 80 people have a problem with their eyes. Maybe some people are just easily satisfied. Now I am looking for a camera that takes pictures in as high a resolution as regular film cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak DX3600","review":"This is a nice camera with very good features for the price, however there seems to be a very long delay in the picture taking process. If the subject is moving at any speed at all, it usually is out of the view finder by the time the picture is recorded, unless you try and follow it like a video cam. Another problem has been the on/off switch. At least 50% of the time the camera will not turn on, and on some occasions turns off before the timer feature is activated and will not turn on again. This appears to be a fault with this unit and not a funtion of the camera in general. I have read others have had the same problem, which leads to a suspect quality control issue with Kodak. I will return this camera and try another unit, because I do like the features, however the long term sevice contract may be something to consider for the Kodaks at the time of purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the trouble","review":"Kodak put all of their emphasis on the Easy Share software and none of it on the camera itself.

We were testing this camera for VeriPic software compatibility and were pleasantly surprised at its ease of use. We had previously used Kodak DC215, DC260, DC265, DC290 and DC5000. We were pleased with how much lighter this camera is than the DC290 as well as this camera is frugal on batteries.This camera take standard or rechargable AA batteries. This will save you a lot of money in the long run. Beware of other cameras from other manufacturers that use their own battery types. The photos are crisp and sharp and the auto-focus is accurate. The colors from this camera, as is true for all Kodak cameras, appear warm and inviting. Kodak really knows how to do the color mix well!

If you want to take more than a dozen pictures, you had better have lots of charged extra batteries. My camera refused to turn on after 12 pictures. I had batteries from another Kodak camera (DC265)and those would only last 2-3 pictures and then go out.

All of them have been Kodak & I had been satisfied with them (aside from a few issues on the DC50) - they are all still working fine. I bought this one for the 2 megapixel resolution, the optical zoom and the 2:3 image ratio (so you can print out a 4x6 image without cropping). After using it, I also like how light it is - it only requires two batteries rather than four (as some of it's competitors). The video feature comes in handy in a pinch. Certainly plan to upgrade to at least a 128mb Compact Flash card.There is always room for improvement. USB 2.0 support would be good (it can never be fast enough). A 3x optical zoom or better would make it more attractive to consumers. The looks are goofy - I think I prefered the traditional forms of earlier models & the on/off switch keeps switching back on as I slip the camera into the camera case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble from the start","review":"First - I do have to say that the camera is relatively easy to use and takes very nice pictures. However, the battery life with this camera has been problematic since the first day that we received it. We have used several different batteries, as well as different battery chargers in an effort to rule out other problems. But this camera continued to be a problem.

It didn't take long to learn how to use it and took great pictures! The movie mode is great for fast action like rides, when a still frame doesn't capture it all, but they do use a lot of memory. I would suggest a 128mb card to make sure you have plenty of room. The battery is great because its rechargable, with the dock, but keep a spare set with you in case it runs out of power. I'm guessing 50 to 100 pics on the battery, but it also uses a lot of power if the LCD is on a lot or if you review and delete a lot. Downloading at the touch a a button is awesome, especially if you have over 400 pictures to download. Any other way, you would sit at the computer for hours!

Then Gundam turned super mecha with cool but irrational robot coloring and designs, and worse yet, included poser personality-type heros (perhaps with the exception of \\"War in the Pocket\\"). That's all fine and good if there is some entertainment value, but even Gundam Seed does a better job than Gundam Wing.

If you are a hardcore gundam fan however, it looks good on your shelf.Oh, but it has a good soundtrack, worth purchasing soundtrack. Only Operation 1 however is worth it.Only buy this if you are1.

Most people know anime as Pokemon, Yu Gi Oh, and things like that. Needless to say, Anime does not have a very good reputation in North America. Gundam Wing is better than Pokemon, but that's where it stops.As soon as I saw it, I saw a problem. Five invincible super-gundams. No matter how badly outnumbered, they would always win. Character development is minimal, and the main character is the most annoying character in the history of anime.With the release of Gundam SEED Coming up, I see no reason ANYONE should buy this. SEED is a far greater series than Wing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But One Of The Weaker Gundam Series","review":"Many of the Gunadam series have a very similar plot. What distinguishes them from each other is the character development. Gundam Wing has a lot of potential, but falls short of greatness. There are some awesome battles and plot twists, but the characters are very boring and one dimensional. The voice acting is bad too, which doesn't help. This is a really good anime despite these things. I like the plot and the action can get pretty intense. If you like Gundam, then you will probably enjoy this, even though it's one of the weakest Gundam's ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky I guess for one of the BEST Gundam Series' ever MADE","review":"Apparently I got lucky when I bought this set at Best-Buy when it first hit shelves.

Hopefully i can buy operation 4 by itself and just watch the missing episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very practical","review":"If you are looking for a book about 'debating' or 'logical argumentation', then MAYBE, this is the book for you. In general, the book goes ad nauseum into the author's past debates.Often, the author makes a great effort into explaining some concept with debating situation examples and then closes off the chapter with a comment like \\"and this can also be applied to everyday arguments etc\\". I became quite frustrated reading this book and found others with much more praticality.The author doesn't seem to understand that in reality, most arguements are not carefully planned debates but often arise from 'emotions' and cannot be easily won through 'logic' alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The darkest comedy I have ever seen","review":"You are going to laugh, cry, and think about this movie for a long time!

Honestly, I just got it for the fanservice, so the story was a bit distracting... could have used more of Mii though. I would recommend Eiken over this, but Jungle De Ikou is still pretty good. About the DVD itself, extras include production art and a gallery of the images used for the packaging. One bad point is, the songs have unremovable subtitles, but this DVD is worth it if you can get it cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as titular as you might think","review":"After reading the reviews, one would almost expect an hour of a very bosomy lady dancing and gyrating wildly. That actually last a total of maybe a minute. A minute that you will not soon forget if you enjoy that type of thing. Mii is extremely attractive and moves very, very well.The story and music are quite good really. Enough to stand on their own merit. The bosomy features that appear after the transformation is what everybody focuses on. To be expected since the box cover so proudly displays that. I enjoyed it and thought it was quite clever really."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Funny and Gorgeous Comedy for all Anime Fans!","review":"Based in the traditions of Ranma 1/2 and Tenchi Muyo, Jungle de Ikou is full of the kind of dead-on comic timing and colorful characters that make or break a series like this. The story follows 10-year-old Natsumi, a Japanese schoolgirl teetering on the brink of womanhood. As though her insecurities about her body weren't difficult enough, she's just inherited an ancient pendant that will transform her into the absurdly top-heavy Flower Goddess Mii whenever she does a special dance. Accompanying her along her misadventures are Ongo - a kid devil, Rongo - a beautiful water spirit, and Ahamu - the lecherous God of Soil. This anime is a must-see for any fan of comedic anime. Young viewers should be warned that even though the anime is not explicitly sexual, there are some suggestive scenes and there's enough enormous breast-bouncing to put half of the animators in Japan to work. See it, see it, see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa.","review":"I have to say, Vision of Escaflowne is one of my favorite series ever. If you haven't seen it yet, you should.

A super excellent song, now a timeless shoegazer classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Wall of Guitars Early 90s British Rock!!","review":"Nowhere is Ride's first album proper and is one of their highpoints, not to mention one of the best albums ever, period. This is the UK reissue/remaster and it sounds fantastic. The shimmering, almost palpable wall-of-guitars and bass n' drums sound, along with those gorgeous soaring vocal harmonies, are all captured here. And the songs....WOW! Polar Bear, Taste, Dreams Burn Down, Vapour Trail, Here and Now, and the grinding closer Nowhere are just amazing (the whole album is, truthfully!). This reissue has four bonus tracks, comprising Ride's 1991 EP Today Forever, and the songs on here are also splendid, especially the beautiful Sennen and the long Today. All in all, Ride is a vastly underrated band, a quintessential early 1990s English band, and this is one of their high points! If you're just starting out with Ride, get this and the Smile EP compilation at once!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Necessary Music","review":"This is fuzzy goodness that is hard to top. What really works for me is how they use brooding pop melodies without confining themselves to boring pop structure. Anyone can tell each member is musically refined, but they are tasteful to the point of letting listeners know they have good chops but are more concerned with structure, dynamics, and mood. That kind of awareness is very much appreciated. Very highly recommended album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time greatest albums now better than ever","review":"If you already own an older copy of \\"Nowhere\\", then sell it and buy this one. The sonic quality is noticeably better, and if you don't own the original \\"Today Forever\\" ep, then the four extra tracks here are worth the price alone. The album itself is full of incredible classic ride tracks. \\"Vapour Trail\\", \\"In A Different Place\\", and \\"Paralysed\\" are my favorites, but every track here is great. Its quite a shame that Andy Bell could write these sorts of songs and then now be satisfied to be the bass player in a sub-par band (Oasis)who's only claim to greatness was (and \\"was\\" is a key word here) a clever knack for ripping off great songs of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only redeeming quantity are the nude scenes","review":"There is an opening shower scene with one lover. And a closing bathtub scene with a third lover. The middle lover didn't get a nude scene. The nude scenes are the highlight (the only highlight) of this movie. The cinematography is good so a star for that and another for the leading lady's charms. You have to wonder if they made up the script as they went along. It is worse than mundane. I cannot believe anyone talking like these people do. I cannot believe these people work at a television show. There are scenes where she makes faces at a bus stop. I don't know why she dumped the shower guy. But the bathtub guy playing a horn along with nude Hannah playing her horn was worth the $1.17 I paid for a used copy. But don't waste your life watching the middle of this. How did it ever get into blockbuster?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only so-so","review":"I read this book a couple years back and then completely forgot about it until i saw commercials for the new movie with reese witherspoon. i thought it looked familiar.like others review-writers, this book was an easy read. i think i finished it in an afternoon. The writing wasn't great, the story was alright, and the ending was not-so-surprising.but overall, it was tolerable and at some points even interesting.i'll say this in closing, the book was enjoyable enough that i'm looking forward to seeing the movie. but save your money, and borrow the book from a friend or a neighborhood library...it wasn't anything special."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only It Were Written Well","review":"The story's improbable premise had so much potential: The hero (Arthur) finds the very real looking \\"ghost\\" of a young woman (Lauren)who is actually across town in a coma. The doctors are ready to pull the plug and she asks Arthur's help in kidnapping her body so that she can stay alive.I purchased the book thinking that this might be another \\"Ghost\\" or \\"What Dreams May Come.\\" It's not. The characters are flat; the dialogue is wooden; the story line approaches the absurd. (How many practicing architects do you know would be able to take an extended leave of absence whilst they (a) steal an ambulance and (b) con a hospital into releasing a patient who's been in a coma?)I give the book a star, because I believe it has potential to be a reasonably entertaining movie. It was as though the author had written the book with that thought in mind. Perhaps Spielberg can do something with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun reading","review":"I don't usually read this type of book but it looked interesting and so I picked it up. I loved it. It was a funny, lighthearted book that made you feel good. Not deep reading, just relaxing. I passed it on to my sister who loved it also. I read it a long time ago and now I see a movie is coming out. Can't wait to see it! Read the book and then see the movie,a fun kind of movie. Romance and humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted potential","review":"The idea behind this story is a good one. However it could have been so much more with a more accomplished author. The love between Lauren and Arthur is not believable. There's no foundation for the depth of commitment it would take to commit the crime and therefore run the risks that he did. The friendship between Paul and Arthur was not believable. Again, why would Paul take the risks he took. Relationships are not well built, dialogue is strained. Past memories are just thrown in to accomodate the next chapters. The tough cop ends his role out of character. So many things wrong that, with more planning, more thought, more devotion to character development, could have made and awesome trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope the Movie is Better Than The Book","review":"I am an avid reader and I was really looking forward to this book because the story line looked cute. The book was written so that it was hard to relate to the characters. I liked the storyline but the writing was hard to endure. I am hoping the new movie coming out will be better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story, okay writing","review":"If the book were indeed written in french originally, I can understand why the writing seemed a little flat and akward, especially in the beginning. Sometimes the scenes jumped a little too much to make too much sense.But the plot was very good and there were a couple one liners that were very memorable. A story on the theme of \\"living every moment\\". The writing settles in after a few pages and I was hooked till the end.I think it'll make a great novel if someone like Jude Deveraeaux wrote it. The book needed to be a little longer and the characters a bit more developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Descent into sentimentality","review":"It's a good thing I had a supply of insulin on hand to counteract the saccherine of this book. I was willing to suspend disbelief - I knew from the blurb the nature of the story. The book started promisingly enough - I particularly liked how the hero's friend and partner made sure the hero saw a psychologist once he (the hero) had reported a ghost in his appartment. However, the ease with which the partner was persuaded to break the law (and break it seriously!) was scarely credible. But my main problem with the book is the descent into sentimentality in the second half of the book. What a disappointment from such a promising premise and beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"After reading this, will not see movie","review":"If Only This Were True is a wonderful story - about awakening of not only persons, but hearts. It was a charming read and am glad I read the book although I did want to see the movie. Now, I would not see the movie, because the book had such real sweetness it would spoil any version of it.A definite sweet read."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment","review":"When I heard about the concept and the Hollywood bidding war that ensued for this book, I thought that I was going to be in for an interesting read. I am still impressed with the concept, but this has to be one of the clunkiest things I have ever read. A story with the cast of perfect characters and sugary platitudes that just doesn't cut it as worthwhile reading. The first two chapters showed immense potential but the dialogue when Laurel and Arthur got together was cloying and unnatural. Much of the \\"life live to the fullest\\" content was the same old same old and I read parts of this in spam emails that I DID NOT forward to my friends. If this thing is going to be made into a movie, the dialogue has to be thrown out the window and somebody has to cut the sugary sentimentality out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written book","review":"I can't believe that this book is a best seller and is going to be a movie! It is horribly written and so far fetched. There is not a moment in the book where you think \\"I could see that happening.\\" maybe a crazy or stupid person would think that! I was expecting this book to be at least somewhat believable and good. Don't waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't sparkle","review":"I just finished this book, and though it may have been terribly innovative to the readers in Europe, it seemed like just another formulaic American romance novel to me. Formulaic, but without the sparkle of the best of the romance genre...Spencer, Phillips, Mittman, etc. The story didn't seem to make the unbelievable believable. The premise and the potential were the, but the characters never grabbed me, I knew the ending all along, so I wasn't terribly motivated to turn the pages. If it hadn't been so short, I'm not sure I would have finished it at all. However, the author has potential, and I would not discount further works by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only It Were Believable","review":"I picked up this book because it was advertised as a best-seller in France, but I was quickly disappointed. The author seemed to be in a hurry to finish, picking up speed after the introduction of Lauren and gaining speed at a rate that provided no motivation to buy into his plot. Dialogue is trite and attempts at humor are very 1950's.Maybe the movie will add some depth, but I'll definitely wait for the video to find out. I should have remembered the French like Jerry Lewis movies, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure soap","review":"This book has nothing to deliver; the writer's prose is *very* poor, and the ideas/actions of the story stolen from $1 soap magazines one can find at the supermarket checkouts. Nothing but hype!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Easy Read!","review":"While the premise of this story is farfetched Marc Levy leads you into it so skillfully that you are totally engrossed with the characters without considering how improbable the story line is. I read it straight through in one day - couldn't wait to see how it ended. Marc Levy has you looking at the world (and relationships) through the eyes of Jessie. It gives you a new appreciation for things you may be taking for granted."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEW! WHAT A STINKER!","review":"DON'T DIVE INTO THIS ONE - VERY SHALLOW. I bought this book from Amazon thinking the premise was a good one and I still think it is. This author just could not write - poor character development, cliches galore, unrealistic dialogue, etc., etc. Hollywood has a long way to go to salvage this one. I'm still wondering how this author? got a publisher for this trash. It's very seldom that I cannot find something good to say about a book, but this one is the exception - I just couldn't see any literary value to this book whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, witty, and unexpected!","review":"I admire the author's imagination; how he turned an 'Impossible' situation into a 'Could-happen' one. There are smart jokes, and the ending is unexpected. Right when you think it has come to an end, you are surprised and relieved that there's a final twist to spice up the 'epilogue'. I recommend this book for people who like smart jokes, and simple romance. Of course, you should keep an open-mind as you read this. It could happen to any of us! Marc Levy is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only It Were True","review":"What a wonderful book. I just happened to pick it up at the sale table and have recommended to everyone. I love the fantasy aspects as well as the romantic, and I especially love the surprise ending! This is just a great, feel good, book! Read it as soon as you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"This book had been on my \\"to read\\" list for a while, because I was intrigued with the concept. However, the book did not meet my expectations. It was obvious that English was not the writer's first language - his sometimes cumbersome word and phrase choices took me out of the fantasy. And I guess that's the bottom-line for me. This book requires the reader to suspend his/her disbelief a great deal. I can usually do this *very* easily, but wasn't able to with this book. Therefore, I never really \\"bought\\" the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a whole lot better","review":"I thought the premise of this book was interesting, but it turned out to be a little trite and with awfully large holes in the plot. I might be being stupid, but I expected a sort of metaphysical mystery, how to get Lauren back into her body ? It smacks of something that was written in order to be sold to Dreamworks and star Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But if you would like to spend a day reading a very undemanding book then this is for you. (I'm still confused, why did she go back?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag Me!","review":"If I could give this book less than 1 star, I would. I can stand sappy, but this was just stupid. Neither the plot nor the characters were at all believable. I still can't believe I actually finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but disappointing","review":"I really liked the sound of this book, being a romantic myself. Boy meets ghost, boy falls in love with ghost, ghost nearly dies......you can guess the rest. But it failed to deliver, there were huge jumps that occured in their relationship without being explained which really annoyed me and huge events like Lauren (the ghost) being able to feel things are skimmed over. Sadly, could have been a lot better than it actually was. Although, still perfectly acceptable for a beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure I want to finish.","review":"I really thought I would like the idea of this book. Getting through the first hundred pages has really been tough. I keep hoping it will get better. Someone wrote that it seems like it is a movie script for Meg Ryan and I can't help but agree. It does remind me of City of Angels but this is just plain silly. I keep thinking of I Dream of Jeannie or Bewitched. I will try to finish it. Hopefully I will be back to say that it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could be worse...","review":"Summary: An okay book that eases away a few hours. Although the story and writting is substantially better than Nicholas Sparks' \\"Message in a Bottle\\" it would still make a poor movie.Strengths: Moderately interesting storyline. Nice touches of San Francisco.Weaknesses: The writing is trite and uninspired. The relationship dynamics between Arthur and Lauren are largely superficial and left me wondering why they were so much in love. Many key details were incorrect, e.g. a 1961 Ford \\"Woody\\" station wagon? with a V-6? Woody's were made 10-20 years earlier and V-6's didn't appear in Ford until many years later, bringing into question the integrity of other aspects of the story. Simple research would have tightened up the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad writing","review":"I picked up this book because the premise sounded interesting. I wasn't expecting great literature; just a fun, summer read. But after only two pages, I was already cringing in my seat. Maybe the writing lost something in the translation -- one can only hopes so. Regardless, it was stilted and self-conscious, the sort of thing one reads in a freshman writing class. I slogged through about 50 pages, but finally had to give up. There's only so much pain a person can take in the name of an interesting premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stupid!","review":"Part one of the book was interesting but went way down hill after that. I found the personality of Lauren to be very annoying! The dialogue between the characters sounded as if they were reading off of cue cards and their reactions to their situation were so unrealistic, even for a \\"fantasy\\" type of story. I ended up skipping from chapter eight to the last page just to see how it ended. I was so disappointed that I found it hard to believe anyone enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please disconnect the sugar!!","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I got this book on tape (from the library, thank goodness!)because I thought the premise sounded interesting and fun. I knew it would be light and fluffy, and I don't mind that, but this thing gets so bogged down in stuffy, unrealistic dialogue and all this serious junk about Arthur's childhood. Personally, I think his mother sounded like a complete weirdo. His childhood stuff detracted from the main story, and, in my opinion, was completely unnecessary to the story. The conversations between Lauren and Arthur were just too soap-operaish. Nobody talks like that in real life! When Lauren \\"disappeared\\" from his apartment, I found myself telling Arthur to \\"suck it up!\\". I only listened all the way through so that I could find out the ending. Do yourself a favor, skip this book. There is so much better reading out there!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Translation\\" ruins the story","review":"Before the movie's release...I read Just Like Heaven. I can now say the movie has to be better than the book. I know it was originally written in French and published there, but the American/English publisher seems to have commissioned a literal French to English translation with horrible results. There is a complete lack of understanding for spoken American English and general American life. The errors make it seem as if the author \\"just doesn't get it\\" and would have been much better off setting the book in France with French characters. Street intersections are \\"crossroads.\\" EMTs are \\"doctors\\" who answer calls from the hospital. Doctors and technicians are interchangeably referred to as \\"medics\\" (although no one is in the U.S. Army in this book). I could go on.... If only a decent translation had been done, reading this book would have been much more fun. The twist at the end is sweet, but it's painful to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only It Were Good...","review":"I don't get this book. I too was sucked in by the coverlines that hailed it as an international bestseller and I thought it must be a sweet tale with something extra, maybe like The Little Prince, a book I loved. But this book was so bland, so amateurly written, so obvious that it's hard to believe it was published. Yes, I can see it as a movie with Julia Roberts, as someone else here suggested, but only if they hired a really witty screenwriter who could make this leaden prose sparkle. I like sweet stories but please give me some originality with my sugar. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I ordered this book because the plot sounded so promising, and because it supposedly was a best-seller in Europe. Perhaps it was translated from the French -- that would explain the plodding, dull prose. The conversations had no hint of the speakers' personalities. Much like Mary Higgins Clarks characters, they all spoke with the same tone. Real people don't speak in long paragraphs. The characters were flat, the setting seemed more of a soap opera set than real life, and the story was unconvincing. The ending was the predictable happily-everafter stuff of a Harlequin Romance. Are you sure this book wasn't written by a precocious fifteen-year-old girl?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Predictable","review":"Because I had heard that \\"If Only It Were True\\" was a bestseller in France and will be a Spielberg film, my expectations were high. Boy, was I disappointed! The writing style is horrible, and the dialogue sounds completely unnatural. Perhaps it lost something in the translation from the original French. If not, the author should consider returning to his job as an architect. I certainly hope that Dreamworks gets a decent screenwriter to clean this up for the film version. The plot is silly and completely predictable, and I confess that I only skimmed the second half to reach the ending because the awful prose and dialogue annoyed me. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no!","review":"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I didn't love this book at all.Although its good qualities included being light, fluffy, and a quick and easy read, I think that's where it stopped for me.The transitions in the book were choppy, the premises all way too far-fetched, and the descriptions were lacking.It's a good book to read to escape for a little while (2 hours top) but it lacked substance for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"itchy scratchy uniboob.....","review":"this bra is very itchy, uncomfortable and a bad buy all around. i am a 48 F and can't find a bra that will support me comfortably. wish someone could make a bra for us bigger breasted women..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend!~.........","review":"Would not recommend runs small....stick uncomfortable pointy...everything you don't want in a bra.....it is not something I would ever buy again!~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glamorise comfort","review":"This was a gift.

This bra was not made for women with a large cup size. I'm a 40 G and I wore this maybe 3 times before it began to fall apart. Before that point, I really loved it and had high hopes for it. The construction of the cups and lace is part of what bothers me most. The lace in the cups began to rip and tear quite dramatically. I'm actually wearing it today (why, I have no idea--maybe because I haven't really been out much today) but I will probably throw it away soon because there will likely be nothing left to hold me up pretty soon.I really should've returned this bra but it may be too late at this point. I think this bra might be OK for women in a C cup or less. But even then it may not be sturdy enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't poke an eye out with that thing!","review":"This is a pretty bra, and I will say it is comfortable however I will not leave the house with this thing on. Talk about Torpedoes!! My husband, being his ever humorous self actually had the nerve to say \\"burn that thing before you put an eye out\\"... great. I spent more than I should have on it without knowing how pointy the thing would be. This bra reminds me of that bra Madonna used to wear in her videos. I can't return it now that I've tried it on and I am stuck with something I wouldn't be caught dead in. I'm a 36DD so maybe this thing would be OK for a bigger gal but for me, I made a very expensive mistake.

I thought it looked strange on the model in the white bra (see color selection photos) and assumed it was just that they had a full figure item on a not so full figure model. No, it actually fits this full figured (44H) woman like that. That extra bit of fabric on the underside does not seem to be part of the cup or the band and causes an odd lumpy look.The side panel fabric is way too flimsy to offer any side support.Also, the bottom elastic band somehow manages to fit snug in the back and loose in the front. How is that even possible? I mean snug and very loose. My engineer husband spent way too much time trying to figure this out last night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bra of the 50's","review":"I need a wire-free bra right now due to costochondritis.

I didn't like the black grips that came in the package (the feel was too close to plastic for me). They are slimmed down where the web of your hand fits in the grip which is good if you have hands on the small side. I put my factory grips on with the insert because I don't want my pistol to be completely black and I like the wood grips better. I did have to cut excess rubber off of the insert (part of it was blocking my mag release). Once I was finished cutting the excess off the gun looked really sharp and I am satisfied with it. Knocked a star off of my rating because of the plastic feel on the grips and because I had to cut the insert so it wouldn't catch my mag release.

I was impressed by only a few things in [SAFE]. The acting by all involved, most importantly the completely different looking (and sounding) Julianne Moore, is simply excellent. It's understated and drab, just what the film succeeds at best. The music, the clothing and the sets evoke the '80s, the time of the film. The single biggest problem is that you desperately want the plot to lead to a huge ending that wows you, especially after sitting through such a depressing ride of a film - and it does not happen. I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"As an individual who suffers from some chemical sensitivities, I purchased this movie, thinking that it was really going to be an eye-opening movie for those around me who do not smell the off-gassing carpets, particle-board furniture, or fabric softeners. Instead, I found a movie that begins with a woman who suddenly becomes environmentally ill, but ends with her entering a \\"safe haven,\\" do nothing for her community instead of a true environmental clinic that would actually assist her in improving her health. I was very disappointed in the movie. And, yes, there are some of us who have been over-exposed to some chemicals that truly become environmentally sensitive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less is not Moore","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high considering how hard this title is to obtain. I ordered a copy from Amazon UK. Todd Haynes' other films - Poison, and Velvet Goldmine - are visually striking, and the framing of Safe reminded me of artwork. This formality however distances us from the narrative, and seems to highlight the miscasting of Julianne Moore. Moore's previous supporting roles showed a tartness which was very appealing. However it is perverse of Haynes to cast her as a bimbo. She may have the skin for her character but she really isn't believable, and Haynes strands her in his huge long shots. When she is called upon to give a speech near the end of the film, it is almost embarassing. The story behind Safe is interesting enough but I think it could have been much more than the curio that it is, if Haynes had used Jessica Harper in the lead, rather than giving her only a few minutes of screen time in a supporting role."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathtaking Moore","review":"I have always been a fan of Julianne Moore, but Safe showed me part of her that I'd never noticed before. She has a breathtaking ability to become a quiet woman, a still woman, a woman who goes unnoticed and who is afraid to speak. The static wide shots make one want to jump off the couch and peer closer to the television in an attempt to see who this woman really is. Haynes barely gives us the satisfaction of finding out, by the time the film is over, but we are left with the feeling we've just been told some kind of family secret. Love it, love it, love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much quality . . .","review":"If you are looking for a terrific visual and audio experience, you can pass on this DVD. The soundtrack is pure mono, and the picture is average. If you really want to purchase this movie, get the VHS version, although that's not much of a bargain at $18. Better yet, rent it.The only reason I bought this movie (DVD) is because Jessica Harper is in it. She had two very small scenes. There are some other supporting roles that are nicely done and appealing.Yes, Julianne Moore's performance is extremely good. She literally looks weak and sick throughout the film, but makes some nice fashion statements. I don't know if this film is for or against environmental whackos, and it will a while before I watch it again.Sometimes you roll the dice on DVD's and that's what I did here. I really prefer a presentation with great sound and picture -- that's what DVD's are about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Safe\\" made me sick! Cinematic torture...","review":"Safe is perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It ranks among Ace Ventura 2 and the remake of The Island of Dr. Moreau featuring Marlon Brando.Safe is agonizingly slow, stupefyingly boring and if you're any kind of a skeptic (like myself) you'll be rolling your eyes constantly. Don't waste your time with this stinker.Multiple chemical sensitivity has been defined as ...If you sympathize with people who wear foil beanie caps and live in overturned toilet bowls, this is the movie for you!

If it hadn't been for her, I would have stopped the movie 15 minutes into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julianne Moore shines in Todd Haines' dark \\"Safe\\"","review":"\\"Safe\\" is at once a heartbreaking drama of a person adrift in a world she cannot control, and a searing black comedic indictment of American therapy culture and upper-middle-class ennui. Depending on how you approach the film, you may find yourself laughing hysterically at the characters' empty, gaudy consumerist existence, or you may find yourself in tears over Julianne Moore's brilliant portrayal of a truly pitiable woman's descent into illness. Despite the director's best intentions, Moore in the end elicits sympathy for a rather unsympathetic character. Whether the character's illness is the result of \\"environmental overload\\" or a prison of her own making is the background question to ponder as you watch this film. I just wish they would lower the price of this video!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls flat","review":"Gets off to a great start that is eery and weird.

Not worth the bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Leonard Maltin","review":"This video really doesn't gel and for me had that \\"made for TV/based on a true story\\" feel.

I was very disappointed, I usually like Julianne Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually pleasing, but what a waste!!","review":"I wanted to like this movie, I was intrigued and it was visually beautiful, but it was so heavy handed and asked too many questions without giving any answers. How many shots of car exhausts or aerosol dispensers does the director need to make his point? Why is everybody around the main character so devoid of any emotion or compassion? Why is her life , so full of material possessions, so empty? Why is everyone at the retreat either crazy or entraced by the charismatic figure who runs the place? Surely there are people affected by this disorder who don't end up living like the bubble boy. I like Ms. Moore, but she plays this role with a \\"deer in the headlights\\" look.

If that is the object of the film - fair enough. It left me feeling unwell and with terrible nightmares! Such a grey depressing movie it is a wonder that there are people that have actualy enjoyed this nightmarish insight into the life of a depressed and totally sick woman.

I know people like this movie, but I don't like it at all. It's by far the slowest movie I've ever seen. It was beautifully shot, and a slightly interesting plot, even a tad eerie, but just [was bad] right up until the end when absolutely nothing happened. Nothing happened the entire movie! She gets sick from everyday chemicals that are everywhere and seeks refuge from all this pollution in a New Mexico retreat run by a swindler/preist guru type. That's it. Call me spoiled expecting an ending too. Village Voice called it the \\"greatest movie of the decade\\" and the New York Times said it was \\"unnerving\\". It's not \\"darkly comic\\" either.

One shouldn't dismiss John Wetton's fleet, muscular bass playing either, although I've never been a big fan of his singing (he's since gone on to great commercial success). Fripp's brilliant work on this recording, at once angry and poignant, spikey and lucid, was his best to date and established him as the dark lord of rock guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album But Not the Best for This Lineup","review":"While being perhaps the weakest of the '72-'74 lineup, this is still an incredible album and a great showcase of the immense talents of Fripp, Bruford, Wetton, and Cross. This album, I feel, contains some of the finest and best improvisational music of this period (\\"We'll Let You Know\\" and \\"Fracture\\" are perhaps the best live tracks released at the time), but this album also contains some pointless improv (the title track seems to be going nowhere then has a really cool piece then fades out with pointlessness-although I would still recommend listening to it at least once in a while). My only other gripe with the album is that some of the lyrics seem a little weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"a failure","review":"Starless in Bible Black is the worst Crimson album I have heard. The first two tracks are annoyingly satirical, sounding like a bad collection of art-school clichés. Most of the instrumentals are drawn-out, tedious, unnecessary pieces of filler. The only good songs are the surreal marvel, The Night Watch and the grinding, melodic 11-minute instrumental, Fracture which flows with such natural radiance. Not a satisfactory follow-up to the astonishing Larks' Tongues in Aspic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there a zero star review option?","review":"I tell you, one star is way too much for what this thing deserves.I admit it, once upon a time I also thought there was some beauty in chaos like KC puts into their albums.

Where each of these three discs differ in focus and content they collectively present the finest era in Crimson history. The interplay between these four exceptional musician's can't be rivaled.

It doesn't inflict the profound reverence that \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" does, but this is the one I listen to in the car. \\"The Great Deciever\\" gets us pumped with it's insane transitions and brilliant lyricism. \\"Lament\\" is a lullaby of blossoming stardom that suddenly pulls the rug from underneath us with it's biting cynicism. \\"We'll Let you Know\\" is a slow building creature that grows into a funky jam from a Glasgow show(I love Bruford's final snare hits on this one!). \\"The Night Watch\\" is solid Crimson ballad with a beautiful Fripp solo. I can't say enough about \\"Trio\\". The enigma that is \\"The Mincer\\" leaves me wishing for more from a really cool song. \\"Starless and Bible Black\\" is an improv of dark intensity, and \\"Fracture\\" leaves us all breathless, a monument of composition and improvisation.

An amateur using old 78s and Audacity would do better. Six people worked on this abomination -- presumably to test one another's hearing. Three of them did the album art. Try playing it. It might sound better.And the sad thing is the music is worth having; it's Tommy in his Dixieland mode. I don't ownthis PD albumbut judging from the samples it seems a good choice, with good sound.

The only built in hints the game has is Bess, Ned, and George telling you to question all of the suspects. I'm not so stupid that I can't figure out on my own that I should question the suspects. The hints on the company's website was of no help to me. I was able to do on my own what the website tells you to do.

I paid a little more for this swing thinking I was paying for quality... but save your money it's not as nice as it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I gave my daughter the 3-1 Swing for her 4th Birthday. She absolutely loves it. She is able to carry it around from one room to the next. It was easy to put together. The only problem that I have with this swing, is that it does not hold heavier dolls very well. But other than that I would purchase this item again. I am buying the Ocean Wonders high chair for her for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute - but not for play.","review":"When I saw this swing, I thought it was adorable. I have two daughters so of course I had to buy two swings It is true as other customers stated, the thing falls apart the minute any doll is put into it. If you have a baby Anabel, you can forget about getting this swing. she is way too heavy. I tell you by the end of Chrismas morning, these swings were in the garbage. they were completely useless. My daughter kept the cloth seat part to tie around her body as a baby carrier, so she did get some joy out of it for a little while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with purchase","review":"I purchased this swing for my 3.5 year old for Christmas. Easy to assemble-was hoping for as good an outcome with my daughter. Unfortunately, every time she puts a baby (17\\"-Baby Annabell~Zapf) in the swing, the seat comes unattached from the swing itself. The seat was removable for a child to play with it independent from the swing however, it comes off every time my daughter tries to put a baby in the swing. To reattach, is a true hassle (the brackets that hold the seat are hard to snap into place w/o bending the swing itself). My daughter is already mad with the swing and we've only had it one day! This toy will be going back to the store ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CUTE BUT NOT VERY STURDY","review":"I bought this as a gift for my two daughters, ages 8 and 4. This toy looks very realistic and seems to work really well as a swing. The problem is that taking the seat off and putting it back on (to convert between swing and booster seat) is extremely difficult and cannot be done by a child. If you are buying this for a young child to use as a doll swing then I would recommend it, but if you are buying it for the 3 in 1 ... I would not recommend it. It is not made to be converted back and forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"look no further","review":"Before I bought the book, I was looking for some more good idea's abouthow to deal with people, which, I feel, is the foundation for everything.

I stopped reading right there. Those who don't believe in a Creator (capitalizing the \\"C\\" cracks me up) are, in other words, incapable of believing in other people and more importantly, themsleves. I believe self confidence can be achieved by anyone regardless of race, sex, and culture.

It damn sure is not religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be confident!","review":"I am a shy person naturally, so this book really helped me.

Unfortunately, this movie seemed very poorly produced (if you notice, though Karver is at least 10 years John's senior, he doesn't seemed to have aged from the moment he kills john's father when john was little to the moment he is out to kill John as an adult...)with weak and trite dialogue spoken by obvious amateurs. The plot was fairly good (though very cliche in some aspects), and I won't totally discredit the book for all of the imperfections I have pointed out in the movie (though I have not read it), but I do think that the book probably deserves more credit than the movie does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it if you want a good laugh","review":"I am a huge fan of BBC period drama and have nearly exhausted my library's supply of miniseries based on the works of Austen, Gaskell, Dickens, and Eliot. But I would have to say that the BBC struck out this time. The direction was bad, the acting was mediocre at best, the music was obtrustive, and the screenplay was just plain awful. After the first half-hour my sisters and I survived the rest by poking fun at one cliche after another. I have not read the book so I don't know how much of it is from the source material.

Aiden Gillen was enjoyably evil as the villain, Carver Doone, and Jack Shepherd and Anthony Calf are always good. But I found Richard Coyle made for a pretty lifeless hero, and while I think Amelia Warner is a good actress (see Quills) I thought she seemed far too smooth and polished for someone brought up with the likes of Carver. It would have been more fun if she'd had just a little bit more spirit. The film dragged on far longer than was necessary, and was generally not cohesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lorna Doone","review":"Bought it as a present for my fiancee but half way through Christmas Day afternoon it just stopped.

John (Richard Coyle) watched his father die, and vowed he would get revenge for their evil deeds. He falls in love with a sweet and beautiful maiden, only to learn that she's a Doone. Lorna (Amelia Warner) is a granddaughter of the Doone's leader, and she is expected to marry the future leader of the Doones-her cousin Carver Doone (Aiden Gillen). John finds himself in a difficult situation-he not only loves a girl that his family will hate, but he must fight Carver, who is just as determined to marry Lorna. The characters find themselves battling with issues of loyalty. This is a great story based off R.D. Blackmore's classic novel. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann","review":"An excellant movie with lots of excitement and a love connection to boot! The scenery in this movie is very fitting to the story. I love the ending and it is one movie that I enjoy watching many times. Definitely one that isn't like the trash that the Hollywood producers put out today in the U.S.!

I, however, chose to replace the heavy duty battery with an alkaline. So far the remote has performed flawlessly. I first used a heavy hand (or rather finger) to key the code, but soon found that that did not get me anywhere. This one requires a gentle touch for which it will immediately respond.

The picture quality is poor (like a copy of an old VHS) and the sound is not much better. Not bad for 5 bucks, but if you are a true fan of the film, keep your eyes open for a full length copy of Phenomena which is harder to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Argento","review":"This is a masterpiece of Italian horror from Dario Argento. Great soundtrack... great on so many levels. Creepers is definitely one of my all time favorite movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad video transfer and sound quality....","review":"I was very disappointed with this incarnation of Phenomena(Creepers) by Dariuo Argento. I have an old VHS copy that looks and sounds better than this third rate transfer from Synergy. First of all, the DVD version should have retained the widescreen format, which the Anchor Bay version on VHS did. Second, the sound was terrible. It should have been in the original Dolby stereo format. And just to further nitpick, the packaging was cheap and had no notes in liner. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie on DVD, but now, I\`ll have to clean up the old VHS player if I do. The movie itself is at least a 3 star horror show, but this DVD version is no stars. I guess I should have checked out all options before buying this DVD. This is a lesson for me and thank goodness it didn\`t cost any more than it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it but ready to leave it...","review":"This is a great camera in most respects. It's hard to take a bad shot -- as someone who wouldn't be able to deal with all the adjustments on a real SLR, this seems to be the next best thing... good lens but the camera does the work as though its a point-and-shoot. I've taken 1000s of shots with it. Battery life is fine. CD as storage is rather convenient.BUT, my complaint is the lag times. Power on lag, shutter lag, and shot-to-shot lag. It's painful to think of all the shots we've missed waiting for disc writing, or power on, or slow shutters. The Burst 3 mode is a silly answer -- just doesn't work right in practice. You can't even see the subject to know if you're still lined up once it starts bursting.Net: this is an ideal camera for non-moving situations... sunsets come to mind. Not so much for taking shots of kids, which I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on the best bass palyer in Rock!! But not perfect.","review":"THis is the best bass tab book of Geddy Lee's amazing playing available, because unfortunately due to the short sightedness of publishers it is the only one available.It could be perfect except for two slight problems- One- as commented previously some of the positions are wrong. Not only are they wrong, but this book tabs everything as if Geddy plays a TON of open strings. I can tell you after seeing him live several times (and playing most of his lines myself) he does not play everything in the first position using open strings. A lot of his lines are playing in the 5th position in D Major and mixolydian.The other slight problem is this has a lot of songs that just aren't Geddy's best bass playing like Cold Fire, And Dreamline.I heard there is possibly a long overdue Volume 2 of Rush Bass lines coming but until that time, this remains your best (and only) bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I'm not going to be long winded about this review, I'm going to get straight to the point. If your are a bass player like I am, you're probably not buying this book for the simpler Rush songs in it that you can learn by ear on your own, but for La Villa Strangiato and YYZ, don't even waste your time nor money. I already knew YYZ when I purchased the book, but I figured maybe there's something I missed, well guess what, the person who did the tab for this piece could not have been a bass player because he(she) missed about half notes, and on top of that added notes that weren't even there. It is beyond me how Alfred Publishing has the audacity to call this book, \\"authentic bass tab edition\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Tab book","review":"The book had some good tabs in there but the lack of rythm measures for all but the bass parts was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen Now I wish Amazon would!","review":"I had to return this twice because the jewelcase and recorded tracks are correct but the printing on the CD was something else entirely.

Took a dozen or more runs through it and now it's become another of my favorite 10 records ever. There's not a bad cut on it.

Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT an introductory text","review":"I'm sure it's a great book for people with advanced mathematics backgrounds, but it's simply NOT an introductory-level text, and it's unsuitable for engineers and other scientists. Definitely not an undergraduate-level text (although I should mention I'm trying to use it for my graduate-level coursework.) I wish I could rate the actual content of the book, but it's too incomprehensible for me to give an informed appraisal. Suffice it to say that the book's title misrepresents the content. THIS IS NOT AN INTRODUCTION.Apart from that, the exercise problems have no solutions given, and Springer (the book's publisher) refuses to let me (a graduate student) have access to the solutions manual. I'd have to be teaching a class using the book, for which I'd need to understand the material, for which a solutions manual would help - you get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I would call an Introduction.","review":"This does not appear to be a true \\"introductory\\" text. I would not recommend it as a first text on time series.A good bit of the text is spent walking through derivations of formulae, and many of the exercises do not use actual data, but are directions such as \\"Derive the recursions for the Burg estimates...\\" or \\"Derive a cubic equation for the maximum likelhood estimates of...\\" There is too little information on how to proceed in analyzing actual data.The book is not well-organized, but appears to have been thrown together hurriedly, and lacks any connecting flow. Coverage of topics is more brief as you get to the later chapters, which is another indication of rushing something into print."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is an introduction?","review":"The term 'introduction' is odd for a book bristling with mathematical symbols. Some academics don't always understand that people without mathematical training still need to use concepts taught in universities.This book is excellent if you've had that training and want to expand your knowledge. It's really an introduction at the top floor of the learning edifice, not the front entrance!More positively, the software that comes with it is excellent. The examples are clear enough and you can bypass a lot of the deeper mathematics by letting the program suggest the best models. But the only way to get the full benefit of it is to understand the accompanying discussion. This I tried to do by looking in other books (and the WWW) for a more straightforward approach directed at 'dummies'.For an introduction to the complex area of time series analysis a lot less maths would have made this book much more readable. But I will keep at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How cute","review":"I bought this set for my daughter for christmas and she is going to love it.

While the book introduces several topics relevant to RF engineering, it goes nowhere in developing central ideas and providing adequate explanations for equations. The logical flow is broken throughout the text, and it would only make sense to someone already familiar to RF engineering. To any engineering students familiar with thin texts covering expansive subject matter, and offering no concrete insight, this book fits perfectly into that category. The one section that developed a little better than the others concerned a review of resonant circuits, however, other texts are available that offer much better coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you want....","review":"I love Italian music and other singers with good beat, but this, let me tell you is not what you think.

Andy Kaufman was at times a comic genius with unmatched ability to get under your skin. Zmuda spends a little too much time putting Andy on a pedestal for my tastes, but I enjoyed the book and the behind the scenes stories. The stories about the experiences of Tony Clifton are especially entertaining.As an aside, Andy had really some severe emotional problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist History","review":"While this book is certainly a must read for diehard Kaufman fans (myself included), as it offers a few tidbits on Andy not found elsewhere, it serves mostly as a vehicle for Zmuda to attempt to overcome his feeling slighted at not receiving enough credit for Kaufman's work. Apparently, Zmuda was the brainchild behind most of Kaufman's schemes. I don't doubt that Zmuda was an important person in Andy's life and collaborated with Andy, yet Zmuda makes it known that Andy wouldn't be anything without him--an idea I find ludicrous.A better book is Bill Zehme's biography of Kaufman, Lost in the Funhouse, which seems more even handed in its treatment of Zmuda's and Kaufman's collaboration.So, read Zmuda if you must, but know that Zmuda's book is of firstmost importance to Zmuda himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zmuda Review","review":"I waited two years to see the movie Man on the Moon.It was worth the wait, and now on to the book. Zmudas reference about Mr.X is intriguing, but sadly not revealing. Zmuda does seem to be enamored with himself.

You don't always have to use the f word to get your point across, Zmuda.

I am pretty young for an Andy fan, but I love 'em anyway. I was 1 when he died. Ok, so anyway, people are sating that this book is more about Zumuda than Andy. Part of that is true, but everything he says about his life somehow ties into Andy's life. I just finished it, and I am still wiping away the tears from hearing Bob's account of losing his best friend to lung cancer (or did he! ), it's pulls at your heartstrings, and let me say that it would even make Tony Clifton cry.

Milos Foreman probably believed that Zmuda's insights were unappealing to mass movie audiences... which is why his film failed....and I must write that I have read biographies about Napoleon Bonaparte, Benjamin Franklin, Friedrich Nietzsche, etc... but no one fascinates me quite as much as \\"Mr. X.\\" When I read Zmuda's descriptions about him, I laughed so hard that I almost literally could not breathe. Zmuda did not diagnose him, but allow me: a paranoid schizophrenic who has a seemingly bottomless war chest. He is \\"carpe diem\\" gone absolutely insane.... and a part of me hopes he is alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tribute to a comic genious","review":"I never understood why Andy Kaufman was so quickly forgotten after his tragically early death.Maybe because nobody could believe it!(I keep hoping that Andy will turn up at the preview of the \\"man in the Moon\\" movie disguised as Tony Clifton!)I'm glad that he is being rediscovered through the movie,and 2 new books about him.(What are the odds that 2 guys with the initials B.Z.would come out with books on Andy at the same exact time?Weird,man!)I preferred Bob Zmuda's book because he was such a close friend and collaborator of Andy's.He reveals many previously unknown details behind Andy's comedy.All in all,a worthy read for the Andy Kaufman fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompously overwritten garbage by an assembly line hack","review":"I agree with the naysayers: this is total junk. Filled with pathetic Creative Writing 101 prose, Zmuda's scattershot faux biography is an insult to Andy Kaufman. Apparently written on viagra, mescaline and sleep deprivation in an attempt to \\"channel\\" the inimitable Kaufman, Zmuda fails at everything except coming off like a \\"buffoon jerkoff\\".

And I know something of this town. I also know many of the players in this book and can say Zmuda and co-writer Hansen told a great story quite brilliantly. I couldn't put this down (except when I laughed so hard I cried). Also, the last few chapters are touching and poignant and the book ends on a very \\"up\\" beat.

It really doesn't cover Taxi, because Zmuda wasn't welcome on the set. Kaufman's past is retold better by Bill Zemhe. Zmuda spends little time on his(Kauffman's) childhood, and a lot of time on himself. The only thing you can't get anyone else is firsthand accounts of his caurousing, which I can live without.The book beat Zemhe's book to the presses. If Zemhe's book had been first, I never would have bought this one.Zmuda is just a friend who is making a quick buck or two. It's obvious that he never cared about Taxi, and considering the astounding lack of depth concerning Kaufman's childhood, it's clear to me that he was never really known, but less liked by the Kauffmans. Buy Zemhe's book. Unless you want R-Rated Kauffman exploits, don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only revelation here...Bob Zmuda really loves himself","review":"This book is annoyingly self-congratulatory. And not at all well-written, either...this guy's a professional? Yikes!Zmuda takes credit for nearly every one of Kaufman's great ideas, but the banal tone of the book betrays the author's assertion that he is a creative genius.

Zmuda includes bits of his personal history that we really didn't need to know (i.e. what Mr. X did in line at the donut shop)and he just tries way too hard. Hindsight is 20/20 vision, and maybe Andy Kaufman really was just this sweet shy guy inside. Or maybe that's just Zmuda trying to hand us a pair of rose-colored glasses.

For someone who's supposedly written for Kaufman, Dangerfield, and others, you'd think his story telling ability would be more compelling...more exciting.But it's not, and I find myself more scanning the book for Andy parts than actually reading it. Zmuda is, dare I say, just feeding off his best friend's success, trying to make us feel that he was truly an integral part of Andy's genius. I woulda believed that before reading the book...but now, well, now I'm completely indifferent. Zmuda's writing is like listening to a long-winded bore at some party you don't really want to be at.In true Kaufman fashion, however, Zmuda has the last laugh.

It was certainly than that jobber of a flick called Dahmer..dont go there word life! and was a faster pace film than Ed Gein..Word Life. Its not that scary untill you get to the exucation scene and that will scare the word life heck out of you. I was watching this movie at aroun 1 a.m. and when they went through the exucauton scene it literally scared the heck out of me. I had to put a Cubs NLDS series game against Atlanta on in the background just to be able to get calm downed. So it will haunt you a little bit. I'd say its worth a purches on dvd because it does have meat and nudity so its a good flim. F-Buindy but long live the moovie.Originally posted on Oct. 14, 2003F-UHF"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises Promises. Failed Promises","review":"Not insightful and not interesting this is more a grisly series of vignettes than a movie of depth or substance.Rather than taking us into the mind of the killer as the box said it was just an opportunity to display Ted's insanity in a variety of different settings. Even the girls all blends together since there is no effort made by the filmmakers to give them any humanity.In this case the TV movie was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"This DVD was a load of [stuff].This movie skims over some facts and events and totally ignores others. It tells very little of how Bundy manipulated victims. It ignores how much support he had from friends and work collegues when first caught and how they faught for his release. It ignores Bundy's arrogance with the police. It actually portrays Bundy as having no confidence in his crimes and when being interviewed by the police. Other than one line it ignores the fact that he represented himself in court. Skims over his two escapes from prison.If you want to see a factual movie on Bundy watch the Deliberate Stranger on Video."},{"rating":"1","title":"No respect for victims","review":"Told from the point of view of Ted Bundy, this film is no holds barred, it provides some quite sickening details of the killer's actions with no explanation of what drove the man. I do wonder about the families of the victims. The victims were portrayed as one-dimensional walk-on parts. I know this is how Bundy would have seen them, as meat and nothing more, but I found it disrespectful to those who died and who were left to grieve. It is clear that the director has no idea of the enormity of these crimes and the affect on the victums' families, if he did he might have thought twice. I suppose he felt the execution scene would create a balance, but it doesn't. These were real people, not inventions, by showing us this the film would have been that much more powerful and convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry","review":"Extremely dry and slow moving. Not the best acting I have seen either. Not impressed with the attempt to do a movie about Ted Bundy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal and Fascinating","review":"First of all, anyone with a interest in serial killers will probably enjoy this movie immensely. Most others will probably be offended by it and see it as a waste of [money]. The film doesn't provide much insight into Bundy's unhappy childhood except for a few sporadic mentionings, which is probably for the best. Instead, the film begins in Bundy's killing era and ends with his execution. Michael Reilly Burke was previously unknown to me, but I think he did a very good job of not overblowing the role of Bundy, as well as successfully portraying Bundy's two-sided nature. If you are looking for a character study, then the slower-paced \\"Dahmer\\" will probably be more appealing, but \\"Ted Bundy\\" will be more staisfying those viewers looking for a less cerebral serial killer film."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" Wacko Wacko\\"","review":"This movie was extremely dreadful. The acting was horrible. The characters role weren't convincing at all!!! It appears these filmmakers have little or no knowledge, what it takes to put a good film together. Where do they find these people? Only the desperate actors take on roles like this. The plots were weak and lame. This movie is worth zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"No! No! No!","review":"Bright took tremendous \\"artistic\\" liberties in making this film, almost to the point where it borders on being a complete work of fiction.This movie leaves me with two baffling questions: WHY and HOW?Not in regard to the motivations of the featured serial killer, but WHY and HOW has this cinematic exploit made it into my DVD player?What was the point of this movie? Was it to showcase the limited talent of its director/writer, Matthew Bright? If so, then it was brilliant success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetically poor effort at film-making","review":"I characterize this version of the well-known Ted Bundy story as a total failure. From the gratuitous manner in which the film capitalizes on Bundy's gruesome crimes, to the poor cinematography, this film packs about as much meat as a marshmallow. In fact, when it was over, I really felt like I had wasted my time watching it. It taught me absolutely nothing about the real Ted Bundy. Even if you really get into grotesque violence, there are certainly much better movies with far more intelligently written screenplays than this one. The whole movie is filled with poorly shot scenes and inappropriate music throughout. Hang it up, Mr. Bright, you're not a film-maker. This film simply sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. The makers try to make it seem like Bundy, at first, was a sloppy idiot. I admit that by the end of his killing spree his work became more sloppy, but to kill over 100 people and never be caught is a tribute to how smart and percise this animal was. Not to say I agree with anything he did, just that to make him seem like an idiot just makes the people that couldnt find him and keep their hands on him look stupid themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horridly disturbing","review":"I rented Ted Bundy as I have always been interested in serial killers (Especially Ted). But this movie shocked me. It was far too graphic for real life events. The previous review made a good point that the names were wrong at times and what the hell was with the upbeat music when girls bodies were being flung around??? I felt like I was going to vomit. Yes, the film is very factual and has real footage (which scared me even more). But I strongly don't recommend this. When you watch this film you feel more like a Ted Bundy fan, as opposed to finding out info on him. Don't waste your time on this film. I'm an avid avid horror fan, but this movie crossed the line. I just feel so sorry for the victim's families, as if the haven't been through enough....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serial Thieves -- on a Serial Killer","review":"While Bundy is still very interesting 11 years after his execution, this depiction is weak and lacking in depth and understanding of the kind of mind Bundy had. Much of the material -- even direct quotes -- are lifted from \\"The Only Living Witness,\\" the 1983 book written by two reporters who were the ONLY reporters to interview Bundy at length after his Florida murder spree. The subject still is interesting, but most (who understand) won't be interested in second-hand psychiatric babble interlaced with fact and semi-fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Ted Bundy film.","review":"I've seen them all and read all the books. Each one has its selling points: smooth, handsome Mark Harmon, so \\"believably\\" magnetic to the women he killed; ironic, clever, cunning Billy Campbell, sparring, in his prison cell, with his biographer. This is the best, however. It portrays Ted Bundy as a sick nerd and crazed, violent, vicious, out of control murderer, exactly what he was. It's a mesmerizing performance, and actually very brave. Congratulations to the writer, director and spot-on Michael Reilly Burke, who refused to indulge us with another \\"charming\\" depiction of a monster. This one rings true, and yet I must caution: it's not a pretty sight, and you may be upset by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I have to give it one star.....","review":"This movie [wasn't good]...Ted is played by some guy who dosen't even resemble Ted, filmed as if in a B movie and personally I found a lot of the movie to be very bad humor that took away from Ted's horrendous crimes. The victims did all blend into one another, there was absolutely nothing in it that showed how 'normal' Ted really appeared to be. All you saw was some cleptomaniac, sociopath who raped/killed/ and masterbated constantly. To the point of it being funny. This is some slasher type flick that takes away from the fact that this was real and this did happen, I would be very upset if I were any of the victim's family, but even further upset to see [something] like this and my daughter's murder glorified like it was in this film. Watch \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" Ann Rule's movie, and see how Ted was from someone who really KNEW Ted..Pass on this movie, not even worth the rental fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's OK I'd rather not see in graphic detail all of Mr. Bundy's sick \\"jollies\\"","review":"I should have read before buying this piece of\\"awful\\". What a truly disgusting and \\"base\\" film this is. Worst than that it insults the memory of the girls that fell into this \\"Monster's\\" hands. I suspect had he not been executed for his crimes, this film would be palyed often in Bundy's cell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toooo cheesy!","review":"When I ordered this I was expecting a gruesome horror flick. So much of the actual story was left out that this was hardly believable and the acting was corny to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie...","review":"I rented this movie expecting an accurate depiction of Bundy's life, as a serial killer and as a human. I got neither. I have studied Bundy extensively in school (I was a Sociology major at the University of Washington, where Bundy took Psychology classes, one of my professors was an investigator in the King County cases), and I was amazed how few facts there were.Not only that, but there were things in that movie that NO ONE should ever see, I can't believe someone would watch this as a director and think it looks like something someone should watch...The Deliberate Stranger with Mark Harmon is more accurate than this, this is just garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"There are 2 things I liked best about this movie that other movies about Ted, and killers in general, sugar coat or leave out. And that is 1- They showed how inhumanly brutal he was and what he did to those poor girls, and 2- they showed what a terrible coward he was in the end and how he got exactly what he deserved with the electrocution. Ole' Ted gave up his card in the human race the second he killed that first girl. This movie is straight to the point and harsh, but it needs to be. These animals need to be shown for what they are, and this movie did a pretty good job of that. They could have went a little further into his background, but honestly, I didn't care that they didn't. Ted was a sociopath and incurable. This movie shows that very well. Hard to watch because of the brutality, but recommeded for those interested in abnormal psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"regarding Ted Bundy........","review":"I find the stories is pieces(story is useless) and it stress more on killings. The opening shots show that Ted bundy steals flower pots, television sets in a kind of expression and action which looks funny and the sex scene inside is more of less a 'push' and 'push' scene. The actor's script in this movie shows that the killer is a problematic or 'psycotic' person and at the end of the movie the killer was sentenced to death by electrocution. This movie is one of the lousy story based film which I've seen in theatres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Application.","review":"Green Gold has integrated the Kervran Recognitions with homeopathy, nutrition, and paramagnetic growing into a total approach to Houseplants, Gardening, Horticulture & Agriculture.

I am older than most who play these games (I have daughters who love ND games!), but I don't have alot of extra time, and I don't enjoy too much violence or spookiness. These games are fun, but also make you think about things a little differently in order to solve the puzzles and situations that Nancy finds herself in. These games teach great critical thinking skills, for those parents out there who aren't quite sure about them.This particular game takes place in an old hotel/ski resort, in the middle of a terrible snow storm. There are so many different places to go, and different types of puzzles to solve. I recommend it for people of all ages looking for some good, clean fun, but who don't have months to dedicate to solving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great game!","review":"Nancy Drew arrives at Wickford Castle to ski, when a blizzard hits!

Lisa, a photo journalist, too friendly? And if she's a photo journalist, where's the camara? Professer Hotchkiss, she never leaves her room, and never seems to want to talk, is she hiding something?

At first, It's hard to find your way around the castle, but you get the hang of it very quickly. Is there any other entrance to the tower besides the hatch in the e. s.?

And i've played them all up to and including the new one, number 16. The mystery takes place in a huge castle like hotel, and its so huge i got lost several times. The mystery is focused around Marie Antoinette, her journal and a diamond. You learn alot about Marie Antionette's history while you help Proffessor Hotchkiss, a nutty french historian who spends her time couped up in her room, not leaving even when she claims she was robbed. You meet a famous french skiier, Jaques Brunes, along with a reporter named Lisa and the guy running the place. I think his name is Mr. Eagan. You have to find your way into a locked and half destroyed library, you get locked outside to freeze, and you get hit over the head just as you think the mystery is about to be solved. Its great fun and the puzzles can be stumping. i loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Nancy Drew Game!!!","review":"I have played all of the Nancy Drew games, and to me, Treasure in a Royal Tower is by far, the best one.In this game, Nancy Drew, 18 year old super-slueth, visits Wickford Castle and Ski Resort for a winter vacation.

All the features of these Nancy Drew games are remarkable. You can talk to characters and explore many different rooms. You have to come up with several ways to get something you want or need.

You should definitely buy THIS game if you're going to buy one at all (which I suggest you do)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"This is the best game in this series and a pretty good game all around. It is educational and has no serious violence as some other computer games do. The graphics are also very good. I can't give the game five stars, however, for two reasons. One: The game did not take long enough to play. I finished it in about 6 or 7 hours when the package promised 20. And I played on senior level. Two: The game is really no fun after playing it once.

And, to our total surprise, our 20 month old daughter is determined to us this potty seat too (even though her success is more imaginary at this stage).Regarding the review where the little girl's legs were rubbed raw: I could see this happening more likely on a smaller child, especially one with quite chubby legs, and especially one who sat for a long long time kicking her legs. Our 3.5 year old has no problem whatsoever. Our little ones' legs do rest on the sides of the duck's head, but we haven't found any friction problems ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album","review":"If you want to truly understand the Kansas/Missouri rock scene from the mid-90's, this is one of the essential must have albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginners Bible: The Story of Nativity","review":"My now 2 1/2 year old received this video for Christmas last year.

He lies beside the beauty selected for him. He touches, caresses and occasionally kisses, while reflecting on his life and the prospect of death. There is nakedness but no eroticism. The touching and caressing (for which he is paying) seems like a form of tactile therapy. The madam muses openly, \`he is a man not at peace with himself'; a confirmation of the therapeutic benefits of this arrangement perhaps. The reason for each girl's sleeping is revealed. If you are in the mood for an essentially sullen film then this is for you. It is, in essence, a prolonged conversation. It's much too clever for me to understand.

While 2006's \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties\\" was largely dismissed by critical consensus upon its release, I nevertheless found this to be a fascinating and frustrating contemplation of mortality and loneliness. The German film has an intriguing premise and, in truth, the plot may leave you a bit perplexed as it is only explored in the vaguest of terms. But still, there is something dark and truthful in the lead performance that brings more depth to the character development than to the bizarre narrative.

Most of the movie is about him in this place, sleeping next to a bevy of sleepy young naked women and having conversations with them. You get glimpses of his life through these conversations but none that reveal anything that can keep you engaged.I researched this movie and I found that it is based on a short story by Japan's Nobel laureate Kawabata and such a place did exist in Berlin.

I had the same amount of movement in my wrist whether I wore it or not. Also, the heating and massage element of this product is practically nonexistent. I was very disappointed in the Handeze glove and felt that it claimed to help with more symptoms then it could ever hope to and that it grossly exaggerated the beneficial aspects of the product.

The editor himself agrees that most ultras are runs more than 26.2 miles - and continuous. There are a few stories in this book that are multi-stage, multi-day etc. And while some may feel it's not ALL about ultras (at least in the strictest sense), it's certainly all about endurance running - different authors' reflections/perspectives on the experience.

The album is a schizophrenic soup of the avant-garde. Sometimes blistering hard rock centered around layers of distorted guitars bursts out (\\"Blank Frank,\\" \\"Needles in the Camel's Eye\\"), sometimes an achingly, beautiful composition erupts (\\"On Some Faraway Beach,\\" the title track) and sometimes a quirky, glamrock oddity is provided (\\"Dead Finks Don't Talk\\" \\"The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch,\\" a song about a sex toy featuring a hilarious, squeaking, mechanical keyboard solo).

Some use lyrics to provoke thought and mess with perseption. Others use the actual music, either by augmenting familiar melodies or rhythms with new sounds, or by creating completely different and new sounds using old familiar tools. Well, Eno does it all here (and subsequently through out his career.) Songs like \\"Baby's On Fire\\" and \\"Blank Frank\\" use very familiar '50's pop tunes to lay the ground work for provokative, sometimes frightening lyrics. Then, songs like \\"Needles In the Camel's Eye\\" are completely new creations, only hinted at before, and copied numerous times today (but even then, only recently.) Absolutely brilliant. What's he mean by all of this? Who knows and who really cares! That's the part that made glam glam."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my son's favorites","review":"While my 2 1/2 year old will not watch the movie \\"Elmo in Grouchland\\", he adores this video compilations of songs from the movie and Sesame Street, and will dance and laugh with delight through it. Though I think we're all getting tired of yet another \\"Elmo's Song\\" setup, the rest of the songs are clever and fun. My boy especially likes it when I sing along with \\"C is for Cookie\\" and \\"Welcome to Grouchland\\" (maybe I just sing better than the Muppet characters). Probably one of the easier Sesame Street videos for adults to take, too. All in all a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I think this video is wonderful! This is the very first video I bought my daughter when she was about 6 month's old. I didn't play it for her for about 4 month's because I didn't like her to watch too much t.v. She is now 13 month's and this is the ONLY video she will sit down and watch! Which is great when you're a stay at home mom trying to get stuff done around the house! I would recommend this video to anyone who loves to sing and dance with their kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun video to sing along to with your kids!!!","review":"My two daughters, ages 1 and 2, love anything Sesame Street. This video is one of their favorites. It doesn't have many of the familiar characters but it is still great! The songs are catchy. I love the fact that the words are on the screen. It makes it easier for us to sing along with the kids. The dvd has a bonus Elmo's World episode. Great choice if your kids like music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is that fat woman singing C is for cookie","review":"This is a cute movie, it's short enough that you don't worry about your kid being a couch potato, yet long enought and fast paced enough to get the dishes done without interuption. I really enjoy this one, however C is for cookie is COOKIE MONSTERS SONG!!!!!!!! It is a crime against humanity that they have some opera chick butchering it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and fun!","review":"We have \\"Elmo in Grouchland\\", the movie, which has great music, a nice story and entertains the entire family. My 20-month old son LOVES it! I purchased \\"Elmo in Grouchland (Sing and Play)\\" figuring that we could enjoy the songs without watching the entire movie, which is exactly what this DVD does. Like the movie, the Sing and Play entertains all of us with singing, dancing, and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Elmo-centric song collection","review":"This is a quickie followup to the feature film, \\"Elmo In Grouchland,\\" with Elmo going back to the bizarro-universe home of the grouches, where everyone is grumpy and cooperation is forbidden. Elmo spends his time there trying to get his grouch friend, Grizzy, to lighten up and sing a little. Many old \\"Sesame Street\\" songs are recycled here, including classics such as \\"Rubber Duckie\\" and \\"C Is For Cookie,\\" along with a bunch of newer tunes that star Elmo.If your kid is already into Elmo, then this will be a welcome addition to your video library... The songs are okay, although the connective \\"plot\\" segments are often quite flimsy, and the actual edits in and out of the song numbers are sometimes a bit rough. Not a lot of thought went into producing this disc, but it still makes a good viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"When I bought this, I thought I was buying the Elmo in Grouchland Movie. It was a great mistake. My 18 month old loves Elmo, old favorites as well as the new songs. Also the video has all the words to the songs across the screen-great for pre-reading toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excession","review":"Another superbly written adventure in Bank's Culture Universe. All the books in this series should be read by any ardent sc-fi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"want to read it again..on my kindle. * hint hint nudge nudge*","review":"If you like the ships from the Culture Novels this is the best read about them to date. I'd like to read it again soon on my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and original.","review":"This is an unusual story written very well.The characters are all believable and well fleshed out, there are a number of standard Banks types in there particularly among the Minds but they are all interesting.The emotional story is a distraction on occasion but is unusual enough in itself to be interesting at times and it never detracts from the main story.There is plenty of action and quite a few twists with it never being clear who are the good guys or what the ending will be, there is also some humour and smart dialogue.A good entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, slow and disappointing","review":"This the first book by Ian Banks that I've read, and I don't understand the praise it has received. It's very slow and very little happens; it's not really even about the Excession, its about a messed up romance. This could have made an interesting short story if you cut out all the relationship garbage. If you want good sci-fi, try Peter F. Hamilton or Vernor Vinge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable!","review":"I couldn't put the book down. One of my favorite Culture novels. This one focuses more on the 'Minds' and their AI friends, drones, orbitals, etc... If you're a fan of the techie aspects of the Culture series, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Ignore all pessimists and give it a shot!","review":"Excession is among the five best books I have ever read. This is the first of Ian Banks' books that I have read and I couldn't put it down. It does take a bit to become immersed in the plot but once there, it's absolutely fantastic. The ideas will stretch the limits of your mind and leave you with a new perspective on the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banks falls way short of his own high standards","review":"If you fancy reading a book full of conversations between computers which are written half in English and half in some meaningless gibberish concocted by the author after spending the night with a bottle of Scotch, then this is the book for you. Tedious, unfocussed, all-over-the place rubbish. Scarcely believeable that it was written by the same pen as the beautiful \\"Consider Phlebas\\" or even the highly effective \\"Player of Games\\". A big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laboured","review":"Don't believe the puerile rubbish you read in other reviews ; this story (I will not credit it with the description \\"novel\\") wheezes along like the pot-boiler it is, in order that Banks can continue to lead his champagne socialist lifestyle, and bore everyone else rigid in doing so. If you're looking for imagination, you'll be better off with the Lion King video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"This is a very nice book, and, frankly, although I read them out of order, my first introduction to this universe. I am currently reading Player of Games."},{"rating":"1","title":"first-draft sludge","review":"Warning sign: by page 200, NOTHING has happened either in this book or in the author's head to give us a hint where the story will go. The above blurb: \\"...Banks is a true original...whose brilliant speculative fiction has transported us into worlds of unbounded imagination and inimitable revelatory power\\" is the real Affront. It kills me how readers of science fiction are so easily pleased by any piece of kitsch that centers around, like wow, a rip in the fabric of spacetime. Totally. Throw in some multi-limbed aliens who like to play squash, and bingo--some jacket-blurb flack is telling us we're in the presence of a major imagination. Too bad the delete key is beyond him. Obviously Banks has gotten to a point in perceived stature where no editor had the guts to pack this junk in a FedEx overnight with instructions to cut it in half and come up with a real plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens!","review":"I have never written a review for a book before. But I feel it is necessary to warn people about this book. It starts interestingly, mysterious, and has a lot of different plot lines, and then...nothing EVER happens. Even when things get tense and you are certain that someone will do SOMETHING...it doesn't happen. All everyone does is talk a lot about what they would do if they were going to do anything...which they don't. So don't be fooled: there is NO action, NO plot, and NO direction to this book. So if you want a science fiction book where nothing happens and you are completely confused for hundreds of pages...you've found the right book to read!As has been said here before by many other reviewers of not good books: \\"I would have given this book a \\"0\\" if they allowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most tedious, fustrating book I have ever read.","review":"This book is shockingly bad.There is no story, endless pages of nonsense, with descriptions which are quite franky tedious and childish.I had read The wasp factory and thought I would give the sci-fi side of Ian Banks a go.I read in the hope the book would improve, which took a year as I read several books in between desperate for a good story.The book did not improve.How the book has received so many good reviews reminded me of another story.The Emperor's New Clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Another culture novel, branching out in another different direction, I liked it, I'll buy the next one that comes along too. The sentient machine battles are especially good in this one. Many reviewers seem to dwell on the point that they couldnt understand the Excession. Is that not the whole poit! We are seeing and being able to judge the actions of the culture when confronted with the the most difficult situation any society could cope with (ie something infinitely powerfull, infinitely unpredictable and infinitely incomprehensible) how would you fare if confronted by the infinitely powerfull unknown, I think the culture did OK. I especially liked Banks reference to the culture getting themselves into an \\"Out of context situation\\" well done, I love it.Dave Reid"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please make this kindle-edition available in the United States!","review":"I'd buy this in a second if it were available in my region.... such a great book! Really a shame that it's not available in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Hugos for Iain? No justice!","review":"Banks is easily the best science-fiction author to be repeatedly stiffed for its major awards, which makes no sense to me considering some of the mediocrities that have been so rewarded (David Brin, Orson Scott Card). As always, pay close attention or else, because Mr. Banks never panders to his readers. His books are dense, ambiguous, and laced with irony, and Excession is no exception to that rule. This is one of his more playful books, however, especially in the wordplay between the various Culture Minds who constitute the novel's main characters. Though Banks's Culture books need not be read in any particular order, I would not recommend this as an introduction to his universe-start instead with Player of Games or Consider Phlebas (if you can find them). Excession is best read in a few sittings-say, a nice weekend at the beach. Stretching it out over a period of weeks may cause one to lose track of the nuances, which are typically plentiful and worth catching."},{"rating":"1","title":"All skin, no meat","review":"I found Excession a disappointing, if entertaining, read. I've read two of his other Culture novels -- Player of Games and Consider Phelbas -- and found them both intriguing and thought-provoking. Excession, however, has no real main plot but a thousand sub-plots that lead nowhere, serve no clear purpose, and end with a colossally boring anticlimax. All I got from this book was a renewed sense of loathing for the Culture (I've loved to hate them since the dungeon scene on the Planet of the Gerontocrats in Consider Phelbas) and a sneaking regard for the \\"bad guys\\", the gasbag Affront."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid \\"culture\\" novel","review":"Contrary to previous reviews, I found this to be an excellent evolution of Banks' \\"Culture\\" series packed with deep strange insight into the psycologies and psycosies of men, women, machines and homicidal gasbags. You never know who to root for in this universe he has created, the heartless amorality of the defenders of good contrasted with the bonhomie and cluelessness of the antagonists again creates an oddly compelling tension that pulls you through the novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Self-inspection of the Culture; subtle, thought-provoking...","review":"One of the indicators that Iain 'M' Banks writes high quality, thought provoking, engaging SF books is the quality of the customer reviews - note the total absense of \\"This is the *best* SF book ever!\\" type quotes that are normally associated with the mass of modern SF 'trash'.I found \\"Excession\\" to be a fulfilling book because it further explores the author's concept of an benevolent (or is it?) federation - The Culture. I have to agree with a previous review which mentions the Contact Agent(s) plot threads - I found these distracting, almost as if Bank's realised halfway through the book that he couldn't weave them successfully into the main plot; as he does so well in previous books.I'd have to rate 'Excession' behind 'Consider Phlebus', 'Against a Dark Background' and 'Use of Weapons', but its well worth a read if you like Bank's previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but tedious.","review":"This book had many interesting concepts but there was too much not relevant to the story and it is somewhat confusing trying to keep all the players in their proper place. It would have been a much better book if it were a few hundred pages shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ingredients but grossly undercooked","review":"As I waded through Banks' story I wondered why I didn't like it more. I never got engaged or really found a character about whom I cared deeply. Compared to Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep which I read straight through, Excession is a complete misfire. It has galactic travel, ship minds, suspended animation, time shifting, exotic xenobiology, and more but the story is related in episodic sections jumping around so much among points of view that a sense of plot or character is lost in the riffing on the certainly fascinating concepts Banks envisions. So this is more a book of ideas and concepts many of which are well realized than it is a novel or even a compelling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"TEDIOUS","review":"There are whole pages in this book containing sentence fragments burried in random computer gibberish like this: //8367309//!2384#@459003000. I got the point the first time Mr. Banks--YES THESE ARE COMPUTERS TALKING TO EACH OTHER! I get it already, so drop the silly gimmick. Unfortutely, the author seems to have forgotten his audience is...HUMAN. The only reason I didn't give \\"Excession\\" a 1 is because it contained some cool ideas about dual hyperspace planes I havn't encountered before. Forget \\"Excession\\" and read Peter F. Hamilton's \\"The Reality Dysfunction\\" series. It delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start but ended with a fart","review":"Don't know how to explain it but being fully \\"interfaced\\" between the MINDS running the various spaceships was GREAT in a cruising sense...but the unraveling of multiple plot lines and the eventual blackholing of characters in face of the some alien Quitoxic reflective \\"being\\" as EXCESSION...hmmm, a bit too excessive"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION: DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE","review":"This movie was sooo bad, I stopped watching it after the first 30 mins. I mean some of the ladies are beautiful, but this is the worst low budget film I ever seen. Its more like low budget porn than anything. It could have been a better film if the story line was produced better and focused less on the man having sex w/ his woman.

It is very flimsly and very hard to turn. I had already broken one set but thought it was a fluke so I purchased another one for me and one for my elderly mother. I still found it very hard to turn and she found it impossible and broke it right away. I wish this problem was corrected as the rest of it is very good.

The first one lasted about a year before it developed condensation under the glass, then stopped working. I surf 3-4 times per week and I wasn't rinsing the watch well with fresh water.

I actually wish everyone that hasn't lost a child could read it, so they could understand what is going on with bereaved parents, grandparents or other loved ones.

It's all there; patterns, drops, rakes, diminished, augmented, whole tones, blues, double stops, etc... He's got some really great sample blues lines that any player could easily add to his trick bag. Most of the fingerings are not specified, making you experiment and think for yourself how to get around. He states that this was his intention. Overall you can't go wrong with this method book.

I am pleased to have Emily watch something that is fun and also helps her learn about being courageous. At three Emily worries a bit about monsters and the like.

The plot is shallow and disjointed, three of the lead characters have no names, the female lead is written with startling ineptitude, and the storyline is absolutely nothing new compared to the other books in the Incarnations of Immortality series. There are only two possible reasons to read this book. 1: You are trying to finish off the series. 2: You are an aspiring writer who wants the confirmation of reading something by a published author that could have been done by a twelve year old with a typewriter and a sick mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only I Had Read Them In Order...","review":"The availability of the Incarnations series for me left a lot to be desired. You see, I read \\"On A Pale Horse\\" (Death), followed by excerpts from \\"Wielding A Red Sword\\" (War), the only two I had a chance of reading. So, when \\"For Love Of Evil\\" (Satan) came available, I jumped at it, even though it was out of order. Thus, when I finally got the chance to read the other 3 (including \\"Being A Green Mother\\" [Nature]), I knew how they ended. But I still enjoyed them greatly. As the series continued, I found that Anthony referred back to earlier episodes more and more. This is fine if you read from #1 to #6 in order, but if not, it can make things a little confusing. Luckily, Anthony's writing style made it easy for me to understand the basics of what was happening, preserving the flow of the book at hand, without giving away too much when I went back and found the other books.

There's plenty of exposition, as well as loose ends in the story line being tied up, but it doesn't seem as fun to read as the rest of the series.After reading the book I found out why. If you read the authors notes you find out that Piers Anthony was tired of writing the series, and while he knew he had to write a final book to give the series an ending, he didn't want people constantly bugging him to start writing the series again (like what happened with his Xanth series.) Therefore he purposely made this book a less enjoyable read.Later inspiration struck and he continued the series with For Love of Evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish...","review":"After reading the first four books in this series, I picked up this one, thinking that I would enjoy it just as much.

This book is the worst of the lot. It goes on and on about this quest, following the exact same formula as in all the other books. The only thing that changes is the point of view depending on what character is highlighted.It's boring. It's a waste of time. The only good thing about this book (and all the rest) are the interesting concepts about Death, Time, Fate, War, Nature, Evil, and Good. The premise is okay, but the storytelling is awful.

She loves it and will stay asleep in it for as long as I have it on. It is also fairly easy to nurse in. The fabric is soft and washes well.

I love being able to hand my baby over to my husband(while still in the sling) without disturbing her. I am a Mom of two and it is nice to able to have the baby close to me while playing with my toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarey for babies","review":"The problem with this one was that my son's head kept falling into it and it would wrap around his face. We tried it a few times and each time he was terrified. Maybe we were doing it wrong but, if we were, they should have made it easier. However, if we were, then they designed this all wrong. Certainly not for a tall baby and possibly not for any other infants."},{"rating":"1","title":"RECALLED DUE TO INFANT DEATHS!","review":"Please note that this carrier is UNSAFE and has been recalled by Infantino. They no longer make or sell this product because several infants died in it. These types of baby carriers - bag style with a deep pouch are very unsafe. Please do not purchase this product. There are much better user-friendly and safe baby carriers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for nursing","review":"I bought this carrier strictly for the purpose of nursing on the go. As the box itself advertises. However, even with a 9 lb baby I could not get her positioned inside to nurse and be in the sling at the same time. It is too deep for nursing and the sling is too hot for my baby to ride in in 60 degree weather. I returned this sling after two weeks of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I bought this before my son was born. He hated it. He screamed each time i put him in it. This sling seemed to swallow him up. His head seemed too far up yet there was alot of room towards his feet. I think if they redesigned this sling with the straps down just a few more inches, it would be great. Hear that Infantino???? REDESIGN THE SLING!!!!!!The pros: Really easy to use.It was easy to carry.I ended up giving this away to a friend ang bought myself a ring sling which I found worked better for me and baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for newborns","review":"I bought the Sling Rider because I wanted a sling that will allow me to carry my 6wk old close, yet keeps her warm and maintain eye contact. It is stylish and easy to use too. I am pleased that the Sling Rider allows me to do all these. The downside is that the fabric stretches a fair bit, so baby 'sinks' and I have to constantly readjust. I find that this gets worst as baby gets heavier. Also, the angle that the baby is lying in cannot be described as ergonomic, though my baby didn't complain. I think this will be better for newborns who are lightweight and 'fragile' and since there is no need to pull and tug like many conventional slings, the Sling Rider will still be my choice. Wish I had bought it earlier though and can get more use out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was hoping to be able to put my daughter in it and have two hands free to get something done. She had colic and wanted to be held all the time, basically in that position. It just seemed like she was too big for it. Her head just gets lost in it and she hates it. She is only 9 weeks old now and I thought I would get some use out of it for a few months. But she just won't tolerate it! It was almost as if she was going to sufficate in it the way her head was in it. It has a piece of material in it that you velcro and strap them in so that they don't fall out or move. It seems like that piece needed to move down in order to give her head some room. It just didn't work for us and I don't see how it would work for anyone else, unless they only want to use it for the first 4 weeks or so while the baby is still very small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is my baby being squished in here?","review":"We tried to put our 22\\" 9.5lb baby in this sling. We strapped her bottom into the little holder and my wife slung it over her shoulder. Unfortunately, this sling seems to crunch our baby in on herself so her nose is practically touching her chest. It can't be a good position for keeping a nice open airway. I don't get how anyone can use this thing without their baby being folded in half."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!","review":"Overall this sling is working out well. My daughter is 8 weeks old, but was born premature and is still just under 6 pounds. We've been using it for a week and she loves it. She sleeps very soundly and I love carrying her in it. It is great for keeping her shielded from people when out in stores etc. The negatives are: her head turns to one side and she does feel warm on warmer days. But, she still sleeps well in the sling and doesn't seem to mind the warmth or head turning to one side! So, it must make her feel very secure and I think that's a big plus. I haven't used it for breastfeeding as it does seem to hang too low (I'm 5'8\\"), but as a sling to carry her around it I'd say so far so good. Also, no problems with soreness in my shoulders, but my baby is small so we;ll see if that changes in a couple months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Newborns in Cold Weather Only!","review":"Having received both a Snugli and a Sling, I wasn't sure which one to keep so I tried them both out. Unfornunately this didn't live up to my expectations. Its uncomfortable after about 8 pounds and is awkward for my baby. Her head falls to one side & she sweats profusely in it in just a diaper. The strap doesn't give you any support, constantly slipping down and its impossible to do anything like work around the house or take a long distance walk. The snugli was much better for that, although its harder to get the baby in and out, especially while sleeping. She did fall asleep immediately in it but woke up when she got too hot about an hour later."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe","review":"A baby recently (Spring 2009) died of asphyxia in this sling.

This was the first sling I used, and I first put my son in it at 10 days old. I did like the \\"swaddle\\" feature, I felt like at least he wouldn't fall out of it. But, the sling wasn't at all comfy for a post-partum mom. It also wasn't that well-designed, and I agree about having the wrong ratio of room at the top of the head. I felt like he was at an awkward angle, and nursing in this thing sucked big time. I eventually gave up on this thing LONG before the weight limit. It was too shallow to do a tummy-to-tummy or a \\"buddha\\" carry, and the shoulder is completely uncomfortable.I graduated to a Moby Wrap at about 3 months old, and to ring slings at around 4 months old, and then at around 8 months old, to Hotsling pouch slings.I can't imagine a 20 pound baby in this thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this sling!","review":"I purchased this sling earlier this week for use with my 5 week old daughter. She is 22\\" long and appx. 10.5 lbs. I have only had it for a few days, but I am in love with it! My daughter is perfectly cozy and content when she is in the sling. She has fallen asleep in it twice. And it is comfortable for both my husband and me to use.Best of all, it's not complicated or difficult to put on like the Snugli we had been using.This sling has a 20 lb. weight limit. To be honest, I think our daughter will grow out of it lengthwise before she hits 20 lbs., but even if we could only use it for another week I'd consider it worth the $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me...","review":"Love the look and concept of this product, however it didn't work for us. Katie is 3 1/2 mos old and weighs 12 lbs and is too big for this. Manufacturer states this is for newborns up to 20 lbs. Katie was too squished up inside to be comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for small babies and small moms","review":"I bought this sling and the ultimate baby wrap to see which one my baby and I liked better. The answer is neither. I am 5'6\\" and around 130 lbs, my daughter is 21\\" and about 7.5 lbs. It is easy to wear, but she sank so far within the sling she couldn't see out and this made for a very unhappy baby. Also, I had to adjust the buckle all the way to one side so that I wasn't kicking my baby as I walked, which left a long strap hanging down my back. I liked the design and pattern, but it just wasn't working for either of us, so I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lesser Life is Thought Provoking but the economic policy will not work","review":"I read this book over twenty years ago but I still remember its arguments that Western European governments, whether \\"socialistic\\" or \\"conservative\\", made social investments in the raising of the children.

It's all government programs to pay your rent, bills, tuition, etc. I'd split the cost with a few friends and take turns reading it. Even used, this isn't a big bargain.

I expected to find out about things offered to people who did not fit this type of profile, but who might be able to acquire government grants or money through programs not known to the general public. Everyone knows about the programs offered in this book, or can easily find out about them through their local government offices. I was glad I did not pay the full $30 + price at a book store for this book. I would really have been upset. The only thing that might be useful to me specifically is college money for my daughter, who has already graduated with a Bach. of Science degree, but who may have to go back and take some additional classes in order to get her teacher's certification.

Thank God I at least checked mine out from the library. Seriously folks if the government was just giving away money we'd all be millionaires. That being said it still doesn't justify the authors tailoring this reference in such a misleading way. Using human greed to feed one's own greed...how ironic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book!","review":"This is a good book for people that need help. If you don't need monetary help and are just lazy and want to get money for free, this book isn't for you.The people before me who wrote before me for some reason believed this book is just a way to get free money from the government, even if you don't need it. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BOOK IS!!!If you are low-income, elderly or sick, or know someone who is, this book is great. If you are just lazy, and think you are just going to bleed money out of the government, don't get it, you don't need it.This is for people who need help, not for people who want free money.I suggest getting this if you need the help."},{"rating":"1","title":"free money","review":"this purcase was a waste of time and money.

Don't even pick this up used at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling It A Day","review":"Question: What is Genesis without Phil Collins or Peter Gabriel? Answer: Not much. After listening to this CD, you'll ask yourself: where did the time go? None of the songs on this CD grabs. A better CD might be Tony Banks' Strictly Inc. (1995). Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford should move on with their (solo) lives.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"And then there were none...","review":"There were several fatal errors that Genesis took that cause their near-demise: First, they waited too long between albums (excluding 'The Way We Walk', there was a 6 year gap between 'We Can't Dance' and 'Calling All Stations', so some fans were bound to give up or forget the band. Second. Phil Collins quit the band, there goes the killer drumming and vocals. Third, Tony & Mike hire some no-name singer named Ray Wilson (only Fred Durst is a more lousier singer). The music isn't that bad, but even Tony's voice would of been better than Ray's. Then there were times when I wonder, why didn't Tony hire a singer from his previous solo albums? I mean, Fish or Jayney Klimek would've been perfect for the music heard on this CD. It's just screaming out their names! Only Congo was the only decent song on this CD, but this album is not worth your time. First time Genesis listeners don't be deceived, because NONE of their other albums sound like this garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, old boys, without Phil you're not Genesis anymore","review":"Well, that pretty much says it all. It is no surprise that this album hasn't sold or been played at all. It lacks emotion and the lyrics are hard and awkward to go with."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very atmospheric album","review":"I really wanted to write a review to comment on one song in particularly. What a sublime song 'Uncertain Weather' is. Beautiful, ethereal harmonies and soaring choruses. A lovely track. Easily amongst the best Genesis have ever done. But the album generally is great. Nice synths that I think add to the mood, you don't need complex synth noodling to make a good track. I also really like 'Alien Afternoon', with the atmospheric fade out. 'Shipwrecked' also has an ambient feeling. Generally, this is a really great album, and Ray Wilson suits the music well. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine recording from Tony & Mike","review":"I think there are some beautiful songs on this cd..Fantastic keyboard playing by Tony( as usual)..beautiful chords...And Mike does a great job as well..The vocialist has a pleasant voice and the material is very nice.It's not the Genesis Material we are used to hearing..But I listen to it and it makes me feel good.It does not have a Peter or Phil fill to it...but I like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried...I really did","review":"Lets start with the inevitable...this album is a piece of junk. It has been said in other reviews...but with Gabriel, Hackett and now even Collins gone...the chemistry just ISN'T there any more.

Maybe it was ahead of its time or something.None of that...\\"Calling All Stations' is Genesis without energy, creativity and sounding in each and every song as if they don't know where they are going to end. Pointless, directionless album.*deep sigh*The songs are just recorded a few BPMs too slow...the voice sounds so damned unsure of itself...pfff...So much obviously WRONG with this album...I wonder where all that experience Banks and Rutherford MUST have gained over all those years of working together with great musicians has gone.Exit...Genesis...may she rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHIL, PLEASE COME BACK","review":"Ok, i am a diehard GENESIS fan, whatever ever they do, however they grow, i can take it, pre-Collins Genesis & post-Collins alike. I am more disapointed that Genesis called it quits after this than i am that phil left. I LOVED PHIL IN GENESIS, but Ray Wilson is ok, i guess they figured that support in England meant nothing if they didn't have America, so they quit. When Peter left, they said, \\"we are still good, let's continue\\" but i guess now they've got enough money so they don't have to go on, a shame. Now as for the songs, Wilson's voice is good, and so are the drums. The best songs to me are the title track, Dividing Line, Not About Us, (the Hold On My Heart copy:) If That's What You Need, Congo,Shipwrecked and Small Talk (despite it's annoying parts) I guess if Genesis won't carry on with Ray Wilson, will Phil please come back?also receommended:Genesis: We Can't DanceGenesis: Seconds Out (almost a \\"hits live\\" at that point)Genesis: Lamb Lies Down On BroadwayGenesis: Live"},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone who really likes it","review":"I was getting tired of Phil Collins and his voice, so hearing Ray Wilson was refreshing. I thought his voice worked very well with the seemingly complex arrangements. I was also getting tired of the \\"pop\\" Genesis, and I enjoy longer arranged progressive compositions. I also happen to be a big fan of Tony Banks and his very nice chord progressions which are hard to find elsewhere. I also appreciated the fine drumming which ranges from solid to extraordinary (I am a drummer). Finally, I find most of the lyrics to be truly thought provoking.So there are many who don't like this CD, and some that do. I am one of the latter. My only complaints would be the fade-outs of the first 2 tracks. I believe this decision was to be poor judgment. Also, the song \\"Shipwrecked\\" can get on my nerves. I guess I find it too simplistic sounding.....unless of course my girlfriend dumps me, then I'll probably like it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"CALLING ALL STATIONS","review":"this album is good, but not genesis's best. different than \\"invisible touch\\" and \\"we can't dance\\". i was going to see them in concert but they canceled the tour in North America because of poor sales of this album. it would of been cool to see them. overall, buy this album if you can find it. one of the best of 1997."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil would make these songs sound fantastic.","review":"I love Genesis. I think their best work to date is Duke, which is an awe-inspiring masterpiece. Calling All Stations is a great album, except for that dreadful Ray Wilson. He sounds really bad compared to Phil. He's clearly not the right guy to replace a singer as good as Mr. Collins (then again, I can't think of anyone replacing him, except maybe Peter...).The songs are (mostly) really good, but Ray doesn't do them justice. Just imagine Phil singing these songs. Man, they would rock! OK, I admit some of the songs aren't that great (Not About Us and Small Talk for example) but there are real classics in there as well (One Man's Fool, Alien Afternoon and The Dividing Line).Tony and Mike are great songwriters together, but I really hope Phil decides to return to regroup the greatest songwiter-trio of all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This album is okay.I bought it September of last year and I really got bored of it.But all the songs are pretty good.I never listened to any of their older music,but for middle aged rockers,they still kick @$$.I was hoping that more people would notice this album.Genesis is a legendary band and this is a good effort,and i think it deserved a LOT more attention than it got.I just hope the next one goes multi-platinum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Mike and Tony a Chance","review":"Well, they're not art-rock anymor. Not even that pop hurricane. But this album is very good. How many bands on the road today can wrtie such powerfull songs as title-track and There Must Be Some Other Way? Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks wrote most of the hits in Genesis history. Phil Collins said that. Let's wait for the next album. And let's see if some of the new stars that music media invents every year will be writting nice songs and selling 2 million copies in the next 30 days. Mauricio Noriega"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely nothing to do with quality Genesis","review":"In the late 70's, Genesis stagnated as an art-rock band, due to the fact that they had pretty much run out of truly creative ideas in that direction. So they slowly turned their course in a more 'pop' direction. They had some successes in that area (particularly the eponymous '83 album) but ultimately stagnated as a pop band due to, once again, running out of creative ideas.So, naturally of course, Genesis decided that the best thing to do would be to make a half-pop/half-prog album. One problem - THEY HAD RUN OUT OF GOOD IDEAS IN BOTH DEPARTMENTS. Every musical element of this album, both pop and progressive, had been previously cliched into the ground. And the lyrics and singing ... oh man, WHERE did they find Ray Wilson? He's a _horrid_ singer. And when you combine psuedo-intelligent pretentious lyrics with singing that's totally unable to make them come to life in any way, you have an unprecedented disaster.1 star is far too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"I've never thought Phil Collins was the most important member of Genesis, but that doesn't mean this post-Phil effort is worth much. Anyone who listens to it objectively has to be disappointed. There is a smattering of pretty good songs, but overall this is not worth your time. No true Genesis fan could possibly give this five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a new bloke","review":"How in the world Tony and Mike could choose Ray Wilson for vocals is beyond my wildest imagination. He simply cannot sing. Shipwrecked should have been the name of this CD. I have been following Genesis since Foxtrot and was amazed that Phil could take over for Peter. Each is different, each is alike, and each sound very good. I plead with these guys to get someone who can bring it back again or this could be it. As you listen to this CD it just keeps getting worse and I have tried to like it. The first 3 songs are fair and after that nothing. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound,poor content","review":"Shortly: this album has awsome sounds, awsome guitars, awsome voice.But that's all. The content of songs is empty. What's worse, I think, this is a love-songs album. Each third word is \\"you\\". The songs are basically about how the singer is willing to be a little puppy, just to get her back. The content of songs is very intime--i hardly can imagine,that anybody will listen to this on a daily basis. I can't imagine, how could these songs be delivered on a big concert.They are simply very deppressive,sad...and just empty,the singer sings them,like he has no soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shame","review":"This CD isn't horrible.

Unless...Phil, will you rejoin Genesis?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Recording Highest Recomendation!","review":"What a great recording. The only reason I purchased it was the fact that I have owned every Genesis recording except this one and it was priced at $12.99 at Circuit City for the dual disk version with a 5.1 mix. What a revelation! The people who say that the drumming is even better than Phil Collins are correct! The songwriting has never been better. What a shame I waited 12 years after this came out to pick it up. Tony Banks keyboard layers are wonderful and Mike Rutherford's guitar playing is tight and in the pocket. Ray Wilson's vocals are magnificent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling Where?","review":"For Genesis, trying to press on without Phil Collins was a complete disaster. When you have a incredible singer at the top of his game, replacing him can be a very difficult gesture. In this case, it became a complete bomb. When Ray Wilson stepped in to Phil Collins' shoes, it became a lot more difficult then it seemed to be, and it was ever just as hard.The 1997 album, Calling All Stations, was the first Genesis collection, without Phil Collins in the spotlight. Although the album has had one credible song, Congo, which remains as the only song worth listening to, the rest of the album was a flop. Unfortunately, it was the final album Genesis made in their entire career.Although Genesis reunited for the Turn It On Again Greatest Hits collection in 1999, many people are still hoping that Phil Collins, Mike Ruterford, and Tony Banks can make great music someday. Instead of getting this album, I suggest you buy We Can't Dance, or Invisible Touch over this anyway you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"Older sounding GENESIS? Hardly!

Wilson's voice is fantastic. He performs with more power and range than Phil or Peter ever had - and believe me, I do love both Phil and Peter. I deeply regret that the North American leg of the CAS tour was cancelled because I would love to have heard Ray perform these tracks and Genesis classics live. I've had to settle for bootlegs of the European tour plus Ray's own Live and Acoustic CD which was a follow up to his Cut album. It is also a shame that Tony and Mike didn't give Ray a chance to prove himself as a song writer by producing a follow-up album to CAS. Check out Ray's new album Change to see what Genesis fans are missing! CAS is a fabulous addition to the Genesis canon with powerful songs like: The Dividing Line, Small Talk, One Man's Fool, Alien Afternoon, and Uncertain Weather. Buy this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"This is one of the greatest albums released by Genesis, and it's not getting the attention it deserves.

I think the band is sounding better without Collins, although he is a good singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Genesis Is Born!","review":"OK. That's it. No more Gabriel, no more Collins. Now it's just the real Genesis songwriting core: Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford. No more happy-light-radio-friendly non-sense. An album as important as Foxtrot. Ray Wilson stands as Genesis ultimate vocalist, and maybe one of rock's finest: he just seem to get any note, without effort! Finally, a comeback to melodies. It's not a five-star just because of two songs: 'If That's What You Need', and 'Small Talk', which are completely superficial. Buy it and listen it carefully, maybe it's not big deal at first hearing, but the same happens with the old stuff. Genesis is back, we just need Hackett again: Rutherford, shut up 'n play bass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Album","review":"Calling All Stations is a good album, if perhaps not a great one. I'm not going to say it stank, but I'm not going to say it was up there with Genesis's best either. When I first heard it, I thought \\"This doesn't sound much like the Genesis I knew\\", even the Genesis of We Can't Dance or Invisible Touch. However, Ray Wilson has a good voice (which sounds really nothing like Phil's or Peter's) and the songs are decent. The first six tracks are the best in my opinion, with the best songs probably being the title track and \\"Not About Us\\". The thing I miss most about this album, though, is not Phil's voice, but his drumming. His charictaristic drumming style has been a central part of Genesis since Nursery Cryme and it is sad not to see it here. All in all, 3.5 to 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great time for a tax write-off","review":"Best thing to do with this is give it to charity and take the donation off your 1040.

CAS is an album to be listened years and yars. Neither classic not revolutionaire, but just a good album, with three or four great pop songs like title song, Not About Us, There Must Be Some Other Way. Genesis still has some fuel to burn. To whom doubt it, try to listen to the third single from CAS, Not About Us. Sign Your Life Away and Run Out of Time are songs that proves that Tony and Mike deserve respect in pop music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you think","review":"I did not buy the album until almost a full year after its release. The newspaper reviews said it was awful. In the records store I would make sure no one was close by when I browsed through the Genesis CDs. I was embarassed. One day I bough a used copy of the album. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It's not anywhere near their best album, but it's pretty good. There's alot of original musical passages, Ray Wilson is a fine singer, althoug he sounds exactly like the lead vocalist from a Canadian group called Honeymoon Suite. Genesis is a band that does not release shit. All their albums are of high quality with the band giving 100 percent. Calling All Stations is a fine example. Unfortunately record reviewers who know nothing about music, listened to it once ruined an opportunity for North Americans to see the band live."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Must Be Some Misunderstanding","review":"This CD hits rock bottom.

I am one of those that was a major Phil Collins fan, yet didn't feel that Phil Collins WAS Genesis. I still don't. Tony Banks can sing. Mike Rutherford can sing. They don't have hard rock voices, but they can sing. They didn't need Ray Wilson. I have not heard the entire album. All I had to hear was the Wilson live version of \\"Turn It On Again\\" to turn it off and never turn it on ever again. Ray Wilson's vocals are so horible, why would anyone want to listen to this. No wonder it was the demise of Genesis. I don't think that they need to bring Phil back per se... just have faith in themselves and do it. Bring in someone from the Prog rock days maybe. Until then, I can't bare to listen to this Wilson Genesis again. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"A die hard dedicated Genesis fan, including the members solo works, I find the album a total disappointment and virtually unplayable.With thousands or more highly talented singers to choose from they selected probably the worst possible new lead singer.

His limited, monotonous range is annoying at the least.How about the lead singer for Mike and the Mechanics for example ? Anyone but Ray Wilson !What were they thinking ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"This was suppose to be Genesis's delve back into serious music from the 70's. You'd never know it from this album. They should have at least tried to get someone who was in the Gabriel / Collins vocal range. And the music is downright vile.

It sounds to me like its either some stuff that they left on the cutting floor from \\"We Cant Dance\\" or maybe some Mike and Mechanic's retreads. I'm certainly not in love with Phil Collins, in fact when I heard he was leaving and they would be getting a new vocalist, I looked forward to hearing the new sound. I don't have a problem at all with Ray Wilson, I think he sounds somewhat like Paul Carrack, its just the material did not do it for me. I do hope however that the band will continue. I'm willing to give their next CD a chance. Even had I liked the new album, I wouldn't have heard it anyway for this market refuses to give new releases by the prog rock bands any airplay To most people in this town, Lynard Skynard is progressive enough, one would think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah well, maybe they can go back to their solo careers now...","review":"I've been a fan of Genesis as long as I remember...I grew up listening to my brother playing their albums over and over and over...and I would have to say this is my least favorite of any album they have ever done. It's not just the loss of Phil...I've enjoyed both Tony and Mike's solo efforts, so that is not the problem. It's just too overdone...almost a desperate attempt to show they can do *serious* music without him, and it just doesn't work.

Maps and drawings are great; cutways of castles and homes very interesting; sections on history and culture excellent. The book divides Scotland into geographical regions, describing the climate and terrain of each, the highlights of the area, sites to see; even walking or touring maps to follow. Perfect for an overview of the country as a whole, and if you are planning to travel there, use this book to narrow down the parts of the country you want to visit and then get more specific information on them.Hard to believe there is this much good information in a 200 page book.

Of course she might be a murderer.Far from hardboiled, Fonesca doesn't like guns and isn't likely to shine brightest in a fight. He makes his first appearance in a well-plotted story with almost as many surprises as murders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Adequate Audio Version","review":"I love Kaminsky's hangdog, uber-depressed Lew Fonseca...he's Columbo on Prozac.

Lew left Chicago after his wife died and ended up down in Sarasota, on the seedy side of town, depressed and aimless. The series reveals, via Lew's acquisition of friends, clients, enemies and casual acqaintences, his return to a meaningful life. He finds a way to make his expenses, a woman to date, an affordable shrink, and a means of combatting his depression and grief. He takes cases that turn into murder mysteries and he triumphs over evil. I like this fella quite a bit. I have now read the first three novels in the series and will start the fourth, \\"Denial\\", in a day or two. If you like author Kaminsky's other series, or you enjoy Robert B.

For those willing to see a common thread in all religions, it reminds one of Jesus' instruction to become like a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but...","review":"This book was okay but might be a little too confusing for the average child (and maybe the average adult!). I appreciate the idea that there is a 'light' within us as people and in nature and in all living things but when the child sees the 'light' in a bar of chocolate and in a teddy bear??? I thought the idea was taken too far. Then I started getting confused about what she meant by the 'light' within us all because that light, as I imagine it, would NOT be found in inanimate objects.I normally love books like this and am very fond of the idea that we are all part of nature- all connected- but I really don't think this books does anything but jumble and confuse that idea.The drawings are average- not particularly breath-taking.All in all I don't think I'd read this book again or recommend it but I applaud the author for trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The artwork is lovely but.......","review":"I am just sorry.

The sound of the standard cd was horrible! So I decided to take a chance on this new remastering. Believe me when I say that this is NOT an attempt to re-issue back catalog for the purpose of making more money. Not only was this version remastered with new 24-bit technology, but, it is also HDCD encoded! If you've never heard HDCD discs, you don't know what you're missing! The original cd of Lark's Tongues sounded like the music was recorded with pillows over the mics! This new remastering removes the pillows, and I'm hearing things I've never heard before (vocals in Lark's Tongues Part 1!). I rated this at 4 stars only because the original recording is not the best, but this is by far the best sounding Lark's Tongues yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"lossless\\" content is lossy :(","review":"sadly, spectral analysis shows that all the 24-bit 96kHz content on the blu-ray (from the maximum-$$ edition) is upsampled from 48kHz. this includes the remixes, the original mix, the bonus tracks, and the 'keep that one nick' sessions. ditto the \\"lossless\\" hi rez content on the dvd. ditto the \\"lossless\\" hi-rez content on all the other 40th anniversary kc releases. bummer! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Exiles in search of a style","review":"Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Part One/Part Two...very good 2 part trackBook Of Saturday - Crimsos attempt at the mainstreamExiles - The Mellotron is backEasy Money - poor mix on otherwise good songThe Talking Drum - same as easy money, the mix is inaudible until the last few minutesAll the experimental household gadget percussion, garbage can gongs and swinging motorcycle chains courtesy of short-lived member Jamie Muir.

For such a dramatic and action packed drama, little of those emotions came through in this story. What bothered me most about this book was the incredible amount of information that I had to wade through to get to the real story. Certain parts of the book go on and on about events from character's lives who are not a significant part of the story. I'm no expert, but I believe if a good editor would have gone through the book and cut out all of which wasn't necessary to the story then it would have been a better book. I can normally read a good true crime book in 1-5 days, but this one took me forever and I found myself skipping pages.

I have had a long history of picking out a lot of Mr. Wrongs, but this guy goes above and beyond any woman's worst fears! Narcissism, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, lack of empathy, lack of compassion, selfishness, and draining his victims on every level, it's hard to see what anyone could find attractive about him. It's easy to say when you have all the facts, though. As for all those women and his children, not having seen it coming, they have my sympathies. This man isn't insane; he's pure evil, and he deserves the death penalty!

I felt like I had been cheated and would have preferred the story to be told to the reader in the very same fashion as it unfolded to every person related to the crime including the author. The old cliches, \\"And this was the last time...., it was the most important case of her life..., never again would she......\\" Come on, what's the point here? Give the reader some credit, we can read between the lines. And let us have the opportunity to make up our own minds about character flaws and as to how that motivates a person to murder.

As Cunningham lives more and more by the lie of this persona, in his private life, especially with his girlfriends, wives, and children, he becomes incrementally more and more autocratic. Rule diligently chroncicles the descent of Bradley Cunningham into hell, a hell where fair is foul and foul is fair, and chroncles the lives of the women he seduces into his nightmare. The book climaxes when Cunningham is put on trial for murdering Cheryl Keeton, and we see that when as fine a vision as the American Dream goes beserk in the imagination of Bradley Cunningham, he won't be satisfied until he brings down American Justice along with it. It's a compelling and very disturbing true crime story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality and Service Disaster","review":"Purchased \\"demo\\" machine directly from SAECO as they are in Annapolis, close to my DC area location.

MOre recently the water simply didn't pump through, not because of scaling, but apparently because the pump had given out.

Luckily it was under warranty, although I had to negotiate with Saeco to actually get it fixed under warranty. It cost $50 to send it back and another $40 for a temp espresso machine for my husbands espresso addiction. We got it back and one month later it quit working again.

It grinds, compresses and dispenses the espresso automatically and the frother has the milk steamed in about half the time of our old machine. The Saeco machine is easy to clean and my husband loves to make the coffee in the morning now. I have had no difficulty with this machine at all.

A great job by Firoozeh Dumas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Point of View","review":"I found Firoozeh Dumas' memoir very insightful in the fact that it shed light on an immigrant's perspective of the United States and how Muslims are treated. There are so many funny instances where the language and cultural barrier literally make you laugh out loud. Other times, it is saddening to read about the injustice of how Muslims and minority people are treated by Americans.

Most of them are pretty screwed up and I like that, but there are a few out there that are funny and/or heartwarming. This book was both. It had short stories that centered around her father, whom you can tell she has nothing but love for. Oh, it's not always all that flattering, but real life seldom is, is it? I thought it was funny, real, and endearing.I was surprised at looking at others thoughts that they felt the author was being down on her parents. I didn't read that at all. I felt like she was laughing with them, not at them. Because you know, even the serious stories in here, the author and her family always found a way to laugh. I think too many people take things too seriously and laughter sometimes really is the best medicine.Give this one a read before judging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Students love reading this book","review":"Recently we had our middle school and high school students read Funny in Farsi.

My poor husband had to deal with me reading, \\"...just one more part...\\" to him, late into the night.Though my grasp of Farsi is limited to greetings, as an Egyptian growing up in L.A. in the early 80s, I could not believe how wonderfully, comically, and sometimes poignantly F.D. captured my experience. Even my in-laws who hail from Uganda saw themselves in this book!Whether you are an Easterner looking to find a story you can finally relate to (instead of always imagining that your name is Christie and your family came on the Mayflower) or someone who wants a glimpse into the life of \\"brown folks\\" (who are sometimes whiter than a fish's underbelly :)) this book is a must-read.And to Dumas' father Kazim...if you are reading these reviews... you MADE the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"breaking down barriers","review":"As a child of immigrant parents and a mother of 3 U.S. born children, I could relate to Firoozeh Dumas' experiences in both capacities, as child and parent. As I was growing up in Downey/Pico Rivera, about 5 miles away from Whittier,California I shared almost the identical issues she faced and swore, \\"I'm going to be a hip parent when i grow up.\\" But I found, as we grow, our natural instinct as parents to protect and nurture our children overtake the whole idea of trying to be cool. In most cases, we try to retain the cultures and practices of our homeland to instill in them the important values as part of their identity. This book serves as the perfect reminder to immigrant parents of things Not To Do regardless of \\"meaning well\\". It breaks down the barriers not just between the middle east and the wild west by sharing our commonalities, but between the generation gap between parent and child in a fashion that carries a bigger message, be proud of who you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Funny Book For All Ages","review":"I am a sophomore in high school and read this book for you world literature project. the book was very enjoyable.

The author appeared at my campus in March of 2006 and was a big hit at a classroom visit of ESL students (students from around the globe) who related to Firoozeh's stories of her Iranian family assimilating into our culture. At a talk to the campus community, she won new fans who appreciated her hilarious anecdotes from Funny in Farsi and her rich humanity of spirit.

Her several trips to the US began during an era when most Americans, apparently, didn't quite know where Iran was, exactly. This was quickly followed by the Shah's downfall, the hostage crisis, and the whole Islamic conservative movement. She see her native country through Americanized eyes - and the US through Middle-Eastern eyes - and sees the humor and pathos in both. Dumas manages to make light of the suffering and financial downturns her family experienced during those years - and to emerge prouder still of her father's resilience and determination to provide well for his family. And through it all runs a profound appreciation for her family, for America, and for Iran."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Shallow meets Pen","review":"I could not handle Ms. Dumas book. She uses repetitively \\"don't get me wrong\\". She jumps from one subject to another with very little background explanation: suddenly, we find her in France bathing in the MED. She brings an idea up, but never expands on it. For instance, she decides not to change her name, and her only reason because the day she wanted to change her name a friend with the same name came to visit her. Don't get me wrong, there are thousands names in the English language for girls that she could have chosen.As an emigrant to the US, I thought she will bring some insight about what she learned here, and what makes both cultures different. Unfortunately, one learn about this culture and her culture, and her writing makes her look shallow, in spite of a her graduating Cum Laude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endearingly funny and human","review":"I found this book to be an enchanting entree into the world of the immigrant experience.Firoozeh Dumas uses her wit to cleverly draw the reader into her family life and shareswith us a viewpoint that most of us don't have, and those who do will probably find someidentitification with her experiences. Overall I think the book shows how humanity is the same;we all have the same issues, the same kinds of people in our families and our life and welaugh at the same things. Also,that through humor and friendship we can overcome old resentments in the US and develop a true understanding of the Persian people that is separate from their government (just asAmerican people are separate from their government).Definitely a good read and I would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!","review":"I thought the book was great, as did my 13 year old son.

If you're a fan of Ed Fowler, you may appreciate this compilation of previous articles for a magazine. As a person interested in knives, I was more interested in learning about different materials, hardness scales, knife functions, styles of knives, and the like. This book does not address those issues. I don't care to learn how to skin a rattlesnake, buy dying sheep for their horns, and I'm not interested in Ed Fowler's dating and subsequent marriage. I didn't expect to get story (with no instructions) about knife sharpening. All in all, the book was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade articles in book form","review":"Ed Fowler is a advocate of the triple quench. This has no scientific basis.

Combining the classical style of Segovia with some Chet Atkins fingerpicking and a jazzy dose of Django Reinhardt, Steve Howe never fails to impress the listener with his absolute mastery of the instrument.

In 2002, Money prompts you to log into your service provider everytime you record a payment. It requires multiple clicks and dealing with a succession of annoying pop-up windows to continue.

It also linked the pre-tax contributions to my 401k on my paycheck with my Money 401k account. Another improvement is that you can set a time schedule for when you want Money to download your account statements.

The sound - as virtually everyone has stated - is pathetic. There's barely any chance of distinguishing what is making each sound. I did find that each concert CD can be greatly improved with a good equalizer. So if I can do that, why didn't the producers? Save your money and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, this is lousy....","review":"but if you're really desperate for the original line-up, blow your money on it. Live at Nottingham is better (no Steve Howe) & Asia in Moscow (again, no Howe) are better. Even the Live in Hyogo is of better quality. Do you really want to hear Heat of the Moment 3 different times in one box set? You can't find the Moscow concert anywhere except for a 2-disc set called The Asia Story, it's got one disc w/Wetton solo material & the Moscow concert on the other.

Yet another \\"officially sanctioned\\" Asia live recording that cuts into the first number. PATHETIC.

Awesoome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaska Adventure to the MAX","review":"In this third book in the Taylor Morgan series, the plot really heats up. These tales of high flying in the Alaska Bush are Megan Rust's forte, and she paints a series of twists and turns into numerous harrowing medivac flights. And all of that wrapped into a tricky, and suspenseful murder mystery. Having actually flown all over Alaska for 25 years myself, I can vouch for the authentic feel to the entire story. It really had me sweating in the pilots seat! A Great Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless!","review":"Being interested in Alaska and being a pilot myself, I have given Ms. Rust every benefit of the doubt, and struggled through her previous two books to the bitter end; on this one I finally gave up about a third into the book. The setting is nicely done, and Ms. Rust's expertise in aviation shows, but unfortunately, she just can't write well. Her heroine comes across as a complete twit, and the reader feels trapped in a bad Scoobie-Doo episode without any of the humor: \\"Gee, what a dandy mystery! Let's go find some clues!\\"Thankfully, Dana Stabenow in her Liam Campbell mysteries came up with a female pilot with some character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Stuff","review":"Much underappreciated, I wanna hear more from this guy.

There is no flow to the book and when you get interested in the idea of the book, Constance goes off on a tangent that takes you off the beaten path.

Even more fun when they have a new book for her to read them, especially when it's about Grandma and Tickling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"My main impression of this work by Becher is that it is far from to the point. The author strives towards assisting the reader in making their own decision, which as such is not a bad idea, but it results in the book missing an adequate structure. Time and time again the author gets lost in details, quotes, and footnotes, while the reader has no idea of the the bigger picture since that is not presented until much later. The practical application of the theme of the book (classification of academic disciplines - only twelve of them, by the way) does not come until the very end.If I'd recommend this book it would be for the lack of something better. For those enjoying a good, clear, to-the-point and enjoyable-to-read textbook this one would not be the right choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile Purchase","review":"More than just a one hit album, \\"I Wish\\" has enough pleasing and catchy tracks to merit a purchase. The production values are high, with some great backup vocals and instrumental work. In addition to \\"I Wish\\", \\"This Is How It Sounds\\" and \\"Crenshaw\\" are solid. Really, other than the last track, \\"I Wish (Street Mix Version)\\", this is an entertaining album across the board with some interesting turns of phrase. Skee Lo's lyrics move at a fast cadence but flow with the back tracks nicely and pause from time to time to permit room for the background singers to jump in smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I recently bought this CD after a friend told me it was great. I have to admit, I am not a big fan of rap. But as soon as I popped this into my player I realized it was more than the normal cursing rap it has been a mainstay for quite some time.

Buy this, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun and inoffensive, creative lyrics","review":"I prob. fall into the minority group that likes rap but does not like all the \\"foul\\" language and bragging of female abuse that frequently is found within. For that reason, I very much like this CD. Skee-lo showed considerable skill (in my opinion) in making a CD that contains funny and serious lyrics that don't rely on curse words, bragging about what woman he'll abuse, or who he's going to slay. And the beats are bumpin' so if you have a proper system, you'll love it and the public won't be able to hear their own thoughts. I can comfortably play this around my child and others without anyone being \\"offended\\". Too bad he didn't catch on with many folks, cause I haven't seen another release from him yet. Anyhow, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this cd was better","review":"I Wish is about the only good song on the CD. Everything else is just mediocre.

It's a very original movie all about love and money and our status-obsessed culture. I particularly liked the final seconds of the movie in which Timothy Busfield sums it all up with, 'There's no such thing as a free feeling.' You got that right!

I don't like Peets coffee or Starbucks and have found that Peets coffee does give the machine trouble, but goes away as long as you clean the machine (which I do on a weekly basis). Where I live we had a little coffee shop that I feel had the BEST coffee (Mr. Espresso), when it closed, I tried Peets, etc. Since, I have purchased Mr. Espresso coffee beans and have NO problems with my machine and feel that my espresso are consistant and almost as good as my old coffee shops.

I made roughly 20 shots per day on the weekends and about 4 per day during the week.The machine functioned well for a while, then after a few months the grinder began to go nuts. There is a small plastic flapper at the end of the grind chamber that is supposed to turn the grinder off when the grind chamber is full and trigger the machine to dump the grinds into the brew group. Sometimes the flapper performed and sometimes not. When the flapper didn't work the machine would continue to grind until one shut off the power or it ground up all of the beans in the hopper. Then a messy clean up was in order to remove all the grinds from the machine.I tried to remedy the condition as best as I could, then one day when the machine was about 10 months old I had enough. In the big green can it went.Loved the machine at first, ended up hating it. I will not travel the Saeco road again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ease of use, ease of use, ease of use!","review":"My girlfriend and her husband have this machine and loves it. My husband always wanted an expresso when at their home from this machine so I bought him one for Christmas. He absolutely love it. It is so easy to use, just a touch of a button.

I found F7 better with C. The Easy Fake Book makes some of the same compromises but seems better. In addition it provides an introduction to each song. I use the Ultimate Fake Book when I want to learn, the Easy Fake Book when I play for relaxation, and the First Fake Book seldom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn your brain!","review":"Fripp claimed at the time that he wanted to make a Beatles like album. That is, just as you can listen to a Beatles album and get something out of it on the twenty-fourth listen, he wanted to achieve the same with Lizard. The problem is a Beatles album is accessible on the first listen too, while Lizard certainly is not. And further, if you listen to this album twenty-four times, you WILL burn out your brain. It's too complex and clever for it's own good.However, the album does work on many levels. \\"Happy Family\\", a song about the Beatles, is very catchy. \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" is very mellow and quite beautiful. \\"Cirkus\\", one of my all time favorite Crimso songs, has a disturbing quality akin to the songs on 21st Century Schizoid Man. And finally, Jon Anderson's contribution to \\"Prince Rupert Awakes\\" is gorgeous, comparable in beauty to \\"Soon\\" in the \\"Gates of Delirium\\" (on Relayer).Be adventurous! Get this! You will be rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"The KC Black Sheep","review":"Now, I know I gave this 4 stars, but I am biased as a KC enthusiast. This is probably their worst album. Don't get me wrong, I like it; it's just that this doesn't seem to capture the spirit of the band as well as their previous or later work. I was truly looking forward to hearing Jon Anderson (I am also a YES fanatic), but was disappointed when I heard the song on which he is featured: he only sings backup vocals and is easy to miss. It is interesting to note that this was just a short time before Bill Bruford would leave YES to join KC.In short, if you are not a big KC fan, this won't be of much interest to you. But, if you can't get enough Frippisms (like me), then this will be a treat. You can't have a KC collection without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST CRIMSON ALBUM","review":"Don't bother. The only thing worth noting is the guest vocal on \\"Prince Rupert Awakes\\" is Jon Anderson of Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Crimson at their worst!","review":"My God, what is this? Certtainly not King Crimson! Or at least, not the King Crimson of Red, Discipline, In Court or Islands. Now, to do them justice, there is ONE really good piece in the album, the instrumental Bolero/The Peacock's Tale. The preceding vocal Prince Rupert Awakes, is not too bad, either. But apart of this, this album is a disaster. To see what I mean, all you have to do is play first samples from In Court, then play a bit from Lizard's first side and then play Red. You'll see how far behind Lizard is from those landmark albums, as well as from anything else King Crimson has done. In Court, Red and Islands all have an inernational, universal I should say, appeal: Their music is timeless. Lizard, on the other hand, presents a sample of overblown, pretentious, pseudo-progressive British music."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Crimson's Best album, nevermind what the critics say.","review":"From the naif cover to the music structure it's imho King Crimson's best album, I like this one most out of the other seven first ones ( I mean from the \\"Court\\" to \\"Red\\"-which are great on their own right) because its sounds hellish heavenly. The addition of horns gives the rock a melt of jazzy classicism. The second side suite \\"Lizard\\" is a masterpiece, that blends Anderson's singing and the woodwinds and brass, mostly the trombone plus the drumbeats and Fripp's strumming surrounded by the piano is unforgetable. There's an indescribable mood that transports you to a timeless sense of music thrilling. This second side largely pays the record price. I wonder if lofty Robert is aware of this masterpiece. However, not reccomended for easy-listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le meilleur du progressif","review":"Pour moi, ce disque rappelle le meilleur du début de l'époque du rock progressif, une de ses racines les plus profondes et originales à la fois, autant que le premier disque de King Crimson."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Hodge-Podge","review":"Fripp was still collaborating with Peter Sinfield. And Sinfield's lyrics here, as on the preceding albums, were unique and sometimes brilliant. They was keeping the name afloat, but hadn't yet found a permanent band - Fripp was doing a lot of the heavy lifting. The musicians he uses on this album fill their roles adequately with the possible exception of the drummer, who overplays a bit.The music - Side 1 sounds familiar to the contents of the band's first two albums. The most unique, and also the strongest of the tracks, is \\"Circus\\" which recaptures the first album's menace and foreboding.Side 2 is something new, a progression forward. Fripp writes a progressive-rock sounding \\"suite\\" with sweet melodies and space for an orchestra to contribute. The hooks are there are the piece works, though it could have been shorter. Jon Anderson sings on the piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXPERIMENTAL GEM","review":"This album is too much! In some areas there is quite a bit going on, and if you are musically adventurous that's exactly what you want! It has all the fixings of an early KC album like moog synth, horns, insane drums, and occasional heaviness. Pete Sinfield's lyrics are as lucid and great as ever. And for an album recorded in 1970 the sound quality is top notch. Anderson from Yes sings one of the songs and does a great job. Definitly on the top 5 KC album list."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASTONISHING","review":"Man.

It offers tons of modes to play in, with a vast array of levels. People who play the demo please listen: I must admit I played the demo at first ...), but trust me, the full game is SO MUCH more fun then the demo. The demo is half of level 1 in story mode; there is much more to the game than that. I have also played unreal'03 and compared the two. In my opinion, Timesplitters 2 is a much better buy. The only thing it lacks is no network capability, except the i.link cable. But other than that, it is a great game! A lot of people complain about the controls. Believe me: you will find the controls very easy after a little while, and come to realize that the comtrols for this game are the best choice for the PS2 controller.

It's the next best thingto the save anywhere feature.Normally, I don't get excited about the multiplayermode, but this game changed my ways. You can haveas many as 11 other bots to fight against and thereis no slow down time. There's a bunch of differentoptions to choose from and they're all downright fun.Any game that allows to configure your controllerthe way you want gets an automatic star to begin with.This is one of the few games I would give 5 stars to,if not 6 (5 being the best).

There is no blood though however(so sorry for the people who love gory games) but in its own ways it has some violence. Such as burning people alive, blowing them up, decapitation and jut shooting in general. The graphics are great(though the screenshots look terribe) and the audio is great with a unique sound for every gun and before i forget to mentin this, there is an AMAZING selection of characters and best of all, you have to unlock them so as you can see, there is more into this game than just the story mode with 9 or 10 levels but many arcade missions to play for weeks, months or even years to come. Unfortunately, edios didn't make it playable with broadband but maybe they may on the maybe TS3.One last thing BUY THIS GAME HOWEVER OLD IT IS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i link compatible!!","review":"Does anyone know that this game is i link compatible!?! does anyone even know or own an i link!?!? well i do and i can tell you that this connection: 2 copies of Timesplitters 2, 2 PS2s and 2 separate TVs , makes this game 6 stars!! I have read many reviews here, and not one mentioned the i link. That is by far the best multiplayer option. I absolutely hate being able to see my opponents screen and vice-versa. Maybe you've played HALO. Now I do believe HALO is a better game because of scope, music, vehicles and the ability to JUMP! But Timesplitters 2 is definitely a contender. My question is why aren't there more i link compatible games!?!??! The locales are excellent and the music fun.

I've never seen that on a console game system yet, so needless to say it impressed me.One of the things that didn't make this game one of the all time best was the fact that it wasn't worked on or thought out enough.

As soon as I got it I went to the single player and thought it was real hard because of the controls so I was a little dissapointed. After that I went to the multi player mode and got use to the controls and played some of the bots and the mapmaker mode.

I don't know how ride did to top their amazing Nowhere but they did. It opens with a bang (Leave Them All Behind) and closes with what I think is the 2nd best song of all-time (OX4). There are no fillers here, Mark Gardener's dreamy elegiac vocals, Andy Bell's angry guitar, Steve's dubby saturated bass and Loz's ubiquitous fills all coalesce into a record that truly stands the test of time. No fillers here though conservative listeners might want to be more keen on 'Twisterella' (a lovely toe-tappin' single). I know I am and never mind what the press said in '92, this is already one of the more revered albums of the decade.

Granted, this isn't ground-breaking music, but it is a very enjoyable album all the way through. Highlights are Leave Them All Behind, Twisterella, Time Of Her Time and Ox4.

It is a working person's strip, documenting the ups and downs of people who do the real work of the world. The work comes in many forms, from housework to childcare to fixing the faucet.Working people also play and what they do in the off- time, what little there sometimes is, is also a topic of the strip. Fishing is the sport of choice for pluggers, they tend to be a bit on the heavy side and see no need to change by engaging in physical activity.Pluggers is a comic strip that you can look at and see yourself in, coping with life as it is so extremely imaginative in presenting you with new challenges. If you have ever kept an old pair of shoes, pants or car, fixed things with duct tape or been frustrated by technology, this strip is for you.

Our mechanic said it was because we didn't use it enough and that the battery would drain itself. He was the one that suggested the BatterySaver solar charger to keep our battery charged while it was not in use. Amazon had exactly what we needed and it works great!

When I hooked it up my battery had enough juice to crank my car. 5 days later when I went to start the car again, the battery was totally dead. Even if it didn't work at all, my battery shouldn't have been totally dead. It was not hooked up backwards, and I live in Florida. It was sunny all week.

They also said it was going to cost $112 to repair the boiler unit (I paid $350 for the machine brand new). They were charging excessive rates for labor, shipping, and labor to package for shipping.

In combination with the conducting stainless steel body this could have in fact been my strongest and final espresso. Other parts feel loose, e.g. the dial. Edges of the steel body are very sharp. I strongly discourage you from buying this item especially with this price tag. I bought a Krups 2300 plus instead. Also nice design, extremely solid make, quick heating, easy to use, superb extraction with crema, good frothing and cheaper than Saeco.

These are more convenient to roll up and store than the prior ones that fold up because of the roll up package so they help break camp quickly. They blow up quickly too, with the proper pump.One of the two developed a leak along the seams after no more than about 10 uses which would be typical of a couple of camping seasons for us. It would not hold air for more than about 2 hours near the end of it's life. This is definitely a manufacturing defect. 10 uses puts the age at about two years after purchase.Coleman customer service would not replace the bed because of the age in spite of their \\"No Leak\\" guarantee. So the take away here is: Use it often and long during the first year to make sure it will not develop a leak. After that, Too Bad. If you push them, they might extend the warranty to 18 months.

Before 1960 he had 19 top tens/ After 1960 he had another 19 top tens. Divided by two CD's. Elvis works were so good, that there are many others that didn't make the top 10 that should also be heard like I Was The One, Treat Me Nice, My Wish Came True, Kentucky Rain and many others and of course all the early Sun Records available on other CDs.

It's dancy, punky and gothy sounding. Song & Dance, Dominator, Let's All Go (To The Fire Dances)...all very good songs. I play this album very frequently. There's nothing bad about this album except that it's too short. Clocks in at 39 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking awesome","review":"I hardly know what to say -- this album is wonderfully exciting, original, and serves to open up the darkness of their earlier records before Killing Joke really brought in the strong melodic element of the albums to follow.

They do make it less interesting. Below are the reasons.The information is skin-deep. It\`s because each festival is covered for only 2 minutes. That's too little information to make me interested in the subject. For example, the scene that shows Tet Festival (Lunar New Year festival) in Viet Nam. We see the hostess buying Vietnam-style fire crackers. Then, people set fire to them. Then, the camera showed people visiting pagodas. In fact, there are many other activities people doing during Tet that are omitted.In short, this type of DVDs inspires my curiosity but does not satisfy it. It\`s worth watching once but not purchasing. Luckily, I borrowed it from the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"long-awaited benny","review":"This is a book that will interest lovers of American history. However, it is not limited to historians alone-- like Love, its appeal is universal. I bought this in 2003 and have enjoyed it immensely, both for the academic value as well as the entertainment it afforded me in looking into a crazy man's mind. The Oldest History of the World is also possibly the most unique retelling of the Genesis story that I have ever come across. I recommend this to all intellectual readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"snorefest","review":"I gave this two stars. One because I love Denzel, and one for the climax. This role did not tap into Denzel's awesome talent (see training day) Plus, the kid character was screechy and annoying. It didn't reveal how to become a great debater except for enunciation and knowing your facts. On the meat scale of spam-prime rib, this was a cafeteria hamburger."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Debaters","review":"A superb film. Brings the viewer into the 1950s reality of the Jim Crow South and the struggle for equality by Black Americans. The lessons communicated are applicable to all races, cultures, and communities. We are engaged by intriguing characters obviously bright and articulate and yet flawed. It is the flaws that we see them strive to overcome as well as the ills of our society. The students stretch their skills to become great debaters with the help of a charismatic and learned professor who pushes his students and himself to be the change agents in their community and the society at large.A true joy to watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, with great performances","review":"This was a great film- I especially liked Forrest Whitaker and his portrayal of the father. Denzel dazzled once again, and the performance of the \\"underdog\\" debate team was a moving tribute to the good things that come from hard work. The shipping time of this DVD was perfect, and it came in perfect condition, brand new in the wrapping, at a pleasing price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Drama classic","review":"The movie was great, it had intricate sub plots and great consistency. I thought it did a good job of dramatizing the issues and got you to think about the period of the piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Washington & team lead the debate","review":"As an historical document and a thought-provoking entertainment, this film can't be beat but unfortunately it didn't score a home run at the box office despite excellent reviews. It's certainly an appropriate docu-drama for the times now since it shows us how far we've come since the '30's and how much further we'll need to come before we can call ourselves truly \\"The United States of America\\". The scene of a Negro after being lynched then being burned to death was particularly disturbing but I'm glad Washington as director inserted this true incident into the film. His direction is excellent and he's abetted by a fine cast of new and older actors. Particularly amusing is the scene between him and Forest Whittaker as they carry on a casual debate in a humorous fashion. I wish there were more films of this type rather than the inane Tyler Perry films that pass as comedy-dramas. Washington & producer Oprah Winfrey should be proud of this inspirating film."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FILM","review":"DENZEL WASHINGTION DIRECTS AND STARS IN THE UPLIFTING DRAMA BASED ON A TRUE STORY ABOUT THE PROFESSOR WHO SHAPES A GROUP OF UNDERDOG STUDENTS FROM A SMALL EAST TEXAS, AFRICAN-AMERICAN COLLEGE INTO A HISTORICALLY ELITE DEBATE TEAM THAT DUELS AGAINST HARBERD.

Real.","review":"It is difficult to capture the charm and wit that we all hope we have when we are dating. Let's face it, movies have been trying for years. Typically it is too sacchrine or just completely misses the realism mark. AFTER FALL, WINTER's strength is a tremendous script by writer/director/star, Eric Schaeffer. He is known for his dialogue and his approach to the realities of love / relationsips, and this film is a high water mark.At times heartbreaking and at other times truly uncomfortable, I found myself both wanting to look away and unbelievably riveted. If you are a student of relationships... If you think the real stories about sexuality aren't told that often... If you like your stories told with a bit of edge and a large dose of realism... AFTER FALL, WINTER will not disappoint!Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative aspects overwhelm any \\"relationship\\" value","review":"The other reviews express almost unadulterated ardor for this director/writer, Eric Schaeffer. (sp?) Perhaps all of his films show the misogynistic/sadistic qualities that make relationships interesting? I don't find this to be so in this film and like the other \\"low\\" reviewer, it simply seems morbid and perverse. Any human being with an ounce of self respect would have left this couple behind, whether because of sheer meanness through words or sexually. Most relationships have conflicts of a considerably more benign nature. Representing the extent of this couple's confusion, depression, numbness and sexual deviance enlightens no one and certainly does not restore one's faith in humanity of any stripe. Frankly, it is easier to equate this film with troop reports from Afghanistan than any human relationship. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Other positive reviews feel like friends of the creators \\"stacking the deck.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"After fall, Winter","review":"Slow, fragmented, drifts and relies on sex scenes for pull.

It is dark and sad, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insight is sacrificed to academia & trendy queer politics.","review":"Califia seems to harbor a wish that true transsexuals did not even exist. Her attitude as I read it is that we are all just \\"queer,\\" each a range of genders, and if everyone would simply get comfortable with the cutting edge of gender play/fluidity/transgression, then no one would feel the need to physically change their sex. This is both absurd and profoundly insulting.Still, while it fails as an attempt at cultural analysis, the book has some value as an introductory overview of the history of transgender activism and writing. Just brace yourself for the bizarre and irritating misuse of \\"Nota bene\\" throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-sighted","review":"The Politics of Transgenderism is an interesting commentary on society today, but it falls incredibly short of meaningful, documented research.One-sided, biased work such as this serves to only further divide."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"Three of a perfect pair is one of the best albums of King Crimson, alongside with Lizard, Islands and Starless. There aren't overrated albums of King Crimson, but there are underrated albums, and, in my opinion, Three of a perfect pair is one of them. Beautiful \\"pop\\" songs like Man with an open heart and Sleepless. For purists of progressive rock, there is nothing like Industry, Dig me and Lark's tongues in aspic III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Very high quality recording. In my opinion, the first few tracks on the CD are much easier to listen to than the rest. The later tracks, although good, seem to have been created to prove the band members could play really difficult music (rather than listening to what they were creating). Even though the later tracks are a little wierd the first few tracks make it worth the cost for the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough music and too much noise !","review":"Just like \\"Beat\\", this cd starts strong with the first three tracks but they are followed by experimental sounds goin' nowhere.

Interestingly, it is those very tracks that reviewer JMcHenry seems to like, so as with all art, it boils down to a matter of taste.I also feel that this disc sounds the most dated of the line-up, reeking of that awful early-mid 80s synth-pop vibe.IMHO, Adrian Belew's pop talents were better served in his solo/Bears releases of the same period. To me, they feel out of place on this disc (more so than on the previous release BEAT) This is the only Crim CD I never bothered to purchace on CDand I haven't listened to my vinyl copy in many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthy","review":"Not as good as Discipline, but enough strong material to justify taking the trouble to dig it out.

I own this on vinyl and had it recorded to cassette years ago so I could listen to it while I was traveling down the road. I was hoping to get this copy to have a digital version as it's one of my favorites and I no longer own a cassette player in any vehicles. Adrian Belew just rocks and his voice is unbelievable. It's hard to imagine a guy so small could play and sing with such a large presence. He and the rest of the group are fabulous and this album is one of the best. This one has some extra mixes included which are pretty good as well. It may be from 1984 but if you haven't heard it you might think it's a brand new sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid 80's vintage Crimson","review":"Ahhh....my first non-bootlegged Crimson album. Think how much work I had to do to go backwards from here to construct a collection!This is a very good album. A bit more accessible (read: most \\"pop\\" like) than its older siblings in the trio of Belew-Fripp 80's albums, but still a great load of progressive sonic thought. Good stuff; don't pass this up just because Discipline gets all the good press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Purity, Musical Creativity","review":"There have been several insightful reviews written by customers of this work, so I won't go into great detail. This is, in my opinion, the perfect ending to the period that begins with the awesome Discipline and continues with Beat. After a great set of accessible tunes, the album takes us into an uncomfortable industrial area that then ends with the mechanical but ordered, disciplined Larks' Tongues III.I must take exception to some remarks by one reviewer. Nuages, an impressionistic piece, dreamy and easy, takes us to a different space, that of the industrial present and future. No Warning, after Dig Me, is not simply an interlude, but a conclusion to the theme explored in Industry.All in all, a flawless record which I have listened to many, many times, and which still sounds fresh and outrageous in 2002, 18 years after its original release."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst DVD jewel case on the market!","review":"Whatever you don't buy Scanavo cases. Their hub design is ridiculously bad. Unlike others where you just press the hub to pop out the DVD, the Scanavo hub does not move and is solid as rock. It will hold your DVDs in a death grip, making them nearly impossible to get out of the case, and makes damaging the disc upon removal many times more likely than normal cases. I wish companies would stop using Scanavo or the company would at least change their piss-poor, crappy design, but this idiocy continues to survive in a market place with many more superior alternatives.Just don't punish your customers or whoever else will be receving your DVDs, and buy some other company's jewel cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just different","review":"Excellent, like all KC, and very original too.

At that time, this 80's line-up of KC had already disbanded, however -as with all the music KC has recorded- an incredible work of art was left behind them.Only by listening to the musical train that \\"Sartori in Tangier\\" represents, the chaotic urban atmosphere conveyed by \\"Neurotica\\", and the sad chords of \\"Requiem\\", one can qucikly realise that KC was, has been and most likely, will continue to be far more than a great band: a group of musicians (cleverly led by Robert Fripp), that has the ability to convey moods and ideas in the most perfect ways..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fracture","review":"As long as you want to have slightly dissonant guitar pop music without much ambition, \\"Beat\\" is a good purchase. Nevertheless, KC waste their talent with shallow lyrics and mediocre compositions. I wouldn't call this music progressive, and in general, KC's '80s-output is overrated. There's one good song here, the melodious \\"Heartbeat\\", which could have been a top-40 hit for KC. Well, the rest is just disappointing with all these meandering noodlings, and you wonder where the fiery band that wrote \\"Red\\" has gone. And I guess the early-'80s are the point where KC have lost their avantgarde status.

This is Steidl's second release since his great debut album \\"Psycho acoustic overture\\", that one was an amazing album... but this one is better. I must to say that this one is pretty diferent from the first one too.The comositions in this album are great...the songs where composes by steidl himself and other from great composers as paganini or albioni.

TPM Manager is a tiresome main character---imagine a dumbed-down, cliche-filled John Galt from \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" Many times I shouted: Shut the F--- up! as I read TPM Manager spew drivel on the wonders of TPM. Initially, I wondered if Suzuki's book was purely ironic. Alas, the author really believes this nonsense. Here's some free advice: save the money, skip the reorg, don't hire the consultant, refrain from making people \\"take ownership\\" over a language that no one really takes seriously and instead show re-runs of the \\"Love Boat\\" once a week. It is guaranteed to make your employees run back to their cubicles and do some work."},{"rating":"1","title":"bobby fischer live","review":"The acting was very poor. I was not very impressed with the actors portrail of the real Bobby Fischer. Damian Chapa looks about as much like Bobby Fischer as I do John Wayne. All of the \\"actors\\" were poorly cast and the acting was not fit for a movie of any kind. I would not have purchased this movie had I known that the lead was played by a blonde. Bobby Fischer never had blonde hair. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"In the end it doesn't matter if the subject material is accurate or not as the movie is painful to watch! The cinematography is done in a manner that looks and sounds like a home movie and sometimes it feels like the actors are actually reading the lines from a poorly written script right in front of your bloodshot, watery, bored to death eyes. If I were to sum this movie up into one word it would be \\"annoying.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fischer Trash","review":"This is an Amadeus 'straight to' movie. It is entertaining but pure trash.

From the moment you hear Ghost in the machine you know this cd is going to sound nothing like Maiden. well, that's almost true the Brave is very Maiden inspired. anyway, if your looking for something to compare this too I would say Bruce Dickinson's The Chemical Wedding and Dio's Strange Highways would be as close as I could think of at this moment. every track is solid heavy metal. no techno, prog, etc. just strait up heavy metal.

Please see the original reviews for this screen production. However, since the film was released on VHS in 1987 it has not, to date, been introduced on DVD. This has presented an opportunity for companies such as Polygram to offer low quality VHS tape copies since the demand remains high for this screen rendition of the perennial favorite. No matter how enticing, I strongly recommend that potential buyers steer clear of these second generation tapes. They are invariably of poor video quality, recorded in Extended Play (EP) mode, and not worth the frequent high price charged by the sellers. Buyer Beware !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids or educational use!","review":"I had hoped to use this in my (Spanish) classroom, to replace an old PBS Going Places VHS. However, it has several things in it that are inappropriate for school-aged children (I'd put it at about PG-13) and I certainly can't use it in a middle-school classroom! Scenes about ancient sex toys are pretty much unnecessary in any travel video; then to find that the exhibit was traveling and not even a permanent fixture in the town just made me more upset! I do love the adventurousness of this series; but sometimes things go a bit over the edge (there's an emphasis on drinking and partying, and some of the ways the two women sleep are simply unsafe for women traveling alone!) This is a very informative video for the average adult traveler. I simply can't use it in the classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical Globe trekker!","review":"Although most of these videos are very fun, accurate, and educational to some extent, this Spain episode is not very good. The Northern section is fine and interesting but then in the Southern section there are strange sexual references on a few occasions making it impossible to show in a classroom. Having lived in Spain, it seems to overly stress stereotypes of what the people and places are like and doesn't do the culture justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"inappropriate DVD for classroom use","review":"This video has a short segment that is inappropriate for middle school and younger.

However, this dvd was completely inappopriate and a complete waste of money. The first half of it was fine, but the second part starts off with the guide bringing you to a sex museum and showing you how witches used the devices. A few minutes later she goes to a town where it talks about how women can't whitewash their houses when they get their period because they are seen as unclean. This was TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE for a travel video and had absolutely no business being in it. I thought I could use this in my classroom, but there is absolutely no way. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wealth of information","review":"I bought these books (upper and lower extremeties)to help me with trigger point work in the neck and shoulders, especially the scalenes and rotator cuff and to gain more knowledge with other major muscle groups.

I took the advice of the other reviewer and did, in fact buy it for 24 cents. A great purchase. It is true that this album has a different lineup, but it is a good one (while McDowell's guitar work is sorely missed, this sound is a different kind of good). I'm guessing there was no promotion behind this album. It is far superior to later outings like the abysmal \\"Pillow Lips.\\" Is it on a par with ME's classic albums? The short answer is no. What sets this album below those is that there are some filler songs that experiment a little with euro-dancy sounds that i feel fail pretty hard. However, the songs that are winners are big winners.

Observer, a fallen angel, is commanded by Satan to compile all the things that Satan has caused mankind to do, and to put a twist on it, so that Satan looks like the good guy. Observer is then told to write it all down, and this book will become the new Bible. You may think I have given the book's plot away. Hardly. There are many different stories within this book. I just gave you the centerpiece. I enjoyed this book thoroughly. If you enjoy spiritual warfare, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"book 2","review":"This story has a few books to it.

I think this would stand up to several more Halloweens. Good product for a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Times and Places (4th grade basal reader)","review":"This is a basal reader that is an extension of the Dick and Jane series that many readers fell in love with as children. It is a fourth grade version that offers short, intriguing stories. There is a little something for everyone, from familiar stories like The Ugly Duckling, The Golden Eggs, and Rumplestiltskin, to nature stores about partridges, squirrels, wild colts, polar bears, and alligators. My favorite feature is the way that newly introduced words appear that appear in one story, are repeated again in later stories, allowing the reader's vocabulary to grow with repeated encounters until the new words become familiar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reasonable collection of performances from TV","review":"For a long time all a guy could get of the Yardbirds performing was either from their documentary from the 90's or from DVD's of Shindig or Hullaballo or what have you. Well this one is not a documentary and is full of The yardbirds performing on TV with acceptable sound quality. The program starts with the Yardbirds with Clapton, then a few songs with Beck in the band, then several with Page and then ending with six or seven performances by Led Zeppelin(!?). I think it would be a good buy for anyone interested in early British Rock. Total run time is 85 minutes and contains 23 complete songs with no interruption."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE the Yardbirds!, the dvd?,not so much","review":"This looks and sounds like a 3rd generation vhs burnt onto a dvd(a dvd rw in fact)I hope someday someone will make a compilation worhty of them.

I did and improved my techniques considerably."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD PRINTING","review":"My Brother has the hard cover editioon of this book which is great. I wanted my own copy because the subject, Governor Garrard, is an ancestor of mine.

I sent it back twice, but the replacements were just as bad.

Horrible, horrible, horrible mastering.","review":"The début UK album remains one of the best progressive rock albums of all time, whose appeal extends beyond the normal 'prog set' and into the worlds of jazz/fusion and even new wave. My original vinyl sounds so good I used to use it all the time to demo speakers when I was in the sound business. After many years without any reissue on CD I was excited at this new release which was a long time coming.When I put it on it sounded as though the worst A-to-D conversion equipment in the history of sound was used to master it. Gone was the driving bass, the crystal clear treble. This cd is thin, muddy, and frankly awful. Shame on who ever did the master of this cd. I cannot think of a greater missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, but very poor remaster","review":"This is great music and I have looked forward to a remaster, but all remasters are not equal, or do they all improve on the sound quality. Some certainly do when done by individuals that care about such things, but more and more remastering is done as a marketing ploy to pump out recordings with increased gain and less dynamic range. Unfortunately this is one of those. Not only is the dynamic range reduced, but the oversound is thin and lacking the body, warmth and soul of the great music that it was. Compared to the original LP this is a night and day difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"the sum doesn't equal the whole","review":"i don't know why, but supergroups (whether music, movies, sports) rarely work out. you'd think with big names and talents, that would be projected into something extremely successful, but for the most part, it doesn't. in my opinion, u.k. falls under this spell. great names, all playing in successful bands, but together, the magic isn't there. to me, this sounds very labored, and forced vocals. i disagree with previous reviewers claiming this is an important part of prog history. no it's not. maybe the bands jobson, holdsworth, wetton and bruford came out of, but not this group. two plays is all i've given this cd and that was enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strongest Debut","review":"What I say about this album?

Still love/listen to ELP, Crimson and YES. So after all these years I find UK available on CD and buy it immediatley. What a BORE - this is what gave PROG ROCK a bad name. Both Bruford AND Holdsworth have been into this same \\"intellectual\\" (?) rock/jazz b******t ever since. every time/key change becomes agonizingly painful and I found that I couldn't even listen to the whole thing one time all the way through- I will sell my copy to anyone who is interested - it is like brand new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Minnesota Fan","review":"This album brings back memories. I was 16 years old when I first heard this when it was first released back in 1978. Now at age 47, the sound is even more refreshing with all the current music on the scene.

All of the cast in it have proven themselves in other films, but this one misses the mark. The only thing that's remotely interesting is the ending, and it's not something that anyone would write home to mom about. There is a bit of clever dialogue in the movie as well, mostly coming from Courtney Love's character, but in general this is not really worth your time or money (though it DID have a plot and it DID follow the plot, which is more than can be said for about 90% of the Action movies out in the market today, which is ALSO why it got 2 stars instead of 1).I can't even think of a comparable film that would be better to recommend, as it's not really comparable to much...

Featuring a great acting cast and a 3-minute performance of world music star Cesaria Evora, the film tells the story of a local business man who disinherits his nephew and leaves his money and estate to his daughter, he never officially recognized. His life story is told by himself on tapes he left her and through her questions to everybody, he knew. It is a romantic story, describing the main character with gentle humour. The few (discrete)love scenes remotely reminded me of some french movies.The slow pace of the film is common to outstanding European and African directors - yes African (Cape Verde is close to Senegal) - think of Ousmane Sembene and Wim Wenders, add a few humorous touches and enjoy the human side of cinema. 8 out of 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testamento","review":"The film captured so much of the culture portraying reality with intrigue inherent in the character's story.

She returns for her father's funeral but also has hopes of fitting back into the family she left. She finds the family must sell the Indian restaurant her father poured his heart into but Nina fights to save it and finds herself starting to fall for her brother's girlfriend in the process.

The thing which made the film nice, is that it seemed sincere as a love story, and while the usual elements of gay love being unacceptable to some are in there, it is not another one of those \\"we are so mistreated because we are gay\\" films, as so many have been. Also, there is an equally important, if not moreso, plot, proceeding at the same time that the two girls begin to fall for each other.

I have been using the firmest core for months, and can never get comfortable. There just isn't enough support in the right places. The culprit is the very cheap foam which surrounds the core. I used a contour pillow before this one for about six years and loved it until whiplash caused me to need something more firm. I have had this pillow for lest than a year, and I just moved on to the Iso-Cool Contour pillow. So far I love it...I hear it is supposed to last for years. We will see. As for this core pillow, I really don't recommend it. It does feel good at first, but that soon fades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pillow has fumes.

We need good neck support while we sleep. We have tried alot of pillows over the years. Water, buckwheat, Tempura to name just a few. After reading the reviews on this pillow I felt comfortable in purchasing a couple of them for us. Mistake. These pillows are made out of VERY soft foam. Even with the choice of changeable inserts the pillow itself does not have support for your head. I only opened one pillow hoping to return the other which I did without any problems. I was very disappointed by the quality with the price I paid for this pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!","review":"I bought this pillow to alleviate my chronic neck pain after reading all the positive reviews. However, after using this pillow for a week, my little nagging neck pain turned into a major pain!! The foam rolls are a good idea except that the two firmest ones are too firm. They feel like rocks under your neck, and the soft one squishes down to nothing! The pillow is just cheap quality foam, and there's virtually no pillow in the middle, so your head ends up at an awkward angle! Also, the foam material that the pillow is made out of is very cheap quality compared to other memory foam or tempurpedic pillows! Very disappointing for the price!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Fast delivery! The idea for this pillow is great. However, the pillow is a little flimsy. The foam has a pre-cut slip in area where you place the firm pieces of foam. But the pillow as not sturdy enough for me to sleep on. I am going to use it in the car when I need a nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality!!","review":"I bought this pillow hoping that for $45, it would be a good investment as well as good for my neck. I couldn't have been more WRONG! This pillow is terribly cheap. I wish I could give it a worse review (doesn't deserve even one star!) I tried to take the pillow out of the pillow case to investigate the foam quality and I about ripped into the foam with my fingers just trying to get the case off. YUCK! This company should be ashamed of setting the price at $45. And the foam inserts are no better.

More \\"ooomf\\" and rhythm. I ddn't like the song until I heard Fire Inc's version.I agree with Jim Steinman, that after Bat, Meat Loaf's voice was never the same again.Meat just tried too hard since then. Bat 1 was perfect.

With her standing 10 feet away the spray hit her too causing her to cough and dry heave. As to the effectiveness the device caused partial-thickness chemical burns across my face and eyes. It was partially incapacitating but if I had the drive it would not have dropped me. I reccomend getting a stun gun if you actually want to get away from an attacker.

Well, the problem was that most were too bulky to fit into my pocket and it just looked awkward. This pepper spray is small and just fits great on a keychain. The best part is that the end snaps off,so your keys can be ignition and a quick pull will disconnect the spray and can be used if someone tries to carjack you.I had to give it 4 stars because it does not spray \\"cone-like\\" and not at an 8 feet distance. I test sprayed it with 0 wind and it came out like a cloud and the range was maybe five feet at the most. You may want to adjust for these shortcomings just in case you have to use it defensively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I like the design because it is easy to carry and easy to use. Unfortunately, that is not what matters. I run on back roads where every so often dogs like to chase. I was bitten once and swore it wouldn't happen again. This dog was part of a pack of three (I never see the owners despite all the barking). The next time they came after me I was ready. When they were about 4 feet away I sprayed but the cloud didn't make it to them. I sprayed again and I think the wind caught the cloud because one dog looked surprised. Apparently not surprised enough because they came after me again the next day with the same results. The next time they came after me I tried to spray them but the device didn't work. I got home, opened it up, canister worked, but the mechanism that makes the canister spray was broken. A cheap little plastic part. So, if you think you are safe carrying this thing, think again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"The damn thing kept popping off at the keyring and falling off.

While Karen Finley is sometimes brilliant and incisive, this story is not. The sexual descriptions in the book are obscene, as are the pictures, without any discernible artistic purpose (particularly when you consider that this was originally a play).

Magnets barely work. I bought this as a gift for my father-in-law and I was embarrassed when he opened it and we couldn't find any metal objects light enough to stick.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$","review":"Well, apparently, ours did not come with the Rare Earth Magnets b/c the only tools that it will hold are very lightweight tools. And I can't move my arm around or those fall off. So, if I am standing still with small tools attached, it works wonderfully.

What fun on Christmas as everything metal in sight was attached! (See pics) Then we put one to practical use in the days after Christmas as we constructed a wall in my garage. It was very handy to slap a handful of nails or screws on the band, then grab as needed.

Like the author, I have also studied men and women throughout my life, and have discovered that when all is said and done, a human being is going to feel love for your essence.

The next day, I bought a copy. I have bought 12 more copies in a week. Everyone who reads this book gasps at its truth. The blockades of Arnoldi's past abuse and present hardship would have stopped her from becoming who she was becoming before she became a mom. In a perfect combination of words and art, she conveys her perilous journey. Thoughts and emotions overflow her drawings, MAD Magazine-style. As it dawns on you that she's writing from a place of victory, you laugh, cry, and cheer. If you're a school counselor, as I am, buy copies for your teen moms and fellow counselors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that puts it in perspective","review":"I found Arnoldi's comic to be wonderfully honest and frank and I thank her for sharing it with us. The turning point of the book is when she becomes grateful for what she has, and what she is, and her horrid past becomes a memory and not a sentence. Three cheers for her dreams and her fulfillment. I too graduated college with a very young child. The love for her child is apparent throughout, and despite the horrid circumstance in which the child was conceived, it is clear the author views her child as a blessing and never a burden. The book is a stark graphic comic about the author's life between the ages of 10 and 21. The artwork is wonderfully descriptive and that which anyone can understand and relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is just outright they way it can be","review":"I am a divorce attorney.

The film footage is constantly polluted with text overlays and moving footers describing what topical events took place over the years that various songs were popular, as well as the constant switching from colour to black and white photography which affects both the sight and sound quality. The whole production has a \\"Pop Up Video\\" feel about it and comes across like a project completed by a group of first year audio-visual students!

He tends to break the high E string a lot, and rather than buy full sets and end up with numerous extras of the other five guitar strings, I find it more efficient to buy the high E strings in bulk.D'Addario is a high quality string and these are a great value. If you are a guitar novice and are looking for a particular string in bulk, just keep in mind you are probably not going to find \\"bulk E strings\\", \\"bulk G strings\\", etc. Rather you will find them sold by gauge. For example, for the high E string you would buy 09 or 010 gauge strings, and so on.I did not rate these strings a 5 for one reason.

There are problems with the physics of the game that make many of the weapons very difficult to use. The graphics do look pretty nice, and are one of the pros in the game. The multiplayer games do lack the quickness and speed of the old 2D worms games that made them enjoyable and ideal for a fast pickup game. The controls and the aiming for many of the weapons are hard to get the hang of, so it requires a lot of time just getting a knack of your weapons, before you can become even mildly proficient with them. Overall, this game is a disappointment to the worms series, and I would not recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this garbage","review":"Just bought it today and after about 2 hours of play, the grip is starting to tear.

It's not so much a return to form as it is a compilation of fifteen years of playing together. It gets you excited to hear rock again. It has a passion that I personally feel lacked in the last few years. Pearl Jam made about as perfect of an album as they come. It's raw, it's melodic, its energetic and it has substance. Eddie Vedder went back to his earlier form of writing by using storytelling in his lyrics. It's a musical ride. Just get it.

In fact it was difficult for me to try and listen to this multiple times hoping that it would grow on me.The hype about this being their best album in 10 years is just that - hype. I truely respect this band and have enjoyed most of their albums but sorry to say I can't see how this stacks up as one of their better albumns. IMHO a couple of good songs does not make the whole album worthy of four or five stars.If you're new to PJ check out just about anything else from them.......sorry guys"},{"rating":"1","title":"Washed Up...","review":"Pearl jam's time has come and gone....along time ago...They havent released an album worth listening to in years, and this is no exception.

Dont get me wrong, they used to rock..10, VS, and even vitology were great albums, but there at their end. I had hope for this album, but yet again severly dissapointed. Eddie veder needs to stop concentrating on politics and start concentrating on his music cause in my opinion both of them suck. There is no taste in this album whatsosver.

Better than Riot Act!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I love Pearl Jam. They're songwriting skills and emotion made them great in the 90's and early 00's. Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed with this album. It has terrible sound quality, like it was recorded in someone's garage. The voice, drums, bass, guitars, all sound distorted like they're overdriving the microphones, so it's hard to listen to. The other reviews indicate Pearl Jam is back in form and compare this to Ten. I don't know what album they were listening to.Maybe that same Pearl Jam I loved still exists but you wouldn't know it from this recording. On a side-note, what the heck is going on with the artwork? It's full of mutilated body parts and grotesque images."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Pearl Jam????","review":"It appears that people either love or hate this album. Unfortunately I hate it. I have been buying PJ albums since the day after Ten debuted on the video channel (whichever one it was back then, at least it played music unlike now), and they have been going progressively down hill. I thought this one might be different after hearing World Wide Suicide, so I bought it the second it was released (literally, I opened the box of CD's for them). I have forced myself to listen to it repeatedly, but it just won't click. I find that most of my most treasured albums take at least three good listens to start to click. This one just won't. Nothing sticks in my head besides the first single. It's all disappointing.Luckily I bought 10,000 Days on the same day."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"As a fan of early Pearl Jam I was disappointed big time with this one.

It's the kind of record you will soon find at a gas station when buying that soda to keep you awake for a long trip down I-5(for $1.99)In fact one might even save themselves some time by just going to a flea market where I promise every booth will have a copy on sale for a quarter.

It's not an album you have to listen to start appreciating. I bought it the day it came out, loaded it into my mp3 player, and haven't taken my headphones off yet. I'm listening to it right now.

Since then Pearl Jam has released some good stuff (Yield), some average stuff (No Code), and some bad stuff (Binaural, Riot Act). This release falls into the good category. Sure, there's a few good songs that will sound great live but Pearl Jam's music still lacks that special element it used to have. There are no anthems like \\"Alive\\" or \\"Jeremy\\", no heavy rockers like \\"Animal\\" or \\"Go\\", and definitely no classic ballads like \\"Black\\" or \\"Indifference\\" or \\"Nothingman\\".

Unfortunatley after \\"Vitalogy\\" the bands releases became more and more inconsistent. Don't get me wrong each of the releases in the latter half of the 90s up through \\"Riot Act\\" in 02 had some good tunes but none of these CDs as a whole held up. There live shows were still fantastic and it looked as if Pearl Jam was headed the way of the Grateful Dead and being known as a great live band that would be better served releasing there all of their shows on CD. With their new self-titled release the band shows they can still put out a great record. \\"Life Wasted\\" ,\\"Severed Hand\\", \\"Marker In the Sand\\" and \\"Unemployable\\" are some of the best songs they've ever recorded.

If so, where did the groove go? Pearl Jam have consistently made good album after good album, so the fact that this album is great comes off as no surprise.This is Pearl Jam's heaviest album in a while, at least in the first half, with \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"World Wide Suicide\\", \\"Severed Hand\\", and \\"Comatose\\" all with great hooks and head-pounding rhythms. But the slower songs may be even better, with Vedder showcasing his lyrical talent on such masterpieces as \\"Gone\\", \\"Parachutes\\", and \\"Come Back\\". But the album closer \\"Inside Job\\" is the masterstroke of the album, an epic song that finishes on a \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" like note.Say what you want to say about Pearl Jam being dinosaurs in the alternative rock field; but the truth is, they never missed a beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The words are too important = @","review":"I own every album except Binural & No Code.

Don't believe all of these reviews. I was shocked when I listened to the CD the first time. The quality of the CD is very poor. On the first 4 songs it feels like they are rushing to play the music which is repetitive and unappealing to the ears. Then the CD mellows out a little bit. I really like a lot of thier softer music(loved Live at Benaroya Hall) but these songs don't do anything for me. A couple of more bland rock songs are follwed by the best part of the CD. The last 3 songs sound like a gift after listening to the first 10. Overall very disappointing. Can't wait for the Chili Peppers. I heard their double CD on VH1.com and it sounds great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked in once again","review":"I own every Pearl Jam album. I was always blown away by the passion of their earlier work, but the CDs in later years were passionless. Each time a new CD was released, reviewers would praise the latest CD, but each work became weaker and weaker, although each had a few bright spots. Although, Riot Act was dismissal from beginning to end. I read reviews of the latest work which said the old Pearl Jam is back. They said the band had the passion and hooks from the earlier days. They are wrong. Although Pearl Jam is still better than most \\"mainstream\\" bands on the radio, this work is still very disappointing. They have tried to regain their passion, but it sounds and feels forced. It is evident that they are angry about the state of America and the world, but they no longer know how to express that anger in their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"Not the Pearl Jam of the 90's this CD SUCKS bad, there are no good songs on it..highly disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've been better... not bad","review":"This doesn't suck, but after the second album, I'm constantly trying to find the band that I was SO into. I like some weird stuff like they played on 'No Code'. If you're a fan, you remember 'Mankind'. THAT was a real treat.I'm a fan, and this is getting closer to the Rock I wanna hear, but just not close enough. 2.5 stars actuallly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good songs but still lacking","review":"I read many reviews before i bought this album. I was under the impression that this cd would be similar (in energy and emotion) to Ten, Vs, and Vitalogy. I was wrong! The album has many \\"mainstream\\"-type songs which lack in screaming and originality. I miss the Pearl Jam of old.Save your money and just download a few songs like Wasted Life, Worldwide Suicide, and Marker in the Sand from the internet (pay sites of course). The album as a whole is not a must buy. Sorry, but it's the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"These guys must hate music. Because they are the worst. And they have paved the wave for awful bands like Nickleback. Pearl Jam is for people who just stopped listening to Jimmy Buffett and Bearnaked Ladies. And then they decided to move on. These songs contained here are the worst ever. And Pearl Jam is the worst ever. I laugh when I listen to these songs...are you seroius. Yes. They are and that is what makes it even worse. All of the songs seemed forced. Like an eighth grader wrote it for the talent show at summer camp. This music is detached from nature and is false. Even 10, looking back is some pretty gawd awful stuff...But there are Pearl Jam fans. And they love thier Jam. And who am I to say. I know some of them and they are nice people. But when it come down to music...There is just no talking to them...Check out some other \\"rock\\" bands out there...and explore your world.Don't sit in the mud..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible album from Pearl Jam.","review":"NOT IMPRESSED.I was expecting a lot from this legendary band but this albums sounds like a cheap copy of the Who. I highly DO NOT recommend this album. If you want to hear a raw garage band type of album without any crisp guitaring or vocals, get this. Vedder sounds the same. Have you heard spin the black circle? This whole album sounds like that, but a lot more worse. Where are the solos, Mike McCrady?If I could give this a ZERO, I would.- Andy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album of all time.","review":"Thuis album is disgusting, its boring, safe, mom dangerous, and worst of all, it focusses on politics, not the lyrics (lyrics are lyrics are lyrics) but they over shadow everything, the album, artwork, the lyrics. BORING!!!It limits the listner, music does not have to be about one thing, especially for the individuals that lsuten to it.Worst of all its by Pearl Jam, a band who have'nt shown a decent album since Yield or No Code, Binuaral and Riot Act, were almost shimmering with glimpses of hope, but they just werent there.Absolutley awful. MUSIC IS DEAD, AND SO IS PEARL JAM, bring back the 90s. Or something new!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Six of one, half a dozen of the other","review":"It's an election year.What does that mean?Pearl Jam releases another, *yawn*, album.Of course we get the obligatory, vitriolic, whining of the self righteous malcontent Eddie Vedder. I swear, this man has no range in vocals. It's either: sneer, growl, or mumble.The lead guitarist tries his best to steal lame licks from the School of Hendrix.Didn't this over-rated Seattle schlock grunge go out of style circa. 1998?Virtually every Pearl Jam album is interchangible. They've been cranking out the same, tired, schtick for at least 12 years now.And, of course, while their time has come and gone (they hardly make a dent in the charts anymore), their mind-numbed fans eat up this worn out crud.I'm sure my humble review will raise the ire of the fans of the band. But it is the harsh truth. The outside world has changed. Bill Clinton is no longer president. Time to step out of your bubble and smell the fresh air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nirvana","review":"Pearl Jam is not Nirvana.They will never be Nirvana.They suck.They have always sucked.Their lead singer runs around on stage. He doesn't play guitar. Give me a break.Pearl Jam is what we've got left from the 90s. That and Green Day.It's sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Sham","review":"Pearl Sham is so 1991. Eddie Cheddar (oops, I meant Vedder) can't sing and is actually really annoying. Nick Lachey is coming out with a new album soon. It's already getting rave reviews. Save your money and wait for that disc soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully refreshing return...","review":"Pearl Jam has always been a favorite of mine. This album is a great return as we haven't heard from the band in a while. The tunes *Life Wasted* and *Worldwide Suicide* really reflect the artists' disgust with our current president and the government tactics that we all have to deal with.The album reminds me a bit of Vitalogy.I was so pleasantly surprised to listen to what I believe is a sort of comeback for the band that layed in wait before they had something to say. And I suppose this is best....why speak until you have something to say? Pearl Jam has been a band of few words...unless there was something to say. And say it they always have. This album is a great one. The band and it's individual components are more mature and more comfortable in their own skin. Their music reflects that.Thanks Eddie and the boys! Good Job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, it's okay!...(by a guy who is NOT a Pearl Jam fan)","review":"I can't stand Pearl Jam's Ten album. Its droopy generic grunge, mixed with a singer that I can't stand listening to for more than a couple minutes, makes it, in my humble opinion, one of the worst albums of all time. Well, Eddie Vedder's voice still makes me physically uncomfortable, but the music behind him this time is solid, groovy grunge metal. Somewhat improved from the group that brought us the uninspired (and boring as hell) Jeremy, Black, Evenflow, and Alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Nothing good on this CD, a big dissapointment.

Vedder thinks he should make ignorant political speeches in his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland album","review":"After all the rave reviews, I expected better.It's like an entire album comprised of all the bad songs on Riot Act. Why make garage music when you have the ability to create classic rock?Pearl Jam's working overtime trying to promote this album, which has gone a long way towards building hype. Don't believe it.Even the album's artwork is uninspired (especially inside)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This album is lousy.. The band I grew up to love has now been reduced to this.. Unoriginal and lame.. What happened to the intensity and innocence some of their songs had.. Pearl Jam should hang it up now, instead of putting albums out like this one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bore (in other words, usual Pearl Jam fodder)","review":"Pearl Jam hasn't released anything decent since \\"Ten\\" (a masterpiece!) and this album is no different. Only the true die-hard fans that have no credible musical tastes will get anything out of this sloppy excuse of a release. There are only a couple of rare glimpses of the brilliance that was \\"Ten\\". For the most part, however, it will bore the hell out of you. The songwriting is lame and Vedder's voice is as annoying as ever. Plus, they continue to push their self-righteous and ignorant political views on us (see \\"World Wide Suicide\\") which just make them a laughing stock. Thankfully, I found this album online and listened to it before wasting any money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their BEST albums","review":"This is amongst their BEST albums after TEN.I would rate it even better than Vs and Vitalogy.The songs,guitar solos and instrumentation are terrific.Please ignore the haters and get this TODAY.FIVE STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"perl jam","review":"this new album is being very much over rated....i feel this album only has a couple of good songs...would not reccommend..."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough with the politics","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer from January 1st, Hoplite Whatever-his-name-is on one thing. Pearl Jam needs to get rid of the Bush-bashing. I say this not in any great defense of our current president; I am neither pro- nor anti-Bush. I am a registered independent, and so have no interest in feeding the two-headed monster that has a stranglehold on our political system. However, I am tired of hearing PJ bitch and moan about everything Bush does. I'll bet they would even criticize the way the man takes a piss. They should do what every other empty-headed, plastic personality celebrity should do in regards to political statements: leave it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Boring...","review":"I love Pearl Jam's old stuff and I was really excited for this album, but it's really just kinda blah. There werent any great guitar parts, no exciting vocals. I guess this album is going into the \\"listening to music but not really listening\\" section of my collection. It works for background noise, but beyond that...."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak effort","review":"...like some other reviews stated, this disc is much like Riot Act in that it has the same crappy production (the drums sound flat and lame) and the same forgettable tunes. At least Riot Act had \\"Love Boat Captain\\", I don't think this CD has one song that's even as good as that. I don't think they really 'have it' anymore...too bad, they were once relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST YET","review":"The best band in the world released their best album to date. Every album gets progressively better, as well as different than the last one. This should be the opinion of every die hard Pearl Jam fan. There is no best or worst album, they are all equally great for their own reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fine PJ album","review":"PJ have returned with a bang.They have made a brilliant album after several mediocre efforts like No code and Binaural.I would rate this on par with tewn due to beautiful songs like worldwide suicide,life wasted and big wave.Keep the good work PJ.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM BY PEARL JAM!!!!","review":"Really like this album from the great rockers PEARL JAM!!!!All the songs are great, with gems like WORLD WIDE SUICIDE, COMATOSE, SEVERED HAND and MARKER IN THE SAND!!!! WELL DONE, PEARL JAM!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pearl jam rocking again","review":"Not 10 , not even VS, but this release has faster pace to it than anything since Vitology. Comparable to the Yield album. But, not as good as Ten or Vs. The album songs display a sense of maturity, something different in general, and a bit grown up in mood. It's as if they suddenly settled down with a need to go back to their real roots of rebellious ecstatic uplifting tunes of grunge. Perhaps, a realization of what really works for them, doesn't necessarily work for their listeners. All in all an awesome piece of work. Going back on tour probably helped alot as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"This album is one of Pearl Jam's best. It blends the sounds of some of their earlier work (Vitalogy, No Code, Vs.) yet has its own distinctive sound. If you prefer the harder side of Pearl Jam, the first five songs are no brainers. But, some of the slower songs on this album are some of their best work. The last track, 'Inside Job' is simply amazing. I recommend listening to the album a couple of times to let things set in and then listening to the album with headphones. There are so many subtleties to be picked up. Amazing album."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to the scene.","review":"I have heard quite a bit of a band called 'Pearl Jam' and how it was a Seattle grunge band. Hearing that, I filed it in my mind in the 'Nirvana' folder. Then, about a month ago, a friend of mine showed me 'Rearview Mirror' and I changed my mind about them. I went and listened to this new effort from Pearl Jam, and I was impressed, now I am the proud and happy owner of a great CD by a great band. Don't just write this one off as another 'Nirvana'-copying group, because they are much, much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's more like 4 1/2 stars","review":"This latest PJ disc is why I love this band ... you can almost hear them telling people, \\"Screw you, we're going to write and play songs we like.\\"It's nice to see there are still bands out there that don't pander to critics and fans and release CDs that are meant to please. \\"Pearl Jam\\" is a great collection of songs that just gets better the more you listen to it.Yeah, it's not \\"vs.\\", but then again, why should it be? Pearl Jam has matured in their writing and still take an uncompromising outlook on the world. Great disc by one of the best (and most consistent) bands out there.Highlights include:- Life Wasted- World Wide Suicide- Unemployable- GoneIf you're wavering on whether or not to buy this disc, pick it up ... you won't be disappointed if you're a real PJ fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for seed bead starters","review":"This is not a starter book even though bead stitch techniques are shown much-enlarged in photographs. Jeanette's book provides an excellent springboard for the intermediate to advanced beader.

Try some of Jeanette's ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I was expecting patterns that were more up to date with the times and jewelry that I could wear to work and out to dinner. These patterns weren't difficult to understand but like I said, who would want to wear it out of the house. Possibly little children would wear while playing house or something. Extremely disappointed. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff still flies me away","review":"This is a great compilation of a legendry band. Paul Kantner will always be a rebellious writer. Jorma and kack still lat down the funkiest blues and can rock your socks off in their electric sets, coupled with Gracie and Marty belting out soulful notes,,,, this was the music of 1968 to 1973.

It has a nice premise, but in the end, this individual (for the sake of not giving away too much of the plot) turns out to be almost superhuman in her tolerance for pain, and the ways that she escapes death.I defy anyone to attempt to make sense of the ending of this movie.
