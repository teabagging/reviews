One of the best books i have read about the holocaust, very much recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe inspiring","review":"I was especially drawn to this book for its depiction of events in Vilna, the home of two Holocaust survivor friends, the great late Israeli poet Abba Kovner, and also a maternal great-grand-father. The book is equally appropriate for adults as young adults.Certainly, theSS-Einsatzgruppendeath pit near Kiev --- at Babi Yar (made famous both by the novel ofA. Anatoli (Kuznetsov)and the equally great poem of YevgenyYevtushenko) --- are far better known than the pit atPonary. But history should also make it better known that an enormous number were shot into pits near Vilna, where the post-Soviet Lithuanian government has recently pressed outrageous charges against many surviving members of the anti-Nazi resistance, simply because they are Jewish.By itself, the scale and inhumanity of Nazi murder of Jewish people in and near Vilna, makes this book worth reading.

This book was so good that it was at the same level as Anne Frank's diary. Susie Weksler is only 8 years old when the war starts. She has to move many times. As the war goes on many horrendous things happen. Susie has seen more than 20 people shot right in front of her eyes as a 9-10 year old. Susie has to disguise herself as an adult to keep herself alive and at one point has to pretend her mother is her sister. This book was very, very, sad and out of Susie's huge family only her mother, her uncle, and she herself survived. The story does stick by the title, Susie's mother is the one who always keeps going, she is the one who always pushed Susie to keep going till the end of the miserable war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to my Mother","review":"This is a great but sad book because of the significant details on how life was being Jewish during the Holocaust.

The translation from German to English by my friend James Skofield, is exceptional and lends directly to the intimacy and loss one feels as the reader.This is one of those books that I put back on my shelf once I read it;I can glance from a distance at its cover and I KNOW and remember.PROFOUND."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to my Mother","review":"Instead of saying I liked this book, I think it would be better to say that I thought it was interesting. There were places throughout the book that I started to forget that this happened and think that it was fiction, or exagerated. Then I would remember that this is the story of Susanne Weksler's life when she was a little girl. This book also gave me a better understanding of the Holocaust and what went on because before we started the unit in school, I didn't even know what it was. It also helped me understand just how much these people went through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Enlightening Story","review":"I loved this book!

His disdain of the Third World and Turks and Muslims in general made this a very unpleasant read.He avoids contact with educated professionals and limits his interactions to the simple folk who make him feel so much more superior.True, the time of his travel was a politically and economically chaotic period of the country but he should have been able seperate this from the larger historical perspective this travel book supposedly aimed for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumper 5 - Reflex 1","review":"Everything I liked about Jumper was missing here. The few things I disliked about Jumper were spotlighted here. The book may have been well-written but it was too painful to read. I felt myself cringe every time I picked it up. After 150 pages, I could no longer even pick it up. I am fan of Wildside, Helm and Blind Waves, so I haven't looked forward to a book this much in a while. I expected more of the discovery and amazement, but instead read something about torture and despair. I realize it probably got better as the hero overcame the odds, but I just couldn't get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadistic.

Jumper barely scratched the surface on teleportation. Gould explores the science and ramifications of teleportation, while giving us more of the characters we love, Davy and Millie. Even more excitement and more energy than Jumper, and it's even more tightly plotted. Kidnappings, twists and turns, an amazingly imaginative climax--this is great science fiction and great writing.

Cuba Gooding was \\"under the radar\\" (i.e. over-acting). I can't even start to tell you how bad this movie is. The \\"Organization,\\" \\"Mafia\\" actors or whatever you call to choose them, were stereotypical of lousy mob movies.Mathhew Modine wasn't very convincing, James Caan played his usual type character (i.e. nothing new) and Caan's daughter 'Clarissa' (Joey Lauren Adams) posessed this really squeaky-type annoying voice. Almost sounding like a parody of Lisa Simpson.The plot was far-fetched (A mob hitman suddenly trains overnight to become a stuntman. Yeah, right) and badly directed. I don't know what people see/saw in this movie as \\"action\\" - it wasn't. Good thing this movie wasn't widely released; it would have been mercilessly panned by the critics.

Purchased for the club and the previous board was starting to fall apart and the wire was too thick. This hardly ever has any bounce backs from hitting the wire.

The material is dense and does not deform too much. The holes plug up overnight for the most part. The numbers on the dart board can be somewhat hard to read since the wire is not moulded very well, but who needs to read the numbers anyway once you know your way around the dart board. This board looks great too with crisp colours and nice metal work on the face of the board.The board is pretty heavy, and setting it up might be a bit of a challenge. The instructions are pretty thorough and well written. Only a screwdriver, hammer and drill needed to set the board up on a wall.

The holes don't \\"heal\\" anywhere near as nicely as the 20 year old Nodor board I replaced. I gave that to my nephew and it's still going strong. It also seems the darts don't penetrate as deeply as in the old board or, in other words, it's much easier to pull the dart out of this board, but I've yet to have one fall out.Now for the pro: I hadn't seen a board like this before buying it and I'm very satisfied with the wire construction.

Awesome CD!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Les Miz recording ever!","review":"Lea Salonga is much better than Frances Ruffelle. It was a shame Frances Ruffelle had to be in the OBC and the OLC. Lea Salonga is a much more better representation of Éponine. Colm Wilkinson is the best Valjean. Philip Quast, what can I say, he is so in to the part, it's extraordinary.

The actors and actresses that sing the parts in this rendition are absolutely brilliant. They bring the story to life through the music with their awe-inspiring voices, especially Eponine and Valjean. I find myself walking down the hallways at school singing these songs because the arrangement is so breathtaking and yet catchy at the same time. If there were more than five stars to give, I would do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I would definitely recommend this recording to any Les Mis fan, any ALW fan, or any fan of musical theatre. I think that the casting for this concert was very good, but I do prefer Patti LuPone and Frances Ruffele to Ruthie Henshall and Lea Salonga (perhaps it is partially the accent). I think that the worst parts of this recording are that since the OLC \\"Little People\\" and \\"I Saw Him Once/In My Life/A Heart Full of Love\\" have been edited and that sometimes, especially during \\"Master of the House,\\" the audience applause and cheering interfere with the music. But, thank God for Colm Wilkinson, Michael Ball, Alun Armstrong, and Philip Quast especially all doing their respective rolls (Valjean, Marius, Thénardier, Javert) better than any others can.

Lea Salonga performance of Eponine is horrible. It's as though she didn't really understand Eponine or feel her. Her songs doesn't have the emotion of Frances Ruffelle. Eponine is supposed to sound like Ruffelle, even Victor Hugo himself described her as having that kind of a voice (I can't remember the exact words). I was also digusted with Gavroche. He is an adorable little street urchin (that means he is skinny as well)not the fat, tall kid who sounds horrid, they have portraying him in this cd. Well, those are my only problems. They may not seem like much, but Eponine and Gavroche are my favorite characters and I hate to see them ruined. *Don't get angry Lea Salonga fans, but you must not identify with Eponine that much either.

The missing bits of music were somewhat irking, and might make it hard for you to follow the story if you're not familiar with it, but I guess you can't have everything. Loved the cast, except maybe for Judy Kuhn. She sounds way too old to be Cosette. I especially liked Ruthie Henshall as Fantine and Michael Maguire as Enjolras (though he still can't hold a candle to Anthony Warlow). The ending, with all the different Valjeans doing \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" was a cool twist, too. If you plan to buy only one Les Miz album, I would advise you to make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The vocalists are fantastic. Although this is a live performance and the crowd cheers a bit, the interruptions are brief and not very noticable. As an avid fan of Les Miserables, I recomend this highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Mis DVD","review":"I have always loved this musical. This is the best version of the show. So I bought 2 more to give as presents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only One You Need","review":"For me this is the definitive CD for Les Miserables. I read every review and bought this one. I enjoy every minute of it. I let one of my friends borrow it (has the London org) he loved it and did not want to give it back. My favorite is the Epilogue (Finale). It is great with the Royal Philharmonic and the chorus of a thousand. You will not regret this purchase, the performances draw you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificient","review":"After listening to this album numerous times, it was this DAMN good, and the political message within the music that has brought was even more powerful. Aside from that, it gives me a new kind of appreciation on musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quast and Wilkinson are a match made in heaven","review":"Although I am not really knowledgeable in the performances of different Eponines I thought that Lea Salonga did a fantastic job. This is one of the best performances that I have heard. The duets with Colm Wilkinson (Jean Valjean) and Philip Quast are absolutely stunning. After their performances together I cannot even listen to another man try and sing the part of Javert. I believe that Quast pulled it off with so much of the character in the song. The song 'Stars' is my favorite and brings me to tears sometimes. All in all I loved this soundtrack and would suggest to any who are interested in Les Miserables to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wonderful","review":"This is without a doubt the best Les Miz recording around. What can I say about it other than that it is just brilliant. I can listen to it and imagine the actors going through their paces.If you want to buy a Les Miz CD get this one. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is definitely THE BEST Les Miz recording out there, but there are a couple things i don't like about it. Adam Searles (Gavroche) gets on my nerves. He and Alun Armstrong (Thenardier) could've done a much better job of personifying the characters. Instead of just singing the words, they could've actually attempted at putting some emotion into it, and made them seem more as if they WERE the character going through the story, than just some guy up on stage singing. Other than that, this recording is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frances Ruffelle?","review":"Oh, please! Lea Salonga can run circles around her acting-wise and especially singing-wise. Even the Complete Symphonic Recording's Kaho Shimada is a hundred times better than squeaky Frances Ruffelle who made a whiney interpretation of Eponine at best.That issue aside, this recording is the DREAM recording with its outstanding and stellar cast and orchestra. (Get the DVD so you can watch everything.) Pair this with the CSR and you have all the musical Les Miz you'll ever need."},{"rating":"2","title":"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN- THE ULTIMATE DREAM CAST","review":"If you love Les Miserables then you will love this recording. With Colm Wilkinson giving brilliant renditions of who am I? and bring him home and also the amazing vocals of Lea Salonga singing on my own and A little fall of rain, you will finish listening to this in tears. Truly the producer and directors of this show picked the best cast ever to perform Les Miserables. The ultimate DREAM cast!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I read other reviews and discovered this was the preferred recording of several reviewers. I can see why. I have really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Les Miserables CD!","review":"This is the musical that got me into musicals. I have heard the OBC, CSR, and have also seen this show twice in person. The 10th anniversary is definitely the best recording I have heard unless you can see it live. The 10th anniversary introduced me to Colm Wilkinson, the original Valjean, and he is great! Lea Salonga plays a wonderful Eponine. The whole cast is just excellent! It's no wonder, more than half of this cast has played major roles in other musicals. If you can afford one Les Miserables CD, this is the one to get. With the live audience, it makes you feel as if you're right there in the theatre. I just can't wait until they do a 20th anniversary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best recording.","review":"I have listened to a number of cast recordings of Les Miserables (London Cast, Broadway Cast, Symphonic Recording, Japanese Cast, 2010 Dream Cast, and 25th Anniversary) - and this one, in my opinion, trumps all of them. The orchestra, and the actors and actresses most of all. The vocals are sublime. WHenever I try listening to the other recordings, I feel that something is lacking. What it is not complete, it makes up for in vocal quality. If the cast playing will one day reunite to play Les Mis again - I will get seats in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Others have said everything that can be said about this stunning concert so I will confine myself to a few brief observations.This cast is truly the dream cast. Wilkinson IS Valjean and his perfomance is extraordinary. Bring Him Home is stellar, the Confrontation with Philip Quast's Javert is perfection and his Who Am I is the standout performance of the show. Philip Quast, Ruthie Henshall, Michael Ball, Lea Salonga...could it get any better than this?Simply put, this is the best of the best in every sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"This is the Best! I listen to it all the time. Truely the greatest musical of all time. Michael Ball is wonderful! Isn't he always? You can even hear him laugh when Grantaire is teasing him. I love that part:-) You can't in the movie. I can't wait for the 20th anniversary concert. It will probably be my only, much desired trip to England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great musical","review":"Lés Miserables is simply the best musical ever. The universal themes that run through it are really philosophical. Almost all the music and lyrics are great. It is beautiful except for the Thénardiers' songs; the musical really paints the portrait of this ugly couple well through, well, kind of ugly songs.I've only heard this particular \\"Dream Cast\\" performance. Javert I think is excellent, and M. Thénardier (\\"Master of the house\\") is perfect for his part.This product could really have been improved by having the lyrics written in the booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and white east village collage frame","review":"Great frames.

The first one had a slight ding in the wood, but it was a present and I had to get it out, so I used a bit of black shoe polish to cover it up. Neither of them had glass fronts. They were both plastic! I was really hoping for a nice glass front, as advertised. I guess I shouldn't have expected it with this price. Matting is nice and it looks nice enough. Just upset about the false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor went boom!","review":"Much has already been said about the poor editing in this novel. Regardless of the possibility that there was a screw up at the printers, there is no excuse for the poor quality of the manuscript. This book is not even ready to turn over to an editor, there are so many errors. There may be a good story under there with a few rewrites, but the typographical errors and inconsistencies in the writing keep jarring my attention from the story. Overall, this is a train wreck and the author deserved better from Palladium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, but...","review":"The story was very engaging and fun to read. Time slipped by quickly! Only problem is, kept getting drawn back into the \\"real world\\" whenever I would have to try and figure out what word was SUPPOSED to be there. It seems that the book was run through a spelling checker, but not a human checker. Words missing, paragraphs apparently missing, gramatical errors, and one or two wrong names (ie Mike talking to Mike) plagued the book. If it is possible, the book should be proofread then re-released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britax Quality & Safety","review":"You can't go wrong with any Britax product. This infant carseat is somewhat cumbersome, but it is for the baby's safety and protection. The cover is easy to wash and looks brand new after it air dries. Another great feature is that the sun shade gives ample coverage to shade my baby. The Peg Perego infant carseat did not have a large sunshade (I had the Peg for my first child). I also like that I can put the Britax Companion carseat in another car, which does not require the base (you can't do that with the Peg). I also love that this infant car seat attaches to the Britax Preview and Vigour strollers without special clips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Car Seat Ever","review":"My husband and I bought this seat because of Britax's reputation. We LOVE it. The seat is very sturdy and easy to use. The head protector is wonderful. We feel very safe having our little guy in this seat. We recommend it to everyone we know with infants.Some people have complained about the seat being too heavy. I don't find it too bad. I feel the heavier the better though, because it means my little boy is in a study, non-flimsy, safe seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best there is!","review":"I'm not a huge fan of the \\"baby bucket\\" because I think babies get stuck in them for too long, but we needed something we could take out of the heat of the car. I have been very, very pleased with the Companion car seat. It is heavy duty and the \\"roll bar\\" on the base is one of a kind. I feel very secure that my daughter is safe in this seat. My only complaints, and they are minor, is that the chest clip is kind of chincy. My daughter is able to undo it now at 10 months old. And the nylon fabric gets very hot, and she's often all sweaty when we take her out despite the car's air conditioning. But otherwise, I am very pleased with this car seat and highly recommend it. Britax is the best, and we are upgrading to the Marathon when our daughter outgrows this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Car Seat","review":"I really like this car seat. The head rest especially. It really holds a newborns head in place. It does get in the way a little when you are putting the straps on the baby's arms, but not enough to not love the car seat. I especially love the color for my little girl. All the pink car seats seem to get really dirty quickly. This color hides all the stains. The five point harness is also an easy way to put the baby in and out. It is very easy to get in and out of the base. I really recommend this car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"As promised","review":"We ordered this for our second car. The product arrived promptly, and works just fine with the Companion restraint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, too heavy, too hot. Do not buy this seat!","review":"I have hated this seat since day one. First, it is heavier than most seats. So, once your baby really starts growing (which happens quickly) it is just too darn heavy to carry. Second, the black is just way too hot, it's like putting your baby in a cooker (at least in the south) Third, the seat with base takes up waaaayyyy too much room in the back of the car (and I have a mid size suv) Forth, the cords are constantly getting tangled and it does not snap easily. Fifth, mine is very touchy to get in and out of the base and stroller--sometimes gets stuck. Add all this up with a baby who hates being in his car seat and it is not fun whatsoever.On a positive note, one thing that is great about it is the canopy. Definitely get a car seat with a canopy- this has been invaluable to have.I wish I had shopped around. But, being a first time Mom it's really hard to know what you'll need in a car seat. I would definitely NOT recommend this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big for most cars","review":"This car seat has a bounce rod on the back which makes it too big to fit in most of the cars. I was advised by the Plano Police Car Seat Inspections to return it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed, heavy, clumsy and not worth the money","review":"Having searched far and wide for a US made car seat for our first-born, we settled on the Britax Companion along with the Britax Vigour stroller.To say the least, we were deeply disappointing when we received the products. Both the stroller and car-seat are short on quality, clumsy and poorly designed. It is not worth the price being charged. As for safety, I hope we never have to find out.The product quality which one would expect from a child product is not there. It is heavy and if you are not well-built, it is going to be difficult to carry around. Neither does it operate smoothly and efficiently.If Britax is supposedly better than the other child product companies, I wonder about the quality of the products from other companies.Anyway, this would be the last Britax product we are ever going to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child Seat","review":"Product works well. Wish they were a little cheaper. $70 is kinda steep for just this base. But it is for one of the premier brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this seat","review":"I used this seat for my 2.5 year old daughter. She was able to use it until she was 10 months old. My older two children were out of their \\"bucket\\" before 6 months because of weight and height. It is slightly heavier than others but I didn't notice at all even with a 10 month old. Someone said it is not the prettiest and that is true however, it is the best \\"bucket\\" I have used and as we are expecting another child I just ordered a new cover for it from Britax and will continue to use it for my next child. My daughter was always comfortable and slept in in as I took her to and from day care 20 miles away from home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but a bit bulky","review":"Overall this is a great carseat. It's heavy though and a little bulky. The buttons on the handle aren't that easy to press and reposition. As another reviewer pointed out, you want a heavy carseat. At times though, it was too heavy for me (a weak, postpartum mom) to carry. The Britax stroller, however is great and the carseat easily fits into it. The stroller is light, collapes in a milisecond and is incredibly easy to move around. I wouldn't use the carseat without the stroller for more than a short trip out of the car, ie a long walk through a parking garage and your arms will by dying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instrument has flaws","review":"I found that the head joint has some damage in that the metal is chipped where the head joint and body connect.

While this headset is in use, the person you are talking to will hear an echo of their own voice on their end, and when it is unplugged, the echo goes away. I have tried this with a number of different people and none of them can talk to me while I use the headset because of the annoying echo.Sound quality for listening to music was fine, with no echo, but since this is a headset with a mic, being able to talk with it is pretty important.I don't know if everyone will have this same experience, or if any of the stereo headset alternatives are any better, but this one definitely did not work for me when it came to making calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Title","review":"This is nowhere near as robust as the title would lead one to believe. It implies that the contents of this book would be more detailed regarding the risque lives of Elizabethan times.

Immortality isn't always what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful picture of life and death","review":"This is definitely Burroughs's most powerful book since Naked Lunch, and perhaps my favorite after that. It's a wonderful journey through the lands of the dead, and offers a few clues into Burroughs' personal beliefs on the subject and how he feels death should be approached and life to be lived. Definitely read the first two novels in the trilogy first, though. Burroughs' books have always been less about narrative and more about painting a picture. This is a beautiful picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vast jigsaw puzzle where something important happens","review":"A rude and violent book of Burroughs which make think of Naked Lunch in the really violent moments with huge explosions and international conspirations. But this book is really hardcore and well done in the sense that it is the third book of the trilogy composed of Cities of the Red Night, Dead Roads. This book is the way to the land of the deads which is a difficult road with various cut-ups and flash forward. It is in a sense the new mythology for the electronic area, Burroughs imagine what it would be like if the pharaos lived in the subliminal electronic age, what humanity would be if the great moments of the world history where trapped with this sort of plot.In the same time Burroughs create a new piece to assemble in his huge jigsaw puzzle, where secret agents mixed with Egyptian mythology, and where the symbolic discovered by the pharaos was a key to the new symbolic interpretation of our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heads up...this version is not the complete story","review":"Just to let folks know--this version has passages that have been altered, shortened, or entirely removed from the original, and the ending is considerably changed.

I recommend the Penguin Classics edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story, and the extra stories are just bonuses to a great package.","review":"I read Maggie: A Girl of the Streets in about an hour and a half, but it didn't seem nearly that long, and I was sad when it was over. It's a very tragic story, and the reader feels real sympathy and pity for Maggie, making the end of the story even more sad. While I haven't read all of the other stories, the two that I have read were excellent. The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky was absolutely wonderful, and it's a testament to what love can do for someone. I read The Open Boat the other day, and I was impressed with that one as well. The camaraderie of the men in the boat was unparalled, and it really made me feel for them.

It made headlines back in the 1960's when it was banned for having too much sex. Now I wonder what all the fuss was about. There was a little bit of sex, a little bit of nudity - but only slightly more than Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl. Only the government could get worked up over this movie.The other 98% of the movie had to do with commentary on excessive militarism (this movie was made during the Vietnam era - the 1960's version of Iraq), Western support for Spanish dictator Franco, and social justice in Sweden. It might have been relevant at the time - and a small portion of it still is - but many of the ideas shown then seem quaint today.The movie (as well as the Blue version) might be good for historical purposes, but it just doesn't seem entertaining these days.

I was surprised by what a boring story it turned out to be. There really is no point in watching this beyond a time capsule of the 60's sociopolitical scene. The first hour is a rather dry docudrama in a faux-cinema verite style about the class system that exist(ed) in Sweden. The second half is mostly about Women's Rights and the point of controversy sex scenes are there to show case the gender based power struggles in society rather than as porn.

In the process, he disappoints his working-class father, loses his beloved girlfriend, and meets humiliation and failure.The execution, unfortunately, is awful. Except for a very young Kelly Ripa, who plays the role of the girlfriend quite charmingly, the actors are just awful. You'd think Robbie Bryan would be believable in the part of the struggling actor, since he wrote the movie, which is based on his own life story, but I'm afraid Mr. Bryan has absolutely no talent whatsoever. The rest of the cast is not much better and the directing manages to be clichéd and slightly ridiculous.Unless you want to be an actor, and need to be reminded that the path is hard and the odds of success are minimal, there's no reason to see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check it out from the library","review":"This is the story of a young man who heads to New York to follow his dream of being an actor. It shows how hard it truly is to break into the business, even if a star recommends you for a job.If you are getting this because you are a Kelly Ripa fan, she does play her part well. But she is not a main character in the movie. I would have rated this movie only one star, but as others have said, the sub-plot with Lou Myers. He plays a former Negro League baseball player who is bitter and becomes friends with the main character played by Robbie Bryan.

He wrote the script: just as bad as his acting! I think the director won an award. I hate to see the films that lost. In one scene, the camera is behind the open door, and we don't see the girl until she enters the room.

I devoured the book in a few hours and read it again immediately thereafter. (I NEVER re-read anything.)I'm not a Macintosh fan, but I appreciate that David Pogue is definitely a Mac expert. I didn't see anything wrong with his using the book to toot the Mac's horn a little bit.

It is refreshing to read a story that could really be happening. The premis was excellent as well as scarey for those of us who rely on PCs and the internet. It was easy to imagine myself in the story, not merely observing. Characters were a little two dimensional and innocent (or guilty) but that was a minor deterant from the overall enjoyment of the book. If there is any real criticism it is the fact that by time I read the book some of the technology was obsolete (although speech recognition is still in its infancy.)

And I when I read the back of the book I thought it held the possibility of maybe being a real page turner. However, as I've already said I was gravely disappointed by it.This book seemed to be more like a cheesey action film in print, with parts of a term paper on Egyptology thrown in for good measure inbetween. True, I have never read any other Slade works, and I know that Death's door is just a part in a series of novels dealing with the same character(s), so maybe I am lacking some necessary insight, but this is definitely a novel that sadly disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was the first book I read by Slade, and I was surprised how amatuerish it was, being their tenth book. There was a considerable amount of research put into this book, and it was appreciated, but it's no substitute for good storytelling. A good story should draw you in, making you feel like a part of what's going on. Slade makes you feel that you're being told about something they experienced themselves, and the occasional personal opinions they throw in only only pull you farther away. They draw heavily from Stephen King, but they should leave it to those who do it well. Allusions are made only to have them immediately explained in detail. Slade must think we're ignoramuses! They also kept beating us over the head with the idea of how important beauty is in Hollywood. Enough already! We get it!

How it gets from point A to point B is unclear, and at least a little bit uninteresting._Death's Door_ seems to me as though the goal of the writer was to become known for the most gory and graphic set of serial killers on record. In this, Slade succeeds admirably-- the abominations range from particularly nasty snuff to child torture to necrophilia-- all in a mere 368 pages.Unfortunately, the book is less successful in creating coherent characterization or plot. I never fully got the Special X thing, and the serial killer is so over-the-top bad he brought Boris Badinoff to mind more quickly than Hannibal Lector. And as for a good explanation of the whole Mummy thing? Forget it.

This replacement part is not the same as the one on the original WaterPik. None of the tips will fit. I was not satisfied with what they sent me so I returned it in their box with the return label. Boy was I surprised when they did not accept the return and sent it back to me. I made lots of waves with Amazon who did finally refund my account.Do yourself a favor and spend $30 more and buy a new WaterPik"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work, waste of money.....","review":"You are wasting your money on this repair kit. The hose breaks because it is brittle. It will eventually break at a point where you no longer can attach replacement hose at the unit or wand end. Thus - your WaterPik is ready for the trash can.Hmmm, is this by design. Has a \\"consumable\\" been built in to this great product? I think so.For this reason, I will buy no more WaterPiks. Surely, better design can come up with a hose formulation that does not become brittle."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAY be replacement for old style. Won't work for New Style handle","review":"I uploaded a picture of what was sent me. The official picture is of a new style handle with a round hole. What was sent was the old style handle which has a hex hole for the tip and a sliding pressure controller on the handle.If you need a replacement for an old style handle then I assume this will work for you. But if you only have a button on the handle and the hole for your tip is circular not hexagonal, then this will not work.Again, when I ordered a picture of a handle with a blue button was displayed. This picture ought to be removed as it is inaccurate. I am guessing that Goodman has so many products that the wrong picture just slipped through. My order did include tubing, an old style handle and the angle piece that connects to the base.I gave this one star because it was clearly not what was displayed in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Do not waste your money !!! Did not work - leaked like a sieve. Cost me $13 with shipping. I could have applied that to the purchase of a new water-pik.

After one week the new hose blew out of the old hose where it was connected as the old hose had developed a tear at the connection site. This was a complete and total waste of time and money. Why WaterPik doesn't make a kit to replace the part that you can unscrew underneath the unit that has the hose connection and the assembly then connects directly to the pump...but I quess we all know THAT answer; they want you to have to purchase an entire new unit! Do not waste your money on this useless kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste on money and energy","review":"Following the instructions, it's very difficult to attach the new hose to the old.

I was sent one with six sides and it requires a different design. I does not work with the round pics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Do not buy this kit. The reason your hose broke to begin with is it has become brittle with age. Thus, the plastic connector that attaches the new hose line to the old hose will continue to break through the old hose side. As well, the new hose will not stay lodged into the tip connector. I have even tried the heating method, to try to 'shrink wrap' the hose safely onto the connector. And, waterpik (thoughtfully) allows no access to attach the new hose directly to the motor (which would alleviate one of these problems). So we are all stuck replacing our waterpiks every 18 - 24 months, as I have done for about 15 years now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waterpik Hose Repair Kit","review":"I had no problem splicing the hose according to the instructions. I was surprised to find out, however, that the new handle did not accept the jet tips that came with my Waterpik. I had to order new ones -- \\"BRJ\\" tips.

The delay and extra shipping cost were irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money and time","review":"The other two reviewers have it right on. This repair kit is essentially useless.

This product is great and exactly like the original. But if your plastic tubing is brittle like mine was, the recommended repair included in the kit will not work.

Don't let their age fool you, Silvertide knows classic rock. Having opened for bands like Van Halen they know what it takes to make real music. This is one of the few albums i refuse to skip tracks on, every song on it is filled with pure talent and musical genius. While all the songs are undeniably great, I do have several favorites such as \\"Devil's daughter\\", \\"Blue jeans\\", and \\"Mary Jane!\\" If you remember what good music is supposed to sound like, you'll love this album.

It really is a throwback to some of the great classic rock of the 70's, but with a little something extra to make it special, and bring it into the 2000's. Every song is great with no filler tracks. I think the comparisons to Aerosmith and the Black Crowes are pretty accurate. If you're a fan of either of those bands, or even a casual listener, you will love Silvertide! I can see Lafty and Perri as the new generation's Tyler and Perry of Aerosmith. Lafty has as much charisma as Tyler ever did, and maybe even more, while Perri plays some tremendous solos. The rhythm section of Frank, Weaver, and Melchiorre round out the band and provide the structure for Perri and Lafty to drive from. If you're interested in this band, you definitely have to see them live!

Listen to this album if you care anything about the origins of the most sucessful heavy metal band in history. The long epic songs and the \\"Almighty Riff\\" rule this album from the beginning to end. The drums may sound cheesy, but what it comes down to is the fact that these guys made this music in a wave of music that was more powerful than any other music movement in the last hundred years. Of the thousands of albums that came out in the four most important years in the history of heavy metal, this album is the cream of the crop."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad remix of the awesome original.","review":"Metal Blade decided to commemorate Diamond Head by re-releasing this incredible album. Unfortunately, they decided to remix the sound, and it was a HUGE mistake. Now some of the songs actually have a disco-like drum sound, the vocal tracks they used are not all the originals, and in general they really screwed up a great album. Stick with the vinyl if you can find it, but if you can't then this will have to suffice. It is still Diamond Head which is why it got two stars; Metal Blade should get no stars for this abortion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanatastic could not put it down.","review":"Read the book when it first came out.

It works as a great supplement. It's very fast and easy reading and it helps readers understand how everything and everyone throughout history is tied together (hence the name \\"The Human Web\\"). It's the basic premise of history--cause and effect. If you are just starting to study history (or doing so because you have to) or just a casual fan, this is a great book to read.

A good starting point for people who want to learn about the past and need a starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Book with a Lacking Main Idea","review":"I found that this book's central idea of the various webs that have connected mankind through the course of history is supported with many details that are too specific. For example, the book talks about how the camel connected Western and Eastern Africa, namely the Ghanaian Empire and the Wangara tribe. Nevertheless, this book presented that material which could have easily been summarized in a paragraph in one chapter. This makes the writing very boring to read. Also, there are multiple chapters in this book that are devoted to the camel. It touches various details of each culture that are completely unnecessary and doesn't go into depth with any of these details. It brushes every culture but none of its details would make any sense to anyone with prior background knowledge. This is book can be understood properly but I believe it needs some complementary education. For this reason I am giving the book one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be better!","review":"This a killer live cd but there should be more songs.Thats the only reason I gave it 4 stars.

Now as a senior electrical engineering student, I still use it if I need to reference stuff that I forgot.Just a warning though, if you want to be good in calculus don't just read the Cliffs and your textbook.

The reviews of what differentiation and integration really are have no depth to them, so those sections are of limited use in bringing you back up to speed in calculus.This makes the book almost totally a collection of sections of the form:Here is a type of mathematical expression and this is how we differentiate (integrate) it, with some examples.One of my college math professors referred to these problems as \\"plug and chug\\", where you simply execute the rules without having any real understanding of the concept.

I totally fine with reading about that stuff every now & then because I don't take it too seriously like some others do. I take it as what it is which is just a fiction book. But, I just think it's a little odd that it's in all the series. Kind of weird. Other then my minor complaint about that, this was a wonderful start to this series & I can't wait to read the rest. In this book you will meet several different people but none of them really pulled me into the book like some of the other book I've read from this author. This is the only reason I rated it 4 stars rather then 5 because I liked it but I wouldn't go as far as to say that I loved it. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Type","review":"I love V.C. Andrews books, but Ruby and Melody were the ones that I hated the most. I hope that Giselle girl doesn't come after me, but if you do it's just my opinion. I thought that Ruby was a nice girl, but she kept on letting Giselle get her into trouble instead of fighting back like she should've. That showed that she was weak.

It's the best one V.C. Andrews wrote so far. Even though Ruby is the main character in the book, her twin sister , Gisselle, steals the show. Her character's back-stabbing and manipulations bring out the series. Her stepmother, Daphne, does so also.Ruby is too goody-goody. That's the reason the character Giselle outshines her with her sterotypical stuck-up rich girl act. You'll love this book. Even though Gisselle is manipulative, you'll love her, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is definitely the best of all her series.","review":"I am a huge V.C. Andrews fan. I have read all of her books. I eagerly wait for each new book and series. However, I think this book is the first of the best of all of her series. Of course, I am biased because I am from Louisiana. The majority of the information is true about Louisiana, but some of it is over-exaggerated. None-the-less, she must have come to Louisiana and observed to be able to know some of the things mentioned in the book.

I dont know what they are saying! There are no instructions other then how to make your characters and what your SIMS need. I found it very difficult to understand what to do. I went into the town and got stuck there for 1 hour, literaly! The character went into the bathroom every minute. This game is extemely boring and very annoying.

The book is an easy read over a weekend or while waiting at airports. It will not scholastically exhaust you nor keep you awake at night pondering some esoteric message. Unfortunately it will not excite, enthuse, or tantalize you. It's plot was trite, its \\"twists\\" predictable, and its characters one dimensional.

They were not involved in the main events. She didn't even talk about what happened to them at the end. The judge is the only one that matters, and she didn't even write about him all that much.

There are a few interwoven story lines. If you are interested in restaurants and/or cooking, food and restaurant trends, or just the type of films that have more character exploration than action, you will enjoy this one. The actor who played an art critic taking some artists and hangers on to dinner was so effective at his role that I felt uncomfortable watching him.

The women in the film were good but the mens interaction with one another was fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"Initially, when I heard about this movie, it really didn't interest me. A mobster movie that takes place in a restaurant? Every mobster movie does that for at least five minutes and then goes on to the more interesting aspects of mob life. Yeah, Italian mobsters eat in Italian restaurants, but that's just where they eat. If I wanted to see food or people eat, I'd just watch the food network. So, yeah, this movie didn't interest me at first, but it's really quite good! I'm so glad I saw it! The pace of the movie is so fast, and yet it flows so naturally. I didn't expect the cool ending, mostly because the story just kept developing and developing and it seemed like the night would just go on forever (in a good way). It's like a really long episode of Cheers but in a fancy New York restaurant with mobsters and hipsters. All of the characters are fascinating and charismatic. It's a very rewarding movie definately worth seeing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Entertaining","review":"The characters are what drive this movie and make it fun to watch. Though I realize that last lobster dish he created for the stuck-up food critic was meant to be ridiculous, I still found myself drooling all over the couch. Danny Aiello is perfect as the low-key restauraunt owner who is not impressed with his star chef son's cuisine.The events are realistic, and I loved the pretentious, condesending \\"Fitzgerald\\" jerk who just rips his waitress to shreds with his lowbrow, rude remarks. The gay maitere D was hilarious as was the ... bartender who challenges his customers to trivia and rakes in the dough. My only semi-complaint was the ending which I found to be rather predictable and unbelievable, saw it coming a mile away.Still, this is a great indy film, and a must-see for anyone who works or has worked in a trendy restaurant."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love?","review":"Another great performance by Danny Aiello.

The only purpose of remembering Beria at all is to remember what pure evil, the devil and Hell is, and how the Russian people got there. At best, the book is fiction, and it made me angry at Sergo for writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificently...","review":"This is a very good book about a very interesting and controversial man.

But, I have since downloaded it from here. This music does NOT disappoint! One song after another of absolute VNV NATION BLISS! I cannot dissect this track by track, because the entire thing is great. From beginning to end, It's a non-stop thrill ride. (I'm listening to it on my mp3 player as I write this.) I think my favorite tracks would have to be \\"Saviour (vox)\\", \\"Further\\", and \\"Fragments\\". Saviour because of the lyrics (they really give you a sense of how powerful Ronan's voice is), \\"Fragments\\" for the longer introduction and the beat, and \\"Further\\" because of the fact that I hadn't heard this track before. I saw theses guys during their \\"Of Faith, Power and Glory\\" tour in Boston, and they put on a GREAT live show. If they come to your area, BY ALL MEANS, SEE THEM. They will not disappoint you! Neither will \\"Burning Empires\\". Get the download. If you love techno, you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I own these shoes in red and am very disappointed. The leather is nice and soft, however it is so soft that the shoes give no support on the side and it looks like my feet are double their normal width. The sole does not cover the toe portion (as many other moccasins do) and now my bright red shoes have a huge white wear mark across the toe portion (imagine you were in ballet slippers up on toepoint-- that portion is completely worn). I must say- I own several pairs of mocassins but none were such terrible quality. I loved the way these looked that I ordered 5 pairs in various sides and colors and EVERYTHING went back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clinical Aromatherapy for Pregnancy and Childbirth","review":"This is definately a book for midwives or aromatherapists taking an active part in a clients pregnancy and labour. Denise is exceptional in her field and is certainly making a effort to bring down the boundries, incorporating aromatherapy into a field that is dominated by the current medical field. I certainly found this book informative, if some what heavy duty reading with all the clinical back up, but understand the necessity thereof. The only reason why I gave four instead of five stars to this book was that I had really hoped that there would have been more illustrations and techniques on the massage aspect of aromatherapy during pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple Corer/Slicer","review":"I would only give this item 2 stars.

The cast is quite good; and though it is a bit of a fanciful tale, suspending reality inasmuch as Disney can, it is wonderful family escapism. Don't miss the shark hunt; it was probably the best scene in this film. My only problem with it is could have been a fantastic daytime scene; alas, it took place at night! Small quibble, though. Still excellently produced and paced. Wish it were out on video, but as with most Disney films under the Eisner regime, it has probably disappeared for a very long time (forever)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"\\"The Banquo Legacy\\" suffers by obviously being a non-Doctor Who novel with Doctor Who grafted onto it. A typical, almost cliched gothic mystery is given a few SF motifs, and a very trite explanation is given for the Doctor and Fitz's involvement (Compassion is almost a non-player).Not the worst EDA, but it does manage to mark time until the next novel, the end of the Faction Paradox cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hillsong's best!","review":"I can't say enough about this project.

Thus, this novel opened up a new frontier starting with the \\"Great Game\\".But it was the ending of the book that brought about my need for discussion.

But I noticed throughout the week that the weights varied even when the variables didn't. I.e. I didn't eat or drink, or pooped or peed. :) Well, at least it got our luggage thru the airline with the silly 50lbs limit and 1 suitcase per person (how?? for a 2 week vacation??). But even when I weighed myself on the scale with the luggage held, it varied w/in 2 lbs with no changes to me or the luggage. I did multiple attempts to get a good average, which one wouldn't need to if the scale was somewhat precise. the floors were tiled so it's even or as even as it can be. Even switched between different tiles to be safe.Like others said, I'm really surprised this was consumer report's top scale.

Nice design, mainly very good reviews, and despite the negative reviews of the fluctuating inaccurate weigh-ins, I took the chance and bought it. Unfortunately, I am one of the unlucky ones stuck with a scale that doesn't weigh accurately.Not only did it not correspond to my weight as it appeared on my current non-digital scale, but one minute I would weigh a certain # of lbs. and literally 3 minutes later weigh 8 lbs more! Then another few minutes later, 4 lbs less! The scale wildly fluctuates. Then I got the \\"Err\\" message on the screen, and immediately stepped off as the instructions say. However,the manual says only to get off the scale if it says ERR. But it doesn't say how to fix this or deal with this.So now I'm returning it and am really annoyed because I have to pay $6 for return shipping and the scale only cost $22!

Stepping on it each morning, I will get the same weight as long as I don't do the following: I pick up the cat, who weighs about 11 pounds, step on the scale, and it will give me the combined weight; I get off, step back on and it will give me a weight different from the first one. In other words, I could weigh the same forever, if I didn't jolt it loose with the cat. Called Taylor.

Get something else - not a Taylor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Simply doesn't work. There is some writing on the back of the scale body (get out your magnifying glass...) that indicates the scale needs to be made ready by stepping on it, ignoring the reading, and then stepping off if the scale has been moved. Otherwise, if it has remained on a hard surface without being moved, that step isn't necessary. In other words, it will give a bad reading unless it is \\"reset\\" under certain circumstances.

The only minor negative I've found is that the surface is very cold to my feet (this could be a benefit in the summer), so I've resorted to wearing lightweight slippers when stepping on it.

I weight 155.0, for example. However, if I weigh myself 1 minute later, then I noticed that the weight has CHANGED! Also, if I stand on the scale with a 25lbs. weight, and then re-weigh myself, my new weight is now different at ~156.2. Finally, suppose that I drank exactly a pound of water, which is a pint. Now, my weight on the scale is still 155.0. Therefore, for the most accurate weight, you must average the last 3 days of weights, and have your weight measured at the same time each morning, and under the same conditions (i.e. after going to the bathroom, before eating breakfast).I'm rating this product 2* because of this random fluctuation, as well as my fat-percent never working for me. Finally, my device only lasted 3 years, and the CR 2043 batter didn't last long towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and stylish for the price.","review":"I have one of these and it is accurate and doesn't look like a scale covering your bathroom floor space.I used it also to weigh luggage prior to flying within maximum weight limits.

I haven't had this scale but a few months & it broke. I am the only one in my house so I know no one has abused it to cause it's faulty-ness. When you touch it to turn it on it will zero then start jumping up & down with weight while no one or nothing is on it. Then it will give you either 3 little lines --- or give you an Err. It does this all the time. Tried replacing the batteries thinking that maybe it didn't have enough juice to work properly but that didn't help any. This scale is JUNK! Really angry I waisted my money & didn't read all the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and looks great.","review":"Rating would be 5 stars except for the fact that the instructions didn't explain how to identify a weak battery versus a defective scale.

Stupid me.The only thing that was fantastic about this purchase is that it arrived here in two days! Super fast. However as for the item itself... first of all the package seal was broken. So that was a good way to start.. Then this scale is crazy! It's all over the place. I literally stepped on it 5 separate times and each time it would give me something COMPLETELY different! I know I weigh around 145-150. So when I stepped on it for the first time and it gave me 120.5 I knew something was wrong. Stepped on it again, 152 (more believable). Stepped on it again, 135.

I tested it out by using .435 pound weights that I had lying around. The reading on the scale never changed with me adding one of the weights to my own. Still no change when I got back on holding (2) of the weights in hand(.87 pounds). Finally, I went back on holding 1.3 pounds, then the scale showed it. I continued to keep adding weights and the same thing continued. This scale does not register until you change your weight by more than a pound. So, why the tenths position??? I went up to (7) of the weights (3 pounds), and then reversed the procedure. The same thing carried on, except I never got back to my original weight, with no weights in hand. I was now 1.2 pounds heavier than when I started. Not a very accurate scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taylor Scale","review":"I don't know if I got a defective one , but this scale broke down after the 30th use. I never use it and its just stored.

I suspected a problem with the scale. I borrowed a doctors' pedestal scale - the balance-beam type that you stand on - and brought it home. I would weigh myself on the doctors' scale, and then immediately on the Taylor Digital. I found that the Taylor was not consistent. It would differ from the doctors' scale by anywhere from .8 to 2.0 pounds. If the difference had been consistent I would have lived with it, but it might be off .8 pound one day, and 2 pounds the next day. I threw it away. My advice - don't buy.

I failed to read the bad ones, and here I am writing one now. At first, I thought I was going nuts because it was showing that I had gained 5 lbs over one weekend. Everyone cheats in their diet- but not to cause a 5lb weight gain, especially when you are active. So I decided to check my weight daily - and again, it was a 2-5lb difference every day. This morning, I decided to get on and off several times and see if there's a difference. I went from losing 2 lbs, to gaining 5 lbs, to losing 4 lbs all in the matter of 5 minutes.

In addition, the readings I received fluctuated by as much as 2 pounds within minutes of each reading.I asked my wife to do a side-by-side comparison with the professional balance scale at the ER where she works as a nurse.

That's a 20% error(Yes, I checked the barbell against two other scales and it was 1 oz. over 10 lbs.So what's the use in even having it take up space.

I don't trust it at all. There is nothing more useless than a faulty scale so I would counsel anyone who is in the market to purchase a new bathroom scale to avoid this one.

Yes, I removed the plastic strip beneath the lithium battery. I also installed a fresh lithium battery. Nothing. To be honest, I did not take the scale out of the box until just over a year after I received it. There was no sign of corrosion in the battery compartment.

It's mostly dialogue - like a drama, or a screenplay. The reader has to fill in the details. It's called active reading. Not that you can't read the book as a light read but if you're reading passively and expecting revelations, well, it's not going to happen. However, if you use the book as a basis for extrapolation of social comment, you may get what you are looking for.For those of you with no imagination, don't read the book; see the film or better yet, the play.

Despite my best efforts, I couldn't convince myself to get past page 80, and finally decided to give up when I realized I was dreading picking up the book. The main character is neither likable nor dislikable enough to to be compelling - he's just whiny and obnoxious.

In this way the movie is much better, but on the other hand the actors and actresses are looking too good for transmitting to us the details of the relationships. We think that the sound in the movie fits very well Generally the book is very easy to read. You can read and understand the whole story without a problem, it is no problem to read the book in one gp. Afterwards it is interesting to talk about the deeper sense of the story or at least some parts of it. We don't believe, that this kind of story could come true in reality. If humans would be like that, life were depressing. You don't know exactly the reasons why the persons react like they do, that's why the book seems a little bit unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy!","review":"It's a simple book. It's not interesting to read, because each sentence is repeated many times. You can understand this book very easily. It's not written with many vomplicated words. The film is much better. Dustin Hoffmann as Ben is a wonderful star. But Mrs. Robinson is too pretty for him. She could have seduced much more interesting men. In the book the countryside isn't described. But the film has got a wonderful countryside like in Paradise. It's obvoious that there will be a happy ending. All in all the book is normal store book which you can buy at every corner.

The whole story is on a very low level. Why did the author write such a stupid, foolish book? Is this his opinion of social life of young people? We hate this book and we'll never read it again. Maybe we have another mentality than Americans have, but we were absolutely shocked. And we couldn't find any humour and we didn't enjoy reading this book. The people in this book are very superficial and have no intention than love, affairs, but they don't know real love. It shows a very bad opinion of people.

So, she invents stupid stories about Ben and tells them Elaine. After telling those stories, Elaine is hating Ben, and she don't marry him. That book makes me laughing, a man wants to marry a girl but she has no interests in him. What a stupid idea! Ben is too naiv, perhaps he thought, that he can buy all things, also hearts, with money! All is in this text: Love, relationships, betrayl, broken friendship and scream with frustration! Dustin Hoffmann is the most perfect person to play the role of Ben in that movie. Dustin is a joker like Ben."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN ABSOLUTELY STUPID STORY!","review":"Thee novel is stupid and unreal. It's written in an easy language. The whole story is about superficial things, and not about real feelings. We don't like stories which are so far away from our daily life. It can't be reommended to be read. It's not worth reading it We weren't very happy about seeing the film, it was neither boring because the film is quite old nor a \\"classical\\" for us. The American way of life is not attractive to us.

I thought the movies witty dialogue came from the pen of Buck Henry, so I was really amazed to find that much of it was written by Charles Webb.

Good luck finding a copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Graduate - fails","review":"I'm not a fan of this book. Even knowing it was written by an individual who had recently graduate from college and it was supposed to be something fighting against the establishment does little to increase its standing in opinion.

Sadly, it would be disappointing even if it hadn't followed the incredible Marbles. There's just nothing here. Last time I tried to listen to it, I don't think I got even halfway through. It was just stupefyingly dull. Even \\"Faith,\\" which we've enjoyed as a live acoustic piece for years, gets heavy sedation here and ends a low-note album on the band's lowest note yet.I'm very worried that the next album will be produced by Michael Hunter, too, whose own stuff is ambient and softly pretty but also so uninteresting as to be nearly unlistenable for me.Sad to say it, but for me this is the low point of Marillion's career. Wake up, guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"As a big Marillion fan it is sad to say that this is the most horrible record they've made so far. The first two songs are good to listen to but after those it just fades out.I don't know why the band is still labeled as a progressive rock band. This was once the case in the Fish era, but after H. took over the singing the band redused to a regular pop band.H. started prommising with \\"season's end\\" and the \\"Brave\\" album is still a great album.

I also realize it's expected that each reviewer give a history of loyalty. 20 years a fan, enough said??There is nothing surprising about SE, no new ground broken. It's not a spectacular CD but it's pretty good. Most Toys is downright annoying I hate to say and the Last Century For Man does nothing for me at all. It's a nice 'try peace' piece. The Wound seems to lose coherency in its final 3 minutes or so. The single is good in the context of the CD but doesn't exist well on it's own.

About halfway through the first listen, I wished I could get my money back. I forced myself to finish the first listen, and tried giving it a second...As many have mentioned, it's uninspiring. But it's H's vocals that kill it for me. I don't seem to recall his voice on SE being so... thin, brittle, weak. It's just awful! I can't think of anything positive to say about this disc... If I could give it zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look \\"somewhere else\\"","review":"After the return to form with their fantastic album Marbles, Marillion take about ten steps backward with this latest offering. While their previous effort had some poppy songs, at least it also had some proggy epics. This CD is pure pop without the tasteful melodies or catchiness. One of the worst tracks on this album, See it Like a Baby, was set as the first single.

This band has always represented my iconoclast take on popular music. It's always (especially with this band) a personal choice. While, for me, every prior CD (with the possible exception of Season's End and Brave) had a few tracks worth skipping, I could rely on a clever lyric or tasteful twist to captivate me. Weak lyrically, too much of the material seems anxious to sell out in a desperate attempt to become relevant. Still a talented and largely ignored band, this disc will give the critics (who I love to hate) legitimate reasons to continue ignoring Marillion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writeup of a 1930's Trek into Tibet & back thru Burma","review":"I picked up an old (1935) edition a few years ago and have read it cover to cover two or three times now. Kaulback writes in quite a chatty humorous style, tells a good story of the expedition and the trials and tribulations of trekking up from Assam through the Himalaya, across parts of Tibet and back down into Burma to Fort Hertz. Some good descriptions of leeches in the jungle - I can personally vouch for the accuracy of his portrayal of Burmese leeches, having suffered through a couple of attacks by the little blighters myself!Most of the places he trekked through are almost impossible to get to these days and the descriptions of them are worth the price of the book alone if you can track it down.

Why do I think her ex-husband and the poor children who will one day read this self-important nonsense might disagree?

It is not a journey through a custody battle, but a journey through the psyche of a women and the emotional obstacles she faces as she searches for the person she wants to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better memoirs of divorce in my lifetime.","review":"This book's flawed approach lies in the fact Ms. Swallow's sermonic endeavor is aimed towards an audience that frankly does not exist, or if there is such existence of a readership intrigued by the intricacies of a highly dull divorce saga, then said population of readers is not sufficient enough to mandate such a lengthy exposition on a personal odyssey of pain and suffering, most of which is remarkably undeserving of public pity and sympathy. Ms. Swallow's flimsy approach to autobiography reflects her obvious call for the reader's commiseration, and her tone at times dangerously obscures the line between the legitimate and the pathetic. The topic of divorce is a highly energizing issue for today's society in which the marital split is so prevalent, but Ms. Swallow's work fails to capitalize on the great potential that is present in such an engaging and relevant contemporary discourse."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, slow, vapid - glad i got it from the library","review":"i read a review of this book on amazon.com that was very favorable - did we read the same book? i almost wonder if i should rate this book at all, considering that i only got through about 75 pages. usually i'll force myself to finish any book, but this was such a waste of time that i returned it immediately. good for my pocketbook, since it's the first book i've actually returned on time to the library in years! thanks wendy. better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"I'd read all the reviews which were, for the most part, positive. The phone arrived on time from the shipper. I loaded the SIM, but then every time I opened the slider and pressed with any pressure at all, the phone would short out and turn off. Don't know if this problem is specific to my phone, but the slider concept appears inherently risky given the moving parts. Too bad, I wanted a quad-band phone to use internationally, but this won't be the one - I've gone ahead and ordered a Samsung 'candy bar' phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known better","review":"I bought this phone in july 2010 for my mom. We are in March 2011 and already giving headaches. At first I was crazy over it and happy that mom liked it so much, but now I feel ashamed whenever she complains about it. It is still cute, but the back simply won't stay in place. No later than 2 days ago a tiny piece came out of it and she had to use nail tools to get it back in place.

It's slim, easy to use and is generally a nice phone. Then it started to randomly shut down and reboot while I read text messages, while I wrote text messages, while I looked to see what time it was, in the middle of conversations, and even while simply sliding the phone open. This happens about two times a week and it is very annoying. Other folks have posted this same defect online but T-Mobile refuses to acknowledge that there is anything wrong.

Also the left soft key did not work and kept launching the the app attached the key below it.In addition the slider mechanism worked like crap. It did not slide the way it should. The phone....even for $64 should work and be as advertised. Also the box it came in was a plain motorola box and not the official packaging of the RIZR.I have also seen many poor reviews in regards to the business practices and ethics of the OEM SHOP and i must say I am appalled that Amazon.com does business with them.I will never buy anything from OEM SHOP again....ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered an unlock world phone was sent T-Mobile phone instead","review":"I ordered an unlocked world phione and was sent an unlocked T-mobile phone.

For the most part I like it; not sure what I would have gotten instead. It works nicely, has the features I need, and the audio quality is significantly better than any other phone I've had.A few notes:- One thing that hadn't occurred to me with the slider design: there's only one display, and it's color. I'm used to using my phone as a watch, but, with this one, I have to poke it to make it turn on the backlight. For this reason alone, my next phone might be a clamshell.- The vibrator is wimpy, to the point that I miss calls sometimes.- The battery indicator is screwy - the battery is always completely full until it's empty.- Getting it configured to work with my carrier (I think they're called ATT this week) was more work than I had expected. Non-technonerd people are likely to need help to get things like web browsing or GPRS working.Overall it's a great phone, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal mumbler","review":"People don't even know how bad this is because they have not seen GOOD magic.The real magic at work here is the hype and the publicity machine.

But when it came to the guy leveltating, I laughed myself silly it is so obvious how it is done. .........I am sorry Charles to share this with you, but it was terrible.

Many laypeople think he is so \\"amazing\\". When you talk about magic the first thing they think of is David Blaine. A lot of people have heard of him, but have never heard of GREAT magicians like David Copperfield and Jay Sankey. The truth about David Blaine is this:David Blaine dosn't make his own magic. He goes into a magic shop, buys something, and does it on the street. David COPPERFIELD, makes his own magic, and sooooo many laypeople havn't even heard of him! And the truth about the levitation is that he does the balduci levitation, but then edits the video to make it look like both his feet are lifing 4 feet off the ground! He also hires stooges.

If you like street magic in general or just David Blaine you should definitely buy this DVD.

If you watch the \\"torn card\\" trick, its pretty easy to spot the mis-direction, he takes the torn card in his left hand, but then places the supposedly torn pieces back in the volunteer's hand with his right hand.His levitation trick is very good, but the fact that he makes everyone watch it from the same angle (and its only filmed from that angle) is a huge tip-off.Still, quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST MAGIC TRICKS EVER!!!!!","review":"When I first seen heard about this movie I thought, oh okay another one of those cheap magic movies again.

David Blaine absolutely does nothing original, exciting, or entertaining. The majority of his dull presentations are filmed in the low-income Ghetto of an inner city. He shows various racial and ethnic minorities a multitude of trite card tricks for most of the DVD. Even at the end of the presentation when he traps himself into a giant ice-cube left me bored and irritated. There was absolutely nothing interesting, entertaining, or unique in this film.I've watched David Copperfield's DVD entitled Illusion which was profoundly impressive. David Copperfield does exciting and professional illusions and magic that feature elaborate presentations inside lavish theaters and outdoors, too. David Copperfield sets the standard and unfortunately David Blaine falls flat. David Blaine can't even compete with the pretentious Criss Angel.I give this DVD an F-."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL! EXCEPTIONALLY GORGEOUS!","review":"I loved this book from front to back. It gave me an inside perspective on how black models are treated in the fashion industry. After being brain washed and white washed by dozens of \\"Vogue,\\" \\"Glamour,\\" and \\"Cosmo\\" magazines, I had lost sight of how beautiful and elegant black models/women are. This is unfortunate but true and can only account for the racist attitudes and standards that Western society (especially America) has against ethnic (African, Asian, Latin, and Native American Indian) beauty. Ethnic beauty is copied and exploited. You can see it in every page of the most popular fashion magazines. I also read Eileen Ford's comment about this book. She was wrong wasn't she.

It is unquestionably a work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is called a writing class and the author missed it.","review":"I was very excited to read this book and I was highly disappointed.

The was a two paragraph mention about black male models. what about children models? What about the effects of we are portrayed in advertisements through history? Where is the history?

It may be the best cheezy album ever--the songwriting is great, and in a day before digital recording, it was made (or overmade) with an incredible amount of care. Stephen Chrumbacher's voice is unusual but fits his writing perfectly. The rest of the playing and singing is simply perfect--maybe too perfect? The first time I ever heard this on tape (a kid in my youth group had left it lying around), I knew I shouldn't like it but I just couldn't help myself. I was as happy to have this album make the jump to mp3 a few years ago as any other. Bottom line, you won't want your friends to know you listen to it, but you'll love it.

I also have very curly and frizzy hair but I like to wear is straight, the straightener smoothes out all of my curls and I find that after I use the straightener my hair is no longer frizzy. I bought this straightener about 3 months ago and have used it just about everyday since. Even though I use the straightener almost everyday I don't find that my hair is dry or course. My hair even stays straight after sleeping on it although sometimes I have the time in the morning to touch it up, and make it really straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't call it Ceramic when the coating comes off.","review":"I was so psyched to buy this straightener, and I loved it for like 2 weeks. Then I noticed that the ceramic coating on was starting to come off. Less than two months later, my straightener has huge exposed sections of metal. Worse yet, the manufacturer (Helen of Troy) will only exchange it for a new one-- which will take at least 3 weeks and simply give me yet another faulty product.

Because of the lack of example exams and general knowledge on what to expect people are hungry for a good study guide.This is not a good study guide. It covers the easy topics with great detail. It talks about things that don't show up on the exam (i.e. good coding style). It skips over more difficult topics and suggests that the reader find a good reference.I recommend that you read Colin Moock's reference, then if you want a good study guide download the test outline from Macromedia and buy the condensed pocket reference to Mr. Moock's book.Study, and practice and you're sure to pass.

Unfortunately, there was no entertainment involved. Like many of the other reviewers, I hated Kate. I was not really attached to any of the characters, but I found Kate really detestable. I thought she was snobby. I appreciated that she had a semi-rough childhood and wanted something better for herself as an adult. Then when she finally got it, she really seemed to be arrogant and forget those who stood by her side while she was growing up. I also was not crazy about Billy. I thought he had no depth.

Sadly, I believe the book has been optioned as a movie, good luck chuck, starring Jessica Alba.This could have been a light, escapist read, but suffers from a lack of editing and an author who's been taking psych one and can't help but casually drop her newfound knowledge, thinly disguised as self-involved introspection by the heroine.Do not buy this book. Do not check it out from a library. If you find this book on a bench in the park, do the world a favor and recycle it.

Helene is hesitant on entrusting Popaul, as she has been burnt before in a previous relationship, but Popaul remains devoted on pursuing Helene's trust and affection. Slowly, Helene opens up to Popaul's devotion to find herself in a troubling situation. La Boucher is slow paced and this is done through tedious effects that provide a strong idea of Popaul's determination to gain Helene's affection. This leaves the viewer with an outstanding cinematic experience that offers much thought of the psychology behind the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor version of a great movie","review":"As an earlier reviewer has observed this film needs to be seen letterboxed.

A fascinating read, Micro Miracles is highly recommended and especially so for those with a holistic focus for their health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information","review":"I appreciated the information in \\"Discover the Healing Power of Enzymes\\" by Ellen Culter.

A murder took place, homicide is put on the case, finds the guy and.... Of course this is a far too simplistic and superficial synopsis of this splendid and gripping film but in many ways \\"The Naked City\\" contrasts with Dassin's later movie \\"Rififi\\", which presents a much grimmer and doomful view of society and mankind. Be that as it may, this piece is definitely worth watching on itself and should be regarded an outstanding film noir. The dvd is delivered in excellent quality and contains, as one of the extras, material of Dassin showing up at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"the naked city(1948)","review":"The biggest problem with this dvd is that it is only playable on region 2 European eguipment.

Everything about this movie is outstanding -- the plot, the script, the acting, and even the photography.

If you are a young movie fan, this film will show you how good the best movies from the legendary Golden Age of Hollywood actually were."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York Forever","review":"A work of a crime investigation and local NYC moral as seen by producers fifty years ago is, probably, so interesting today for having Big Apple itself as a live character.Not much to say of a context but New York is great even in this old B&W; movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is ART, a Masterpiece! Corpus Christi TX","review":"This is a classic film. To capture the city of New York, the city that never sleeps, in it's heyday and in black and white non-the-less, is more than anyone can do. I treasure this film as a wonderful work of art. You get the real thing. New York as it was in 1948. Very, very good movie. Get it for your collection. You won't regret it. The critic who wrote the review, \\"Did I see the film?\\" by nobody, well, that's what he is. A nobody. Has no earthly idea what he saw..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ever See a Man that Looks Like This?\\"","review":"The recurring question asked by the police detectives showing the photo of a boxer as they engage in the massive manhunt for the murderer of a young Manhattanite woman. This is one of the seminal film noir pieces, showing the seamy side of NYC as the police, headed by Barry Fitzgerald, try to figure out just why Jean Dexter was found in her bathtub, but not as a drowning victim. We go deeper and deeper into the morass of immorality among some city denizens--Jean doesn't seem like a very nice girl, but someone has to be brought to justice for her death, even if it means the chase leads to the top of the Williamsburg Bridge itself. Filmed on gritty location in NYC just after WW2, \\"The Naked City\\" still delivers after 50 years. Make it a point to check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaker Leaks","review":"The shaker looks nice, but if you plan to use it for actually making drinks you will be disappointed.

This book falls short on all three. Mostly on applicability: it speaks against the dangers of mind-numbing bureaucracy and close-mindedness, claiming American university physics PhD programs as the example. I had hoped for something that talked about the salaried professional once s/he's at work, not the university experience preceding it. If you want to review the worst of academic bureaucracy in order to know how to recognize and deal with it, then read this book.

In fact, Taylor never seems to have any point at all, rarely rising above a hack journalist's dialogue-splicing. Read William Goldman -- or other actual scriptwriter -- before tackling this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, not so good material.","review":"I have no objection to the actual design, I think it will work quite well. I am very hesitant to use it because even after several washings in hot soapy water, whenever it is exposed to hot water or any heat, you can smell a very \\"plastic\\" smell, and if you leave the utensil in any hot liquid, the soup or whatever actually absorbs the flavor of the plastic.

Then, I guess Vidal Sassoon decided to make crapola products since I bought a black VS straightner thinking it would work well but that was HORRIBLE! So then I decided to buy this model again since it did me so well the first time. BAD IDEA. It gets hot and fries your hair to the max but doesn't straighten worth crap.

It can pretty well wipe your bookshelf of any other scrapping reference books - with the obvious exception of Clean and Simple Scrapbooking part one. Cathy Zielske is the master of her art. Her ability to share her techniques with her readers is unsurpassed.

Look very carefully and count the points on the star. Thats right there are six points. As every true Wiccan knows there are only five points on the Wiccan Symbol. I looked at the other reviews on this book and noticed that the book contains things pertaining tarot cards. All true Wiccan's should know that even the Tarot cards have the five pointed symbol. The six pointed star is know as the Satanic symbol. Know also for the animal head shape.

And, when it ends, the story seems so flimsy that it didn't seem to me worth 2 hours (which, incredibly, is pared down from the 8-hour traditional pansori performance).Even with its gorgeous visuals and smooth editing, even cinéastes might find this film a chore to sit thru.Definitely -- rent this one first. Or try seeingSOPYONJEfirst -- a film about some itinerant pansori singers which might get you used to that performance style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I am a romantic, so I really enjoyed this film.

The movie seemed like it would have been nice otherwise (about a 4). The sound of the singing was very grating & harsh to my ears; since it was almost continous it made watching the video impossible. It also seemed to add little to the film in terms of content.

I am thankful he wanted to leave this to his children, as it is now available to everyone, for free. I watched it on the net, and I bought the DVD to have it, just in case. I am hopeful not only my children will learn from it but that it will be passed to my descendants. If you read this far consider I bought it three years ago and have not watched it recently.

In this case it is similar to \\"The Last Dance,\\" another great dance picture with a corny plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Forgettable Sexploitationer","review":"After watching \\"Lap Dancing,\\" I was filled with questions, like, was Lorissa McComas simply untalented or was she the best actress for the part? What was the difference between her two separate on-screen auditions at the offices of CineTel, other than the fact that she writhed all over the director? Was that an actual strip club, or was the writer confusing his neighborhood experimental/dinner theater for an adult venue? Was that Tane McClure's actual singing voice? And will I ever find the soundtrack in the cut-out bin of my local Sam Goody? Is a poorly-handled domestic violence subplot really a good idea in this kind of movie, or did the producers think that the audience likes voyeuristic sex mixed with implied wife-beating? And perhaps most importantly, is Mike Sedan merely an incompetent filmmaker or does he just hate the average viewer? All good questions, all to be left unanswered."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLEN STRIPPER FILM","review":"This is an excellent stripper movie with the charming Lorissa McComas showing off er well endowed self. A great exotic dance scene by Kim Dawson too. Unfortunately, in my opinion the film is marred by having the male lead played as a blind guy; a dumb gimmick. Does he smell the girls as they do their routines or maybe he is turned on by the fine musical score. Catch the great fast editing in the dance numbers.

It's truly unbelievable. I realize that these exercises can be tricky, but the publishers ought to be ashamed that, after four editions, they have allowed mistakes to remain in nearly every assignment.Why is it that the majority of first-semester music students can find so many mistakes, yet the professionals who put the material together can not see glaring errors that jump right off the page? This is the most unreliable text I have ever used. It's not unusual to find a mistake here and there in technical books, but I identified literally dozens in just the first half we covered in Theory 1 class.If you are required to use this book for a class, then you don't have any choice--just be very careful.

This book, I do not like. There are so many errors. Not only in the text, but also in the back of the book where they provide answers. Even those are error-filled. Really, publisher, how can you justify a textbook (soft back) pock-marked with technical errors, for almost $100? yikes. Clearly publisher should be issuing either partial refunds or get the 6th edition out already. This book is now 13 years old, that's 13 years of students fumbling through your errors. Some of my fav'rit errors are the font errors, where the wrong symbol is printed.

Leave it to Disney. Stubbornly old-fashioned--and therefore family friendly--it follows a group of adventurers who stumble upon a lost Viking society in Antarctica. The mostly European cast--save for a flat but still likeable David Hartman and woefully underused character actor Mako--gives it a jauntily Victorian feel that seems almost innocent today (though grad students will zero in on the post-colonial subtext). While older kids are probably too cynical to enjoy the movie (Gasp! It has a happy ending and positive message), younger kids will probably like the art direction and special effects, crude by today's standards but quite possibly the inspiration for such films as Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Even hard-hearted Gen-Xers might get a little nostalgic over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of an era","review":"This movie is good, old fashioned entertainment that seems to have been lost after Star Wars appeared. This movie follows in line with adventure movies such as: The Time Machine, Jouney to the Center of the Earth, and Mysterious Island. It's an adventure where a \\"Shangri-La\\" type area is discovered that is inhabited by vikings. The acting gets a little cheesy; but the story, cinematography, special effects,and musical score make it an enjoyable movie to watch. I haven't seen any other movies since this, that try to present a complete portrait of a book. Modern movies tend to use special effects exclusively to present a picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CHILDHOOD FAVORITE THAT MY DAUGHTER ALSO LOVES","review":"I RECEIVED THE DVD QUICKLY AND IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.

There were neither VCRs then nor color TVs in Israel,mind you. So as a small kid watching this fantastic film stretched so widely on the big screen with the icebergs, the Zeppelin, the volcanos, the huge dark whales and the barbaric vikings running around...wow, that was an overdose. After 32 years, those very same pictures were all that I could remember. I didn't know the title of the film; I knew nothing about it except for the icebergs, the Zeppelin, the volcanos...you get my drift.

What we have is Sir Anthony Ross, played by Donald Sinden, who is searching for his son. His son was exploring the North Pole and disappeared. He gets Prof. Ivarsson, played by David Hartman, to help him. He also gets an airship commanded by a French Captain Brieux, wonderfully played by Jacques Marin, to fly them to the North Pole. On the way there they also pick up Oomiak, played by the VERY Famous Mako, who was one of the last people to see Ross's son alive.In the end they find a lost world. But instead of dinosaurs they find VIKINGS! 94 minutes of pure childish delight. Not that I am so sure a child should watch it - one scene has the burning airship crash on top of somebody...ewwww.Lots of extras but no commentary. I would suggest it for the younger members of the family. After all, it is Walt Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing waaaay off","review":"I got these pants along with the matching hoodie a few days ago.

Then I noticed the other door was a bit loose and tried to tighten the hinge screws, but they just spun in place. Minor, but even when I forced the right door closed, the mid-line didn't match up and looked sloppy.

I don't know that she's THE leading US expert on mindsets of poverty, middle class and wealth. Sort of pretentious. She separated out behaviors, values, characteristics of the three socio-economic classes. I was appalled at what she claimed to be economic factors - all so often they are matters of diagnosis of LD that is most commonly exposed in poverty and least often exposed among the wealthy. I liked the holistic approach - that many factors affect folks beyond just money! This book is poorly researched, most of the time interestingly presented book. For parents and teachers, not a bad read some of the time - but, don't believe all that you read in this book. For employers, policymakers and service providers, skip it. It's not a bad read from the public library. I wouldn't buy the $22 4th edition over the $2 used 3rd edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no Research Involved!!!!","review":"Please don't buy this book! The author uses her opinion as facts. I read it for a class in my Master's program. It is not based on any research. Her suggestions are flimsy and opinionated and not helpful.

Please do more research before purchasing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generalizations and Stereotypes Predominate","review":"I found both good and bad aspects to this book. First, I was shocked at the liberal use of generalizations and stereotypes provided about low-income families. And, it doesn't support a \\"strengths-based\\" perspective that is important in any human service endeavor. What was useful was the emphasis upon the need for low-income folks to be \\"bi-cultural\\" if they are to participate in \\"middle class\\" society. They don't have to accept \\"middle class\\" standards but need to demonstrate them to some extent if they are to \\"get along\\" in the \\"middle class\\" world. At least knowing the \\"middle class\\" culture gives them more options."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - stay away from Ruby Payne!","review":"If you ever hear that your school is considering using Ruby Payne's methods as a way to \\"fix\\" poor people, I caution you strongly to reconsider. Not only has she not used any real research to back up her claims, but her writing is absolutely FILLED with classist, racist, and terminology that only belittles those whom she supposedly is trying to help. This does absolutely nothing to help further the cause of helping those who are poor and/or working class. One thing that is important to note: her books are all self-published. This means that unlike with academic works, there are not a multitude of editors making sure that what is written can be validated through research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening","review":"This book opened my eyes to many issues I have had as an educator, and school-based speech-language pathologist, with parents not participating in meetings, students not completing homework, and attitudes in the classroom.

The 'research' is outdated and based on 3rd party anecdotes. I found it to be extremely biased and obviously written by someone who has not known poverty. It is not a peer reviewed publication, but rather self-published, which casts further doubt on its validity. I read it as it was used for professional development in my school district, but I was very disappointed. I work in a school with much diversity (23 language backgrounds) and high poverty, and while reading with my demographics in mind, I found myself thinking over and over again that the author has a very narrow world view of the culture of privilege and how to achieve it - dress like her, talk like her, think like her is all it takes... What this book does accomplish is to make those of us who are privileged smile and find affirmation that we have done it right and those poor things who are not so privileged just need to try to be like us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful","review":"This was an older Publication, but the information did explain a great deal of the situations I was either witnessing, or experiencing with students and parents I encounter through teaching or in parent conferences.

Understanding the culture of poverty is needed in order to facilitate the growth of those in poverty on the economic social and educational ladder. While this book addresses the overall aspects of the poverty culture, it fails to properly document the other aspects that affect the learning process, such as child abuse and cultural differences. In all, this is a book worth reading for not only teachers but anyone who works with those in lower income levels.

I suspect that is because no publisher would want to be associated with her racist, stereotypical ideology. She makes claims about the three socio-economic levels of our society that will do nothing other than further stratify the classes of \\"wealthy\\" i.e. white and the \\"poor\\" i.e. blacks. It is horrifying, as an educator to know other teachers are buying her books and attending her seminars to learn how to teach urban youth, yet they are being taught nothing but insulting generalizations about minorities in our country.

I had never thought of my upbringing as middle-class, but I did bring middle-class values to my education and that made all the difference in the world. This book showed me why some children have so many problems adapting to the expectations schools have of them and how, as a teacher, I can adapt to reach these children. Children may have to learn the social norms of school before they can even begin to learn how to read and write. This book gives educators a start to learning how to integrate these children into the school system without expecting them to turn their backs on their home cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes Abound; Avoid this Book","review":"While Dr. Payne may have felt as though she was helping her readers to understand poverty, what she actually has done is reveal her own stereotypes and, unfortunately, reinforce the institutionalized classism and racism existent in today's culture. Payne utilizes precious little actual research to back up her exaggerated caricature of poverty in America; in fact, a great number of her claims do not stand up to serious scrutiny. The poor can no more be lumped into one convenient group than can members of any particular race, nationality, or religious affiliation, but that doesn't stop Dr. Payne from trying to do just that over and over. It is in measures insulting and demeaning.Sadly, this book does far more harm than good. I cannot emphasize enough to avoid this book. I would urge anyone seriously interested in actually understanding poverty to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Fluff","review":"I like direct, to the point, presentation of information without lots of fluff to go through. Ruby Payne does that in spades. The content is well researched, and is well organized. Although directed specifically to educators, the description of the characteristics of the poverty class culture as contrasted to those of the middle class culture has universal application. As for me, it is a re-read and reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a really, REALLY bad book","review":"Poorly argued, abysmally written, non-researched, filled with stereotyping and scapegoating.

I couldn't believe that the worst of Calvinist principles were coming back. But here it is in Framework in all it's glory. Here we are, with the concept that the poor are that way because of their immorality and poor thinking skills and that the big brother of the upper middle class can get the surfs to stop their stumbling and backsliding. What about teachers who come from poverty? What about what stumbling blocks that Ms. Payne's class put in place? I was almost waiting for Ms. Payne to speak of the \\"White Man's Burden\\" of another century."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Casual and Off-Hand Analysis","review":"The book strikes me as poorly researched. While Payne may have access to boatloads of data, she gives the reader very little reason to believe that she has ever discussed these topics with people living in poverty. Rather, each new idea feels as if it has been thought up off the top of the author's head. This, and the simplistic, vague language, make the book hard to follow. Each chapter seems more concerned with introducing slick, jargon-y lists than developing, proving, and defending an argument.For any educator working with many low-income students, the book's contributions are already foregone conclusions. To its credit, the book would be a helpful introduction to working with people in poverty for a reader who has never before done so. While it might serve as a starting point, it should by no means be the only or final resource for fear of developing a dangerously one-dimensional image of people in poverty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read. Very informational.","review":"This book is a necessity for anyone that works with disadvantaged and at risk you. Really sheds light into the poverty epidemic and how it effects our youth, especially students. I learned many new things about poverty and how it has shaped the students I work with.

I find myself referencing it from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Payne's book an eyeopener","review":"Payne does a wonderful job of showing how economic status influences a person's world view and affects his/her reality.

For people who work with the public, it's a valuable resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist and Narrow Minded","review":"What I once found enlightening, I now find offensive. Payne does not back up her claims with any valid research and paints an ugly picture of those living in poverty. Payne illustrates those living in poverty as criminals with low morals and typically as minorities. I am ashamed that my school district wastes so much money on her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Ruby Payne","review":"This book perpetuates the institutionalized racism and classism that creates students who are unsuccessful in schools. Payne, whose \\"research\\" is anecdotal at best, completely unverified at worst, suggests that teachers teach to poverty, instead of fighting the social injustices that cause it. She works from the deficit theory of poverty, which has been widely discredited since the 60s, and her anecdotal examples are racist stereotypes.This book makes white, middle-class teachers think they understand poverty, when in reality, the advice she gives teachers perpetuates poverty and does nothing to address the complex causes of it. Ruby Payne is laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller should be banned","review":"This seller never shipped the book and never returned my emails as to why.

But when I mentioned the tendency of the program to freeze on manual scan mode, the very polite tech support person told me the Real-Time scan mode was taking care of things. He pretty much ignored my complaints about the fact it freezes in manual mode even after I repeated the complaint several times. If it happened on only one computer, I could chalk it up to some idiosychrasy.

Vianna, a scholar of music, introduces the reader to important samba musicians, intellectuals, and government officials in this story that centers around the rule of Getulio Vargas which began in the 1930s and lasted into the 1950s. Vianna connects samba to ideas of national identity and race, offering insight into why, despite the celebration of samba and Afro-Brazilian roots, Brazilians of African descent continue to face discrimination.

The band's self-titled debut album was just as exciting. The Futureheads have barely stopped touring since, and it shows. All of their technical craft remains evident on News & Tributes, but there are few if any memorable moments. The songwriting just isn't there. And believe me: the band knows it. At this year's Pitchfork festival, they played perhaps three songs from N&T, choosing to lean on the older, tighter, hookier material. Want a great new rock album?

They aint no h6rr6rc6re \\"chop off your head and use it as a bowling ball\\" crap. There ACID RAP. No other rappers can produce acid rap, so pick this up to hear the original, the greatest rappers from Detroit. All the songs are the classics, but my favorites would have to be Life After Death, Get My Head Together, Dance, Dancin' On Ya Grave, and Hellraiser.

These two wonderful detectives are caught in the middle of a bunch of murders that seem to lead back to witchcraft in the Navajo nation.

Noise isolation is also excellent and right up there with all other earplugs. Don't be fooled by the 33NRR ratings on other earplugs - the extra 1NRR doesn't make a real difference.The reason why these earplugs beat all others, is the material - it's made with a different type of foam than traditional earplugs, which results in less ear canal pressure.

Don't buy this if you're expecting anything above low-intermediate level Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Intermediate Book","review":"Initially, I wasn't pleased with this book, but once I started using it a lot more, I increasingly grew fond of it's teaching method and the way the lessons are structured. The way it teaches the kanji is very good. It's not as advanced as it says, but I'd say it's suitable for someone who passed JLPT lvl 3.Here's my suggestion: use the second half of the book with all Japanese. Don't waste your time with the first half (roomaji/English) except to check the English translation of the passages if you need to or review any grammar that goes over your head. If you can comprehend the CD, you probably don't need to do either of these things much.The main problem I have with the book is it's business bias. This company (Living Language) tends to do this and for many, this isn't a problem, but for me, it'd be more interesting if the dialog mixed and matched between business and play since I go to Japan for both. I'd like to hear more informal dialog for one thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Japanese study guide with adults in mind","review":"The dialogues in this book don't make you practice how to greet your home-stay parents or make nice to your new school counselor or even how to get a date. The conversations, settings, and vocabulary are business and social situations with adults relating to each other. What a treat.The design of the book and the cds are quite useful I think. The other reviews discussed the book's layout. The cds are very good too. There are two sets for each chapter. In one the speakers do the dialogue at a pretty good clip and then repeat it sentence by sentence giving you time to say the words out loud. The second set focuses on expressions, grammar, and vocabulary.It's odd - the program assumes a previous background in Japanese yet some of the grammar lessons are quite basic. But as anyone who has studied Japanese knows, another explanation is another chance to 'feel' the point and review is always welcome.Pennywww.WhereTheHeckIsMom.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"Reasonable introduction to TRIZ, but is overpriced for only 44 pages.

You can digest this book in about thirty minutes. Mitchum is amusing as an interview subject but the interviews are mostly question and answer and have no context and the questioners often don't know much about Mitchum's career or at least don't know when he's got his facts right or wrong. Most of the interviews were done during publicity jaunts so you get a superficial, one-sided view of the actor's experiences.

She can sing rockers like I'VE GOT THE MUSIC IN ME, STEP BY STEP, ONE JUMP AHEAD OF THE STORM, and ballads with ease. This compilation CD is certainly worthy of owning. The 60's songs WHY DON'T I RUN AWAY FROM YOU and RUNNING OUT OF FOOLS are worth hearing ... rare singles from 1966 that illustrate Kiki's abilities singing r&b; with that big voice when she was just a kid.

I especially like being able to see the hands at night. However, the alarm only works 15% of the time. Setting the time, date and alarm is not as easy as it sounds, because you have to unscrew and pull the stem out the right number of stops, which are not clearly defined. Was that one stop, or two? You can't tell until the wrong thing starts spinning. Then, once you set the alarm, there is another stem that has to be pulled out. But, that one pushes back in very easily in the normal course of wearing the watch. Most of the time, the alarm does not work for me. Even if I do not accidentally push the alarm stem back in, thus turning off the alarm, the alarm still does not sound! There may be an AM/PM difference, but I haven't figured it out. If you're buying this watch to use the alarm on a daily basis as I was, keep looking.

There are some entertaining nuggets in the plot stemming from farcical happenings, as well as some perhaps-unintended absurd writing.

At least a secular author doesn't have pretentions when he writes about the world, he is part of it. The book is just so bad, I threw it out after reading it. Wouldn't even sell it second hand.

This book could be a 5 star book, but it is different and takes some real intelligence to comprehend all of the subject matter, thus it is not for everyone. One has to have the ability to see between the lines and be conceptual in thought. At superficial glance it can be misunderstood, one has to put some thought into the mysticism and the plays on God and reality.

The price is a bit steep, but optical quality is there, resale value will remain good, and weather sealing should hopefully keep dust and junk from getting inside this lens."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},O={key:1};function L(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(B,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-7584e07f"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/32.md","filePath":"people/32.md"}'),H={name:"people/32.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
