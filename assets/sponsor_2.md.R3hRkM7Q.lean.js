Also get Walter Wanderley records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointing Compilation","review":"I mainly purchased this CD for the Hamilton Joe Frank & Reynolds song \\"Fallin in Love\\" which for some reason was left off their Greatest Hits compilation? The version on this CD IS NOT the same version that was originally released back in the 70's. The song sounds flat and without the great music so I am very disappointed. Also the remaining songs by Freddy Fender and the other artists are poor choices to reflect the great music of that year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject, if you can decode the writing style","review":"I read about one third of this book before giving up. The subject is very interesting, but the writing style is complex, confused and hard to follow. The author uses rare words for their own sake not for clarity. The sentence construction is obtuse and unclear. He seems to be trying to impress as an intellectual, but he fails to present a clear picture of what happened and when. Michael Burleigh badly needs to meet Rudolf Flesch."},{"rating":"2","title":"wiped out by page 25","review":"This is trenchant, demanding, totally depressing. I found myself defeated by this book early on. It was like an avalanche. Nor do I find the view that Nazism=a religion very enlightening, short of being an obvious comparison. I guess I just don't have the heart to go through this book, right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book not intended for general public use","review":"The complexity of the word use in this book makes it incomprehensible. How did it get past his editors? Most of the adjectives Burleigh uses I have never heard before. I have to sit with a dictionary next to me to look them up as I read so I can try to follow what he is saying. When I do understand him, I think his insights are excellent. However, I find his tone condescending at times and I think that detracts from the idea that this is an attempt at a somewhat objective study of history. I would recommend against reading this book for the same reason the Catholic Mass is no longer spoken in Latin. I hate to say it, but if the author dummed down his work a little then it would be nice to grasp the perspective he is trying to convey. As it stands, this is a book for professors, not for the general public."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Third Reich","review":"Save your money. Yet another book about Jewish victimization. Judging from Mr. Burleigh's previous works, this is his area of interest and speciality. It is by no means a new perspective on 'the Third Reich'. It is surely no advance on Wm. L. Shirer's somewhat dated history written close after the war with the expected overuse of adjectives, and the many histories that have followed. Mr. Burleigh writes as so many contemporary academicians, which is to say with extraordinary resort to notes and bibliography (125 pages) as if to impress with his research, similar to any PhD thesis. In places, the text seems to be a gloss on the numerous paragraphs Mr. Burleigh has inserted from other authors. Why did I buy it then? I was gulled by critical reports in several of the news media. I am seventy and get most of my books via Amazon. Had I been in a store and thumbed through \\"The Third Reich\\" I would never have bought it. Be happy to donate my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I am very interested in developing an understanding of how and why the Nazis were able to take over Germany. With a sub-title of \\"A New History\\" I was looking forward to learning something \\"new\\" that I haven't learned from the first 100 books I've read on the subject. There was nothing \\"new\\" here and what is written and the writers style qualifies this book as one of the five worst books I have read on the subject. It is an extremely hard read since he uses compound sentences that string out for four or five lines. It requires very slow reading to get the point being made that often turns out to be his opinion, not a fact. Looks like the editor was out to lunch. Save your money and don't be fooled in buying this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old rehash....","review":"Just another rehash of the same old garbage we've been forcefed for years. Just mention the \\"poor\\" Jews and how they werepersecuted and it'll be published... For the real deal on National Socialist Germany, read \\"Nature's Eternal Religion\\" sold here on Amazon. Most people rate these Third Reich books almost without thinking because they have been conditioned that way without really knowing the history of the times. Instead, for a couple of bucks you can download \\"Nature's Eternal Religion\\" and come away much the wiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding & Difficult to Read","review":"I agree with \\"writing got in the way\\". The writing was so difficult to follow it required reading a sentence 2 or 3 times to figure out what he was saying. I finally give up after 90 pages.

I've never heard this soundtrack, but as I read the track listings, I can recall each scene from the movie. The best thing to come from this movie is the music soundtrack, which is - as far as I know - out of print. With songs like Love Kills (Vinnie Vincent), Back to the Wall (Divinyls), and Rip Her to Shreds (Blondie), it's a must have. Unfortunately I only have the cassette, am searching long and hard for the cd.

His credibility takes a beating when the police return and the body is gone. At this point, Father John makes it his mission to find the body and discover who has died. When a commercial developer threatens to take over Father O'Malley's mission and turn it into a recreation center, he becomes distraught and is tempted to turn to alcohol, which has been the bane of his existence for many years. Instead, he teams up with Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden, and tries to solve the murder while helping Vicky with her drug-addicted daughter, Susan.

I read Native American suspense almost exclusively,(Tony Hillerman, JA Jance, Aimee Thurlo) and was happy to find Margaret'sr books. I'm also a writer and am working on my second Native American book myself. My first is presently under consideration at Avon. It's so difficult to find good Native American mysteries, they're few and far between. Thanks, Margaret for a great series! I'm looking forward to reading more of your books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner by Ms. Coel","review":"This series by Ms. Coel is refreshing because the main characters are not perfect people. They are just like us with doubts and failures and struggles to deal with while solving crimes too. Excellent story telling and the Native American/southwestern flavor is a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After consuming everything Hillerman has written, and learning something new about Native American culture from each book, and after Hillerman's squib on the Dust jacket, my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind... As a 1/8 Arapaho [& 1/8 Blackfoot] i had hoped to learn something about their life. The characterizations were also paper thin, including both the male and female protagonists... and the denouement was telegraphed for miles... ergo, even as a mystery/suspense novel, this one flunked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use the Web","review":"A nice collection of information but for what I was looking for the web had as much information on what was where and how much it cost.

I just slap a strip over where the cats are scratching and they don't scratch there any more. If they move an inch to the left of the strip, I cover that area as well. It's very easy to remove, unlike some other products, and there is no damage done by doing so. In fact, I've moved strips (removed and repositioned) as many as two times and it still sticks to the upholstry. I also found that if I cover a scratched area, and then put a small cat scratching board or post nearby, they scratch there and not on the furniture where they are discouraged by these strips. They work great - if you have cats and nice furniture you should definitely purchase these. Make sure you get enough.Dennis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put on and fell off","review":"Put one on and it fell off within about 5 seconds so what I would say is that it was one of the most annoying purchases I've ever made.

If I had a dollar for every pundit who claimed that this is a revolutionary situation that has never happened before in America, I could buy my own fleet of birchbark canoes. Of course, there have been many subsets of North American society that have been characterized by a mixing and blurring of ethnic identity. Some of these subsets arose centuries ago. One of them is that group of French-Canadian-Indian men and women known as the \\"metis\\" or \\"voyageurs.\\" The social customs of this group, their values, their strengths, their love of life, are recounted here by an enthusiast. Miss Nute was a pioneer. She wrote before her time. I heartily recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adieu Voyageurs","review":"Grace Nute's portrayal of the French-Canadian voyageurs who penetrated the Great Lakes and all points north and west in the mid-late 1700's to early 1800's, is an intriguing look into these tough, hard as nails canoe men.Either working for fur companies or for themselves, Nute highlights their carefree character, everyday life in the most remote or unexplored regions, unconscionable efforts to survive the elements, Indian attacks, hunger, etc.We read of their appearance, how they would build a canoe from scratch, the actual traversing of the hellish backwaters, coping with fort life, then as a soldier and later as a settler.With snippets from original journals, from the likes of Alexander Mackenzie, Sir George Simpson, Alexander Henry, John Franklin, Peter Pond, Lord Selkirk and many others, this puts it all into perspective.They opened up vast amounts of territory through their canoeing and hardships during the fur trade era.A good insightful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shoes","review":"Very nice, comfy shoes (I got them in sand colour).

It was a really good book, it had a story line, some great factual history, and of course romance! This is the first and the only book I have read of Virginia Henley's and I would definately read some others now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical of Henley","review":"Boring to say the least. I was so disappointed in this book that I felt that Henley had penned her name to another's book in desperation to meet a deadline!The heroine was so unlike her previous heroines whom historically are strong willed, feisty, outspoken and downright physically violent at times. This particular heroine was a 'mouse' in my opinion. No guts, no gumption, and the book was received by me with no glory. The hero, I found him to be naive in the matters of female reproduction. Having a mistress for years, one never wondered why she never conceived? The mistress was so shallow that even he should have seen through her vindictive behavior. As for his sister, well, I believe she was transported through time travel from another era due to her language and prose and her psychological analysis of men."},{"rating":"1","title":"bearly okay","review":"I didn't hate it but I certainly would not recommend it.

THE AUTHOR DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE PERIOD SHE'S WRITING ABOUT. If her goal was to make the reader better understand the dialogues, doesn't she think the reader would've bought a Contemporary Romance instead? Henley is one of the worst, if not the worst, authors when it comes to dialogues. Her sentences are too simple, uninspired, and often silly.

The dialogue for this 13th century romance is way out of time. Phrases she has used, such as \\"cut to the chase\\" and \\"a helluva a woman\\" are straight out of the 20th century. I thought the whole point of historical romance was to immerse yourself in that time period, including how the characters would speak. I frankly didn't care for any of the characters, including the lead characters. The times when Jane Leslie was dreaming about the lynx in the forest suggested a hint of bestiality to me. There was no suspense for me in the plot and I simply could not in any concsience recommend this book for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"sorry, ms. henley but i did'nt really enjoyed this story very much. the story mostly revolves on getting an heir and nothing much, especially romance. you can almost predict the story right from the begining. the only interesting part are around the bruce's era which is quite good to read. hope in future you can write more interesting story. addios......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"Glad this made it to kindle. I remember reading this a few years ago. Nice story. Loved the story and glad to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok, but I wouldn't recommend it","review":"I found myself wishing the story would move along a little faster. The conversations among warlords and details of war movements were dull. . I didn't like that Lynx was so selfish sexually during his first two nights with her. Lynx didn't trust women. He thought they were deceitful. Jane became that way too. I didn't like that she was purposely playing hard to get with Lynx. It worked to create more lust, but that is not the kind of story I like to read. Lynx's former mistress and sister were also game playing and/or deceitful. On the positive side, two scenes come to mind that surprised me, one was with the lynx animal at the beginning. The other was the nourishment she gave to Lynx during his healing. Other than those, nothing else surprised or delighted me. I didn't laugh at anything. I was annoyed at a few things. I didn't respect, like or admire the main characters enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as interesting as her other books can be","review":"Henley has written a few very interesting historical novels but this is not 'it.'

I've never felt so cheated in my life. The characters were cliches who spoke 20th century dialog. Although the sex is described as \\"spicy,\\" it was as crass as I've ever read outside bonafide pornography. I knew I was in trouble when the heroine turned out to be a red-haired Celt with \\"special powers,\\" but I made myself finish the book. Even after the heroine dreams about an animal exciting her by licking her breasts. Even though the heroine was \\"empowered\\" and no one in the story seemed to realize what time period they inhabited. Even through the climactic breast-feeding scene (warning: no infant is involved). Right up until the end - which was the best part, not because it was good; just because it was finally over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally The Real Cotton Eyed Joe!","review":"I've been looking for this version of the Cotton Eyed Joe for over 25 years - and finally here it is.

Ever single song meshes together until the entire album forms a towering wall of sound, and the result is absolutely beautiful. \\"Moksha\\", the opening track, sets the mood for the entire journey, and the ride doesn't let up. However, simply listening to the 30 second preview clips here won't do any justice to this kind of music. I suggest buying the first couple tracks on iTunes or even the band's whole first EP if you want to get more of a feel for their music.

It is not merely an adventure story about a boy freeing a dragon, but it a message about the lengths we should go to help other people-even if they are dragons in their heart. It is about the adventure of hove as we free people from prison, what ever their chains may be.The illustrations are done in foggy charcoal and perfectly compliment the story. The book was first published in the 1940's, and the illustrations are a snapshot of that simpler era. In a sense, they are a type of Norman Rockwell Fantasy.I got this book for my nephews, and when my sister-in-law finished the last book, my nephew said, \\"Let's read them again.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable way to spend time during a car trip","review":"I purchased this audiobook for a long car trip with my husband, 4 & 6 year olds.

Their suggestions will appeal to boomers who may be anticipating retirement, except for their \\"recommended living locations\\" listings in chapter 5. Some of their upscale venue ideas are beyond the financial resources of many boomers. Some readers may find gaps in their discussion addressed helpfully in a recent publication--Spiritual Wisdom for Successful Retirement: Living Forward [Haworth Press]. For the price and timely facts, this is an excellent resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beginners Only","review":"If you have not given much thought to the questions that retirement brings, this is one place to start. Many other books cover the topics in greater depth. For example, there is no mention of becoming more involved with groups such as churches, many of which thrive in proportion to the time which retired people like my wife and me donate to them. Forty per cent of the pages cover retirement places, which is not the main goal for most retirees. Buy it cheap and move on to books specializing in medical or financial issues. A chirpy pop psych introduction is no substitute for a serious discussion of the real issues involved. Definitely for people with pensions and professions. Invest in a retirement seminar instead.

I'm not the yuppie type who will have a fortune to spend when I do retire, and I'd say this book is bound to appeal to that particular crowd.Far more interesting and appealing is the series written by John Howells over the past decade. He seems to have put more time into his books and goes into more depth overall; he and his wife have made it their business to RV-it all over the place and personally check things out, staying all different places and getting to know the folks who live there.

(You can almost be excused for failing to notice that \\"government\\" will be deciding where and when such boundaries are erected.)His formulation can easily be refined to support the \\"Dhimmitude\\" of our country towards Islamic (or other) theological ravings. At a time when free expression can be easily, if not hysterically, likened to a loaded semi-automatic assault weapon, this exegesis is a welcome beacon to guide us away from the otherwise unpleasant clashes between the violent and the narrow minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's scary how close this guy is to becoming a Supreme Court justice.","review":"I'm simultaneously giving this book one star and telling you that you must read this book.

Power pop at its finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the music teacher you never wanted","review":"As a rank beginner who can't read music or play any other instrument, I bought this book hoping for a quick, friendly intro to the fiddle. But it doesn't really seem to be written for self-teaching; instead, it offers a series of \\"exercises\\" (i.e. not music!) for teachers to assign. What little text there is (the book is mostly music and a few pictures) is pedantic and unfriendly, and even in the illustrations the model never looks like he's enjoying the instrument. The material itself, while skimpy, is useful -- you learn how to play four notes on each string. I haven't found a better alternative, but this is not an encouraging place to begin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"easy to understand! and great for beginners..moved through the book with ease and very informative.......would buy from this author again"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Student's Opinion","review":"The information in this book is well presented and easy to read. I am a music student. Even though this book is written basically for a teacher, it provided immeasurable assistance in showing me where my practicing is inefficient. I fit into 11 out of 13 practice error categories. The author not only clearly identifies these practice traits, he also tells how to correct them. The games he provides are fun - but my ego will not let me play by the rules all the time. I expect great results from my improved practice sessions. This book also deals with the stage fright I get before a performance. This will be very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Battle Scenes","review":"This book is fascinating. Curtis Ford brings to life the Roman Empire in all its intrigue and military might, recounting the life and times of Julian the Apostate, a character I had never heard of. I loved the book, in particular because of the battles descrived in it. Curtis Ford just brings them to life, much in the way of Homer and Virgil. The thought crossed my mind of how they'd look in the big screen.Appart from the battles the main characters are developed very well and the ending leaves a lot of food for thought.I heavily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Philosopher Emperor - So So Story","review":"\\"Gods and Legions\\" is a well written book. Michael Curtis Ford is a capable writer who knows how to piece together a decent story. He had a good amount to work with in Emperor Julian, the last Roman Emperor to hold onto a polytheistic view on religion; and while the story moves along nicely, and the core characters have a reasonable amount of flesh, the aggregate just didn't pull me in.I really enjoyed Ford's \\"The Fall of Rome\\". What his stories lack in emotional depth, he makes up for in the plot pace, and a good variation of action and politics.I'd consider \\"Gods and Legions\\" a solidly average piece of Roman military fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emperor in the attack","review":"Mr Ford has penned an excellent book about one of the great men of ancient Rome. Although I am not very familiar with this period in Roman history and can not comment on the historical accuracy of the story, I can say that it is enjoyable reading. Mr Ford does and excellent job of describing the characters and the intrigue that surrounds the Emperor and his court. He also does a great job of showing the importance of the legions in determining just who will sit on the throne in this era. Overall, the book flows along and keeps the reader absorbed in the characters and the plot and is an enjoyable read. I recommend the book to anyone interested in this period of history or just wants an enjoyable novel for the summer vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"also disappointed","review":"Put me down as agreeing with other reviewers who found the latter half of this book tedius. Somehow, Ford allowed his narrator to become a monotonous, carping voice, stating and overstating Julian's descent into paganism. In the process, Julian becomes one-sided and uninteresting, yet he's the subject of this book!

It has no padding. It has no good hinges and no good fastener. The hinges are the plastic case itself and the fastener is just a plastic clip. Both will evenually break off with use. It would be more of a $10 item than a $50 item that they charge. I was expecting a quality case like the Omni Chord used to have.. It seems things are being made cheap these days.

However I still have pain and stiffness which limits what I can do. The surgeon recommended this supplement.

This book was so unnecessary!!! If you are a Stevie Nicks fan, you could do your own research on the web and get more information yourself! Don't bother reading this book. As for the pictures....they are all black and white...not that great...some are interesting. If Wincentsten was aiming to do a photo book on Stevie, he should have marketed it as such and gone all out with color photos, ect. He should definitely give up trying to \\"write\\" about her.

When I got it I found it to be a thin book with about 90% pictures. The man talked a bit about how he tried to get her to authorize it in the beginning. Then it was all black and white picutes. A few are kinda nice but most are just from a concert taken and they aren't real nice depictions of her. Toward the end he blabbers on about some other artists. Some Tori Amos lady and some other people. I can learn more about Stevie from reading articles free off the internet. I think it was a waste of money (...) on some black and white pictues that I could find better ones free off the internet. Don't waste your money on this book. It teaches you nothing about Stevie. I wish someone would just write a book about her. Like mabye Stevie should do one. She's supposed to but it says it was never published. The moral: don't bother. (...)

If you are interested in the \\"quality\\", \\"truth-telling\\" writings of The Star and The National Inquirer this is the choice novella for you at an inflated price.

The feeling remains even after the glitter fades."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor book","review":"This book is a great disappointment.The only information within this book are various newspaper and magazine articles that the author mentions. Anyone, I think, could have written this book. All he did was quote several PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN articles and give his own opinions. Over half the book consists of photos of Stevie (most of which are NOT very good at all). There is even full section of the book about OTHER artists that he seems to think are similar to Stevie. Very far off, IMO.Also, the book is written very poorly. Simply read the excpert Amazon provides and see what I mean. In reading this, you will also notice that the author flat out tells you that Stevie, her management, even her parents, all stated (on numerous occasions) that they wanted nothing to do with the making of this book.Kinda pathetic, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comical piece of work","review":"No wonder Stevie Nicks wouldn't help with this work!

If you follow some of the advice in this book, you will actually be a worse filmmaker than if you just started bumbling your way through it on your own. (And, some of his advice will land you in jail, if you get caught.)The book is poorly written, incoherent at times, and each short section only conveys the vaguest information possible about the subject it purports to be about. The tone is sarcastic and vaguely insulting. Some of the advice was so stupid I was offended by it. I've read at least fifty books about filmmaking, and this is hands-down the worst. Period. It's hard to comment on the information in much detail, because there is so little depth to the information in this book that it's like reading a ream of blank paper.If you read this book, you'll need to read at least one good one to understand all the vague things, and un-lear all the incorrect things, that you'll hear about filmmaking from this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense!","review":"The author is a racist and a nut.

It was what I wanted from Icehouse. First came the soaring love ballad, Crazy, then the follow-up Electric Blue, with its snazzy riffs, and finally I got the whole album on tape from an acquaintance in Australia. It was magic. Other songs I enjoy are Girl on the Moon and the epic story-song, Sunset and the Heartbreak Kid, which for me was a kind of sequel to the Eagles' New Kid in Town.This disc is kind of pricey but it's hard to find.

Toni's vocie is alright here, but she seems to be lacking the meaning of the standards, and conviction, as well as a sense of rhythm, timing, and technical skills that are essential for a swing singer. She may be able to pass as a caberet singer along the lines of Mabel Mercer, but this cd doesn't work well, because after one or two songs you begin to realize taht Toni's run out of cliches and ideas, she essentially copies styles of past singers, using so many cliches, she's bound to fool some into thinkign she actually can pull this off, but in reality this emberessing session, should never have been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph--Albee's Best","review":"It's unusual for a playwright to produce his or her best work in late-career, but that's what Albee has done in *Three Tall Women.* The essence of Albee's genius has long been his ability to get language to do what he wants, rather than being constrained by what language wants to do. But in *Three Tall Women*, unlike in *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf*, there's something urgent and concrete at stake: what, exactly, was the meaning of a dying woman's ninety-two year life? It's this question that fuels the gripping conflict between the play's three characters, \\"A\\", \\"B\\", and \\"C\\", who represent a single woman at ages 26, 52, and 92.There is so much in *Three Tall Woman* for brilliant actresses to exploit that the play seems virtually certain to be a hot ticket for as long as live theater exists.

These guys have always been influence by Zappa, but can pull off just about anything. The highlight of the album for me is the 14 minute plus \\"Abyss Of Dissension\\" which will probably get mixed reviews depending on one's personal taste.

She does not have a very big part, but when she's on screen she lights up the scene and inevitably steals the show.Recommended if you like war epics, or if you're an Oscar buff, or like romance, or if you're a Clara Bow fan.

The biggest surprise of all, however, is just howenchanting Clara Bow is as the very sexy girl next door. While obviously men's tastes in women differ, it is still rather difficult to believe that Charles Rogers wasn't at least infatuated with his next door neighbor.

The beaver footage was obviously setup and did not represent natural behavior; the background music was obnoxious and not fitting; beavers do not make loud moans and actually they make very little noise at all; and the film was too \\"done up\\"--if they would have only filmed the beavers and left it at that!

In fact, im ordering another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"usa made! very nice knife","review":"This is a great knife for a very reasonable price.

AMZN offered a refund or a nice discount if I wanted to keep it.Such an awesome knife, I kept it and took the discount.What can I say that other reviewers haven't.....A simply awesome knife....most have covered all the features and etc, so rather then repeat what most have already said, I'll just add in...BUY IT....You'll love it.Also, the description is wrong...on quite a few kershaws so be sure to check...this DOES have the BETTER 14C28N steel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great knife","review":"This knife is just great. Slim and easy to carry but still very secure in the hand due to the \\"sandy\\" texture on the grip. Made in USA! Craftsmanship is excellent. Sharp as a razor. Very easy to open one-handed. Looks good without being over-styled. Seems just the right size - not too big to carry, but big enough to handle most reasonable tasks. (Note - look for a serrated version for cutting thick rope, leather, etc.) The carry clip is very secure and allows for rapid retrieval. It really compares well to knives that cost a lot more.

It took me about 10 minutes to get the hang of opening it but all you do is use the notch on the blade to flip it open with your thumb.

I wouldn't change anything about this knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, what a value.","review":"First off I have seen this knife at big box stores for at least $10 more.

I have Gerbers, Bucks & Kershaws.Pros:- Sharp out of the box, & tough steel- Serrated edge is sharp & aggressive- Red & black contrasts well, which is easy to spot should you drop it in the grass at night- Grip is VERY aggressive; It's basically skateboard grip secured to the knife (like 80 grit sandpaper)but is very durable & waterproof- Simple one-handed operation; right amount of spring action -- not too springy to the point of accidental openingCons:- Though the grip is good, it can be a little too aggressive on the clip side. It will likely shred-up your jeans/belt eventually clipping the knife off & on.- I'd like to see a little more for forefinger slip protection, but still adequateI would recommend as a good general purpose knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this knife.","review":"This knife is everything it should be. The speed safe release is pretty sweet, and fast. very comfortable in my pocket. I'm left handed and it feels very comfortable in my hand also.

I don't find this knife to be to big nor to small for EDC and it fits in my hand quite nice. I was amazed at the speed it opened and lack of having to fling or flick it with your wrist. just a simple push of the thumb and Kablamo its opened.for the price I am very happy with my purchase and do believe this knife is going to last for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife liked mine so much, she ordered one too","review":"My wife got this for me for Christmas and it was my favorite gift this year. Larger than I expected (not huge, just right), it has a very nice heft. The skateboard taped handles give it a secure grip (haven't used it in the rain or anything yet) and it is very sharp right out of the box. Speed safe opener is quick and smooth.I know that Kershaw stands behind their products and if anything goes wrong, they'll make it right. But this is a solid knife that I expect to use for years.

I didn't feel like I was watching a 'Burns and Allen' show, It felt like a long boring commercial for carnation milk.The quality of the picture is ok..just ok. There are parts in a couple of episodes where scenes were snipped together, almost like the films we watched in high school. Remember how those films would break and someone would repair them only to have scenes jumping from one minute to the next. If you are a die hard fan of 'Burns and Allen' I would recommended this dvd if only for the low cost.

Unfortunately my expectations for this CD were unmet. While I do appreciate the creativity and considerable talent that went into the production of the CD, I had visions of the live show in mind. As a fanatical Cirque du Soleil performances fan, I'm afraid the \`Inspired By' compilation just didn't work for me. Cirque du Soliel's live shows leave a fantastic and indelible impression in the mind and imagination of the viewer I doubt seriously that they can effectively capture the essence of the performance with anything less then the original!

There are about 10 animals to choose from, about 7 toys, a handful of trees, a few shelters, a few toys, etc. Not much selection at all. This game was literally thrown together quick & thrown in the stores. I could poop something more interesting than this game, really. If you're 5 this might be fun more than a couple minutes, otherwise buy some string or rubberbands, you'll have more fun with them!

The graphics seemed ripped out of the 80's. The gameplay was boring and uninspired. The animal customization (which is what drew us to this game) was very nil.

But looking at it, she has a very fortunate life, and you just wanna smack her and tell her to come down off the cross.There is nothing unusual or dramatic about her life. She is simply a snob who feels sorry for herself because she expects perfection. Poor Jessica Lange stars as the mother. Jessica looks like she is trying to doing an impersonation of Faye Dunaway doing Joan Crawford. And why is Ricca nude on the cover of the DVD? This had nothing to do with the film..I think the director knew he had a stinker and thought maybe this cover shot would help sell it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"any hope for ricci","review":"Listen!i watch & own many Christina Ricci filmsevery time i wish the next film will be better than the nextthat just isn't the caseall her films seem to s^ckexcept buffalo 66& addams familyoh wellmaybe she's the next TRAVOLTAsee you in ten yrs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I changed the channel","review":"Unless you want to sit around and be depressed then you may want to bypass this movie.

Actually, I recommend reading Lasch's book and then not watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bet Ricci's tear ducts needed some prozac after filming this cry-a-thon","review":"Christina Ricci is a great dancer. I bet clubbing with the Ricci would be a night to remember.The problem is that Ricci's manager let her take a role that required her to weep in at least 50% of her scenes.

The book was indeed very good, and truly depicted Elizabeth at her most vulnerable state. That being in a void of depression and knowing that the only thing responsible for it was herself.No sooner than finishing the book had my friend pulled out a japanese release of it on DVD. The more I watched the sicker I got. The movie turns Elizabeth's character into a \\"fated teen\\", displaying her as if the back of her hand was indefinately attached to her forehead. Simply overdramatic and very annoying.Now dont get me wrong, I love Christina Ricci. I loved her most in The Opposite of Sex, which was just another display of how amazing she can be on screen. It wasn't her performance in Prozac Nation that disappointed me, it was the overdramatics of it all that did."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"im not crying because im sad\\"","review":"Christina Ricci is WONDERFUL and fits this part BEAUITFULLY!

After a sudden turn of events, her life goes spiriling downwards back into the depths of hell and trys, but fails to leave the dark hole so many of us have expierenced, depression.QUOTES FROM THE MOVIE:\\"what do you want me to do!? slit my wrists so it can count as a trauma case?!\\"\\"im not crying because im sad, but because i cant imagine how hard it must be to be you.\\"\\"its almost like we're living in a prozac nation\\"\\"people dont act like this unless their on drugs!\\"NOTE: not for the faint of heart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I would agree with this reviewer. \\"Perhaps because of the nature of the film, \\"Prozac Nation\\" will divide the opinions among viewers. Some will find Elizabeth selfish while others relate to her. Whatever your reaction may be, it is hard for anyone to rationalize the complicated psychological aspects of humans' behaviors, and the film also shows that difficulity.\\"The film does a good job at showing how wrong human behavior can go and how tough it is for parents and friends to reach out to someone who is truly disturbed, and even Harvard cannot save some from their own self destructive urges. There is some very good acting going on in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Story?

It seemed that the film left out vital parts of the story, or it was poorly edited/directed. It just seemed really choppy and inconsistent. The value of the plot is immense, I just didn't think that as a package the film delivered it well. The acting was great, though I constantly found myself thinking that Michelle Williams looked so much older than the rest of her peers that the illusion of college was broken for me. I wanted the film to be this deep commentary on our sanctioned drug culture via the mental health audience and I never felt that it got there. It was more a noncommital nontreatment of mental conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Strengthen your Testimony","review":"I thought this was a very good book, he summarizes much of the evidence for the LDS church into this book, very good read, I would highly recommend it to all members of the church, it is also very entertaining...only one thing is at times dosent tell the whole truth, for example he points out how the dead sea scrolls support the Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (which is true) but it also supports the Bibles translation of Isaiah, and other scrolls support neither...but it is a very good book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Just more regurgitated stories.

I'm sure even seasoned massage therapists will learn a thing or two, or at least refresh their knowledge of muscles. The only wish for this DVD is better quality of the video itself.

However, I was expecting something entirely different. I think I was expecting a vinyasa workout with a focus on upper body and back strength.Plus, this is supposed to be a video for beginners. But, I am experienced at yoga and I can't even do some of these moves. Wheel!? I took yoga for over a year and didn't have enough strength to do Wheel pose! I think this could be very intimidating for newbies who dont' understand that it's OK to not be able to do some exercises.

This performance is only a shadow compared to the high energy and excitement of Castro's \\"Live at the Fillmore\\" DVD. The main culprit is simply the quality of the songs themselves, which was much stonger on the Fillmore DVD. The contrast between the two DVDs is so striking that it almost seems like two totally different bands on each DVD.

This is one of the reasons this album sort of disappeared into obscurity. Nonetheless, \\"5:30...\\" is a fantastic album because Lennon Murphy's presence is so overpowering. I give this album 4 stars because of three 5-star songs (\\"Couldn't Breathe,\\" \\"My Beautiful,\\" and \\"5:30 Saturday Morning\\") otherwise I would have had to give it 3 stars. The other songs are good but there is a manufactured feel to them. \\"5:30...\\" is the best song on the album because its just Lennon & the piano, no chance for manufacturing here! \\"My Beautiful\\" is a great song even though Lennon herself wasn't happy with it. She even remakes it on a future album but, personally, the remake isn't as good. \\"Couldn't Breathe\\" is a wonderfully powerful and dynamic song."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an incredible band!!","review":"The first time I listened to the cd I was mesmerized. The talent of all the members is incredible. I think the lyrics are the best part.

Lennon pushes the boundary of typically male music by creating a sound that is her own. Distinct similarities can be drawn to nine inch nails however nothing compares to the melody of a female voice laced with aggresive backing music. Well worth a listen especially if you have an open mind towards a different sound. Lennon will certainly be the next big thing, make sure you read the lyrics it is absolutely amazing stuff.

I love the hard-driving songs, the touching melodies, the thought-provoking lyrics and the whole package. Solid collection of alternative hard rock classics and slower, heart-touching ballads. Just raw talent in all aspects of her music. She really opens herself up for the world to see in her lyrics helping you to feel her inner rage, emptiness and soul searching.

After listening to 5:30 Saturday Morning by Lennon many times with anticipation, I get a feeling of anger and independence, strength and vulnerability, youth and experience. Lennon is a very talented, young woman who has overcome many hardships in her life. This may seem apparent in her lyrics. Her band and music have a heavy, yet melodic sound which is strengthened by her piano abilities. The vocals are powerful and diverse-ranging from sweet and almost childlike to angry and jaded. I am left with a feeling of rebellion and a hope for a better future. Strangely, I feel stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Man, I just cannot trust all the 5-star reviews on Amazon.

It's great to have this novel in print, as a companion and contrast to the very dominant Austen. But I have to say this edition needs reworking; not only are there typos, but the notes are very spotty. Example: one character plays an early form of roulette, called E.O.; do we get a note on social attitudes to new games of chance other than cards? No. Further example: a character goes to visit the Chevalier D'Eon. Do we get a note explaining that this is a real person -- a crossdressing swordfighting real person?!!!!! No. Shame, World's Classics!

Indeed, resistance to the idea of a Trinitarian Deity historically has probably had this motive behind it. That Williams' book enriches our understanding of the Holy Spirit with thoroughness and grace and enhances our sense of mystery and unity within the Divine Trinity at the same time is witness to his skill and commitment as a Biblical scholar. The reader has access within these pages to careful research and honest evaluation in a subject full of potential controversy and dissension among the Christian community.

With multiple confusing flashbacks, a myriad of characters whom we never get to know in any depth, and more than 2 and 1/2 hours of watching Matt Damon look really, really serious to the accompaniment of really, really dreary background music, you end up with a perfect cure for insomnia. Not once did I care about any of the characters, which is critical to the success of this film. They all seemed to be moving underwater, which is a good analogy to describe the pace of the film. Intellectually, I got the point of what the characters did, why they did it, and the gut-wrenching nature of their actions, but it never hit me in the gut.

Some may be put off by the long running time and the lack of big action scenes, but more patient viewers will be rewarded with a compelling presentation of the psychological damage caused when mistrust is the normal state of human interaction. Wilson emerges as a tragic figure, having gone into government service with the best of intentions but, step by step, coming to the point where he becomes responsible for horrific acts.DeNiro does a fine job in his second film as a director. He has assembled an excellent cast, including some outstanding cameos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrrrring.","review":"Rent, do not buy, this movie. Glad I rented it and removed it from my wish list before purchasing. Matt Damon sleepwalks through his role, with very little dialog. Ms. Jolie is terribly mis-cast as the pregnant girlfriend/wife, but does her best with her role. Lots of flashbacks, which are not always clearly communicated to the viewer. I won't bother going over the story (which was told much better in \\"The Company\\" by Robert Littel (warning - get this in paperback -- it's a long but engaging story).And I thought the DaVinci Code was the most boring movie ever made . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Spy movies of all time!","review":"Without a doubt, The Good Shepherd is one of the worst spy movies I have ever seen and I think I have seen almost all of them. I'm not sure where to begin with how bad it is. The main character Edward Wilson is absolutely lifeless and there is zero explanation as to why 3 women find him attractive. There is zero explanation as to how he advances as he seems to do nothing. There are so many contradictions, dead ends, events unexplained and mistakes that you would think an amateur wrote this film. The movie is deliberately dark so as to give the Cloak and Dagger mystique but it fails miserably. And the worst part is it tries to shed the fictional cloak by trying to tie itself to real world events but again fails with so many mistakes that it becomes simply boring and ludicrous. Based on the critics reviews I had high hopes for this movie but I usually find that when the critics hail a movie that it is a bad sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"the good shepherd","review":"I just received this DVD.

It's entirely possible to do a movie about an unlikable and even bland character that makes him interesting and sympathetic. In this character study the creation of an even mildly compelling character whose life we take any real interest in was simply not accomplished. This isn't to say Matt Damon did not act well because he seems to have turned in a decent, understated performace that was befitting of the role. The fact that this is a story about a strange man whose life is his work that is also the story of the birth of the CIA lumps it together with a whole slew of movies that affect for the worse my reaction to this espionage, cold war spy drama. Seems like it could have been a lot more engaging to me, and no I don't mean more action.

Ilike Matt Damon and all of the actors, I appreciated the history lesson, but a bit of a snoozer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillant performance by Matt Damon","review":"This movie never ceases to amaze me. The purpose of acting is to emote. Damon's character has to suppress all emotion, for over 2 hours on screen.This is the story of a highly damaged man who finds his niche as a counter intelligence agent at the outbreak of WWII with the OSS (precursor to the CIA) recruited out of college about 1940, and follows his life through middle age.I find it hard to say he's ruthless, as his character never appears ambitious. Because he feels nothing, he is able to do whatever is asked of him, including arranging several murders.The character is much like La Carre's 'grey man' Smiley, without the intellect, as he never questions what is asked of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent, entertaining film.","review":"The Good Shepherd has a quiet intelligence about it, making subtle and interesting points about the human condition -- about trust, sexuality, intimacy, and rationalization. To be sure, it has it's flaws. It's a bit on the long side -- it could lose half an hour and be a better film for it. Although Matt Damon's performance is unusually understated and his character only marginally sympathetic, it's a riveting turn nonetheless. He's one of those smart, quiet \\"clerks\\" whose emotions lie buried and whose ruthless intelligence makes him capable of just about everything except meaningful human relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I let a stranger into our house.\\"","review":"An excellent film, The Good Shepherd, brings to the screen the events and people that brought about the establishment of the Central Intelligence Agency.The film follows the life and career of Edward Wilson as he plays his role in laying the foundation for one of the best intelligence agencies ever to be set up.Matt Damon, Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, Angelina Jolie, Michael Gambon, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!The acting, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful and along with the mystery that accompanies this film will keep you on your toes throughout the entire 168 minutes.In short, The Good Shepherd is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"unknown history","review":"First I thought the good sheperd would be some kind of \\"JFK\\" film....but the story (ie creation of the CIA) is far most unknown but still very interisting.As for the hd dvd, audio is excellent but doesn't have the opportunity to unchain as the movie run smoothly the all time...Picture is perfect even in dark sequences with extreme dark blacks.Enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"DeNiro created something to talk and think about...","review":"Everything was already told by other reviewers.

Hopefully DeNiro continues the story with a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks freshness and it's filled with skulls and bones...boring","review":"I just didn't like this movie, despite it has some of my favorite actors and actress (Jolie). They all do their jobs well but the story never picks up, it's slow, boring, and filled with cliches (oh by the way she is pregnant; oh no, really?!--compare this to the pregnancy dilemma in \\"The Last King of Scotland\\"). It doesn't show or tell anything we can't guess, nor care. If I were a betting man, Damon probably didn't like this script; but because De Niro is behind the project he probably gave it the green light. Jolie probably needed the money to adopt more kids. This movie is perfunctory at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I can't believe this movie. It took them 2 hours and 40 minutes to tell this story. If you are an insomniac or having trouble sleeping, get this movie and you can kiss your sleepless night's goodbye. This is one of the most boring movies of 2006. I am usually patient with movies and give them a good chance to get going but unfortunately this one didn't get off the ground. I compare it to Kevin Costner's 28 Days. Matt Damon was alright in it I guess, fleeting moments of acting, but the rest of the cast fell a bit short and missed their mark. Hope this review helps your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been good","review":"This film is not complicated or cerebral as some have commented. It tries to be that but these attributes should not be confused with a thin plot supported by a sound track that seems to be in every scene making noises for no reason, disjoined scenes, dark sets and minimal dialogue. It could have been good if the plot and characters were fleshed out. I've watched it three times and the film becomes thinner and the backing track even more pervasive and annoying. A chance was missed with this one.This film is often compared with the Constant Gardener (that did have a plot which needed following). But leaving people confused is not deep film making. All I got out of it was that the central character was a cold blooded, upper class and uncompassionate CIA operative, with little love for himself or his family - so what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly BORING!!!!!!","review":"Don't listen to all these reviews stating how wonderful this movie is...oh my!

By min. 20 I thought I was at least 90 min. into the movie. The only words in my diction I care to employ to describe this movie are tedious, sleep-inducing, ineffective, irritating, and interminably long. Hopefully De Niro and Damon will make more approachable movies from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falls apart at the end","review":"I'm still not sure what happens at the conclusion here. And it is, after all, more than 2.5 hours long, an eternity by today's movie standards. Matt Damon is a little less than convincing as the cold warrior, but this gathers steam, overall, and I did manage to watch it all at one sitting, which is saying something for a long movie. Even Angelina Jolie isn't bad as the neglected wife who just wants to have fun. Flawed, but not a throw-away either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shepherd","review":"Interesting, if disquieting, view of the kind of organization apparently necessary to a nation to stay afloat in today's world: Situation ethics; disposable loyalties; diverse and highly sophisticated technological tools; unswerving but troubling idealisms; personal costs to participants in anguish and guilt; incremental compromises of original principles; patriotic ruthlessness.... Our eventual realization that both our friends and our enemies have similar organizations, for similar reasons, creates in us, the viewers, a more-in-sadness-than-in-anger awareness that parallel organizations have probably always existed and, of necessity, probably always will. The film's dialogue is often muffled, oblique, and hard to understand---in keeping with its atmosphere of secrecy---but the viewer thereby tends to lose the detail thread of what's going on at the moment. A film to watch several times, but not one where the viewer ends up envying the participants' lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore!","review":"Again this is a really bad surprise. This is another example of how you take an exceptional cast and manage to botch up a movie. When I saw the trailer in December 2006 I was looking forward to seeing thi movie about the birth of the CIA. Unfortunately it is way too slow-moving and somehow not that interesting in parts. Matt Damon is good in the role of a future spy-master who is recruited after studying at Yale. He then manages to meet and marry the sister of one of his upper-class friends. How he then manages to become such a grey and rather uninterseting character afterwards is more a problem of the script and probably of the directing. Indeed, while the start is confusing, the rest is worse because it actually manages to get uninteresting. As I write, to have such a splendid cast and to manage to ahve them act well in what could be an interesting movie and make it become such a bore is quite an undertaking. Snore."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a joke...","review":"I saw it in the theater and man this movie sucks! This is the only movie that literally fell asleep to.

He also wanted to give it another chance. Well, that wasnt the case. I had to leave in the first 20 minutes because it was that bad. The only reason he wanted me to see it cause he wanted me to suffer through it like him. HAH! Well I knew better. I came back for the last 15 minutes of the movie (it was still on).

It's a good thriller with a complicated plot and worth the rewinds if you do have to watch again to digest everything between and during the flashbacks.

This is one of the most boring, overly complex and simply crappy movie I have ever seen. I thought the Larry the Cable Guy disaster 'Health Inspector' was the bottom of the barrel - we just found a new bottom with this one.The main problem I find with this movie is the total focus on the dedicated, dull character Matt Damon plays. Mind you, there are a few great moments (especially when he talks to Pesci), but just no enough to make this 'compelling'. Acutally, when I see that word describing a movie on the box, I tend to think that this is really the only verb one could use because 'good' would be a stretch!With all the really great and even mediocre movies out there, pass on this one...you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Longest Film Ever Made(at least thats what it felt like)","review":"I was very optimistic when I watched this film.

Why were women attracted to him? I've never been attracted to mutes myself. Also the plot was a confusing, jumbled mess. I think this film committed the worst crime possible-it didn't give the viewer a reason to care about the characters or the plot.It was also a very boring film.Considering all the critics' hype I was expecting at least a marginally enjoyable film.

Again, I get that it is supposed to be a film with a dark, grave subject matter, but I would also imagine that the audience is supposed to be able to actually see the film. I found myself squinting and wishing that someone would turn on the lights.3. The characters left me cold. I was unable to care about any of them, even Angelina Jolie, and I usually like Angelina Jolie. I just found myself wishing that the film would end. It had a high \\"so what\\" factor.

Perhaps the CIA really was formed as depicted in this insufferably boring film, but having Angelina Jolie inexplicably throw herself at Matt Damon's gloomy, robotic character calls even the most basic facts into question.But worse than that is the amateurish script. Each scene lasts about fifteen seconds before moving onto the next--often unrelated--scene. So we see the set up, say, of a scene, then the outcome, but not the drama in between. If you've seen a TV movie in the last few years, you may get what I'm talking about.

No-one could take the torture of the work over plot and even worse, the wooden acting.While Matt Damon is never the most emotional actor, in this role he outdid Kevin Costner in the hello-I-am-a-wooden-cigar-indian acting. What is it about Hollywood that they think they can donn a few fedoras and fifties/sixties spectacles, presume conspiratorial theories and think they can teach history with effete aplomb? - Completely bogus and unsupported.Fortunately DeNiro supplies the comic relief as he fulfills a completely out of place F-word scene to demonstrate his own true limited range.Having trouble sleeping?

Honey, get the popcorn!At least that's how it should have gone. Unfortunately the recent '06 film \`The Good Shepherd' falls far short of my pre-viewing expectations. It is exceedingly slow, too long and the farthest thing from being a thriller than one could imagine. Damon sleep walks through this 2 hour, 48 minute snooze fest and Angelina is delegated to the role of a long suffering ignored housewife (as if that could happen).Alas, it could have been great.

My friend was even more aggravated than I was.I don't recommend the movie if you are looking to be educated on the birth of the CIA.Also, there is violence and sexuality in this movie so it may not be appropriate for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT so great!!!","review":"I read all the reviews and was extremely disappointed with my purchase.

But the worst sin is that the filmmakers had the conceit to stretch this thing out to 2 hours and 48 minutes! Good production values are the only reason I gave this 2 instead of 1 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom","review":"One of the most boring, uneventful, and dull movies I have ever watched. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please DeNiro, give us a break","review":"In case anyone is misinformed, Robert DeNiro is just an anti-American hippie. This so-called tale, or maybe tale is a better description than story, is so far out of touch with history that it is pathetic. Yes, sometimes the CIA can be pretty pathetic, too, but at least their pathos is not contrived, it just happens, humans being human, after all. DeNiro's pathetic film is totally contrived and seems to be directed at making the USA's spy mission somehow evil. What were we (the US) to do during the Second World War and the following Cold War? Close our eyes and pretend that the Soviets and Papa Joe Stalin were a bunch of nice guys not trying to get us. They certainly were trying to get us and if sometimes our spy agencies screwed up, well, as I said above, they were human; and if anyone thinks the Soviets didn't screw up, they need to read up on their history.All in all a pathetic picture, made more pathetic by poor editing and historically inaccurate tale-telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try wearing slip-ons next time....","review":"Does it get any better than Michael Gambon's off-screen scream?

The film is as dry as can be. My brother and I actually stopped on the way home after the film just to get something to quench our parched mouths. Everyone save you money on this one. The theater was packed and I feel everyone was disappointed. I am not sure who edited this but it easily could have been the same bad film with only 2 hours of footage. I am amazed that such fascinating subject matter could be made so boring. That sucky phony lame film National Treasure was better and I hate that film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"Lundberg Rice has come under fire recently from the FDA and Consumer Reports for the high levels of arsenic found in their rice products. These rice cakes arrived in good condition but were dry and brittle, while also being unable to remain in tact while trying to spread peanut butter or jelly on them due to crumbling easily. I am so sorry that Lundberg has come under fire since they have been one of the few surviving farms that actually grow their food instead of succumbing to GMO manufacturing. I will continue to purchase Lundberg products, but these cakes arrived outdated and dry. Would not recommend this seller again, sadly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilt-free cake","review":"Okay, it is nothing at all like a birthday cake, but if you like something with a little taste, that is chewy and nutritious, these salt-free rice cakes made with brown rice is a good choice.I wish they wouldn't crumble quite so much, but it is worth it for these little treats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Edible; they fall apart in your hand, not in your mouth","review":"I ordered these in an attempt to have healthier snacks. I usually enjoyed the taste and texture of rice cakes. Maybe this is just what brown rice cakes are like versus the white I'd previously known, but these were the driest rice cakes I'd ever known. Most of the rice cakes fell apart somewhat at the slightest touch, and as I finally eat the last bag after four months with them, I have a spare bag of the crumbs which is almost entirely full.On the plus side, they are rather shelf stable. The first bite months ago was as good as the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lundberg brown rice cake, salt free","review":"I find them excellent, but I never use table salt, so I''m used to salt free food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will they be crumbled?","review":"I buy these for my dogs to help in controlling their weight and they are salt free. However, I like them with peanut butter. My only complaint is that I never know if they are going to arrive so that few are broken in bits. This last order seems to be much better than the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior rice cakes","review":"These are by far the best rice cakes I have tried. They are really crunchy and don't have that styrofoamy quality that most cheap rice cakes have. They also taste great. Not too salty or too sweet - you can actually taste the rice. Only complaint is that they crumble a lot and have to be careful not to drop all that goodness on the floor. That means I have to use a plate or eat them over the sink. In any case, they taste so good that this minor problem will not prevent me from buying them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crumble Cakes!!!","review":"I would not recommend anyone to purchase these cakes. They crumble really, really bad. I had to use them as cereal they were so bad. Will not purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, satisfying","review":"This very healthy snack is crunchy, tasty and fills you up. I enjoy it with various nut butters and jellies, butter, or you can even make a pizza out of it. You can eat these (in moderation of course) and not feel guilty because you've eaten something healthy. It's a great gluten free choice also. Lundberg is my favorite brand, because they do a great job with the taste and texture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only two episodes?","review":"After being very pleased with the first two installments of this series, I have waited anxiously for this most resent tape and it maintains the high quality of the previous episodes and then some. The first episode is refreshing in that it is a complete story involving real people and not just a mad boomer getting blown to bits. The second episode begins to get away from the previous obsession the series has had with Linna and begins to look more at Priss. We get a chance to see into her head and begin to dig up hints about her past. Prior to this, our only hints to Priss' past (at least in video) have been some brief flashbacks in the Hurricaine videos.My big complaint, why only two episodes? The first two tapes had three episodes apiece, yet I'm paying just as much for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Jose Jose I know!!!","review":"Unfortunately, this Jose Jose CD is both very disappointing and incredibly ill-conceived. For starters, the ranchera songs are totally inappropriate for him. Secondly, most of these songs are definitely and unquestionably inferior to anything he recorded previously. With the exceptions of the smooth pop-baladas \\"Ya Lo Sabia\\" and \\"Necesito Un Amor\\" this CD has nothing to recommend it. Jose Jose really needs to work again with the likes of Roberto Livi, Rafael Perez Botija or Manuel Alejandro."},{"rating":"1","title":"He can still do a lot better!","review":"I own every single CD ever recorded by Jos�� Jos�� therefore I have the audacity to believe that I'm quite familiar with his voice, his talent and his style. No, his voice is not quite as strong as it was, let's say, twenty years ago. But, I saw him in concert about a year ago and he showed that he still has enough voice to be able to record a much better album than this. With the exception of one song, this was a waste of his time and ours- his fans. He needs to get back together with a composer like Roberto Livi or Manuel Alejandro who fully understands Jos��'s talent and magic! Nonetheless, he is still, and will always be, El Pr��ncipe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a First Communion Set","review":"As a First Communion gift set, this is beautiful.

The album isn't nearly as intense or as memorable as The Fundamental Elements Of Southtown or Brown. I'm worried Howard Benson got his hands on the boys right when they were hitting it big, and turned their style completely around. Not that I'm saying Benson is a preying mantis waiting for the next group to take under his wing when they make it big, far from it. But I'm sorry, this is NOT the classic P.O.D. sound we've all come to luv and respect.I mean, could anyone have ever imagined songs like Alive, Youth Of The Nation, Satellite, Anything Right, Ghetto, and Thinking About Forever on any previous P.O.D. release?Although the lyrics are very evangelical, I'm afraid the musical element of this album has taken a blow for the worse. Hopefully the boys (with or without Benson) will be able to regain their touch for their next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This CD!","review":"One word: wow.

A little later, I heard it from one of my friends and I ran out and bought it right away. This music hits so hard...it's awesome. You got everything from the faster, harder beats of \\"Boom\\", to the awe-inspiring lyrics of \\"Youth of the Nation\\". That aforementioned song is one of the best and most powerful songs I have ever heard...it really makes you think long and hard about reality. Well, there's not much to say except that, if you like Korn or Limp Bizkit or just about any other metal/rap band out there, you'll love this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the most powerful CD ever","review":"This CD is for EVERYONE it combines some pretty hard edge \\"traditional\\" POD stuff with all types of musical influences.

Very unique. People have been dissin POD lately. sayin that they arent christians cuz they on the blair witch II soundtrack and stuff. ever hear of preaching to the lost. and so what if they thank KoRn and whatnot. KoRn sorta started the genre! and they are most likely awsome witnesses to Jon Davis and crew. however I think the rumor that Wuv is gonna replace Jon Davis isnt true... because KoRn is really not .... Christian at all and I think thats going a little far. but other than that. stop saying they dont live the life! you dont know them. from their music I'de say that they have no comprimized their walk with god. and just so you dont think that Im a biased jesus blinded music fan (I love Jah! tho) System of a Down's new CD is awsome (As good as this). So get this and get Toxicity."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD GO AND BUY IT NOW","review":"I am absolutely in love with cd. This is a cd where you can just sit back and listen to it without having to skip tracks. EVERY song on this cd rocks but some of my personal favorites are...Set it Off, Alive, Youth of the Nation which talks about the school shootings, and the song Satellite. I definitely think \\"satellite\\" is just as good as brown, snuff the punk and fundamental elements of southtown.

The only problem I have with the record is that it starts strong with Tracks 1-3, gets weak with tracks 4 and five then gets better with tracks 6-12, but weakens with similar sounding material as the beginning of the album. This is a good album, just not a great album that you can listen to the whole way thorugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Umm...Masterpiece","review":"OK, I'll admit it, Fundamental Elements of Southtown was a promising debut, but it really wasn't my thing. I'm not a huge rap-metal freak, and besides the positive message, I didn't find anything too different from the run-of-the-mill rap-metal. And when I heard the first single \\"Alive\\", I wasn't too sure about buying this.But this is outstanding! POD has inproved so much on Satellite. Every song is either something you can bounce to (Set it Off, Boom, Messanjah, Portrait), something you can relax to (Youth of the Nation, Ghetto, Thinking About Forever), or just plain listen to (Ridiculous). This is such a huge step over normal rap-metal.My favorite song is \\"Portrait\\". It's heavy, it's got a great riff, and the message is great to (that is, if you can understand it).Basically, what I'm saying is that you need to get this rap-metal masterpiece.

The rest of this album is the biggest waste of space ever produced! It's absolutely horrendous and completely unbearable! I cannot beleive that anyone would enjoy it, let alone give it a good rating.There are so many smaller, less famous bands, that get only half the ratings these guys do, and they are ten-fold more interesting.I have no idea how these guys became so popular, but certainly don't buy this album just because you liked Youth of the nation or Alive.

It has more continuity than the last album which i felt peaked in places (Rock the Party, Southtown)but dipped in others. This has a more consistent feel to it. In a genre that is already looking a bit tired - lyrically most other acts wander in an aimless existence spouting their meaningless drivel - P.O.D. have a positive & poweful message & reinforce it with plenty of originality musically - what more can you ask for in an album ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like any other rock band","review":"Maybe it's just coincidence, but in two major-label recordings produced by Howard Benson P.O.D. has lost its unique musical identity. On Satellite, multi-tracked guitars and vocals plus keyboard treatments suffocate, leaving no room for the band to breathe musically and trapping passionate lyrical material inside passionless, homogenized musical packaging. At their best P.O.D. is a plug-and-play band that incorporates rap, hard-core, funk and reggae into a fresh,interesting and moving sound (see P.O.D.'s \\"Brown\\"). However, working with Benson seems to have swallowed that promise and fated them in the worst of ways: they sound like any other hard rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"As the city crumbled, Satellite sent me a message of love","review":"...This POD record could not have come at a better time. Satellite is about straight up LOVE. Every track is an inspiration to keep your head up, trust in God, trust in life, trust in your friends and family. Trust in Love. Not just in this time of crisis but years after, and life will never be the same.POD is heading toward a more melodic future of music, and even though some fans will be dissapointed and others will see them as selling out. In the end thats not the point, I won't remember POD as \\"gettin softer\\" I will remember them as giving me shining hope from above, with their DEEP lyrics, haunting melodies, and down to earth emotion. This album is honest, if you hate them for loving God, what if someone hated you for loving your mom or your dad? We see Faith as such a Taboo thing, we see God as an enemy and not a friend. Don't you see people, its all about LOVE...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satellite is Alive","review":"As this CD plays on you'll find it has some soft parts to it. But the only song that was ok not great was ghetto. It was not really about anthing. The strong parts really make this CD become a 4 because \\"Alive\\" and \\"Youth of the Nation\\" are two of the best songs that POD have every written. Satellite is a CD for mostly people 10 and up it has some suggestive songs but it is good so buy it. It will make a great addition to your CD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Rockish","review":"I remember my first POD album (snuff the punk) that I got in the mail in 1995. I knew that this band was going to make it big from there catchy song 'He's coming back' with crazy bass guitar. 'Satelite' has sure shown that the band has progressed over the past 7 years. The sound on the new album is tighter with more of a Rock sound and less rap. POD needed to make this direction towards Rock; the talent on songs like 'Youth of the nation' is amazing! The best part of this album is that there is not one song I will skip over when listening to the album, its entirely catchy. This was the critical album to prove that POD was not a one-hit wonder after 'southtown', and POD sure proved that they are not. Im just still waiting for the POD double disc album with one cd containing their normal sound, and the other cd with their Latin Jazz songs...wow, that would be amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd, but could have been better","review":"P.O.D. is a good group with plenty of potential, but they could be so much more. Songs such as \\" set it off, alive, boom, youth of a nation, satellite, and the messenjah\\" are great to liosten to but such fillers as \\"ridiculous, ghetto, and without jah nothin\\" ruin a perfect score. if P.O.D. would stick to hard core rock instead of jamaican styled music they could do so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preserve wildlife.

The production is next to putting your head on a steel door and having someone pound on the door from the other side. Production is awful, musical instrument playing is okay, rapping is awful, songs are better than that of this genre. I give it two stars simply because they're less fake than Kid Rock which is not hard to accomplish."},{"rating":"1","title":"why!!!!!!","review":"this has to be one of the worst cds i have bought in my life. most of the songs are awful or are b side material. Most of the songs have nothing going for them. very strung out material that goes nowhere. The thing that really is frustrating is how the album is so inconsistent. It doesn't feel like these songs should be on the same album. The radio hits are the only good things going for this sorry disc. I learned my lesson never buy cd based off of radio play alone. the music is not catchy, engaging with complex rhythms, no real musicianship shown here."},{"rating":"2","title":"They rule","review":"I realy love the song \\"Youth of the Nation\\" it sounds it's talking about teen kids shooting up schools.

They say \\"Youth of the Nation\\" is better than \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" they must be on some kind of Pavlovian dog trip cos the song is pathetic compared to the Pink Floyd classic. \\"Alive\\" is just a poor man's Creed tune.

This is an awesome CD from an awesome band. I bought Satellite today and thought it was really cool like Linkin Park crossed with Rage. The best tracks are Set it Off, the Messenjah (Messenger), Boom, and Masterpiece Conspiracy. Set it Off is the track that most sounds like Rage. In fact, if you heard it, and didn't know it was POD, you'd swear it was Rage. So, if you like Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Korn, Rage, Powerman 5000, etc., you have to buy Satellite"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satellite!!","review":"I think or better yet I know P.O.D.'s new album is awesome. Wuv, Sunny, Marcos, and Traa have really outdone themselves this time. P.O.D is a great band sending out a great message. The songs on \\"satellite\\" are Christian based and are very inspirational.

Whether you like alternative rock, rap, hard rock, punk, slow rock and there is even some ska in Satellite. This is how P.O.D made the change of the century, going from heavy metal to ska and punk and makeing it sound good even to metalheads is an amazing talent. Talent. Talent is the only way P.O.D has made it this far otherwise they would have broken up by now. And thats also what makes P.O.D so popular, they succesfully created music that no one could truly say they hate. Every song on this CD is worth listining to even the twenty-second long ones. I highly recommend \\"Satellite\\" the latest of P.O.D, experience it forn your self."},{"rating":"2","title":"tiring to listen to","review":"p.o.d. will always make albums that tire out most music listeners but the energy they sport on Satellite is overwhelming. More melodic than the platinum selling Southtown but with even more energy and grit p.o.d. succeeds to grow as a band.

I didn't know whether or not i'd like it. I finally did and it turns out that i love EVERY SONG on the album. Seriously, if you're not sure whether or not you'll like it, this is the best c.d. i've ever had, and you've definitly have to get it!

It gives my kids and I an enjoyable listen together...how uncool huh. Well neither of them are teenagers quite yet.The thing is that in my youth, the generation gap was most noticable in the kinds of music my folks chose from those that I did. Now we can all rock to Jimi, Zep, Clapton, The Beatles, the Stones....and we're adding to the catalog with new recordings from artists such as P.O.D., the Foo Fighters, the Dandy Warhols, Jimmy Eat World or the Ladies. Plus slowly but surely, the kids are grooving to Sinatra, Benny Goodman, Mozart, Beethoven, and Tchaikovsky...to name a few of the influences my folks enjoyed exposing me to...The voice of GOD echos in the reverb on this recording. The force light is not under a bushell - their Christianity shines forth from the darkness of the media. The message is the thing.

Otherwise, though, despite my name critique, the plot was good. I too have a grandfather much like Izzy--very stubborn. He also died recently. The author, Ms. Mazer, must have had someone close to her die in a similar manner (or else she is very good at fabrications!) because the death of Izzy was very, um, accurately portrayed, if I may say that.

She is the main character in After The Rain. Rachael's personality changes a lot during this book. Rachael is a worrier. She worries about everything. Throughout the book she wonders if Lewis, the boy she likes, will ever like her back. She also worries about other teenager concerns. I think this book really relates well to young people because it talks about many issues that they have to face. It takes Rachael's dying grandfather for her to finally realize that she shouldn't worry so much. Rachael's grandfather is a very tough, stubborn old man. He seems like a very hard person to relate to. I think that the characters in this story are very well portrayed. It makes the storyline very interesting and keeps you reading all the way to the end. It is very interesting to see if Rachael will find a way to reach her grandfather and make him understand her, and help Rachael understand herself better too."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME FIND!","review":"I really loved this book. I started reading it one morning and finished it that night. I just couldn't put it down. Racheal was struggling with issues that teens deal with everyday. It takes ur grandfather, a man she dis-liked because of his harsh ways, to make her wake up. Just a simple walk everyday helped her reach inside the only skin deep harshness of the man. Her grandfather has a set time to live and Racheal helps him live each day to the fullest!

Stick with Julie.I do hope she has an updated edition in the works for the upcoming Lewis and Clark bicentennial.

So why buy a CD ROM, which can only be played on your computer? DVD is less pricey too- The CD ROM auto-starts with a Macromedia (Flash?) interface that works rather badly (at best is cumbersome), and on my PC shrinks the film to a small square in the middle of the screen. You will be well advised to navigate into the CD to the folder called VIDEO (using Windows Explorer) and open the .MOV files yourself manually.

We've seen it all before on the season episodes, and the screenplay was not interesting, and also a little confusing. The few scenes that made me laugh kept me from ragging on this movie even more.

Based on reviews, I was expecting much worse when I purchased the DVD, which is why I waited so long to buy a copy. No, at no point was I in tears laughing like I have for several episodes of Reno: 911, but I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie. At no point was I wishing the scene would move on to something better. And at no point did the scene or script become so ridiculously stupid that I had to stop the DVD because I felt dumber from watching it. So it is definitely not deserving of some of the low ratings bestowed on it. Perhaps some were offended by the raunchy nude/sex scenes that lend little to nothing to the movie. In this particular genre of comedy, I rate it four stars with five stars being Scary Movie 3 and one star being such atrocities as Date Movie (which I tried to watch twice and could not bring myself to finish).

They tried a little too hard to make it funny but it just falls flat. In many ways this is a vulgar movie. Showing guys jerking off through their hotel windows is not funny, even though I think they meant it to be. Also what could have been a very funny sequence involving a beached whale seemed to focus a little too much on breasts of a couple of the girls on the nude beach or more correctly the topless beach. There were some semi-porn scenes in the motel. If you want to make a porn movie, make a porn movie. If you want to make a comedy, make a comedy. This appeared to try and mix the two and didn't succeed at either. This could have been so much more. It's mildy entertaining and it has its moments, but mostly it's not worth your time.

Don't be fooled though, she will give you concrete tips and advice as how to handle EVERY possible situation and she went far beyond the point where those clinically, matter-of-fact books stop and leave you in the dark.This author did a wonderful job.

Every time I found a place to stop (which wasn't often), I was amazed in realizing how much *more* I could respect and reflect on my 3-year old's individuality ... him being himself. I can anonymously admit (grin) that our relationship has improved from just reading this book.It provided some great insights for understanding and managing situations (which have worked in practice), and showed how, even in the thick of a scene that we have an opportunity - an obligation - to work lovingly *with* our children's unique collection of attributes rather than battling them to fit into some proscribed mold (seeing my own reflection in the book was also sobering <grin>).I have even ordered a few more copies to share (constructively and professionally, of course) with others involved in his care and development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real help, not hype","review":"This book was recommended to me by my doctor, and I almost cried when I started reading it because my son fits the \\"spirited\\" profile in so many ways. If you have a child who isn't necessarily hyperactive, ADD, etc, but just seems to require extra care and effort, check out this book. Kurcinka goes through the different character traits of spirited kids and offers simple, PRACTICAL strategies to make life run a little more smoothly. Some are so simple, you'll kick yourself for not coming up with them on your own, but that's the whole point: it doesn't have to be hard. The writing style is very easy to read, with plenty of real kid examples taken from the many parents Kurcinka has helped through the years. Buy a copy for yourself because you'll want to keep it handy for reference, and then buy another for a friend (or two).

There is no reason that ANY child cannot be taught to behave appropriately. This book suggests that there's nothing I can do to change my child, so I should just change everyone and everything else around her to accommodate her. I think I'll read The Omnipotent CHild, as suggested by other reviewers... Hopefully it'll teach how to help my child live in the real world and accept that it doesn't revolve around her!

Enough said on that.As a drama, this is simply fantastic. Many standout performances. I've always been a huge Malcolm McDowell fan and loved his portrayal of the title character in Caligula. However, I forgot all about that performance in light of John Hurt's take on the same character. For the rest of my years I will never forget his dance in drag.I was quite fascinated by the documentary of the never released Hollywood version of this. What was most interesting was seeing Charles Laughton in action as Claudius. As great as Derek Jacobi was in his role, I have to say that the definitive take on Claudius would certainly have gone to Laughton had this movie version ever been released. Remarkable.At any rate, if you've never seen this, check it out.

The fact that I can now get a good copy, an uncut copy, is wonderful. One of the best historical dramas to come out of television, outside of HBO's ROME. And let us look at all the star power. John Hurt, Derek Jaccobi, Patrick Stewart, Brian Blessed, George Baker, and John Rhys-Davies just to name a few of the actors you will notice.Based on a book from the 1930s, some of the facts are no longer facts and some of the scenes were pure fiction to begin with, but it makes for great television viewing, even if we know that Claudius is fact was NOT a very nice person. Just sit back, turn down the lights and enjoy it. I would suggest, readingSick Caesars: Madness and Malady in Imperial Romeif you want to know more about the early Emperors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful --- entertaining, educational, excellent series!!!","review":"You've got to hand it to the British --- they may not have Hollywood's budgets or special effects, but their actors and writers are among the best in the world! The casting in this series is superb! And it gives the viewer an excellent insight into the daily lives of those in power during the early days of Imperial Rome! I recently took a college course on this subject, and this series was a GREAT HELP in my better understanding the personalities of this very important period of history! It's almost like watching a \\"soap opera\\" in that the characters draw you in, but it's based on reality, not fiction, and is therefore so much more valuable as a work of cinematic story-telling! Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Performances/Awful Sound","review":"This is an acting tour de force especially the performance of Sin Phillips who is absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately the picture is not very brilliant, nor is the sound, which is awful. I had to pump the sound level on the TV to the top level and turn on the stereo speakers and I still couldn't hear what they were saying at times. However, performances like these come along very rarely, especially today. I doubt you will see this kind of greatness on American TV again. Luckily they restored the original opening with the African dance. It had been cut for US audiences when originally presented in prudish American. I do wonder though if the scene where Claudius opens the door on Drucilla, after Caligula had eaten her baby, showed the horror of what he had just done. It seems to me that there is an abrupt cut in the scene as if we were meant to look inside the door but a censor decided we shouldn't see what was there. That has always bothered me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old days in Rome","review":"Aside from a few very minor audio problems, the DVDs were of excellent quality. After 30 years the program lives up to its reputation as one of the finest miniseries ever televised. It puts HBO's \\"Rome\\" to shame. The acting was superb. Derek Jacobi as Claudius, a young John Hurt as Caligula, Brian Blessed (Augustus), Sian Phillips (Livia), and all the rest are outstanding. Not a lemon in the bunch. Derek Jacobi's performance was astonishing when you compare it to Charles Laughton's portrayal of Claudius in the unfinished Alex Korda 1937 screen adaptation of \\"I, Claudius\\". He actually makes Laughton look like an amature. A word to the wise for your young ones. It lives up to its billing as portraying \\"ruthless ambition, debauchery (nudity and sex), and murderous intrigue\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roman History - another view","review":"Greetings:I first saw a poor copy of this in Germany.

Bet you never saw an emperor go mad, think he was a god, marry his sister, get her pregnant, tie her up and then cut the unborn child out of her while she was still alive. Talk about ceasarean section! There are no hollywood scripts here. It's all taken from actual Roman history. Many of the great British actors are in this film including a very new to the business Patrick Stewart. It's sort of low budget. No real special effects.

Robert Graves' novel took the bits and pieces of recorded history about Claudius and turned that into a mesmerizing book told from the supposedly idiotic Emperor's point of view. The BBC series went a step further by adding living drama to the classic book and showcased some of the most skilled actors of our time. It's interesting to note that the series' biggest stars, Derek Jacobi, Brian Blessed, John Hurt, et al are all still highly respected stage actors. Do yourself a favor and make sure your children watch this too!

What is the reasoning? Is it censorship or stupidity? It's like spending money to buy a beloved book on tape to listen to in your car, and then finding out it has been abridged.

Seeing this again after so many years I must say the acting and the screenplay has absolutely lost none of it's original punch and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Derek Jacobi was remarkable in thie role of Claudius and the other actors are all superb. The story of the treachery and debauchery during this period of Roman history makes for some great theater. Masterpiece Theater has never topped this in my opinion although some of their other productions were outstanding. as well.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the transfer isn't the best and the sound quality is poor.

Mordantly funny and painful at the same time. The Lion in Winter can't hold a candle to it, even though that's a wonderful movie.

My hearing is not that bad, but I gave up after an hour; tried wearing headphones--better, but tiring. Why in heaven's name would anyone release such a marvelous film without closed captioning? It seems to be a problem with a number of British video releases. Do they not have hearing disabled people in the UK? Or do they assume that all Americans have perfect hearing?Too bad.

This is the KOREAN REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION. Oy.Anyway, the Korean remake is slightly confusing -- it's almost as if they expected you to have already watched the original Japanese version.The acting is very stale. Very, very stale. The two main characters are often in conflict with each other, even when they shouldn't be.Their portrayl of Eun-Suh (Sadako, Samara, in other versions) is rather interesting.

All in all, these are easily the best plate shoe on the market. The only drawback is that they are a little less dressy than other plate shoes. These look and feel more like sneakers than other shoes that look more like dress shoes or golf shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child's play Great Rock -n- Roll at its best","review":"Child's Play Rat Race what rock-n Roll is all about Play it Loud -n- Proud ."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT!!!","review":"If you like partying music this is the one to get.

He also manages to meet a nice girl who may want to settle down with him.

The story is clever and funny and touching and suspenseful, and the cast is splendid (One can watch Steenburgen and McDowell falling in love as they make the film (They were later married). And David Warner makes a superb Jack the Ripper (and gets the lion's share of the best lines: \\"Ninety years ago I was a freak. Today I'm an amateur.\\") There's also a luscious musical score by Miklos Rozsa (Listen to the little tune playing in the background at the revolving restaurant!).

In the original, when H.G. was traveling through time, the vantage point from his chair changed showing lady's fashions in a store window (Macy's?) changing as he went through the decades. Also it showed what happened to his home over the decades (it was torn down), That part of the movie was quite entertaining and a lot more interesting than the flashing lights and special effects and no views on the current version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dvd of entertainment","review":"This is a very entertainning video.

Wells in a role that could not be further removed from 'A Clockwork Orange\\". He is strongly supported by the gorgeous Mary Steenbergen who I fell in love with during the movie and David Warner who plays Jack The Ripper gives a fine menacing performance too. This was the original \\"fish out of water\\" movie that became so prevalent in recent years.This movie has aged well since 1979 and I regurlarly hire it from my Video Store to recapture my wild, recklesss youth.Ah Nostalgia.

A very imaginative plot and great premise with actors perfectly cast and you believe they really are these people. Very witty script and many fun suprises. You will want to watch it many times because there are so many funny lines and sequences to enjoy. The 1979 clothes and hair styles are also fun to watch. Malcom and Mary are so perfect I dont think anyone else could've played these parts. Even though parts of the story are hard to believe you do believe it because of them. Even the strange ending is fun and touching and makes you wish there was a sequel so you could find out what happens to these characters later.

It's a dense, first person account of an extraordinary out-of-body odyssey that spans the entire life of the cosmos and beyond. We meet myriad worlds, alien life-forms ranging from crustaceans to conscious galaxies, and even the Star Maker himself, the great Creator. I don't know what Mr Stapledon was smogged on when he wrote this but I've never seen this many SF ideas packed into one novel. He penned it in 1937, which is kind of staggering because it means he probably coined more SF concepts in Star Maker than anyone else has in a full career.It's tough going in places due to the relentless bombardment of ideas without a proper narrative. The author also drifts outside SF throughout; he's spiritually/philosophically inclined. But he's also a poet, and I really lapped up the eloquence of his prose. My imagination reeled for days after finishing it. As trailblazing SF, it's a one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A milestone.","review":"Although I just began reading novels a few years ago, I could tell Star Maker was no regular book. I often found myself struggling with Stapledons long explanations , but also dumbstruck by his grand description of the Star Maker.

It was then that I got a glimpse of what this book was really about."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and unrewarding","review":"I rather doubt Douglas Adams \\"was thinking of Stapledon when he invented, in the Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy [actually, in \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\"]...the Total Perspective Vortex\\", just as I doubt former Late Show host Johnny Carson was thinking of Stapledon when he parodied Carl Sagan with his \\"billions and billions\\" speech. Douglas Adams and Johnny Carson were quite capable of finding out for themselves, without help from Stapledon, that the universe is big and that time is vast.For that matter, it is a different thing for comics to harp on this simple-minded theme and for a science fiction writer who seems to take himself very seriously to do so. Rather than read \\"Star Maker\\" or \\"The First and Last Man\\", I suggest you read instead H. G. Wells's short story \\"Under the Knife\\", written several decades earlier. \\"Under the Knife\\" deftly and SUCCINCTLY puts the \\"Total Perspective Vortex\\" itself into perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great view, handy size","review":"Having several pairs of high end binoculars, I can say without question that the clarity of these binoculars is unbeatable.

Some people complain about this book starting out slow. That is true, but necessary.

I thought there would be more original musicians of Motown's \\"Snake Pit\\". It seems that Jack Ashford has his own \\"Funk Brothers\\" band, and some of the other musicians aren't alive anymore or just not interested in hitting the road again. With the exception of the great vocals of Marcia Ware, the other singers are ok. I'd say that the other band members are just as skilled as the FB trio. So it's a great show to watch, although I wish there had been one produced just as well as \\"Soul Comes Home\\" (celebrative show of Stax Records' singers/groups), for the Funk Brothers.If you want to see most of the original FB in action, try \\"Standing In The Shadows of Motown\\". This is a fantastic documentary released in 2003. Some of the members that gave in interviews for this film are already deceased, so it's an important piece of Motown history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love for musicians that we never knew","review":"Great to hear the music behind the music.

Well it seems the critics don't like the style of this disc either. My advice? Stop calling yourselves fans, and follow another band that doesn't have the balls or creativity to do anything different. As for this disc, it ranks up there with their best material.

That said, Nothingface is my favorite band without question. They have a unique sound, the best extreme rock vocalist in Matt Holt, and killer songwriting abilities.Pacifier is not their best album. I think it is their weakest overall, but that makes it better than 90% of the other bands out there. The major thing that is lacking is the production on this album. On their subsequent albums, you'll notice a huge difference in sound quality.This one sounds very raw, but for most of the album, that is a good thing. It has a very in your face, live sound to it. If you are just getting into Nothingface, I suggest starting at the beginning or get all four discs at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut!","review":"This Cd is great but doesn't sound as good as their second album.

This car immediately lost its value and I was injured in the crash. I could have hired an attorney to settle my claim, but I first wanted to see what it might be worth and how the system worked. This book was extremely helpful. I was able to successfully resolve the property damage claim for a reasonable amount and the bodily injury claim as well all without hiring an attorney. The book has a lot of good advice and sample letters to assist in writing claims and what to do to negotiate or further pursue the claim after the first few settlement offers. This book, along with a lot of patience, was very helpful in my settling my own claim. I'm very glad I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful to explain the basics of your case.","review":"I would certainly recommend this book if you are considering a personal injury claim against someone.

Hogwash. The songs on here are creative, energetic, and while not always as memorable as some of their other best work, excellent throughout. My only real complaint is there are only eight songs. That's probably better than the alternative, though: packing the cd with filler material.

While the music and performance is typical expert Toto, the songs themselves are mediocre and unmemorable, with the possible exception of IF THIS IS THE LAST NIGHT, a song more representative of the band's familiar style.No hit singles were culled from the album and although TURN BACK hit the album charts, it faded quickly.

Since this seems to happen regularly to people, it is clearly a design flaw, and the company should take responsibility.

While it worked, it produced some good roasts. However, the programming took some getting used to, and constant tweaking and adjusting. Roasting was never very consistent, with a roasting profile producing a good 'city roast' on a particular varietal one time, and barely browning the same beans the next.For the money, I've decided to stick to hot-air popcorn poppers, which last anywhere from 6 months to over a year, at about 5% of the cost of this machine.While generally I would say that a machine that you can program, fill, start and walk away from is a real plus, this one was never consistent enough for this; you still have to keep an eye on it or risk underdone or scorched beans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good results and has lasted for years","review":"I've owned this roaster for about three years now. I roast several times per week, as we go through 5-6 large espresso shots per day. It has been reliable and delivers great coffee every time. The programmability is great for different blends, and different times of the year. I use it outside, so I have to have different settings for winter and summer. The top lid developed a crack and a piece broke off, but it doesn't affect roasting at all.

After two months the painted labels for the buttons began to disappear. It took me a few months to determine my favorite roasting curves. The greatest part about this product is the flexibility to program your own roasting curves. The poor quality of the product gives it about 9-12 months of life. After that your lucky(and careful). I went back to zach & dani's as it is smoke free and a little cheaper(although only good for a year as well). This roaster looks cool and is fun to program(geeky), but not worth the high price.

The plastic cracked just beneath the handle making it unable to lock in place. Instead of sending an entirely new unit I was sent just the top roast chamber. Although it has not broken (yet) the top portion that screws onto the roast chamber does not fit quite right. It is already cracking off chips around the edge and currently it's a struggle just to screw it in place. In addition, the unit is so loud (it's not referred to as the \\"iRoar\\" for nothin') that it's almost impossible to hear the second crack, which is fairly important when you're trying to dial in profiles. All in all, it's been a complete disappointment so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not built to last","review":"I liked this unit at first, even though it is horribly noisy. But after just over a year, it began to stop midway through the roasting process. If you aren't around when that happens, because there is no cool-down cycle, you could have a roaster fire. I watch mine like a hawk, and unplug it and restart it after it stops until I finally get my beans roasted, then I manually start the cool-down cycle. For $180 this machine should last more than a year. This is the second brand of roaster I have tried; I had two Fresh Roast units that also gave out after just one year. I am done with home roasting - as soon as I finish off my last bag of green beans, I am throwing this piece of junk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 13 months","review":"As others have mentioned, the iRoast is loud.

After about 13 months, my machine now stops half way through a roast for no reason.

I am getting so good that my wife really won't drink any other espresso. But the credit goes to the roaster and the basic fact that beans have a < 7 day shelf life. You must wait 12 hours for them to breathe, then they are awesome if used with a good burr grinder. One warning: Roasting must be done outside as the beans smoke when heated to > 400 degrees and they smell something like burnt popcorn.My neighbors see me outside in the dead of a New England winter and wonder what I am doing.

The 2nd woman he falls in love with has the same cliche mentality about romance and relationships (there is only 1 person in the world for everyone), but somehow the writters thought the audience will buy into that highschool mentality. I wasn't convinced with Danny being truely in love with Candice because he was just to eager to leave her for JoJo then suddenly he had a revelation that he is in love with Candice and not JoJo.

If this movie is good, then why are there 50 used copies for sale at Amazon for less than what you can rent it for?Oh, and dude needs to shave the pubes and get on an enzyte routine or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BE FOOLED LIKE I WAS INTO BUYING IT","review":"i bought it when i saw the 4 star rating...but i was fooled big time...totally fooled...This movie sucks...and i am a horror movies fan..but this one...is utterly bad that i was really embarressed since it was movie night at my house and i always show the best..this one was too bad that i tried very hard to come up with anything ..anything plausiable abt it..but nothing..absoultly nothing was!!! I hate it and wouldnt even recommend anyone watching it for free!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAAAAAY CHEEESE!!!","review":"The film is designed to be campy and cheesy, creating unbelievable characters. The acting was held to a minimum. The film includes the family of psycho killers, the ominous killer pick-up truck, hook tossing, head explosions, and a plate throwing midget. As a campy production it starts out well, but when it came down to where the love story of aspect of Brain and his prisoner Tina had to carry the film, it died. They attempted to create a surreal atmosphere, but only went half way.The film some good campy/cheesy scenes, but I just wasn't stoned enough to enjoy the whole film.F-bombs, no sex, male nudity (Jason Dugre)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and just plain stupid","review":"This wasn't even near good as a gore movie (I love gore movies and I like most of them). The person with the most dialogue was a midget who threw plates at people. The whole plot is ridiculous and the movies just simply horrible. Don't even give this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon, proofread these!! Book has too many typo's.","review":"I love this series, and have read this book in paper format as well. The first two books of this series had relatively few typo/errors in the Kindle editions, but this one is embarrassing. Even spell-check would catch hundreds of errors, but beyond the obvious ones, there are plenty of errant letters that change the meaning if you don't know the way the words are really written. Of course \\"tore\\" is \\"torc,\\" but also -- Dougal isn't crying out, \\"By the mane of Asian!\\" -- it's \\"Aslan.\\" The firvulag are \\"wild,\\" not \\"wdd\\". I wish I could correct or mark the errors myself, for them to be fixed... it's so frustrating. I can't imagine buying another Kindle version in this series... no one is proofreading these books. $10 not well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"$$$s over duty","review":"This story is intricate and demanding to read. Keeping track of all the characters is a challenge. But the story is worth it. Its taken 30 years for people to get the message.Unfortunately, the publisher must have used non-native English editors. Even academic texts suffer from this these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on publisher!","review":"I hate giving this book 1 star, because it deserves 5. Heck, it deserves 10. The book is a classic.But, the incredible number of spelling (most egregious of which is \\"tore\\" over and over again for \\"torc\\") and punctuation errors (many periods are absent) make it painful to read. Obviously the publisher just automated the process of character recognition, then gave the result to Amazon to feel WITHOUT A SINGLE MINUTE OF QUALITY CONTROL. If a human being had spend a single minute looking at this book, they would have realized how many errors it had.Thank you, Julian May, for writing an excellent book.Shame on you, publishers, for having no quality control whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst editing I've ever seen in a mass-market publication","review":"I have been eagerly awaiting this series in Kindle format and now that I've got it I wish the publisher had waited a little longer and gotten the job done right. Typographical problems like \\"96 THE NONBORN KING\\" appearing in the middle of a paragraph, bad hyphenations, and mis-spellings are ruining the experience of an otherwise very enjoyable series of books. I read these in the mass-market paperback editions back in the 80's and there was nothing like this in those editions.I hate to give this one star when the story, including all the books in the series, deserves a 4 or 5, but Amazon really needs to step up here. These typos and mis-spellings are present in the first two books of this series, The Many Colored Land and The Golden Torc, as well. Unfortunately \\"torc\\" is mis-spelled as \\"tore\\" more often than not inside the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent story, Poor editing","review":"This is an excellent story, one of the true classic series. I found that this book became very difficult to read due to the constant misspelled words.

In my enthusiasm of finding the Golden Torc series on Kindle, I went ahead and bought them all at once.The first 2 books were marred by occasional transcription errors, but not so many as to spoil the experience. Not so with this one!In have really tried to get over the constant misspellings created by a very poor OCR product, and without any perceptible quality control, but when they are so frequent and of core words too, it's impossible.This has detracted to such an extent that the joy of re-reading a much loved classic in Kindle format has become an irritant.Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to go on without rectification. Others have previously commented on this and you have done nothing about it. Do you actually read the product reviews?Bottom line, overpriced for such shoddy quality. Please sort it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for them to fix the Kindle format issues","review":"This review applies to the Kindle edition ONLY.The third book in one of the best science fiction series I've ever read, but until they fix the formatting issues, do not buy this book for Kindle. My apologies to Julian May for this review.They pulled the book from Amazon for a bit, and then it reappeared, so I figured they had fixed the formatting issues that everyone was complaining about. I was wrong. I bought it, started reading, stumbled across a few things, and then more. Here's an example:\\"The invading operants made their way to the Atlantic Coast. There they 40 THE NONBORN KING linked their modular ATVs to form boats...\\"I made it about a tenth of the way through the book before I found the mistakes too distracting to continue. I asked for a refund.To the publisher: Please hire an actual proofreader before you put this out for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"for shame","review":"This is one of my all time favorite series. It is absolutely shamefull what the publisher has done (or not done) to this digital copy.Clearly, no one bothered to even read through it once, as the transfer errors are so numerous they make certain passages almost unreadable. if you were reading this story for the first time, you would have no hope of following along. I expect this when the book costs $0.99, not $10. These money grubbers should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Biography Of Rock & Roll Legend","review":"When I purchased this DVD, I was expecting a concert. Well, there is plenty of concert footage, informal studio sessions, all wrapped around the narrated story of Leon's life and his influence spanning four decades of music. I was surprised by the previous author's review. He/she claims to be a Leon fan, then gives this DVD a 2 star rating? I'm not sure the review was about this DVD as I think any TRUE fan of Leon Russell will see this for what it is, a musical biography of one of the best there ever was. It is a pity that the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame hasn't yet inducted him into the \\"club\\".If you ever enjoyed Leon throughout his extensive career, this DVD is a must own for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time and Space - Lost","review":"Leon Russell is the undisputed master of time and space, creating a pure legacy of concert magic. Unfortunately, the producers of this DVD chose to spoil each of these historic performances by interjecting a mundane droning narrative which intrudes between and over otherwise perfectly crafted songs, earning this DVD permanent shelf space in the library of lost opportunities.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Read harder to Believe","review":"Fidel Castro Lover of Humanity? This book is a poor excuse for a bad propaganda piece. Castro rails at capitalism but refuses to point the finger at the real culprit of Cuba's economic demise (himself). Only some lunatic and blind socialist could read this book without bending over from laughter or being totally revolted. Those who still believe Castro' or his revolution are anything but an abject failure or a crime against humanity will undoubtedly enjoy this trash.

The group on this cd is essentially members from her Swingin Armadillos, including boogie woogie Queen of teh piano Miss Sue Palmer.

Kane's vocals sound like she's in the 1920's-40's era, and her vocals are strong and very authentic in blues/swing tradition. This is her best all around \\"swing\\" cd.

Tomfoolios sound is anything but generic - its the most original music of the last 25 years. it will put you in the zone so turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream - vibe to this and you'll see what I'm talking about; adventures among the pod people is a truly brilliant work of art, one that deserves repeat listening through stereo headphones.

Don't get me wrong, I love a good common-girl-rises-up-and-takes-the-nobility-by-the-... story, but this one fails. It only illustrates how mercenary (and apparently, rather promiscuous) Bess was. And Henley conveniently omits the later years of Bess' life, when she became the ... of England. It's common knowlegde that when she could not keep George Talbot from straying, she ruined innocent people's lives. Granted, Mary Queen of Scots was no nun, but Bess took advantage of her vunerability and ruined her further. This woman does not deserve to be remembered in the romantic way Henley portrayers her. She gives all women who have and do aspire to be more than they are a bad name."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected gem","review":"I was just looking for something to read on a plane and found this gem of a book.

You'll love the steam that she shares with Sir Cavendish, and feel true sympathy for her and Robert Barlow, her first husband who she marries to save her family.

Not for black tie affairs but if you need to tell time at work... this fits the bill. I bought this for my brother and then found that he just got another watch the day before... so I kept it. Thanks bro... your loss. LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, simple--albeit loud--watch","review":"For a basic, reliable, everyday watch, this is an excellent choice. As one who has an allergy to metallic watches and watchbands, this watch, with its fabric band and coated surfaces, provides blessed relief from skin irritation.There is, however, one drawback: During moments of quiet time, the TICK, TICK, TICK of this watch may be too annoying for some. Have found it necessary to place this watch far away from the bedroom each night to escape its loud TICK, TICK, TICK when trying to sleep.But, on the whole, a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value for the money","review":"A straight forward, no-nonsense, practical design make this watch a great value for an everyday timepiece. High contrast easily readable face. Super lightweight when compared to other all-metal case watches. Dial window type is not mineral as stated under the product specifications, it is plastic. Watch band is solid, nylon webbing corners on inside at buckle are hard and may irritate skin (I used a mini-file to soften these corners). \\"Indiglo\\" works fine, all hands have luminescent material, however they do not emit light for very long after exposed to a light source. The \\"tick tock\\" sound of the second hand is audible, but I do not wear mine to bed so it is not a problem. All together a great value for the money especially if you get it on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex, I am disappoint.","review":"This watch fit the bill perfectly... for about two weeks. The adjustment knob tapped against a table and popped right out of the watch. Timex watches used to be made fairly well, I had my last one for about 12 years before it need replacing. Apparently, that time has come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I picked out this model several years ago as a watch that I could use, but one that I easily replace if damaged on the job. It worked out great. Fast forward to Dec 2011 as I was activated and deployed to Afghanistan. I took the watch with me, but lost it enroute. Once in Afghanistan, I ordered another one exactly like my last. Order arrived promptly, and I started wearing the watch. Today, which is two days after I received it, the time adjustment pin fell out. Now the watch is useless. It seems to me that another review I read prior to purchase indicated the same problem. I always had good luck with Timex watches, but not with this current model. Will I own another Timex? I probably will, but am disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, a bit large though","review":"This watch seems well built and durable. Looks stylish, has a date function, dial easily seen at night when pressing the set button, strap is durable (not plastic, however not yet able to determine the life span). Compared to the others like Casio(which I had previously) it is a bit large. Fits nice on the hand but not the thinnest of watches. Lightweight for the size.Again, for the price you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"TICK TICK TICK TICK......","review":"I really like the minimalist style of this watch, but the noise created by the second hand is so loud that it keeps me from sleeping. I can even still hear it when I curl my hand around it. Don't buy this watch unless you have moderate hearing damage. The noise is too annoying and this thing is going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"good watch. lousy band","review":"THE WATCH WAS WHAT I EXPECTED. INEXPENSIVE. EASY TO READ,NO BELLS OR WHISTLES. JUST WHAT I WANTED FOR YARD WORK. BUT. THE BAND WAS WAY TOO SHORT TO FIT MY WRIST. MY WRIST IS 7 1/2 INCHES AROUND. THAT IS A SMALL WRIST. THE WATCH BAND BARELY MADE IT AROUND THE WRIST. WHEN IT WAS BUCKLED THE BAND WOULD NOT FIT INTO THE LOOP TO HOLD IT IN PLACE(TOO SHORT)I FIGURED SINCE THE WATCH WAS MADE IN CHINA THEY USED THEIR WRIST SIZES TO SIZE THE BAND.THIS WATCH MIGHT BE GOOD FOR KIDS BUT NOT AN ADULT. IF THEY CONTINUE THIS PRACTICE THEY SHOULD PROBABLY SELL THE WATCH AND ALLOW YOU TO BUY A BAND SEPERATELY BECAUSE YOU WILL BE BUYING A NEW BAND ANYWAY.I HAVE E-MAILED TIMEX ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT HEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT.

No le doy las 5 estrellas porque como dicen mis antecesores la pulsera es de nailon y los fabricantes para evitar que se deshile en los cortes queman la tela y esas partes quemadas hacen irritar un poco la piel, pero por lo dem��s la pulsera es las mas resientes que he probado, solo hay que sumergir el reloj en alg��n bactericida de ves en cuando para que no tome mal olor ya que la pulsera atrapa suciedad entre la trama de la tela de nailon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tick tock","review":"excellent product for the price.

He runs up against the expected shock and outrage from the local bluenoses. No subtleties here. The characters are clearly divided into the good guys and the bad guys. A good cast of competent actors; a glossy production and cinematography help to overcome the occasionally heavy-handed and predictable plot. It's a well-done movie and it's definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should watch this one","review":"Don't be fooled by this campy title. John L'Ecuyer's \\"Prom Queen\\" is a necessary and heart-warming tale of the charming high school student Marc (Aaron Ashmore) taking on the Canadian Supreme Court, a homophobic school environment, and the CatholicChurch in order to bring his boyfriend to prom. Even though some parts, particularly the ending, seem a bit too picture-perfect, don't worry: this film is totally believable and the plot and script remain solid and interesting throughout. Not tomention the actors are absolutely adorable and talented.Sexy and humorous, political and educational, Prom Queen should be required viewing in every high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Based on true story","review":"\\"Prom queen\\" is a story of a canadian gay teen, who wanted to bring his boyfriend to the prom party.The events, which the film is based on, became quite popular even here in Europe a few years ago. It's good to see that there are countries (like Canada for example) where reason is more important than bigotery and narrow-mindedness.My overall impression is very positive. Both Aaron Ashmore (as Marc) and Marc Fyfe (as Jason) created a believable couple of young gays. The way his parents supported Marc and his action is really amazing and should give hope to all viewers. It's clear that you don't need proferssor's degree, lot of money or live in a big city to be open-minded and reasonable man.The rest of the cast don't disappoint, even if some plots seem to be wooden (to name one: with those two nerds, internet freeks)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a biography","review":"The only reason I finished reading this book was because I'd not read any about Duras.The writing is so stunningly bad that I had to control my anger as I read (melodramtic repetitions, little fragments that figure in soap opera, so on) because I was still curious about Duras and thought I might learn something. The translation is as awful as the text. (I'll save you examples.)This is not a biography. It's a badly written travelogue of a literary and political career. Duras constructed an amazing life and I look forward to a biography that might open that up.This piece of dribble is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaaa!!","review":"LOL...there has to be a mistake with the pricing here!

I picked this up with only a faint recollection of what the story was about.

Brilliant descriptions, gripping to the very end"},{"rating":"2","title":"Renault would be proud","review":"Sadly, The Song of Troy is no longer in print, and the novel is hard to find; however, it is a must read for anyone interested in the Trojan War or historical fiction in general. McCullough writes her tale with grace and thoughtfulness comparable to Mary Renault. The Trojan War and the events leading up to it are told in about a dozen different perspectives, which offer a diverse and full encapsulation of the period. I especially admire McCullough's interpretation of the rift between Achilles and Agamemnon, which seems more plausible, in my opinion, than the usual explanation. While people may disagree with her interpretation, it is impossible to find flaws in her prose, which is eloquent, evocative, and captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"this DVD delivers","review":"I'll just chime in with all the above.For me, as a novice, watching the band and picking up on their cueshas been most helpfull"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Everything about this movie is outstanding... story, animation, humor, action, etc. And Blu-ray is the best way to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite","review":"A horrible storyline can spoil the best of films.American film makers have this undying love for stereotyped underdog stories with the courageous character that finds his true self and achieves success despite most unpromising circumstances. I suppose it must be part of the stereotyped image of the American dream, this feeding the average viewer with the idea that anyone can have a dream an make a success out of it.This underdog storyline can be sometimes exploited with originality and effectiveness (take Hercules and Mulan, to remain to cartoons) but it can also be a tricky path to choose as it is fully demonstrated here.That animation is excellent (and yet computer tricks are a little TOO evident and mechanical looking) and rhythm serrated, that voice-acting is professional and funny turns out not to be enough.This movie is not good, not even for children actually, not because of any improper adult content but because the ethics conveyed here are simply not healthy for a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price for the Blu-Ray version -- No double-feature!","review":"I loved this movie. I saw it in theaters and knew immediately that I was going to be buying the Blu-ray version.However. This review isn't about the movie, which is great. This review is about the Blu-ray version.The DVD version comes in a double pack, including the 'Secrets of the Furious Five' \\"sequel\\" to the original movie. That's a huge draw of buying this movie.However, the Blu-ray version not only does not have the double-pack offer, it also does not have the movie bundled onto the single blu-ray disc at all, which means if you buy this version you miss out on the new movie.Why on earth would anyone buy the Blu-ray version if they're missing out on the 'Secrets of the Furious Five' sequel?

I have other CD's for her and since she's young she likes to take her CD's out herself from the player and ets most of them scratched. Some of her CD's still play so well but this one after just 2-3 minor scratches started giving me problems.The movie is very good though.

It was a cute movie, but a rental or even a purchase (from Amazon of coarse) is a better way to see it.It was a very long movie for a 3-5 yr old to sit through.

But finally having done so I am disappointed. It was amusing and the animation is good, but it is much too violent for children younger than preteen. The reviews stated that it was great family entertainment for ages 3 and up. I have a son who will shortly be turning 4 and found it unsuitable viewing for him. We were watching it as a family and found ourselves (my husband and I) horrified that we had exposed our son to such violence. I feel that the movie was misrepresented - all the previews depict is as being light and funny, and the reviews on amazon, as I stated before, suggested it was suitable for ages 3 and up. I am no prude but this film is clearly not appropriate for anyone that young. The violence was extreme and vicious, even by adult standards. It should have been advertised as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look forward to watching this DVD","review":"I appreciated Amazon getting this DVD to me so quickly and at such a great price.

However, this CD allows any lover of the Andy Williams Christmas Shows of the past to experience once again Andy signing Holiday and Seasonal favorites Live. What a treat.

It smells wonderful, but the consistency made it impossible for me to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Kershaw","review":"I've owned quite a few Kershaw knives and this is my second of this particular model. I really like the serrated tanto blade and I wish Kershaw had more knives with a tanto blade option.This particular knife is quite nice for its assisted open, weight, and quality steel. I use knives a lot at work to cut rope and open boxes primarily. Even on thick rope the serration is plenty to do the trick.There are a couple of things that I don't really like about this particular model. The main thing would be the grip. The grip is very similar to a type of sandpaper and after a long life of use can tear up whatever pocket you keep it in. The repeated rub of the grip on clothing can be quite damaging. The second would be the size. It is just about 1/4\\" longer than I'd like it to be for a pocket knife. However it is the best tanto that I have found from Kershaw so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife","review":"This is a great knife. Once you get used to it the spring assisted opening is very natural and the knife is shave sharp as I have heard others describe. My only reservation for a 5 star review is when I left this knife in my pocket and washed the jeans the black finish wore off in a couple spots. This doesn't affect its function in any way, just seems like it should have a more durable finish. No worries though I would definitely buy another of these knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"blur vs. cyclone?","review":"just purchased this knife to replace my beaten and battered kershaw cyclone. i have to say i was kinda dissapointed how lightweight it is. the cyclone was beefy and heavy metal handle could be used to hit stuff almost like a multi tool and i dont think im gonna be able to abuse the blur as much as that knife but i guess only time will tell. other than the weight the blade is razor sharp and its just a well built knife great deployment. i will always carry a kershaw i ahbe for about 5 year now and have no plans of changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far sooo good.","review":"This is a very well made knife. Sharp and sturdy. I would definitely buy another one if I lost this one. I have not had any problems with the the locking mechanism as some people have suggested or showed videos of. They must have a received a defect or broke it themselves. I carry it in my pocket everyday and the only thing I don't like much is the fact that it has an open spine along the top of the handle/case -- so pocket lint collects in it and on the blade.**EDIT: 11/16/11I still carry it with me nearly everyday. I use it pretty much everyday day as well(light duty)but its still sharp and intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious","review":"I absolutely love this knife. Amazingly sharp, right out of the box.

In those 6 years it has held its edge with minor touch ups and worked as well as it did the day I got it. The spring mechanism was still taut and the blade opened with ease. No issues with the serration.Unfortunately I lost that knife last week. The clip holds extremely well in the pocket and I have never had it come out on me so I assume I simply mislaid it somewhere. As much as I love this knife, I didn't think twice and ordered another exactly like it. Why look at alternatives when this knife did exactly what I wanted and proved its reliability?A simply wonderful daily use knife, razor sharp right out of the box. Consider this one, it is a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Razor sharp but uncomfortable to carry","review":"This knife does everything advertised, however the design of the thumb stud makes it very uncomfortable to carry in the front pocket.

Then I tried to use it in at work like I do my Benchamde. Cuts open boxes great, slices up cardboard fine. I tried to cut some plastic banding off a pallet of boxes, it FOLDED OVER ALL THE SERRATED TEETH! Not sure if it was a bad heat treating on the blade or what, but returned it. Ordered an Emerson CQC7!Will never buy another cheap knife again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad...","review":"I was excited to purchase what I thought was a quality knife for a good price with good ergonomics, being a Ken Onion design. What I bought was designed to sell and not to last. The handle was textured on the sides, but the edges of the handle were far too smooth to be held safely, especially if they were to ever get a little wet. The thumb studs have very sharp edges that will wear out pants quickly. The spring-assist broke after two months of extremely mild, absolutely non-abusive use.The $12.00 return shipping fee plus the cost to ship it to Emerson makes the true cost of the knife about $84.00...and what if the spring breaks again? My advice is buy another brand.P.S. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is the tanto blade and the fact that it can still be used as a quick-opening folder, absent the \\"blur.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife!","review":"I purchases this knife during a Gold Box deal with Amazon and i couldnt be more impressed on the way the knife looks with the tanto design, the \\"grip tape\\" as i call it on the handle, and how easy it is to fold open and closed with one hand. Another plus is it is made in USA, even though this one does not say it is, in the pictures provided on the item it does show made in USA, if you go onto their website it also states that their blades are made in USA.

The blade opens with an easy thumb push. A very sturdy knife, very close to (but not) a switchblade!.

Overall something that will be in my pocket when I am holding any fishing rod!Have fun and stay safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"How sharp you ask?","review":"I am embarrassed to say that within 90 minutes of owning this blade, I had 16 stitches placed in my hand as a testament to its edge. This blade is *super* sharp. I lost my grip on this blade and in an effort to recover it mid-air, it gave me a gentle kiss on the back of the hand. The serrated portion barely touched my knuckle, and a year later it is still an ugly, scarred, mess.This is a serious knife that can do serious damage, learn from my mistake.

See their map of the Steens Mountain area and Steens Mountain Loop Road - this road is only accessable with high clearance 4WD vehicles in late summer, but on this map it's marked with the same symbol used for the two lane, paved highway south of Burns.

In 2030, when the \\"Peterson crisis\\" hits, the median age will be 38.5 and the mean age will be 39.9. Yes, our total population will be older but I have a hard time getting too alarmed over 3 years. In fact, if wisdom comes with age, maybe our \\"older\\" society will be better.

She has pulled together all the best songs from her many albums, so I like almost every song on this cd. In addition, she has rerecorded a few of her earlier songs with a more mature, controlled, and developed voice. (ie, the same soul/heart but with less screeching.)All the songs are in Japanese and the Japanese lyrics are also included in the insert. (Why do American \\"Best Hits\\" cds never include the lyrics??!) She also mixes in ballads along with her techno/pop songs, so you get a good example of her range. If you've never heard her music before, I'd recommend this as an introduction to Ayu since it gives a good sampling of quality songs. If you're already a fan, then this is an essential addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eek...","review":"I guess she's pretty, and her lyrics are thoughtful, but bottom line- she can't sing. But she gets one star for her lyrics. Everything that other singers have believed in, the whole \\"ok-sing-from-your-diaphram-blah\\" is not respected. Her voice is...interesting, the sort of high-pitched softness that M2M brings out in their first album except worse.

I think it has of the funniest lines, one of the best episodes(once more with feeling), the best villian/s- the trio was so incredably funny, and Willow was even more scary! I loved watching Buffy go through all the emotions and having to deal with Giles gone and her affair with Spike!

The show is much darker, more graphic, more intense. The main complaint about season six is the storyline.Essentially, every character on the show becomes self-destructive. While this is something that does happen in life, watching these characters you know and love destroy themselves and each other is painful. All season you have to watch them go through pain and inflict pain. There is some good stuff in there, some of it is just tough to get through.Season six is definitely my least favorite season, but if your a Buffy fan its still worth watching.

It's riddled with unfunny third-grade sex jokes, and some very stupid moments and a forced rape. Season seven accomplished a darker tone than this mess. Buffy creator/writer/producer Joss Wheadon was off creating a great show called Firefly when this disaster occured. The loss of his prescence was obvious.If you're a completist, I'm positive theres nothing I can do to sway you otherwise, but if you're unsure don't listen to this small faction of people putting this season on a pedestal and saying it was Buffy's best.

Why bring Anya and Xander together to break their mariage, even before it started. Again it would of been nice to see a couple working for once. Where is your humour.

This one is realy dark.Hope the seventh season will be better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 6-Another Success of BtVS","review":"As a truly dedicated fan for over seven years now, Season Six of Buffy stood just as powerful as ever. Episodes such as \\"Grave\\" and \\"Two To Go\\" showed the true reality of mourning and coping with death, and \\"Once More, With Feeling\\" combined original Buffy with a more campy, silly taste of Joss Whedon's brilliant mind. Buffy taking on a \\"normal\\" job gave viewers a look at what life could have been for Buffy, if her destiny wasn't as The Slayer.

Yes it's dark but the characters have never been more compelling and the writing is just stellar.The commentary overall is very good, with the notable exception of Bargaining 1 and 2.

The character arc for Willow the entire season was about addiction. And the last few episodes delt with redemption, love and forgiveness. Buffy began to forgive herself for all of the things she did that year. We can see some tiny hints of Anya beginning to forgive Xander. Buffy and Dawn get through the earth monsters together and form a new bond. Andrew and Johnathan leave Sunnydale to start a new life.It is only natural that Willow is saved by love, and is then forgiven. Had she died her entire arc that season would've been meaningless.However, everyone is entitled to their own opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"why is this rated so high?","review":"I love Buffy in general but Season 6 was truly awful.

I instantly loved it and could not wait for more. I enjoyed all of the diverse characters and was suprised by the death of the character. I thought, what will they do next? Well...they did season six. This season tested the boundries of television and showed what it could do. This season is about change, new beginings and endings, and self evaluation. This season made me feel so many different emotions while watching. I think that is what makes a good tv show, something that makes the viewer feel. And boy does this season meet that requirment. All of the Buffy seasons are amazing, and this one is just as amazing as the others. Seson six is worth every penny if you love Buffy or are looking for a good show (i would suggest you get all seven though :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was not bad, but a far cry from what made the show so unique in its earlier seasons. Granted the growth the characters had to grow up after season five, but the way the writers could have managed the whole situation could have been better. Althought the muscial and bad Willow episodes are fun, these positive gaps are too few and far between. I would recommend to just catch these episodes when they are in reruns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't you like this season?","review":"... The relationship with Spike and Buffy is a great one, and then you have tension between Willow and Tara, which isn't a good thing if you like the two, but this ultimately leads into a great story line with Willow doing to much magick and then trying to destroy the world.You have Jonathen and Warren out to get Buffy which only turns into a very comical thing to watch, they are no match for the all powerful slayer, oh wow, I need to get a life.

We go from The Master to the love of her life Angel then the mayor then Adam and Glory. Now three nerds. I know Willow becomes the bad guy. It upsets me that first they mess up Buffy with the sleeping with spike thing and then they make buffy the bad guy with the \\"i'm gonna kill all my friends cuz i wanna stay in a mental ward.\\" Then Xanders the bad guy with the leave Anya at the alter thing. Then willow with distroy the world thing and spike with the rape buffy thing its just all wrong its not Buffy. Buffy was a cool action show that was also funny but in season 6 it wasn't funny.

He took a fantastic set of characters and threw them all around just for the sake of shocking the audience, not for the sake of history telling. He made Willow gay; he made Buffy sleep with TWO (not one, but TWO!!!) vampires; he made Xander let the lovely Anya at the altar; he made Joyce send Buffy away from her home; I could go on and on....There is also a funny thing: Joss and the producers say they are very aware of the continuity, but this show should be called: \\"PLOT HOLE, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER\\". There are so many of them, so much inconsistencies, so much things unexplained, so much verborragy that explains absolutely nothing"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Season of Buffy!","review":"This season as others say, was indeed the darkest season of Buffy. I still like it anyway. They do a good job of messing up the casts lives, but then tie it all together in the episode \\"Once More, With Feeling\\". That episode was my favorite episode of the whole show. The cast did a good job of singing and dancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best season but better a second time around","review":"Season 5 is a tough act to follow considering, aside from My So-Called Life, it's the only season of television I've ever been riveted to my chair. So when season 6 first aired on TV, it paled in comparison to the depth of season 5 and I quickly lost interest in this campy season and stopped watching all together. Now, watching season 6 at a later time and basing it on it's own merits, I find it rather likeable and fun to watch. But I think I realize also why it was so hard for me to watch back when it first aired. Everyone in this season is so damn miserable and filled with inner tragedy. Everyone is going through so much and since you feel, at this point, that you are a part of these characters, you suffer right along with them. There are some truly great moments in this season and it is definitely worth a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"continued excellence!","review":"Living overseas, I've watched the majority of Buffy on DVD. The wait for Season 6 was unbearable, but well worth it! As was the case with each previous season, Season 6 had no let down. In fact the darker plots and feel made the season even more compelling. Away from the darkness, Once More With Feeling (my favorite episode) made for some lighthearted entertainment.

Particularly, I think the show got a lot better when Angel went away. That love relationship between them was going nowhere, full of tears and soap opera moments, and Angel always with a frown in his face, always worried, always serious. Boring, I tell you. With Buffy / Spike things are much more interesting, funny, dangerous. Also, Dark Willow was something to wonder about, the transition was well explained and well timed, the ending of the season is fantastic, the battle between Willos / Giles, and Willow / Buffy, all the while completely destroying the Magic Box, is one of the best moments of the show ever! Also we have Xander fear of commitment taking the best of him on the day of his wedding with Anya, a moment of real tear-jerking power.And some people say this ia a bad season of Buffy....

Xander and Willow grow the most as characters in this season, and SPIKE proved without a shadow of a doubt how much better he is the ANGEL and he should have had the spin off show (which would have survived longer)BUFFY, got here edge back...even as the uncaring emotionally dead buffy.

And this was the best season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Lives","review":"The switch to UPN infused the series with a new look and style that I liked a lot. Buffy returns from the grave and starts a compelling and believable relationship with Spike (In his best season). The three nerds are the best villians in the series in my mind, they are hilarious. Spike interigating them with a Boba Fett action figure is priceless, as is the Millenium Falcon painted on the side of their covert ops van (With a horn that plays the Star Wars theme). Buy this season for the brilliant musical episode, \\"Once More, With Feeling\\" and stay for the evil Willow story arc which ends the season. A must have for all fans and another good starting place for newbies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE 6TH SEASON!!!!!!","review":"This is the best season you could EVER own!!!

It was dark, difficult, but brilliant--absolutely every storyline was just gripping, scary but so realistic and so emotion driven.From \\"Tabula Rasa\\" (Willow's spell goes wrong yet again...) to \\"Once more with feeling\\" undoubtedly a work of brilliance, to the darker later episodes--\\"Smashed\\" Willow delving deeper into the dark magics, Buffy delving deeper into...uh...Spike. (I also think Spike and Buffy have the most amazing chemistry this season)to Anya and Xander's doomed marriage, the downfall of poor little misguided Dawn--I related too and was fascinated by every little subject in this not-very-liked season (It alos had just gone to UPN channel, leaving behind the little green frog at WB) but I can watch season six episodes more often than any other season--except of course, season one.Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Still Love This Show!","review":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is my favorite show and this is my favorite season and I do not think season six is the darkest season, that in my opinion is season seven which I found to be much darker with the whole thing with the first evil, Caleb, the uber vamp and Spike having been brain washed to kill again.I have read some reviews by people bashing this show because they hate that they made Willow a lesbian.As a straight female who liked her relationship with Oz I must be honest that I had no problem with Willow deciding she was gay and I think the homophobic reviwers should just get over it.Anyway I liked Willow and I liked her first girlfriend Tara but I didn't like her second girlfriend Kennedy. Tara was so sweet and Kennedy was like the complete opposite of Tara and was so pushy and mean. She had an abrasive personality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"way to go, buffy!","review":"I loved this season very much! The Buffy and Spike relationship was my favourite...of course that is slightly biased since I've wanted those two together since \\"something blue\\" in season 4. Besides that, however, the other storylines were strong and I loved them just as much. PICK THIS SEASON UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"Jumped the shark\\"?","review":"Yes, it has the musical, but what the ones writing sonnets don't get is breaking of the relationships that defined the show killed it. Giles taking off, Buffy sleeping with Spike and invalidating the Angel relationship, the Geek Villians.. that is the definition of \\"jumping the shark\\" as when Happy Days died after the Fonz literally jumped a shark with his motorcycle. The original premise of the show, a small quirky blonde teen saving the world, was also invalidated as Buffy Summers became a morose burger-flipper slacker who just got caught in strange circumstances each week.Season Six was an anticlimax from Season Five, and a let-down as Joss ran off to do Firefly.The whole \\"why am I back from the dead?\\" was Joss revisiting his failed attempt of Alien: Resurrection. The series never answered this question very well. It just didn't, but that's a discussion for when they do Season 7 on DVD. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was awful","review":"This season was awful, with the notable exception of the musical episode. Buffy started out as a great show, and then somewhere along the way (season 3-4?) it became a metaphor for a successful child star who ruined his life with drugs and alcohol, sinking ever-farther into his additions. I still don't know what happened. Did Joss and his writers just run out of good ideas? Or did Joss, secure in the success of the show, feel free to indulge emotional issues he'd never been able to resolve? Where is the joy in watching characters about whom you've learned to care sink lower and lower in their lives until they are perpetually miserable? I loved Buffy the first couple of seasons, liked it the for a couple after that, but it should have ended before this disaster came along and I still thought good things about Buffy and Willow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Season 6 was a fantastic season but I just have to point out that this box set is pretty dissapointing. There are many glitches in 3 of the discs and especially during the amazing musical episode \\"Once more with feeling\\"- which is letterboxed, not anamorphic widescreen. I don't understand why the US sets are done poorly then the R2 ones. Also there are plenty of spoilers spread throughout the artwork so if your watching this season for the first time, you might not want to look at the designs and quotes- especially the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the series really lost its way","review":"What really characterized this season was bad, lazy writing. Instead of themes of empowerment from previous seasons we have a really messed up Buffy/Spike relationship (with tacked on attempted rape), a really lame after school special (and total cop out) with Willow's \\"magic crack\\" storyline, and none of the characters acting in a sympathetic way (and completely out of character ways...example Gile's \\"good luck Buffy, you're on your own, exit.\\"). This barely scratches the surface. There can be \\"dark\\" good and \\"dark\\" bad. With the exceptions of OMWF and TR this was mainly \\"dark\\" bad. This is the season that many of the actors (SMG,JM, etc.) stated they had real problems with the script/content.S6 - The show now is officially a soap opera. And the ratings reflected this..Buffy had the most preciptious drop in viewers during this season than ever before. And from which it never recovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all downhill from here folks!","review":"Season Six can best be summed up as the Nude Spike season. Oh yeah and bad interpretations of drug use.

DVD Manufacturer Bad","review":"Well, maybe I souldn't really be writing a review, as the 4 times I had to order this set through Amazon only to find that disc 2 was either a0 not included, or b) so poorly manufactured that it didn't play ay all. I really wanted to watch the seires in order, but I went ahead and watched what I could. Pretty dull season, but then again, early on it was rumored to be the last season.

All the episodes were great but these really stood out for me. As supernatural as it is I can always relate to these characters. We all go through grief, happiness, anger , and sadness. This show knows how to explore these emotions on a higher level . I love this show!!!!!!! thanks to all who worked on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Fans gold","review":"This Box set is the best yet in the Buffy DVD collections.

It had great ideas and I loved the wicked Willow! I loved the \\"Normal Again\\" episode and was on the edge of my seat the whole time, going \\"NO WAY\\"... Yes the Musical was AWESOME!! (I bought the soundtrack)... A side note, it's funny how I accepted Buffy and Spike and cheered for them, but simultaneiously while watching Angel despised the fact of him touching another woman (what a contradiction I am).

It's the 2nd Thomas book, I've ever bought - and I hope most of them aren't as bad as this one. There are several stories in this book, all of which seem to have chunks of the stories missing. It is very dis-jointed. The illustrations (which are photos of the train models) do not help the reader to figure out what is going on in the story. The words(vocabulary) that are used seem to be somewhat unusual (perhaps - they are british terms) - which do not help. This book is not worth the money or the effort.

The Navin brothers have put together an album that is unusual and refreshing to hear, it appeals to your strangest and silliest senses. You find yourself tapping your foot to the catchy beat and tuning into the almost sometimes maudlin lyrics.

It should have been made more epic and Godfather-like. The Gypsy culture is fascinating but you only get a glimpse of it.

This is the story of Bill and his final battle with cancer. This man survived the battle of Guadalcanal by his wits and bravery. He was in the signal corps which basically meant he strung telephone wire between different front lines and rear areas. His story is his experience of life and death on the island of Gaudalcanal. The book also has commentary from his doctor on his final battle with cancer in 1997. This is truly a touching story, much like Duty.The veterans of World War II contributed much to the greatness of this country. Bill and Ben's sacrifices made this country great and that is why I love to read these stories. It is sad that Bill could not experience the satisfaction of seeing his story published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if you DID read the book...","review":"The graphics were sub-standard, the movement is linear. It's \\"360\\" degree movement is basically being able to turn your head around a pinpoint spot, which has really no use. As a teen, the opera music, albiet harmonic, was tediously repetitive and overall unappealing. I did not read the Ring novel, and have absolutly NO clue as exactly what is going on. The mouse control feels slow and unresponsive, especially for a PII 400 w/128 meg ram system. The feeling you get when playing this game feels more like being stuck in a box with the bland environment and non-logical puzzles and terrible voice acting. I gave this a 2 because the installation and UNINSTALLATION were flawless. Pity I bought this game from CompUSA on a whim. I'll just consider this a bad investment. Don't make the same mistake and avoid this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book, forget the audio","review":"Forget the audio, read the book. The audio is severely hampered by the reader's constant interruption to give footnotes. Every few minutes we are forced to listen to endless repetitions of footnotes, many coming from the same report or source.There MUST be a less intrusive way to accomplish the same thing.Begin by the reader saying \\"this book has 3 million 700 footnotes\\" Give the website, where anyone interested can log in and follow up to view them.Then give a straight numerical listing as you narrate. \\"Footnote #1.... Footnote #2... Footnote #3, etc.\\"The intrusive reading of every single footnote caused me to stop by the third cd. Sorry. Read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda at best","review":"This book is nothing more than propaganda, written and packaged in a manner that attempts to incite the patriotism of the readers in order to bring them to the author's obviously biased point of view.

As an American Soldier (Marine), I am offended by the presumptions made within the book on the lack of morality of servicemembers who may not believe in the author's particular God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"The title captured my interest but the negativity expressed through some of the descriptions of battle scenes bothered me especially since I have active military experience. Gross descriptions of allied soldiers killing Iraqis and then questioning motives did nothing other than undermine the reason the soldier is serving. Drawing quotes from Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 film disappointed me as I do not see Mr. Moore as a credible authority on the war and the American soldier. A little more independent thought from Mr. Mansfield would have made better use of my time.

Of course her voice is top notch, as always, but honestly--does this album garner heavy rotation in your stereo?\\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" puts Madonna to shame--she can't sing compared to the great Sinead. \\"Success Has Made a Failure of Our Home\\" is riveting. The Track I love is her heart-wrenching \\"Scarlet Ribbons\\". You can hear Sinead almost crying while singing this powerful, gorgeous song. This track alone is worth buying the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Voice Sabotaged by the Wrong Material","review":"Sinead O'Connor took it on the chin, both critically and commercially, when she released this album of show tunes in 1992. While her voice is'nt the problem, these songs are simply not her forte. Sinead never gains command of most of the material and the big band that backs her is jarring. The are a couple of exceptions: the opening track, \\"Why Don't You Do Right\\" is familiar Sinead material (perhaps the quality of this song raised my expectations of the album) and her version of \\"Don't Cry for me Argentina\\" is superb - Sinead's lets her anger ebb and allows her vunerability to show. But the rest of the album never gels and borders on unlistenable. It took Sinead nearly a decade to recover from this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected, very nice!","review":"I truly enjoyed this c.d. her voice, the arrangements, lovely.

Put this on for your newborn and watch her develop colic (which, apparently Sinead has a chronic case of).

Spice it with seducing, Monroe-ish charm. There you have it: Sinead with a successful example of Big Band jazz. From the childish joy in \\"Secret Love\\" to the sweet melancholy in \\"Gloomy Sunday\\", she conveys an exquisite blend of emotions with her better-than-ever, \\"breathy\\" voice. She is a lost swan, really, singing the enchanting songs of a distant era, breathing them a new life. Even if you think that Sinead is not for you, this is one to have. Because it is pure gold, a tour de force!.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Subversive Enough","review":"Sinead O'Connor is a great vocalist. Forget, for a moment, all the publicity that ended up destroying her career (aside for the few remaining diehards) and think back to the first time you heard that voice. That voice. The one that gave you goosebumps on \\"The Lion and the Cobra\\" or brought you to tears on \\"I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got.\\" Then, imagine it singing a batch of show tunes. Intriguing idea? Absolutely. Unfortunately there isn't enough attitude here.What this ends of being is a straight forward collection of these songs, which might be great for Barbara Striesand, but for Sinead we expect more. We expect a certain subversion and, sadly, we don't get it here. Oh the voice is still there, but the passion isn't. Diehards may like it, but then again by the time this was released, they were the only ones still listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Good singer, great songs -- so what went wrong? Some of the cuts are embarrassingly overproduced, and her singing here is just too thin to compete or be of much interest. If you go big band, you'd better go big voice too.

I think because so little is said about him. Mrs. Traylor brings him out of the Bible and into your home.

And you can tell that she has done a lot of research on him from how well the story flows together. This book is also a great lead in to her book \\"Abraham\\" (ISBN: 0842359753). But be prepared, no matter if you read this book as a stand alone or with the others, to be entranced, entertained and to enjoy this book and to be saying, \\"HHMMMMM\\" a lot.

The subject matter is important, it talks about many practical concepts, the cover is cute, etc. But trying to read this book I was very disappointed. The author has just cut and pasted some well-known ideas but doesn't explain anything clearly. Despite knowing the subject I found it painful to follow. I wanted to throw the book away after reading a few sections, but I kept telling myself \\"it can't be that bad, the material is fine, let me give it another chance\\". But the book is that bad! It is no excuse that this is a \\"handbook\\". There are many books that are not textbooks that do a great job explaining things. I feel sorry for anybody who is trying to learn by reading this book. If you are a beginner read Howard Johnson's classic \\"Black Magic\\" book.

They can't help but sound the way they sound. It's as if these guys time-traveled from 1967:an era when thousands of lousy garage bands would play just for the fun of it. These guys are for real.Too bad most of the songwriting on this recording is also in that \\"lousy garage band\\" catagory. The best tracks are \\"Let's Go\\", \\"One Less Step\\", (both written by Ken Fox) and \\"We'll Never Forget\\" (written by K. Streng and P. Zaremba). The other tracks are quite forgettable and lack energy.I would recommend this album (if the price was right)if only to hear \\"One Less Step\\" and \\"We'll Never Forget\\" -- great songs.You might want to check out The Fleshtones' \\"Beachhead\\" CD (2005).

I guess I have been spoiled by the complete chair massagers as featured at Sharper Image Stores. In rereading the reviews, it appears most people who appreciate these type of machines have painful chronic foot problems which are helped. Otherwise for healthy people, I imagine just taking a walk would do as much for you. It was a very low price but in the end, I would not have wanted it for free.

To my dismay the character for the letter \\"d\\" is a ballerina. Now I know that it is a \\"dancer\\", but she wears ballet shoes, dances on pointe, and the capital letter D has a tutu. But the narrator only say their letter names, not their characters. My ballerina obsessed six year old immediately said \\"d, ballerina.\\" I cannot imagine how these supposed experts could let an obvious conflict like that get through the planning stages, much less focus groups. The company's response to my complaint was for me to ship back the flash cards and coloring book I had ordered at my expense, and they would give me a refund for the purchase price.

The diary is written by two students in the school, Hyo-Shin and Shi-Eun, who both are seniors. On the very same day that Min-Ah comes across the diary Hyo-Shin commits suicide for some unknown reason. The death of Hyo-Shin leads to multiple rumors among the girls in the school, which induces mass hysteria and depression among the school girls. However, Min-Ah discovers something much more mysterious as she continues to read the diary that seems to enchant her. Passionately Min-Ah begins seeking the truth behind Hyo-Shin's demise, and the road to the truth seems to be a very dangerous path. Memento Mori is a film that displays the joy of film making as it tells a complex coming of age story, which offers a truly great cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Korean movie!","review":"Memento Mori (Remember the Death) is a great horror flick.

Considering that, the movie is enjoyable with good acting and a sweet little hidden relationship that turns dark. For me, most asian movies tend to have their moments but never really tie it together in the end... In this case it feels like there could have been more, something more full circle. ***THE KICKER is that some scenes were cut out of the movie, including a bathtub scene, But there is a (Korean ver. only) 6-disc special edition of this movie available for about $49-60 online with many extras and special packaging which I DO give five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Bland Attempt","review":"Memento Mori is a very bland attempt at invoking horror in the jealous rage of preteen relationships. At no point did the movie provoke any late night viewing fears, nor any interest at all.

One of the best is Football Manager 2006 (a soccer simulation) as it is one of a long line of great management games, and I play it religiously. NFL Head Coach, though, stinks on ice. EA Sports tries to make the game as though you are a real coach...but too real. Endless meetings that could be done through text messages instead of having to actually move from place to place, office hours, meetings with owners...ACK!!Train players, draft players, trade players, create a playbook, coach games. That's all there should be in this stupid game. Unfortunately, there's too much junk in it. I really had high hopes for this game, but, apparently, EA Sports didn't even bother to look at some of the sports strategy sims that are out there to see what works. Instead, they included everything that didn't.On a side note...how do these idiots keep their jobs? If the reviewers here on Amazon can see the flaws in the game, can't EA Sports see them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"EA Misses the Handoff","review":"I can say this much for sure: No little boys who play this game will ever want to grow up to be an NFL head coach.The product description claims that the game has \\"the strategy and realism that real fans crave,\\" but unless your strategy is one of the *two* strategies that exist in the game, you're out of luck.It also claims \\"easy-to-use controls and assistance,\\" but the feather-light 10 page instruction booklet doesn't really explain anything that isn't already on the outside of the box.I won't address the dozens of bugs that ruin the gameplay and, in some cases, corrupt your many hours of progress, but if EA doesn't take a closer look at some of the issues, there will be gamers with pitchforks parading in the streets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being A Head Coach Is This Boring?????","review":"This game is just plain boring!I had no idea being a head NFL coach would be this boring.If you like sitting in meetings, answering the phone and reading emails....this game is for you.All of the tasks that are required of you take forever to do...even reading emails takes several steps.When you finally get to coach a game....IT IS BORING!!!!!!Complete waste of time and money.Save time and money to just play the regular EA College Football games or Madden Games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and Buggy Overall very bad","review":"This game had great promise for game play as an excellent Sports Strategy game. Problem; numerous bugs, the network play is just terrible and as you can see by the price drops everyone knows it. You cannot do a direct connect and have to log into the EA network. Which would not be bad if it was not DOWN ALL THE TIME. I would not mind the single player game play but thats not what I purchased the game for. Multiplay is why this would have been a great game. Poor Graphics, Poor Networking, and Overall Very Poor Game Play. Sorry EA but this one will be in the bargain bin at $5 in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with bugs.","review":"Get this game if you enjoy spending 40 hours + preparing your team for the regular season. It is kind of fun, I enjoyed it although it was very tedious. However like Paul, when I get to game 2 of the season all a sudden scores start becoming 0-0 and when I try and coach my next game its two other teams on the field from a game thats already played and not my Cowboys! I tried patching, reinstalling. Tech support says my saved game files corrupt? Oh great, I go back to my saved game before the draft, sim to game 2 same thing. The only thing that works is going back to my saved game 3 hours into this and starting over and spending another 30-40 hours hoping it doesnt bug up again? No thank you. Nice try EA but next time playtest the game before releasing.I looked for a patch as soon as I installed the game. Couldnt find one on the EA site. Only after contacting technical support did I get the link for the patch. Thanks for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to this game. I have several text football simulations that I enjoy playing. I enjoy running the GM functions and picking the plays to see what happens. I like making the trades and building my teams. This game isn't that. It is more an exercise in tedium. The interface is clunky and hard to get it to do what you want. It is buggy when you work hard to ready players each week to have it bug out and return to zero readiness. If you could combine the view of plays like in Madden with some of the good text simulations, you could have a great game. This is just a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I've been waiting for years for a game like this. How completely disapointing. Shame on you EA Sports. Only 4 1/2 games into a season and I'm done. Just for a few examples, in only 4 1/2 (thus the half) games, the game has locked up requiring a reboot and loss of the game. One of my coaches quit during the season, but I can't replace him since I don't that the \\"hire coach\\" task on my calendar. Likewise I get a bunch of emails about trade offers from other teams, but I can't call the team because I don't have a \\"trade\\" task on my calendar!! For a game that's so ridiculously detailed, why can't I call the other teams or coaches during my office hours!? It takes hours for the draft for instance (it's all in real time), but I can't do these simple things. Oh, and what's with the 5 minute quarters? Isn't this supposed to be the NFL? The opposing team calls their plays with 30+ seconds left on the clock. I could go on and on and on. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This is a horrible game. I played Madden for the strategy part, and I was really looking forward to this game. But as the other reviewer said it takes forever to do anything.

And from reading your reviews, it doesn't seem like I want to spend another 9 1/2 hours to get to a lame game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"NFL Bad Hoax\\"","review":"Everything written here about this game is amusingly true. I cannot figure out what EA was thinking by creating this game. For those familiar with Madden 2006 the interface is alot like Superstar mode only more restrictive. The \\"Superstar\\" and \\"Head Coach\\" concepts are intriguing, but EA should stick with what has worked for years. Their franchise mode is WAY more user friendly than it is in NFL Head Coach. I love Madden's Franchise mode and if EA had set up NFL Head Coach under that format I think the game would be much more successful. Better yet, just include \\"Coaching Mode\\" as part of the Madden 2008 game. Now that would be cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interface worst of all-time","review":"I've been a soccer management game player for years. I was looking forward to this game with great anticipation.Let me sum this up quickly: This game has the worst interface of all-time. It's awful, really hard to move around and completely unuseable. It's as if EA wanted to take The Sims and marry all the characters and conversations into a management game.When you are in a management game, which is not for all game players, you want menus so you can quickly get things done.I got the feeling that EA was too lazy to differentiate the PC engine from PS2 engine.Deeply, deeply, disappointed that EA put out a piece of junk like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headaches","review":"Besides the headaches already mentioned, it took three copies to get one with the access code in it.

Maybe after I begin the season things will get faster..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Mamet (along with Glen Garry)","review":"This is probably Mamet's best work, in my opinion, since he focuses on truthful characters without the rather contrived repartee of many of his other plays in which he seems to attempt to develop some metrical dramturgical quirkiness to provide the viewer/reader with a sense of originality. I find Mamet's screenplays usually better than his plays, try The Spanish Prisoner for example. But in Speed the Plow, he provides us with fully fleshed characters who speak like real people (with the necessary artistic license and not so hung up about verbal pyrotechnics. By the way, his style is obviously influenced by studies with Sandy Meisner from the Neighborhood Playhouse.

In reality \\"carro\\" has the trill whereas \\"caro\\" does not. The \\"r\\" in \\"caro\\" is pronounced more like the \\"dd\\" in the English word \\"ladder\\".The other single/double consonants also taught incorrectly are \\"z/zz\\". A single \\"z\\" in Italian has a \\"d\\" sound in front of it, like in \\"ad zone\\". The \\"zz\\" is taught to sound the same as the single \\"z\\" when in reality it has a \\"ts\\" sounds like in \\"hits\\" or \\"ritz\\".Even though I'm from an Italian-American family, I know minimal Italian but enough to know how letters are pronounced.

I was hoping to learn Italian in an entertaining way, and to learn to speak it like a native (with correct pronunciation and emphasis). They got it half right. The DVD effectively uses visuals, repetition, and dialogue to make learning some basic Italian easy and memorable. But in the first three lessons I have already found a multitude of examples of words or letters that were pronounced in at least two different ways each, which is sloppy, to say the least. The problem for a new student is knowing which is the CORRECT pronunciation (and, YES, there IS a correct pronunciation). I will have to rely on OTHER sources to teach me which is the correct pronunciation. I wonder how much else they got wrong? Ultimately, there are some valuable tidbits of information on this DVD, but don't expect to sound like anything but an American speaking Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment.","review":"We bought this DVD based on the idea that it would be an easy and fun way to learn conversational Italian. Big bummer! We watched over 1/2 an hour and at the end of the time didn't know a single word in Italian -- but we COULD tell you which letters are not innate to the Italian alphabet.Too much focus on the finer points of the language (the aforementioned alphabet issue as well as long, drawn-out sections on the difference in pronunciation of various vowels but no context in which to place them) and not enough on the nuts and bolts, like \\"Where's the bathroom?\\" \\"How much does that cost?\\" or even, \\"Do you speak English, please?\\"Also, I found the constant change of narrator to be quite confusing and even irritating.A good idea -- to make learning another language fun -- but it somehow got lost in translation (pun intended!).

It is likely the smell and the powder are both toxic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Good:- Affordable.- Padded handles are great. They provide a nice grip.- The wheel if very light.- It's small and easy to store.Bad:- Assembly was not so easy... it was a lot of strenght involved in order to make pieces fit \\"all the way\\".- I don't like that the wheel is plastic.- What is really missing is that this model does not have a spring which will help you go back to original position. You need to use your own muscles to get back, and this puts much strain on the back.- Wheel seems not to be very well \\"greased\\", so you need to put much strenght in order to push/pull yourself.My husband and me used it few times, but found that instead of good workout, we end up with back pains... so we are not using it any more.Now I'm sorry that I choose this one... I wish I went for one of better quality excercise wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"Not good at all. I tried to use it and it's too difficult.

The head of Imperial Security finds out Miles is really not a well bloke, and gives him the boot from his current assignment.This is seen as an opportunity for some that don't like the current boss to try and get rid of him.The first bit backfires on those that have targeted the head of Security as Miles finds an old law that lets the Emperor appoint a troubleshooter who can basically order whoever th ehell he likes around. He gets a surprise when said Emperor makes it him. This sort of troublemaking certainly suits him as he does the business."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun little book to share!","review":"This little board book has become a favorite in our home. It is the perfect size for the little hands of my ten-month-old daughter, although we have been reading it to her since she was born.There are five little toys for babies to review: a ball, a set blocks, a car, a teddy bear, and a drum. The presentation is done with a sweet rhyme that is easy for parents to memorize. We find ourselves reciting the words as we play with our daughter and her toys, especially her own little blue ball! Pictures of the toys are also placed on \\"tabs\\" so the baby can turn to her favorite page immediately.I really love the diverse illustrations of the babies, who all have very happy smiles. My daughter \\"talks\\" to the babies and points to the toys.I would recommend this book as a gift for any new baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked gem","review":"Fans of Cream's best material (i.e., Jack Bruce's songs) and Ginger Baker's drumming will be blown away by this undeservedly obscure offering. Chris Goss, MOR's very talented lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter penned several great Bruce-ish songs for SOTSB, ranging from dark and panoramic to driving and comic, and Baker is in top form. This is clearly the best rock recording ginger has been in involved with since Cream and Blind Faith, and at its best, MOR rivals either band. (I also highly recommend Ginger's trio recordings with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cream Fans Take Note; Ginger Baker Plays On This Album","review":"Fans of the 60s supergroup Cream should give this album a listen. Cream drummer Ginger Baker plays on it and his drums are very prominent in the final mix of the CD. The influence of Cream, and Ginger Baker of course, can be distinctly heard in a lot of the material.For a laugh, check out Ginger Baker's lyric on T.U.S.A., a very amusing take on a Brit's chagrin at the way tea is brewed and served in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would've been a great album.","review":"I know I will catch hell from Masters Of Reality fans, but I was really dissapointed with this album. I thought it would be a bass-heavy album with some killer riffs and some stoned out jams. At least that was my impression when I heard that Chris Goss, the leader of Masters Of Reality, produced Kyuss' best album, Blues For The Red Sun. But I was wrong. The production is way too 80's for me. The guitar isn't that heavy, and the drums don't sound like drums. Some songs I really like, such as She Got Me When She Got Her Dress On, and Jody Sings, but the bulk of it is bad late 70's rock. I guess I didn't catch on.

The premise of a young teen in boot camp didn't appeal very much to this middle-aged housewife. But since I'd read and enjoyed The Western Chronicles also written by this writing team, I thought I'd give it a try.Boy am I glad I did! The character development in Graceful Waters is excellent; both main characters and even the secondary characters leapt off the page and into my den. I love how the authors took their time in building the relationship between the two women so that by the time they finally physically consumated their relationship, I could understand why Carey & Grace found the other so attractive. I hope these two authors will team up again in the near future.Excellent summer-time beach read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not very origional","review":"Kazuki is wizard, but he can only use his magic 8 times before it kills him.

Even though the story is pretty regular there are a few touching moments, it also delivers plenty of comedy too. I'm not gonna lie and say it's one of the best animes I've seen; but I'm glad I did see it. It's pretty enjoyable. Maybe check it out on youtube or netflix to see what you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"People are way too generous with 5 star ratings","review":"Maburaho is well drawn.

Just to establish what I think of as a funny anime so you know where I'm coming from--- GTO is funny. This is, at most, cute. It may be that I'm not in to \\"Harem\\" comedies. I find animes with shy, sexually repressed male protagonists who get smacked around by their female counterpoints annoying.

Several people at church commented on how pretty it was and how precious our baby girl was in it. The only down-side is that after hand washing it due to our baby drooling on it (she was teething), the center butterfly on the bodice came off. Because of this, I discovered that the butterflies are just hot-glued on. It will be simple enough to hot glue back on, but I was surprised by it. And I only used slightly warm water.

Last year the metal bar broke under one the seats, so the stroller would not stay open, and my husband had to get a new screw and put it together. At this point, I am online trying to find another inexpensive double stroller b/c I am embarrassed to take this anywhere b/c it is so rusty! I don't want to spend a lot since my twins are now 3 and the baby is 1yr old, so hopefully our days of double strollers are numbered and we can get away with a single to most places.

I read many reviews and ended up getting this one only because it was the only choice in my price range at the store. I LOVE it though!! It is very lightweight, folds and unfolds easily. My girls love sitting in it and looking around and at each other. Cargo bags on the sides are nice as is the simple, but effective cupholder for parent. I think it moves very smoothly and steers easily. I am still keeping my front and back stroller because I like that they can eat on the trays. With this, there is no tray in front of them. It is not a cadillac stroller, but it is a VERY, VERY nice umbrella stroller. Good price too--baby depot $89.00!!!

I loved the fact that we heard the story behind the creation of Il Divo. To hear about their backgrounds and how they began to blend their voices and create a sound that is truly appreciated by all is incredible to me. They continue to get better as they branch out into a slightly different sound as each CD/DVD comes out. I can't compare their voices to any I've heard before. Simon Cowell is a genious when it comes to finding new talent and he was right on the mark when he had this vision for Il Divo. I recommend this DVD to all who wish to discover and appreciate just what it takes to find unknown talent, realize their potential and have a vision as to how that talent will take the world by surprise.

Also, I wish Carlos would hold back his need to show off his big barritone voice. It does not always blend. It seems, at times, he is trying to out do David, who also has a big voice.

The DVD gives you a good bit of understanding about how this revolutionary sound came to be. This group is the brainchild of Simon Cowell (sp), who I understand is quite popular among reality TV fans. The film exposes his intent to bring operatic voice to pop music. Obviously, his vision was the right vision at the right time, as this group promises to introduce the world to virtually new genre of musical sound that will only rise in popularity.You will learn of the diverse backgrounds of the four young singers, each themselves, previously successful soloists. The DVD also includes a rather brief live performance from Medira, Spain, as well as two music videos.

The screenplay, or directing, lacks focus and ambles its way through Funke's delightful story. I credit the actors for their decent performances, and the setting in modern-day Venice is especially beautiful. Still, the entire film appeares flat compared to Funke's rich and visual text.

I would definitly recomend seeing it, but I would advise you to read the book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive Actors/Poor Plot Line","review":"I bought this DVD based on the good reviews written here. And I have to admit the actors looked good and the movie had a nice look. But I and my family were disappointed by the shallow, disjointed storytelling involved. A good movie should also be true in how it presents a story so that consequences follow on actions. But here, everything works out fine in spite of characters doing them the wrong way. If nothing else, Scipio should have aged 20-30 years at least for riding the Merry-Go-Round rather than just a few years and all his problems being solved. My advice is to buy Disney's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" or \\"Oliver\\". Either is a much better movie for children and families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darned Good","review":"I found this gem shopping at a CD/DVD consignment store in Portland, OR 5 years ago.

The base that is supposed to support the glass is crooked so any attempt to put the glass on the base doesn't work since it falls over or tilts. It's completely unattached and unsafe. It's cheaply made too - made in china. I bought this for my kid's nursery and there's no way I can use the light when the glass doesn't fit over the base and it's about to tip over.Also, this barely lights up the room - it takes a nightlight to work and doesn't give off much light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Not sure I would refer to this as the \\"best 'live' album ever\\", but I sure wish Ian would do a remaster on this one, and make it more available. This is far better than \\"Bursting Out\\" or \\"Live at Hammersmith\\". Definitely the best \\"live\\" TULL CD ever.Traffic still does a much better version of \\"John Barleycorn\\" but all other cuts are top notch and have the boys in fine form. Ahhhhh---when will we ever get a new Tull studio album. Based on the excellent recent solo releaes by both Ian and Martin, we shouldn't hold our breath.If you really enjoy Tull's music, you definitely need to pick up \\"A Little Light Music\\". You won't regret it.Since when have the critics been right about Tull anyway? Listen to what their fans say about this release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise!","review":"A Tull fan forever but never considered buying this album simply because it was all songs that I had in different versions on different albums.

Walter and Mike are wonderful characters, and their story takes place in beautiful settings, vividly described by the author.

The writing has a cheery and approachable style, yet is unmistakably informed and authoritative.In my opinion, the Three Wine Glass rating system (good, excellent, outstanding in its category) is much better than rating systems based on the 100 point scale (like the Wine Spectator's and Wine Advocate's) which profess more precision than they have accuracy. The Gambero Rosso shares its opinions, but in a way that leaves room for my tastes and palate.The 2000 edition presents a good selection of the highly touted 1997 vintage in Tuscany and is worth having just for this.The book is decidedly *not* an introduction to Italian wine, though. It does not discuss the differences in wine regions or wine making techniques and will not help you distinguish or decide between a Chianti and a Barolo. It's not that kind of book.I highly recommend it for anyone interested in buying and drinking Italian wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing","review":"where is Josko Grauner in this book ?

It is good for those days when you might need that extra layer. The bright colors make it very visible for road cycling. A disadvantage is that it is extremely loud when going over 30mph from the lightweight fabric snapping right next to your ears. The jacket is form fitting but for me is cut an inch or two too short in the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages!","review":"I highly recommend it especially for the low Amazon sale price! My 6 year old daughter and 4 year old son both love it, want to do more and more art with it and both have a very easy time operating it and they get beautiful results every time. Even my 1 1/2 year old son loves watching it work. I even have fun doing it and we will definitely use our art to make cards for family/friends or just hang up and enjoy. The only drawback is it is a little time consuming peeling off the paint from the unit after it has dried already, but hey, there's cleanup involved w/ any art project so it's to be expected. I read on another review that the paint stains fabric, but I didn't find that the paint flies around too much, so none of us got any paint on our clothing. Also, I like the paint they include since is dries really nice and doesn't crack/peel like other cheap children's craft paint. Buy it and enjoy! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Time Use Toy","review":"This was a Christmas present my two girls (8 and 5) received. It was basically a one time use toy.

On Christmas morning we opened it, put a battery in it and nothing. It didn't spin. The seller sent a new one no questions asked and it again arrived quickly and the return was hassle free. The new one worked for about 20 minutes in total before it just stopped spinning. I was there supervising my kids and it wasn't due to any mishandling. During that time my kids loved it but certainly not worth the money paid. I called the seller and they were great and refunded my money.

Rather than send the large and bulky package, with all the speakers, back to Amazon, I sent the receiver to the Sony Center in Laredo texas. It took forever to get an acknowledgement, until I went on line and saw they wanted to charge me nearly $80 for cosmetic repairs to the front of the receiver-- and were waiting for my OK, without ever emailing me that there was an issue. The receiver, needless to say, had been very well packed and protected. Eventually, they sent it back without charge-- but when I went to plug it in, and pushed the on/off button, the button went all the way through and fell somewhere into the bowels of the unit. After an email exchange with the Sony people in Laredo, with no reply after the first one, I just gave up. I will eat the cost and look elsewhere.

Indeed, it is quite simply the best cinematic adaptation of a comic book character I have seen so far. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best screen performances as billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, whose near-fatal encounter with Afghani terrorists literally leads him towards a new path in life. The supporting cast is just as superb, most notably Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's lovely - and brilliant - assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges as Stark's complicated business partner Obediah Stane. Director Jon Favreau does a fine job handling both the intense, often bloody, action sequences and the more introspective scenes featuring Downey and Paltrow. Of course the special effects are absolutely top notch, courtesy of Industrial Light and Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WAIT A WHILE AND THE DISC WILL LOAD ...

I have a few quibbles with the script, but nothing that serious. {Like how did Obie manage to control that giant power suit so well when he had no time to practice his Ironman Kung-Fu?}My real quibble is with the Blu-ray transfer team. They did not implement DTS-HD Master Audio, which is the top-flight audio standard Blu-Ray offers. They should have used DTS-HD MA. Also, there is some softness and grainy noise in the picture occasionally. I found this very surprising. Certainly, a movie just released this summer cannot have had time to degrade on a media shelf somewhere in North Hollywood. Certainly, such a recent master must have had many purely digital elements. Certainly, they should have been able to avoid some of the problems associated with film transfer?I am afraid Paramount is still figuring out Blu-Ray after having been entrenched in the HD-DVD camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"origin\\" superhero movie.","review":"Very good \\"origin\\" superhero movie.

His experimentation in the lab with his robots by his side, was particularly funny. He delivers a somewhat cool, calm yet lackadaisical approach to things when the pressure is on. He did everything right in this movie and I think that's why he's endeared millions more fans because of it.Jeff Bridges was extremely annoying and obnoxious as Obadiah \\"Stane\\" (was that a subtle hint?) and the \\"Iron Monger\\" who battles Iron Man in the final sequence. Which by the way, reminded me of RoboCop 2 (RoboCop vs Cain) and Edward Norton's \\"Hulk\\" vs. Tim Roth's \\"Abomination\\" battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely rust-free","review":"The writers and director of IRON MAN have crafted a fine comic book adaptation, skilfully combining character, action. plot, and humour (the latter is essential in such movies, with many failing as a result of self-reverence). Here the script is sharp and lean, and is confidently delivered by a top-flight cast. The set pieces are well constructed and the special effects are impressive. The story, for the most part, is cohesive and convincing. There's not much to criticise here, except perhaps the ending, which is rather predictable. All in all this is first-class entertainment from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Man","review":"Outstanding PQ & AQ. A great movie to watch.

What I will say is that this Blu-Ray edition does a good job of bringing the feeling of the big screen at home. The video is very clear provided you are using high def, and the sound track is very cool for those who have multi-speaker systems. Using the PCM stream, you can appreciate individual bullets in different areas and some more subtle sounds during the battle sequences that you may not have noticed. This movie is probably one of my favorites to show off sound effects.

A little slow at times, reminded me of Superman Returns, The problem I have with my purchase is I was expecting to be bowled out of my chair by the audio. Compared to the audio effects and low-end bass found in Transformers, Iron Man was kind of a let down (use of all channels was fine/transfer was nice) The scene where Stark demos the Jericho was a major disappointment (had to crank my receiver). Anyway, as a whole the movie was fine, but I think people should rent it first, not only because of the known issues with compatibility, but simply to make sure this is a movie you'll watch again.

There was a lot of hype going into Iron Man, and the film satisfied nearly everyone. The action is just enough to please, and to leave the viewer wanting more. The film's pace is brisk and there is nearly no downtime. Downey Jr. perfectly portrays Tony Stark, an immature billionair turned empathetic hero. Jeff Bridges rarely plays a villain, but turns out a believable performance that is a good counterpart to Downey's character. Terrance Howard has a somewhat minor role, but Howard pulls it off greatly; it is too bad that he was replaced for the sequal. Paltrow's take as Stark's assistant is the heart of the film.

When I saw the movie in the theatre all the fanboys went nuts for that little bit at the end of the credits, and I was impressed too. I wish I had thought of it. Downey Jr. is great as Stark (unlike Christian Bale with that silly diguised voice.) It shows that you can stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film. It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron man. Not a guy in an armored batsuit who usually has the intellect of Sherlock Holmes but (in this movie version) gets others to do his thinking for him. Oh right.... that was another summer film.

I have never been a fan of his, but I was very impressed by his role as Tony Stark. This movie has boat loads of action, suspense, and drama. The supporting cast is also amazing.

There are 2 action scenes, only one of which has any substance and duration. This movie cannot compare to any of the other comic book movies on any level. If there is a sequel it stands a slim chance of being good but it cannot be any worse. Ironman for a superhero is as weak a character as Magneto, or Aquaman, or Greenlantern. It cannot touch Superman, Batman or Spiderman. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.This cannot be classified as an action movie, it is a total sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark, cynical, not for kids","review":"The worst film I've seen in a long time. Senseless violence, one-dimensional characters and outright racist portrayals of arabs. Robert Downey Jr. shows the emotional range of an earthworm. He wisecracks stone-faced throughout, although doesn't seem to care one way or the other what happens to him or anyone around him. The one opportunity for redemption falls flat, as there's no real change after the press conference. The romantic interest is forced and uncomfortable. You have to sit through two hours of tepid \\"build-up\\" before Iron Man actually battles a bad guy. Let's hope this is the last we see from this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Stupid Comic Book Movie, or Downey Needed Money","review":"I know movies should be bigger than life, but come on. How much jet fuel does a single armor suit carry? I did not see any fuel tanks.

I approached it as a bit of action-adventure-comic book escape. It turned out to be quite a bit more than that. There is some serious thematic material subtly woven in, for example the strength of the original heart. And our expectation about who the bad guys really are gets turned on its head. I also really loved the chemistry between RDJ and Gwyneth Paltrow. They smoked in a beautifully understated way. All in all, I found it a very satisfying 2+ hours, me who is pretty much the polar opposite of a 12-year-old boy. (But fear not, there is plenty in the film to satisfy that heart as well. Very endearing, actually.) Two thumbs way up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I have seen Iron man II a couple of times, but had not seen this one.

It is great simply because it provides escapism fun for the length of the movie. I cannot claim to be a Hollywood movie critic. I am not going to dissect the acting skills of every actor or the quality of the scenes.All I can say is this - when a movie is over, if I feel moved because of the message it delivers or, in the case of Iron Man, I am excited about the action, etc., and can't wait to watch it again, then I consider it a great movie!Iron Man is a great action movie, pure & simple. If you like things that fly, explosions, etc., all delivered with a Sci-Fi, eccentric billionaire twist, then you'll probably love Iron Man.The Blu-Ray version is superb....explosions, fighting, etc., all provide excellent audio quality. The video is very good.In summary, I think it's classic movie fun....sit back and enjoy it for what it is - a fun ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Pleasant Surprise","review":"Seeing this on the heels of watching the new James Bond Quantum of Solace and the re-make of the Day The Earth Stood Still (two huge disappointments) Iron Man was a very pleasant surprise. The film had plot, acting, dialogue, direction, special effects, humor - what a concept, maybe this type of film making could catch on in Hollywood. What do you think? I'm already anxious for the sequel. Weak spots - not too many, perhaps Jeff Bridges characters motivation. But that's nit picking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is a great movie full of action and comedy (in the right spots not stupid/random funnny).

I can say however that I just saw it last night on my big screen downstairs and absolutely loved it. The basic story line is a weapons developer, Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr is captured by enemies using his weapons to cause destruction and chaos through terrorism. During his captivity he invents a new type of energy that allows him to make some awesome new developments, in the process a villian is revealed that is initially considered his friend, this villian steals the invention from him and they fight.Overall it did not seem as long as it was, and was extremely entertaining.

Wasted talent (Ms. Paltrow (wasted!) & Mr. Bridges, in particular), plot holes, a completely schizophrenic conversion by Tony Stark (\\"I realize that my family's business is war, so I'll rectify that by building a legendary suit of armor, flying around the world and killing people!\\"), and racist portrayals of terrorists, the villian du jour.I started getting bored about 1/2 hour into the movie, and it went downhill from there ...Seriously. Hollywood spends a kabillion dollars on this movie, and this is the best script they can come up with? The script felt completely formulaic, paint-by-numbers, and predictable.Finally ... I seem to be in the minority here, but when I watch Robert Downey Jr. acting, all I see is a man playing Robert Downey Jr. ... in every movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED IT","review":"It only had one disc when it was suppose to have two.

Maybe I just like this movie (I'm not even partial to Ironman) but I re-watch this a lot more than any of my other DVDs and Blu-Rays, and it always looks great on my HDTV.

A five-year old child could write a more imaginative scenario & dialogues. Spoiler: The line \\"give me an American cheeseburger\\" by Stark upon his return from captivity in Afghanistan, after which he is shown eating Burger King, seemed really cheap to me. It demonstrates what the movie is all about. If you are oblivious to propaganda and advertising, then you may enjoy this movie. Just my $0.02.PS: I did read the comic book as a kid and was a fan, whis is why I was disappointed with the cheap pseudo-patriotic \\"American cheeseburger\\" lines, the cliche Afghan terrorist stereotypes, and the rest of the shallow plot.

When he killed his first victim, the writing was so difficult to comprehend that I couldn't tell if he raped her and killed her, or just killed her.

This book gives a good review of their overall \\"game plan\\" for making money during the good times, and preserving it in the downturns.I'd recommend it to other DWA subscribers.

The chapters are organized around physical phenomena and the math behind their explanation. The result is a charming and VERY useful book. I have the 1970 edition which is quite worn from frequent use. The chapter titled, Differential Equations - The Heart Of Analysis, is exceptionally beautiful and pertinent. Reading this book is akin to a treasure hunt. There is page after page of mathematical discovery. Reading the chapter on Motion Of Projectiles made me terribly angry at the banal way in which this topic is handled in high school texts. Things such as quadratic equations and the law of gravitation are explained very well. I sincerely believe that this book should be a required text for High School math students. Highly recommended. The Dover edition is very affordable so even if it means foregoing a meal, do it. Buy this book!

Newton's laws wereformulated . i.e. F= MAThe motion of projectiles evolved into the use of the sine andcosine to describe curvilinear motion. The laws of gravity,motion and oscillations were refined further into a multiplicity of uses in mathematics and theoretical physics.

I also found the writing style annoying because the actual \\"per-page\\" ratio of _useful_ and _relevant_ information is low.In retrospect, it is obvious that grand claims are always \\"red flags\\" - e.g. imagine a tourist on her first trip to Rome signing up for a guided tour that claims to show all of Rome in one afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to Jon Land!","review":"I don't give many 5 star ratings but this book definitely deserves it.

First off, this ain't country, but more of an amalgam of Lou Reed (vocals) and Tom Waits without the histrionics (Muss) and maybe a touch of Greg Brown (Fool of a Girl). I do love the open space melancholy that pervades most of these songs and the low key singing style adds to all of this. This album is certainly eclectic, as the title states, but I'm not sure it serves the album as a whole.

The picture shows the original model weight vest with sand packet weights stitched into the vest. This neoprene, non-adjustable vest is the only one I ever found that fit comfortably for all day wear, and had enough bend to be worn during martial arts practices. Almost every manufacturer today uses the steel shot packets which never conform right, are uncomfortable to wear, and have almost no give when doing simple exercises like sit ups. If you must go with steel in your vest, try another product, because this one is sub par on every level.

It is a fascinating look into the working spaces of some of the greatest artists of the 20th Century. The photos are usually Liberman's own and while good, they are not usually \\"fine art\\". However, they do provide glimpses into places few have been, and that now no longer exist. Do I recommend it? Try borrowing mine--sorry!

Be warned that if you have thick curls and/or coarse hair, this is NOT the product for you. It does not \\"calm\\" and is definitely no longer a \\"creme\\", so the packaging is misleading.

I think due to authors' math background, sophiscated math finance students like me find this book even more intriguing -- we can actually see how mathematic theories are applied in the market to price different exotic instruments. Yet this book is also written simple enough so MBA students (or even advanced college students) can gain comprehensive knowledge of how financial market really works.Also, don't forget to check out this book's website.

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"If you are looking for a good solid swing CD this isn't it, although there are many songs that will get your feet moving.

I think it is fair to say now though, that I am possessed by it--it's my top pick for studio music. And I have to say, the more I listen to it, the more I am absolutely impressed by this band's headstrong individualistic determination to cut their own path and make it work, damn it, and if you don't get one or two songs then too bad for you--they're there anyway!It's my understanding that this band is from N.C. and plays around there quite a bit--I sure wish they were a local Boston band because they'd garner themselves a cult following pretty quickly although I'm sure they have a huge one down there.

SNZ hit a more potent era, right around 1932, when swing was just one of the many possible futures of music. The jazz-pop fusion of the twenties had matured and was just ready to explode.Be that as it may, this disc is super! There's depth and bite and tunes that just grow and grow on you.

If you're new to these guys, this is where to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suitable follow-up.","review":"\\"Hot\\" was the first Zippers CD I purchased and I was not dissappointed by this follow-up. This group was born in the wrong decade, as they have much more of a retro feel than any of the other new \\"swing\\" groups. Completely enjoyable and loads of fun. If I could find any fault, it's in it's rather diminuitive length. Couldn't they put a couple of rehearsals or covers of classic tunes on here?

You can't help but sing along to all of the songs even though they achieved such variety.Unfortunately this time around I don't find myself singing. I've listened to the CD 3 times and don't hear the fun and witty lyrics that I was looking for. The music is there, and it's good, it's just not what I had hoped for.

I guess I am a \\"less is more\\" SNZ listener because I loved the simpler, more vintage tunes on HOT and INEVITABLE. The first track, \\"The Suits Are Picking Up the Bill\\" starts out well and goes on to be a regurgitated Looney Tune mess. A definite highlight would be Andrew Bird's incredible intro to \\"The Ghost of Stephen Foster.\\" (His album, THRILLS, is great also - check it out) That song is GrEaT! Most of the songs are happenin' shindigs, of course, but the \\"less is more\\" songs are the ones worth listening to.

As a refuge from the punk movement of the 70s and 80s, I think youth music is moving towards tonality and harmony that the alternative musinc of the 80s and 90 have lacked. It's funny, but the same kinds of people I am seeing turned on by the swing movement were the same type or people who were drawn to Punk and industrial in my generation. I guess the best way to make your way in the world is to rebel against the austerity and atonality of the punk sensibility of your parent s generation!

The cage was easy to assemble and I received it the day after ordering! Quality is good from what I can see.I took a star off because the lip down into the cage from the top of the door/ramp is the only source of hesitation from my rabbit. With eyes on the side of his head, depth perception isn't something he excels in and the drop is enough to cause concern; He will eagerly go to the top of the opening but then refuse to make that last hop in...even with his favorite food as incentive. Ironically if I place him into the cage he will happily eat the food and then jump out with little trouble.

IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT LEARNING FRENCH, DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR & WATCH FRENCH FILMS INSTEAD (or use French audio on favourite moves, listen to French cds, etc). Classic French language animation, like Asterix & Obelix, Tintin, and Lucky Luke will help you much more. I also recommend listening to Zazie CDs, she is great and always comes w/ lyrics (and she sings slowly enough for you to follow everything). She has at least 6 CDs out currently.

It's so much more romantic than the usual half naked couple you get from the paper back romance books. The story is just as beautiful. Virginia Henley is a master at mixing romance and history. At the beginning I was skipping the historical background, but very soon I was just as involved with the political power struggle as the relationship between Rodger and Rosamond.If you like this book, you would love A YEAR AND A DAY too.

It was mainly Rodger and Rosamund, but the rest were alyce, edward, and rodger. Rodger and Rosamund couldn't even stand next to eachother without being sexually aroused. The scenes were also too detailed. There is no reason why there should be so many detailed sex scenes. It doesn't matter what your age is, no one needs to be reading that stuff. The more detailed it got, the less i believed they actually loved eachother. this book was just too much. i couldn't even enjoy the rest of the book from the fear of the next intimate scene. i like romantic books, but this was just over the top. defintely not for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"FINALLY FINISHED!","review":"This book was tedious. Maybe I kept on reading because the love scenes were so sexy - I don't know. The story seemed cobbled together, strung out on a version of English history. I became so tired of Rosamond with her \\"love him - love him not\\" attitude. One minute she was slavering over Rod, the next she was beating him with her fists. This heroine's personality, attitude and behavior were so inconsistent and shallow I could hardly wait to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until the end","review":"I love the romance between Rod and Rosamund, but I cannot believe Virginia Henley killed off Simon De Montfort. I don't read romance novels so I can feel sad. Simon is one of the ultimate romance novel heros and to be killed off in such a hideous way really bummed me out. He is the kind that you don't kill off! I guess Henley didn't remember that Simon is the best War lord in all of Christendom.

I was more caught up in his story here than Rosamund and Rodger.I have loved Virginia Henley's books since I was 12, and I thought she could do no wrong as an author.

First of all, I hated the characters and I never really felt like I knew them. If you loved The Dragon and the Jewel, I suggest that you never read this book. Simon and Eleanor de Montford are in this one, and if you know what happens in history to Simon, you don't really want to hear how he was killed but his godson, and then dismemebered. I don't know about anyone else but I really didn't like hearing about how Simon died after Virginia Henley made you fall in love with him in thw Dragon and the Jewel.

My 9.5 years daughter really enjoyed it. It reminded her about story of Pilgrims coming to America.Although the story was probably fictional it was interesting since it had one main topic and a moral dilemma. Who should a person be loyal to and what is more important - loyalty or passion.I did not rate it with 5 stars since some parts of the movie were not consistent. In the beginning Bach is presented as an angry, almost violent man, then he is becoming a very understanding and even compromising, although he never compromises his music. Good action, nice costumes, I wish it was more factual and it talks more about Bach's music and his life in overall and less about a small boy who was so perfect and almost saved bach's freedom. But maybe this is a reason why children like it because they can identify with this small boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I watched it in choir","review":"My choir and I watched this movie and I thought it was preaty good, being a composer movie an all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Botched Bach","review":"I bought this film based on the reviews and the price (it is inexpensive).

Some parts are interesting, but the main theme of the film loses the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Excactly Learning Anything....","review":"This is one of the many \\"educational\\" movies that you only learn about one thing for an hour. It was not a very fun thing to watch, even though a kid was in the story. It's weird at alot of parts, not just the fact that Bach lived a long time ago. I don't really recommend this movie, only if you are a very big fan of Bach's work. You don't hear alot of his work in the movie, until a \\"grand finale\\" in the end.

When I was a child, my parents played classical music for us because they loved it, and they hoped we would, too. I do the same for my own kids. But my siblings didn't much like classical music, and despite the insulting and ludicrous claims made on this CD, their SAT scores were in line with my own.

Petruska Clarkson looks at five aspects of the therapeutic relationship (the working alliance, plus the transferential, reparative/developmentally needed, person-to-person and transpersonal relationships.) Theory-wise, she has a psychodynamic background but her book contains examples of other approaches too, including transpersonal psychology, so is particularly suited to someone on an integrative counselling course, such as myself.

It doesn't even say what glass is.The authors are interested in linking glass to a few well established themes of Western Civilization courses, such as the rise of the individual and the scientific revolution. Example: Is it coincidence that the great scientific minds of the medieval period were all men of the church, which for the last few centuries had been using a lot of stained glass? (The authors acknowledge that the church monopoly on higher education may help to explain this astonishing coincidence.) The discussion seems never to get beyond a few supporting quotations, and a cavalcade of disclaimers.For a good history of glass, we may have to wait for Henry Petroski (Evolution of Useful Things) to write one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I thought this book would be more technical, with more details about glass itself. It's really just about the Renaissance and Greek revival. I can remember reading many pages without the word 'glass' even being mentioned!

I'm actually dreading finishing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and enlightening","review":"If your idea of World Music is that of pious songs played on folk instruments, then you need to take a listen to this compilation. It's fun, fresh, and modern, whilst still retaining the variety and charm you'd expect if you were trawling the world for material. The 'rock' in the title is perhaps a little misleading, but this CD covers pop, rap, and an Iron Butterfly cover, so there's plenty to entertain people of all ages. Possibly the best Rough Guide CD I've heard so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read two previous books by Jarman both of which were well written and enjoyable. I recently found this book and was looking forward to reading it, sort of a sequel to \\"We Speak No Treason\\". What a disappointment!

The blurbs on the back about three characters bear no resemblance to anything that actually happens in the story.

Now, in my fifties and with a lot more biographies under my belt, I ordered another copy. What a disappointment! It's what nostalgia can do to one's memory. This is what I call a 'light' biography. By that I mean there is much, much interpretation on the part of the author--what the subject was thinking at particular times, what she said or was told. Of course, there is no way for Ms. Edwards to know that. She is adding her own spin--by today's lingo--to history. By the time I was to the end of this book I had been force-fed Mary's \\"majesty\\" and \\"majestic bearing\\" so much I was anticipating a royal beheading!For those who don't read many biographies, or who remain more interested in the interpreted interplay of personalities, this book might satisfy.

Plus, Kokane adds a whole lot to this album and the music world in general. Kokane brings a sound to this album that we havent heard since the 1970's.

I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb.

It is very lightweight. Since it has the larger wheels it rolls very smoothly and with hardly any effort. We have taken it to the mall and the zoo and it fits in narrow pathways and standard door openings where others do not. The swivel wheel works great as well, so far. I couldn't imagine having a stroller without one, especially when it is a multi-purpose stroller. It also locks in place for jogging. The brake bar is very nice,(large enough to use your whole foot rather than just your toes) and easy to engage and disengage. The other thing that I should mention is that Schwinn does not make their strollers latch/lock closed when folded. The wheels do quick release for easier storage. I was also bummed when I found out that this model (2009 MODEL#: 13-SC916 Blue/Gray) didn't come with the zip out rain shield, so I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars. Overall the functionality is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I spent hours researching strollers before purchasing this one. And, although I think the more expensive versions might offer a stronger quality, this one suffices for the price. I actually like this stroller a lot! I just brought it to the mall for the first time and had no difficulties with it fitting in stores. It is super smooth when running and also folds up easily enough. The couple of things that I don't care for are the construction of the basket below - it seems just a little flimsy; however, it does hold my diaper bag and small drink cooler, in which I didn't think it would. Also, although I love the size of the sun canopy (this one of the main reasons I bought this stroller), this too seems a little flimsy. But, again, for the price comparison to others, I really am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to others.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, until the wheel fell off.","review":"We used this stroller for about a year, then on one of our walks my husband started to run for a little bit.

I get LOTS of inquiries about this when I am out and about. It's VERY easy to push and maneuver. I love the swivel front wheel, and I use the lock mechanism for walks/jogs. I would really like to see a hand brake, but the wrist strap on this model is definitely helpful for hills and rollerblading. The seats are easy to adjust, great pockets and cup holder. The sun shade is upgraded to a curve, which is really great. It's a little bit tough to collapse, but not too bad. It fits into the back of my minivan fairly well.

Excellent customer service experience from Manufacturer","review":"Great double-stroller, especially at the $220 price point. Only complaint is that the canvas material is a little thin (on the cover and underneath storage).Impressive 5-year warranty, which I actually utilized in the first couple weeks of use. One of the back wheels had a slightly loose spoke, which created a soft (but annoying) clanging noise. I went on the manufacturers website, clicked on the \\"Contact US\\" link and described the issue. Someone contacted me via email within 20 minutes, and after a quick follow-up question, they said a new wheel would be shipped to my home free of charge. It arrived within 2 days. That is very impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Feeder","review":"We ordered two of these Best-1 72 OZ hummingbird feeder on June 3rd and have used them for 2 months.

The feeder is now full with hummingbirds all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were the designers thinking!","review":"This hummingbird feeder has to be set into the opening of my garbage disposer to sit upright to be stable enough to fill, and the small needs a funnel to fill the feeder.

The brush is hinged in the middle and does a great job. There are also ant stoppers you can buy or put a sponge where you hang it with ant repellent on it. No way I know of to stop bees and wasps except for having fun with a hose or swatter. The older models had bad plastic that would not hold up to the sun and get brittle, I think the new models are better, maybe more UV protection and thicker, at least I have not had any problems for some time. When I got these feeders the hummers quit the little fancy ones. I have one I drilled 8 more holes in and when these little guys are hungry they will crowd right in there.

At the start of the film they have plastic laser guns that make sounds light up and shoot a light. A bit later the tips of the guns have a light bulb that lights up and there's a sound. Winding down the light bulbs must have burnt out because all you had was a sound while they stood there holding the guns.

It is great that people have the motivation to do movies, but there is a thin line between bad movie and a complete trash.

Special effects are awful, lasers coming out of the guns at odd angles and acting out recoil when gun is not going off, just to name a few. Acting is pitiful, to say no ones career will be launched from this \\"film\\" is an understatement. And the audio editing is awful, not to mention the Foley artist should be shot. When it comes down to it its obvious not a lot of time or effort went into this movie. I sometimes enjoy a cheesy movie with awful effects and sub par acting if it seems cared for, this movie however seemed like it was filmed just to have something on the disc while they tried to confuse people into buying it thinking it was Transformers.

The machines (TransFORMers) begin to close in on this location (terribly compared to Zion) and so they must engage (something like that of Starship Troopers).

The focus is on the humans though. The humans have to destroy the \\"invincible\\" robots. The Transmorphers are all apparently evil robots who for some reason made the sky dark and killed off 90% of all humanity.

I had never heard of the graphic novels, so I had no expectations. No Oscar nominations for the acting, but I thought the cast was well chosen and the performances were basically solid. When I realized Largo was going to be something of an action hero, I was initially skeptical of Sisley in the role...seemed a bit too pretty....but he carried it off very well. I thought the action scenes were exceptionally well done, and I'm not a particular fan of action scenes. I did think some parts of the plot were a bit predictable, but I wouldn't recommend investing any effort on trying to figure things out. The fun in this movie is just watching it happen, and who cares how it all comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed :(","review":"A story of an unlikely rebel inheriting a massive fortune and control over a mega corporation.

The preset EQ's are extremely handy because I listen to everything from talk radio to metal to rap.The issues I have with it are the manual gave little to no instructions on how to use the satellite radio, and the remote isn't spelled out very well for radio use. Also no carry case included for faceplate. I ended up buying one here on amazon which was inexpensive.Although I'm happy with it, I probably would go with the 4800 which adresses a lot of issues that others have had and it's around the same price as the 4700.

I couldn't believe the bad reviews given to it back in 1993. This was a very creative album. Idol was getting into this electronica sound long before the late 90s trend of it was getting onto it. And he succeeded on most levels, combining it with his guitar rock. The first song Wasteland is so funky as well as Shock to The System. The song Heroin is also solid. While his longtime songwriting and music partner Steve Stevens is missed on this album, Idol decided to move on and make this album. A few numbers are a little weird and don't fit with Billy's style. But the album is daring in its approach to its music and the landscapes it brings. As his new album hits stores this week on March 29th, this past album deserves far more respect than it's getting. This ranks right up there with his best '80s albums and 1990's Charmed Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyberpunk- Billy Idol","review":"This CD has been totally forgotten in a world of superficial lyrics. \\"Adam in Chains\\" is total genius by our bad boy Biily; he turned sorta soft for us to enjoy his beautiful Baritone voice.

Good thing I only paid $3 for this, because it sux! It's nothing like his other stuff, and it sounds like Matrix music that you find in clubs. I think Idol saw that the club music was about to get big, so he did this cd. If you are into this music, then you will like it. I on the otherhand luv classic punk/rock Idol, and this isnt it. Let me say again, that this cd is CLUB music, so unless you like that stay away. The songs aren't bad for club music, its just not the Idol stuff we've grown to love.

It actually is only 50 pounds. It is now being returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stroller","review":"I have really enjoyed using this stroller with my five month old daughter. She is comfortable in any position. This is a lightweight, easy to assemble product that I can fit in the trunk of my mid-sized car. There is no hand break and the straps could use more padding, but otherwise this is a really great buy. We take the stroller everywhere - trails, on the road, to the mall, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I have tried several different strollers, in fact I ordered 4 online and returned them all except this one. The front wheel swivels unless you lock it which I really liked. The only thing I don't like is the childs tray has to completely come off every time you take your child in or out. The wheels are very wide, and thick for excellent offroading. (I suggest buying green slim and filling the tires with that too) I am happy with this stroller, seems sturdy and has plenty of storage space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stroller.","review":"I really like this stroller and would recommend.I have a few complaints:1) it's a little bulky2) the basket is not very big2) my biggest complaint is that the tires are NOT sticker proof which could be a problem if you live in the country"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for the price","review":"I think this is a great stroller for the price. I run with my 2 year old 3 times a week in Prospect Park and it does us just fine. The seat does not sit all the way upright, but he still can see and look around well enough to call out everything he sees. If you're running, lock the front wheel and you may need to adjust it a bit to stop it from veering one way or another. The directions included are a bit vague and I found the trays useless, but that wasn't a deal breaker for us. It folds easily, but it's not all that compact when folded. This may not be as nice as some of the more expensive strollers, but for a dedicated jogging stroller, it's well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stroller!!!","review":"I really like this stroller. I haven't ever used any of the higher end strollers, so I can't compare it to those. When it came it took me about 5 minutes to have it together and figured out. Very user friendly! I did have to slime the tires cause on our first outing I had a gob of goat heads in the tires and they went flat. But that was not the strollers fault. Overall, this is a fantastic stroller! I also want to mention that I use it for a 3 year old and I do not have a problem with the recline. It seems fine for him when I pull the adjustment strap tight. Maybe if it were an infant it could be a problem, but for us it works awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After 1 month of Use","review":"Product Description - my comments* Reclining seat - Its really a lace that you can adjust yourself at any level* Extra thick padded seat- Its really not, as other recommend, I added my own padding* One hand fold - it still takes me both hands to fold.* Under seat storage basket - as others say, the basket looks as it will fall down. I really don't know why it is not re-enforced.* Rear parent storage pouch - although it might be the same size as a folder, it is also as thin as a folder. May be difficult for people with large hands.Overall, stroller is light to push/maneuver. If I could, I would: add a hand break, re-enforce storage basket, and a lid to the parents' tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Regrets","review":"I have owned this stroller for a few months now, and I am very pleased.

The stroller handles so well that my dog is able to walk right along side the stroller. Now our other dog Natty hates to walk, so we put her in the bottom basket with a small pillow, and off we go. The construction of this stroller is very sturdy. I hate the thought of my grandson out weighting the comfort of this stroller, it is good until 50lbs. he is now 34lbs. I would recommend this stroller and I do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE STROLLER","review":"I read all the reviews and decided to buy this stroller as I didnt want to spend too much money on it.

Would the violence be more justifiable to me if I knew and cared for these characters? No.A drunk driver hit and killed a woman. He did not, as far as I know from what the novelist has given us, deliberately murder her. This vacuous gaggle of women deliberately kidnap and skin another human being. The dead woman's daughter cheers her on.I was hoping these cold blooded women were caught and stopped from their serial crime spree.The characters are so artificial and banal. The women are not interesting. There is no build up of tension and the criminals get away in the end.If you care about young minds don't let them read this type of tripe. Strong women are not psychos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok...Gettin A Bit Stupid...","review":"I have been enjoying this series by Fern Michaels about the vigilante sisterhood because they are entertaining one day reads, despite the annoying Jack that keeps popping up. This one, however, the third in the Sisterhood, is rather stupid. Myra Rutledge, the money behind the gal group finally gets her name chosen out of the shoebox and can avenge her daughter's death. I found the whole story, 3 women secretly entering China, kidnapping the bad guy, whisking him off to America and basically beating the tar out of him, and then dumping him in England and never getting caught rather far fetched. Meanwhile, the annoying Jack keeps popping up breaking and entering and violating about 5000 laws himself. (At this point, who is this guy to judge?) Give me a break! The girls are starting to grow on me however, so I will read one more. This series gets one more shot with me and if the fourth is not better, I will not waste any more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Someone had hit and killed Maya's daughter as she was crossing the street. For revenge, Maya and her friends capture him, imprison him and cane him until he is disfigured.This is sick.

The idea that being a vigilante is attractive and fun is so vulgar. These are \\"supposedly\\" intelligent women who think it is okay to inflict pain and take the law into their own hands while the heiress just eases the pain of her daughter's death by buying them and having fun at the pain of other people. While the language is simple, the gist of the story is purely evil. My recommendation is don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and Sick","review":"I've read many of Fern Michaels' books and have enjoyed all of them.

The theory behind the Sisterhood is great, righting the wrongs that have been committed against victimized women, but the methods in which these women seek their justice (if it can be called that) is appalling! The things that they do, in my opinion, make them just as bad as the men and women they are punishing. Any reader with a heart is not going to identify with a single character in these novels. Terrible things have been done to the women, but the brutal ways they handle the people responsible definitely made any sympathy I had vanish before I even finished reading the book. I have read the first three books in this series, trying to give them a fair chance, but I think I will stop there as each book has been more disappointing than the previous one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closure","review":"For Myra Ruthledge, the hit-and-run death of her beloved daughter and her unborn child is the reason she formed The Sisterhood and put her immense fortune at their disposal. For seven years she has waited and now, it is her turn to execute retaliation on the man who took from her the child she loved.Unable to take part in the early stages of her own revenge, aristocratic Myra takes to the road riding shot-gun in an 18-wheeler for Kathryn Lucas. This is one of the absurdly funny sequences that prevents Fern Michaels', \\"Vendetta\\" from being a parody of revenge. The little things keep this series moving as there is very little one can do, short of murder, to extract the vendetta these determine women desire.Nash Black, author of \\"Qualifying Laps\\" and \\"Taxes, Stumbling Blocks & Pitfalls for Authors 2007.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse book of the series","review":"Myra worked the nerves in this book. The love scenes between her and Charles were ridiculous and took up too much of the book. Otherwise, is just wasn't as good as the others.

He and his friends keep the series lively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book of the Sisterhood Series.","review":"I have been enjoying reading the series and was upset that I couldn't get it at the local library.

This third entry in the revenge series allows Myra to exact her pound of flesh (literally) from the b*stard who took her pregnant daughter's life. The actual incident when punishment is exacted is very short so there is not a lot of anguish -- the leading up to and aftermath are most interesting though.

We then swapped the plugs back to the original plugs that had been in my car for 10 years and the car ran perfectly. We then put in two plugs at a time and neither set worked - but didn't actually make the check engine light come on. Again back to the original plugs and the car ran great.I then called the manufacturer and received some of the worst customer service ever. They will only let you leave a message and when they finally call you back - get this - you are supposed to pay to ship the items back and if they test them and the plugs do not meet their quality standards - then they will send you the amount for the plugs.

Instead of expressing grace and subtlety, they plow through the trios with no sensitivity to nuance, character, or color. Terribly disappointed with the pianist who should have taken time to thoroughly work out the technique and think through the phrasing to capture the Mozartian grace. He sometimes captures a boyish charm and spirit, but I expected so much more from such a respected musician. The violinist is interesting in her approach, but her tone is edgy at times. The cellist does no harm-- but then again, the cello part is not prominent.If you would like to hear some beautiful Mozart trios, try Maria Pires, Dumay, and Wang."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Political Tract","review":"On the face of it an adventure story.

Maybe it took the visuals to make him start counting. We are proud parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC & 123","review":"Ok here it is. I'll admit that I bought meet the letters, numbers and shapes DVD's at a garage sale. We started watching the letters and numbers DVD's 2 days before my son turned 18 months. He is now just a week shy of turning 19 months and recognizes all letters (upper and lower case) of the alphabet and numbers 1 through 10. We try to get in 1 viewing of the letters and numbers every day (in the car or during breakfast). Some of the reviews here mention catchy words like \\"brain washing\\" and \\"insanity\\". I agree that these videos are repetitive. The videos hold the attention of my 18 month old and it allows him time to interact with the video. Lets not forget that repetition is the mother of all learning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet the Numbers is amazing!","review":"These Preschool Prep Series videos are truly amazing!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is a potentially beneficial product for the 2 and under set. My son who is 3 and a half found the video to be boring. He did sit through the first viewing, but has not since requested to view it again. My 9 month old did stare intently at the screen...so maybe all is not loss. We shall see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"I began showing my son this video when he was about 9 months old and at first he wasn't that interested. But he is now 10 and a half months old and he absolutely loves, loves. loves it. As soon as I turn it on and he hears the music his face lights up like a Christmas tree!!! And since it is actually teaching him something, I don't feel so bad about him watching T.V. He'll usually watch for about 30 min. and this gives me time to do some cleaning around the house or to just rest for a bit and so it is a win/win!!! We also have the meet the letters dvd and my son loves that one too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tape you can listen to and laugh to over and over again!","review":"My sister gave me this tape for my children and we have enjoyed it so much. The first time it was funny, the second time we understood it more and laughed more, the third time we laughed more and now we immitate the characters and make jokes about the humorous perspectives. I would highly recommend this tape. My children (ages 5 and 7) love listening to this tape before bedtime (and I enjoy it too).There's the story of Micheal the grasshopper with O'Callahan's great voice and the story of the Red Ball about a little girl and how she comes into her own in elementary school. There are also lots of other short stories each unique in their message and their style. The way O'Callahan tells the stories makes us want to listen - they sound exciting, but the stories themselves are so rich in imagination and imagery. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Entertainment for all Ages","review":"Jay O'callahan tells a story like no one else! My own children were introduced to this nationally known storyteller at the National Storytelling Convention in Tennessee and have loved him ever since.

Even songs like \\"Sugar Rush\\" and \\"Disco for a Ride\\" are slowed down to a depressing crawl, as are all the songs. I allow Ronnie a few sad songs, that is part of this great band. But I don't think any suicidal patient should ever be left with this album, \\"Five Stars for Failure\\" and a set of razor blades.Even that isn't such a bad thing if he didn't need to make every song sound like each other.

It is being narrated by a disinterested observer, and there is no guts to it. \\"The old poachers have had a slow night....\\" Now let me EXPERIENCE what the poachers are feeling and seeing.

It has a lot of action, pretty woman without their tops on, and a lot of cheesetastic dialogue. The captain is especially hilarious, and with only three scenes, I definitely wish he would have had more screen time. No, Samurai Cop isn't a great movie. Some of the action sequences are poorly directed and choreographed, and the movie does sometimes invite yawns. The scenes with the samurai cop and his girlfriend just hanging out, for example, kind of slow the film down. Still, Samurai Cop is a mostly fast-paced action-comedy that's cheaper than most action-comedies, but also more fun than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samurai Cop","review":"Sure to be a cult classic here in the states as it was in Europe. There's plenty of action and full breasted babes in action to keep you interested when the dialogue gets you laughing. Not to mention a mullet here or there. So, your best bet may be to watch it with the Joe Bob Briggs commentary track. A group of friends and I watched it together and Joe Bob's comments had us laughing our asses off. I guess there's no chance for a sequel since most of the cool characters die by hara-kiri, beheading, death by sword, fire or get shot off a roof. But our hero and his partner could always return..if there not in convalescent home by now.

It heats up my food and it doesn't break."},{"rating":"2","title":"The little microwave that could","review":"I got an excellent deal on this microwave.

I wouldn't buy this brand of microwave again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Westinghouse Microwave","review":"It's a small, but kind of nice little microwave, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that my old one had, can't set or cook in the microwave with the timer going, and can't set multi-levels of cooking, but you can change the power level while it's going if you have set it for say, 30% power, you can change it while it's still going. It's just a simple, all together microwave. Surprisingly, it does heat up better then I thought for the lower power it has. And for some reason, I have to keep setting the digital clock on there, it keeps loosing time, but that's not a real importance in the cooking feature of it.Overall, it's a pretty nice little microwave, but don't expect it to do what a higher wattage or larger oven would do, it does take a bit longer to heat things up, but overall, I kind of like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick delivery and great product","review":"I was looking for a cheap microwave to get me through a year in the dorms and amazon had a great one that shipped for free.

Very small 'font' versus nice big letters from Oregon Scientific projection clocks.Also, the projection alternates -- slowly -- between time and outside temperature. Very frustrating to wake in the middle of the night, quickly glance-up to see what time it is, but having to WAIT for the projector to cycle back to time display. You can turn-off the external temp display (only do time), but that's the whole point of the product -- right?I love gadgets, but in the end this one falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This weather station is a solid workhorse. It has all the features I wanted and the projection feature is a nice touch as I use it when I go out to work in the dark since my wife is still asleep. The atomic clock works as promised. The temperature is accurate with my regular thermometer and I really like the humidity feature. My only problem is that it was hard to set and the it seems to indicate weather forecast changes that don't actually happen. I have adjusted the sensitivity to the changes but it has not helped. I like the weather boy who shows me how much to bundle up before I go out. That feature does seem accurate. Overall I would recommend it but again it is difficult to set at first but you should not have to fool with that again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"We love this clock and weather station it works great and the projection is nice to ne able to see the time and temp when its dark in the bedroom. Only reason for 4 stars is I wish the buttons were a little easier to use for setting the time and alarms.... they can be a little bit confusing cuz the buttons do multiple things and the hour is on one side and the minute is on the other side, instead of right above each other like most clocks are set up, not too big of a deal cuz the clock never needs set just the alarms. Overall I would recommend this to someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Love this product. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the oscar outlook is inaccurate. I still, however, recommend this product because of all of the other features it provides - dual alarms, temperature highs and lows with the highest and lowest recorded with a date stamp, the time stays projected on the ceiling all night and is readable without my contacts/glasses. Despite oscar's outlook not being accurate, we enjoy his weather outfits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this clock!","review":"Until recently I had the little brother to this unit and really loved it. My needs recently changed and I wanted to be able to view the clock at night without having to reach over and tap a button. I chose this unit because it projects the time and outside temperature on the ceiling so all I have to do is look up and see the time.It gives a fairly accurate forecast depicted by Oscar Outlook (the little man in the display). Oscar will dress according to the weather conditions to give you an idea of what to expect. I've found that the forecast is about 90% accurate!The clock sets itself via radio waves from the atomic clock in Boulder, CO. It is very accurate and I never have to worry about setting it.Overall I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and I would do it all over again if I had to."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it seems too good to be true.....","review":"Just received this today, and am immediately sticking it back in the box and returning it.

If you're wondering how I know that THIS is the device that's off, I have two other little sensors I can move around easily. When I place all three in one location, guess which two read exactly the same, and which one is WAAAAAAy off?To make matters worse, it is utterly impossible to reach LaCrosse tech support, or even leave a message.

This film is better than three stars, but not really a four. Fans of pulpy film noir will recognize many of the elements which make those movies what they are - down and out characters, seedy atmosphere, a murder . . . The story here is pretty average and not terribly compelling, and the plot twist at the end feels a little far-fetched. But what makes the movie watchable is the acting and dialogue. The best moments are the conversations between Eric Stanton -the drifter who wanders into a seaside town and winds up getting torn between the town's femme fatale diner waitress and one of its virginal well-off spinsters - and Stella, the head-strong waitress. Very watchable, but not unique enough to stand out very far from the pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good, well written movie --a class act","review":"I wanted a good classic movie from the 40's--I am in awe of the 30s and 40s era movies.

As an avid fan of historical romance, I am used to reading mindless, soulless trash, like that from Harlequin. This book, however, is something different! The author took time to develop the characters as seperate people, not just as a couple. Real development, too, not just a pitiful attempt at characterization.The land itself, the setting, seems to leap out at you, not just as a backdrop, but almost as an identifible character, too.Read this book before any Harlequin trash! It's a wonderful, beautiful story. Admittidely, it has it's racy parts- but the sex doesn't distract from the real story. To call it a romance might even be wrong- because it's more than that, just as the movie 'Rob Roy' was more than a romance.

Patricia Barber has perfect timing and what is more, she has a terrific sense of humor. In \\"If This isn't Jazz\\" it is displayed with intelligence, not only in the words but especially in the use of the instruments (the hauling guitar) and when she sings: \\"if the real thing is coming along\\" she's telling the truth.As pointed out by my predecessors the sound quality is superb, listen to \\"The Beat Goes On\\" and hear the public in the background clapping to the rhythm. The rhythm section is best judged by listening to \\"Black Magic Woman\\", it leaves the Santana performance far behind.

Some on the weapons that LaManna created are almost believable. However, the Trans-Altain Alliance villains are unbelievable as are some of the action scenes.

I read the discription on the back of the book and was instantly interested ( being a huge spike fan ) and bought it. but I was very disapointed, the whole thing is just flash backs that come directly from the show and the autor didnt add anything.

It relies almost completely on the dialogue and plots of Buffy, without adding anything new. In addition, the story jumps all over the place moving back and forth through time in a confusing jumble (even for a fan that knows the show and the episodes like the back of my hand). Finally, the line that really got my goat is a direct quote from season seven, where the first evil is talking through Warren and says, \\"sugar and spice and everything...useless unless you're bacon.\\" Bacon?

Like what he thinks of Cordelia's insults and trying to capture Joyce while Buffy is at the fratenity party in \\"Reptile Boy.\\" Some scenes continued like for instance in \\"School Hard,\\" the scene ends with Spike asking if the Slayer is tough but in the book it continues. You see the past with Angelus, Drusilla and Darla. More on the two Slayers he killed. About the Nazi Germany thing, before he comes to Sunnydale, when he first gets to Sunnydale, when he is in Sunnydale and more of The First talking to him in the basement.

Go pick this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book... but kinda lacking","review":"I <3 the character of Spike so just the cover gets you into it. Overall this was a great book. It gives a lot of information on Spike's background and past life. I love how it goes into different times, but also it's a bit jumpy. It is constantly switching between years and unless you know a lot about the episodes it can be kind of confusing. Also I was kind of expecting something better, like more of a story, not history. I thought that there was going to be more added to the episodes. Other than that it's a great book for Spike fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Spike, but not this","review":"I LOVE Spike. But I did not love this book. There was nothing new in it. There was only recap after recap of all the major episodes Spike was in.

This book, however, is pretty much just a recap of everything known from the show. The only really original part is how Spike ended up on the Nazi submarine. Otherwise, the author rambled on about Spike's origins and repeated unoriginal themes from the show. And, personally, I did not appreciate her using Spike's supposed involvement in the other Buffy story lines (such as those about Machida and Ampata, the mummy) to fill her pages. He was not in those stories, don't bring him in now just to take up space. I have great reverence for books and can count the number of times in my life that I have destroyed a book on purpose -- this will be number 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Bon Jovi","review":"If you like the band such as BON JOVI, you won't disappointed to combine this album in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrorscope","review":"This is a cd worth your money, its as good if not better than their first cd. the sound is for the most part the same (so thats good)you must get this cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their first","review":"Without a doubt, the premiere release from Eve6 back in 1998 was a much better album that kept your head bumpin' and had you singing along.

This isn��t punk. This is nice processed pop, sorry, but its true. And yet��there are a couple of good songs. ��Here��s to the night�� would be my favorite. Most likely because I can relate to it, and it truly is a moving song. Amphetamines is like the only punk song on the album and it is good. The rest is��blah blah��.

Almost every song had the potential to climb the charts. This CD went in my top 10 case with my beatles, led zeppelin, grateful dead, and GnR albums. Definetly the best album I've bought in the past five years, and I NEVER saw it coming. Everyone I know agrees with me. Go get it and I guarantee you, you will be pleasantly suprised.

If you buy it, go to track 11 and you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Punk","review":"Though definitely leaning on the \\"pop\\" of the term \\"pop punk,\\" Eve 6 is perhaps one of the wittiest and best-educated bands in rock & roll today. Deft-spoken linguist Max Collins steps fresh off of the success of the band's radio-friendly first release to produce an even greater collection of ear candy complete with Eve 6's patented tongue-twisting lyrical stylings. From the frank honesty and tongue-in-cheek wit of \\"Promise\\" to the nearly frantic urgency of \\"Enemy,\\" the album unravels and keeps you listening close to the lyrics so the tunes can be as amusing as they are engrossing. While definitely not my general taste in music, Eve 6 is just one of those bands you can't help but listen to, and come away from feeling smarter for the time you spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad song on the CD","review":"The new CD from Eve 6 is in one word...AWESOME! Its one of those where you can just listen from beginning to end without skipping one song. I still have my favorites (Rescue, Amphetamines, Nocturnal, On the Roof Again) but all the songs are GREAT.

The first album really worked and sounded great, but this just plain stinks.2 stars for Here's To The Night - the one listenable song on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here is some pop rock.","review":"It's kind of sad that a band thinks horrorscope is a funny pun. Eve6 doesnt really bring anything new to rock, but it's one of those things that really doesn't get out of your head.

Then it poops all over the house and you get sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I know you hear this on CD's all the time that people like, but this one is one of the best. It is the best made by Eve6, no doubt. The songs flow together quite nicely, and having track number 5, \\"Here's to the Night\\" in the mix, it takes the cake. I think the entire CD revovles around track 5, my personal favorite. Everyone has had one of those nights of which they remember for forever, but sometimes forget them in all the hussel. Mixing this song in the middle of the hatred venting going on in some of the other songs, \\"Sunset Strip Bi***\\", takes you back to the time that you need to remember, to the one time where nothing comes in your way. \\"Here's to the Night\\" makes the CD, the other songs compliment it nicely however."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was THAT!?","review":"Anyone who has heard Eve 6's fist CD will agree with me that the vocaling is strong. They sacrifice the attention in Horrorscope for more focus on their not quite up to par guitar skills.

Its lyrics are well written and the song can be related to many events in anyone's life. There are always the times we felt alive, and the tears you knew you'd cry...and tomorrow always does come too soon. It can speak the words you can never seem to say, and can communicate feelings better than just talking. If you really listen to the lyrics, there is a sad note to the song, but the song really sums up the times in life that we find hard to express. Everyone can relate, and if for nothing else, buy the CD simply for song five, \\"Here's to the Night.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price","review":"There's only 50 puzzles on the CD, so that is disappointing considering the price you pay.

It's hard to imagine that a grown man who fed rat poison to an inconvenient party functionary, threw a lover off the top of the House of Commons, and car bombed up another in front of her husband, would be tortured for a second by having killed a boy in (Cyprus civil) wartime.

If you are looking for an architectural ethics that will help you think about how the built landscape contributes to social justice or impedes it, how structures interact with their builders and occupiers, how buildings may be dangerous or protective, this is not the right book to read.

Back in the day, these programs had the best ensemble cast, storylines that didn't always have a popular resolution at the end of 22 minutes but great theme songs, openings and epilogues and some even presented the name of the particular episode. Every season of this series is a treasure and this one (season 3) is no exception. Carefully and beautifully packaged and sprinkled with extras, it makes me smile seeing Donald Hollinger, Mr. Marie and the rest of the regulars and semi-regulars and of course, who could ever forget Ann Marie's awesome wardrobe. Perhaps one of the future extras will reveal how she managed to look so fashionably trendy on waitressing and other quirky jobs in NYC.

It pulled strongly to the left and was impossible to use as a walking stroller so jogging was out of the question.

Well...guess what. That is simply not the case all the time. Maybe if I had the sense to start my divorce several years earlier, it would have been possible to utilize the very sensible advice in this book. Unfortunately, this advice was of no practical benefit in my situation and no amount of understanding or common sense on my part would have changed the situation.Good luck to anyone in this situation.

I was misled into believing that on THIS topic, at least, Sennett would be more clear and easier to understand than in those previous books of his which I've read and found highly incomprehensible. His case studies are sketchy, his conclusions are cliched, and his ultimate point is lost in obscurity. Instead, try reading Barbara Rudolph's \\"Disconnected\\" for a more personal, accessible look at the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly, more true now than ever.","review":"Sennett's evocation of the nature of work in postmodern capitalism is spot-on in recognizing and explaining the alienating factors at play in a de-centered, job-based not career-based working world. In fact the book, a long essay, was in places hard to read because he evoked some memories of my own encounters with this world. It was harder to read also knowing that the research and the ideas driving the work were in place during the time of writing. Much has changed in ways that only amplify the alienation felt by workers. If, as Sennett claims, that the breakdown of the corporate structure is bad news psychologically for the worker -- where there is no clear antagonist in the workplace -- then the alienation is exponentially more evident in a world with ten percent unemployment. This essay was true when he was writing and the US economy was creating over a million jobs a year. The issues he explores are only more true now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanistic insight into the changed world of work","review":"This is a highly readable book, informed by academic insights but not over scholarly. Its merit is that it makes you think-particularly by the chapter segmentations. Its scope is wide for a small book-employment,the nature of jobs, the career..Throughout Sennett provides a powerful counterblast to the rhetoricians of the right and also demonstrates the indifference of big business and politicians. His perspective on the Davos summits is beautifully written and acute. While respecting the advice of another reviewer concerning Hezenberg et al, I do not believe the books should be compared. 'New Rules' is a book largely about employment and does not attempt to assess matters of meaning and identity at work. Sennett does this admirably. I think his target audience is the layperson not the academic and reading this book can be a rewarding experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melancholy cliches; no practical solutions","review":"Even Richard Sennett can't avoid every cliche of the downsizing literature: the father who toiled at honest, meaningful janitor's work; the successful symbolic analyst son filled with insecurity; the bakers who watch machines and \\"don't know how to make bread.\\" The psychological insights come from a sample of two (no kidding): the owner of the bar where Sennett used to drink, and a guy he sat next to on an airplane. And there are no positive or practical solutions to be had. For that, readers can go to Stephen Herzenberg, John Alic, & Howard Wial, New Rules for a New Economy: Employment and Opportunity in Postindustrial America (1998)--and skip Sennett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow vibes","review":"A lovely album of acoustic guitars and sweet, haunted voices.

I give two stars only for dear Olivia - love you darling - and the music of ELO.Xanadu The Broadway Musical circa 2007 is a complete turn around and I suggest waiting for that soundtrack, even if you can't get to see the show.

If you like this one, checkout Grease 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olivia Newton John at her best","review":"I have read some of the reviews, and clearly the people writing them are totally disenchanted folks. This is the feel good movie of the year. It stars two down and relatively out men who make good after a visit from a muse. They then go on to create what has to be the very best designed roller skating venue I have ever seen. I intend to actually pattern a business for video games after it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xanadu is excellent","review":"I remember watching this movie originally. It has all the things a teenager needs to enjoy a movie, great music, beautiful people, and most important, it is a tale with a happy ending. The guy does get the girl, and things do go right. There is already too much misery in the world. A lot of these so called reviewers seem to forget that movies were not supposed to be reality. They were supposed to pick your spirits up, bring them down, and get you to feel some emotion. This world is already at a point where nobody wants to feel anything, I say forget the impossible, enjoy the fantastic, and let the disbelief stay where it belongs, in real life. Your kids will love this, and if you can spend 90 minutes trying to be a kid, you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny flick","review":"You know, I remember going to see this movie when I was a teenager and thinking it was a little corny, but I loved ONJ (and still do) so I endured it. My sister, who also remembers seeing it only as a younger kid, wanted this for christmas, so I ordered it. This set is great because it included the movie soundtrack as a bonus. I love ELO, too, so I really prefer the music to the film. Great chick flick, and you can't really explain to yourself why you like watching it, but you can't help yourself. It doesn't hurt that Gene Kelly also starred. But I think this role was a dive for him as a Golden age actor, dancer, singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should just buy the Xanadu CD...","review":"I bought the DVD because I remembered how much I liked the movie when it first came out. I sat through an entire showing on my home theater wondering what I could have been thinking. The movie is almost unwatchable. The story between the musical numbers is slow and plodding. The acting by Michael Beck is terrible. The direction is amateurish. It's really sad because the music in Xanadu is fantastic. But, even the terrific music can't save this mess.Love ya, ONJ! ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad it's just plain Bad","review":"Please! Anyone who says that this movie is so bad that it's good is out of their mind. I really like Olivia Newton John, ELO, and certainly Gene Kelly. But just mixing them together doesn't magically make something worth watching. The story was painfully tedious to endure! I recently made the mistake of renting it, due to misplaced nostalgia. Please don't make the same mistake as me.If you must see it then you should illegally download it; the makers of this move should not be entitled to make another cent off it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Neon Lights Won't Shine For This Bomb","review":"I love Olivia Newton-John, and I think she is beautiful, but this movie is really awful. This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. This movie doesn't even make any sense. I don't understand how this piece of garbage even got made. Nothing blends together in this movie. I don't understand why an animated piece by Don Blueth appears out of nowhere, and it just shows that this movie makes absolutely no sense. The ending is horrible, and don't even waste your time watching this movie. I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst film ever made...","review":"I have to disagree with the other reviews available here.This is without a doubt the worst film that I have ever seen in my entire life. If there was an option to give a film no star at all, this would be it.Xanadu is a film which manages to combine Greek mythology with roller disco, Olivia Newton John with Gene Kelly. It is a film of considerable production values with absolutely zero artistic merit. In short: everything a film should not be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kitsch classic","review":"In the world of kitsch films, there are good-bad and bad-bad music-focused movies. ... Good-bad is \\"Xanadu,\\" a film which -- though reviled at the time of its debut, and vilified for daring to put Gene Kelly on roller skates and second-bill him to a two-bit twentysomething Australian singer-actress -- has transmogrified into my second-best guilty pleasure of all time (\\"Showgirls\\" is still first). Be forewarned: your Kitsch Appreciation Sensors will have to be at maximum to appreciate this film and overlook its gargantuan flaws, particularly a complete lack of acting ability on the part of Michael Beck. It also helps to be a fan of ELO and Olivia Newton-John music. This movie isn't for everyone -- you might want to rent it first before buying it here to make sure you like it -- but I consider it to be a true kitsch classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music But.....","review":"... In what started out to be a promising film turned into one of the worst disasters ever put to celluloid.It's the result of too many cooks in the kitchen, or too many ingredients in the pot. To top it off, Xanadu's script is perhaps the most ... ever written.At least the music is terrific. The visuals sometimes measure up to the music but not too often. The best sequence is Don Bluth's animation in 'Don't Walk Away' which makes the rest of the picture look really bad.If you're looking to take a nap, this is the film for you!Try to forget about the bad acting, mediocre writing, ... choreography and non existent direction. Better yet, buy the CD and forget about this turkey all together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie looks and sounds great/cd content dissapointing","review":"The movie looks great...the video has been re-mastered. The 5.1 surround sound is also a great improvement over the original release. If you like or love this movie..I highly reccommend this.As for the so called \\"complete soundtrack\\"... the word complete had me hoping for additional songs such as \\"You Made Me Love You\\" and \\"Fool/Country\\" by the incredibly talented Olivia Newton-John.The making of extra was nice and informative..I just wish Olvia would have participated."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Romantics & Dreamers Only","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out, with someone I loved. Therefore, it has more meaning for me. Nevertheless, it is a marvelous movie, if somewhat dated by today's standards.This is a movie for those who love Fred Astaire musicals, beautiful costuming, Greek myths and fantasy.Stay away if you prefer gritty, down-to-earth realism - this movie is NOT for you. There are no gratuitous sex scenes, no blood/murder, no bedraggled druggies. It is a movie you can watch with young children and grandmothers who fondly remember Van Johnson 'war' movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie, good picture and sound","review":"I fall in love with Olivia all over again every time I watch this movie. She is astoundingly beautiful in her Golden Goddess costume during her entrance in the last scene of the finale.Gene Kelly never lost the magic. He could still float across a room like he was dancing on a cloud.One complaint: the image is too large and too cropped. It's most evident and most annoying in the overhead finale shots when the top and bottom of the turntable are cut off. I compared the same frame side-by-side with an HD broadcast image, and it is in this reproduction, not the original movie.But overall, a fun movie with good picture and sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Checking out old movies","review":"I watched this movie on cable when I was a child when HBO was not 24 hours a day.

Don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable...If you like this movie you are brain dead...","review":"I can not believe what I tried to watch. It was UNBEARABLE...My television broke due to the terrible scenes and music in this movie. I have nightmares of people singing disco on roller skates. This movie should not be shown to children under the age of 12. In fact nobody should watch this movie because it would be considered cruel and unusual punishment.If I can't erase these memories from my mind, I will have to go to the hospital that they send people to in Clockwork Orange, or just simply kill myself....Save yoursef, don't watch this movie..oh by the way, did I tell you it was a bad movie.Your buddy,BOB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still don't have it","review":"I ordered this DVD on May 25 along with an item from another seller.

I contacted the seller who told me it could take up to 6 weeks to arrive and to contact again if I hadn't received it by June 29.

And Gene Kelly radiates his always-warm personna in one of his last films. ELOs music is fun, and ONJ adds a few #1 hits. But c'mon folks....this is pure dreck. There is no story that can actually be followed or dialect that even remotely resembles what real humans say to one another. The sets are [non-elaborate], the costumes post-Disco rags, and the dancing....well, there's dancing I suppose. Xanadu fails to deliver on ONJ's promise as a musical actress, and does not hold up well over time. Buy the album....skip the flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"I had already bought the original XANADU on DVD and I also had the original soundtrack, as well. When I saw that the DVD was going to include a complete Soundtrack from the movie I thought, finally, the complete soundtrack is being released. Wrong. The Complete Xanadu number is the same as the one on the original. Just the song Xanadu. There were several numbers by Olivia Newton-John in the movie right before the Xanadu number. The box itself states that the Cd is the full complete soundtrack from the movie. But we were misled again. I don't understand why these companies do this. You know later on they will release it again with the complete soundtrack and then we will have to pay for it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice movie and c.d.","review":"I purchased this for my wife, as she loves musicals and this was one of her favorites as a young girl. The addition of the c.d. with the soundtrack was a nice bonus and cost nothing more than the d.v.d. Would have liked to have had a sleeve for the c.d. outside of the d.v.d. packaging but as it ended up on the i-pod almost immediately it didn't matter much. If you like Olivia, than this will surely please as the excellent music (the best music ELO ever made) and sexy little dress she wears throughout make up for the cheesy storyline and writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xanadu & ELO rocks","review":"This is one of the silliest, best films ever made. I'm so glad to be able to add my name to the chorus of those hold this film in a special place in their heart. I'll agree too that this movie is not on the top of anybody's \\"best\\" list. But, Xanadu moves, has lots of color, peculiar style, and the music is phenomenal. I can't wait to watch it on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD makes it really worth watching again.","review":"I own a VHS, LaserDisc, and now a DVD copy of this movie. As you can tell I'm a bit biased in that I was fascinated by it when I first saw it in a theater. I was really disapointed when none of the previous formats provided a wide screen view. The opening dance sequence is short changed in any other format as are several other sequences. I loved the music and the dancing. It is definitely a surprise among most films. No violence, few if any harsh words, no drugs, and no sex (however some of the costumes we a bit eye catching but hardly push todays standards). I really think the movie makes it's point in not giving up on ones dreams and that romance can happen in the strangest of circumstances. Then of course there is Olivia who can light up a room just by smiling. It is a movie very much worth seeing just for the fun of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"gene kelly,olvia newton-john","review":"I saw this movie years ago and loved it.

I read all the reviews and most of them are postivie, but some of them. Have you actually seen Xanadu?! This is almost the best movie ever. The dvd version is alot better than the tape though. Cause the video is clean and the sound is awsome. I spent a whole summer watching this movie and I'm watching it as I type this. It brings back alot of memories. It's a great movie if you like musicals and proably the last great musical to come out of Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"To quote an old review: \\"Xanadon't...\\"","review":"Wow. I couldn't sit through this movie in one sitting. It was that bad, and this is coming from a guy who typically loves bad movies.

It went beyond corny and simply became just a film made with bad taste. Since the movie and the plot were so bad, I was at least hoping that since this was a musical, the musicical performances would have been impressive (considering the very talented Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly were teamed up together). However even the musical performances couldn't revive this movie. The songs sounded like they came straight out of a Hollywood studio's recycling bin.

I tried it on a HD TV with a quality sound output, A computer with an advanced sound system and an HD DVD Player hooked up to a high quality sound system. Yuck. My recording onto cassette from the original tape version of the movie was better than the sound coming out of this DVD. Bad balances, distortion, you name it. Highly disappointed. Let's face it, Olivia is nice to look at and the concept is fun and different but the music makes the movie and without the sound having decent quality it might as well be a silent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xanadu","review":"Here's a real oldie that was a great Christmas \\"gag\\" gift. Crappy movie (not the DVD, but the movie itself) but great ELO soundtrack that brought back lots of memories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"I remember watching and loving Xanadu as a kid, but watching it now at 29, all I can say is that this is one strange movie. Nothing in it makes sense -- the protagonist (Michael Beck) is a lazy artist who falls for a muse (Olivia Newton-John) who is sent to him for inspiration or some silly reason that the movie never makes clear, except to give them musical montages featuring \\"Magic\\", Olivia's big hit at the time. Actually that is the real reason for the movie's existence: the music, and admittedly, the music is very good.Along with the music, the film does have some interesting aspects including the roller disco scenes. They are well-choreographed even if they are tacky. And the movie's fashions and hairstyles (shot in '79/'80) are a curious hybrid of late 70s culture and 80s fashions/trends and to the film's credit, it eerily predicts the fashions/trends of the 80s (much of what is seen onscreen would be popular in just a few years -- 1983/84)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets Skate!","review":"This is my favorite DVD.

It's another of my favorites for when I want some silly uplifting. As a kid I loved this one, and I still do. It's another one you can watch with kids around. No worries about language or improper scenes, this is a film that relies on whit and humor, singing and dancing. It's s good pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essence of life","review":"Michael Beck's acting is a little mechanical, other than that it is pure positivism.

Great musical movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Fun!","review":"20 years after this film first came out and it still has it's magic!And on DVD it's even more fun to watch! Because now you can just jump to all your favorite scenes, namely the singing and dance parts. Of course the acting and storyline in this film aren't the greatest, but this film was never trying to be a Gone With the Wind, or Star Wars. It's purly a fantasy fun excape film and on that level it truly succeeds!Hearing the songs will make you feel happy. There aren't too many films you can watch over and over again, but this is one of them, You'll find yourself watching it so much you'll soon learn the songs by heart!And the sets and costumes are so much fun to see, I always wanted to wear those outfits worn by the muses. :-)So check out this movie today, you'll think it's 1980 all over again, and be glad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redefines the genre or something","review":"Xanadu is truly one of the best-worst films of all time.

Olivia of course is great, Gene Kelly is amazing and the roller skating scenes are fun to watch. Now it is a broadway show, so before you go to New York, see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing because Olivia is so much better than this awful script","review":"\\"Xanadu\\" can't seem to decide if it wants to be a roller-disco movie, a dance flick, a musical, or just a vehicle for Olivia Newton-John, who is a much better actress than this lousy script allowed. And WHAT??? is Gene Kelly doing in this movie? Was he broke?The music is good, and the storyline could have been - a Muse, one of the daughters of Zeus, comes back to inspire great looking young man with a dream - but bad dialogue and some just plain dumb production numbers (roller skaters dancing and chanting \\"Xanadu\\" over and over - what is that about?) spoil it. Olivia has proven herself a capable actress, and of course her vocals are superb, and all that adds up to Completely Wasted On This Movie. Ick. Two stars, and those only for the great soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie with a great soundtrack!","review":"While the movie isn't the best one ever made, Olivia Newton-John does a fine job. The movie is severely dated in the 80's with the roller-skating theme, but the special effects are well done. ELO does a superb job with the soundtrack and Gene Kelly does a fine performance on his limited exposure. On the soundtrac, Gene & ELO blend harmoniously with his Big Bad-era orchestral music mixing perfectly with ELO's 80's rock band guitar-heavy riffs. If you grew up in the 70's and 80's, you'll love the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLIVIA SHINES IN XANADU!!","review":"XANADU WAS THE PERFECT SHOWCASE FOR THE TALENTS OF THE LOVELY OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN.

I thought it would be funny. And it was. But it was also surprisingly sweet and enjoyable. I could trash it for a pasted together story and some silly dialogue, but in the end, it wasn't trying to be much more than a bit of entertainment.Certainly, it's dated a bit. But that's just part of its charm. Strangely the 40s stuff is less dated than the 80s references. Odd when you consider how much closer we are to the eighties. And there is one sequence in particular (the big band/ rock band melding) that goes on just too long. But other than that, I can't say anything bad about it.Gene Kelly is terrific and Olivia Newton John comes across as likable and ethereal. There's some really oddball sequences here, and one really cool Don Bluth animated scene that is completely superfluous and completely enchanting.It won me over. Damn it, it won me over.

I only wish it had been twice as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting. You can't put it down.","review":"It's impossible to fail to recommend \\"The Longest Day\\" by Cornelius Ryan. It makes makes all of the uncertainties of war vivid and, in describing what would ultimately be a decisive victory, it shows the real (and tragic) results of errors in judgement, planning, and analysis (\\"Eisenhower 'lied' us into war,\\" they'd say...). Most importantly, it shows a fighting spirit in the American and British military man that is unconquerable.It is motivating, sobering, humbling, and a superb reminder of the greatness that we are capable of when our leadership is as resolved as our soldiers and when we are willing to cast ourselves into the midst of uncertainty with the intent of creating certainty in its place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling and inspiring","review":"Although I like reading histories--they are usually social history and NEVER military history. I don't watch war movies. I read Jane Austen. I could not put this book down. My brother in-law had introduced me to some of the basic concepts and we're planning a trip to Normandy soon,so I thought I'd give it a try. Sweeping yet anecdotal. I was captivated all the way through! It's so important to have this period recorded in such a thoughtful way--and so accessible to the average reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This book goes beyond any description. I love how Ryan sucks me into the battle making me feel as if i were there. He brings me into the mind of Eisenhower, Rommel and countless troops on that fateful day. Ryan's detail creats a rythmatic flow which plays like a movie in my head and i would recommend it to anyone. I've read hundreds of excellent books but i would have to say that none could compare to this book. it's written almost too perfectly for it to have actually happened. Ryan's an expert and a master. After reading this book, i seriously wished to be in that war and to fight along with the troops just because of the way Ryan was able to pull me into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The longest day reviewed by a high school student.","review":"I have seen the longest day and read the book. Obviously I am going to say I enjoyed the book more then the movie but I think they go hand in hand. The book is add suspense while the movie seems a little less serious and tries to add comic relief. Also the book is very detailed while the movie just brushes over a some accounts. I liked this book becuase it was, or felt like a series of actual personal events from various soldiers. For the most part the book sounds like soldiers letters or daries put into a fairly accurate timeline with d-day. My favorite account would be the german officer that was so shocked by the landing he didn't notice his boots where on backwards until after the day had passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on the invasion of Normandy","review":"I first read The Longest Day as a kid after watching the movie. Cornelius Ryan is an excellent author who has the ability to draw a reader into the history he writes. It is filled with personal accounts and stories that make this an enjoyable book to read. It's a real page turner. Another excellent book on this subject is D-Day: The Sixth of June: The Climactic Battle of World War II by Steven Ambrose."},{"rating":"2","title":"What?!!! I didn't know *THAT*!!!!","review":"For everything I *thought* I knew about the D-Day invasion, this book (even in the first 75 pages) had me saying HOLY COW!!! I had no idea!As a history dabbler, I did not want heavy, burdensome details (extensive listing of equipment with full nomenclature, many confusing names and places and minutiae), but I also did not want pure fluff. This book delivered with an extremely easy to read combination of facts and day-in-the-life details that brought the action to life. Jumping between the Allied and German perspective kept the momentum going and delivered suspense - even though I already knew the results.THAT qualifies as a good book! Definitely a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the gold standard","review":"This is the gold standard among military history books, the masterful story of D-Day, the first day of the Allies' climactic invasion of Normandy.This is an eminently readable book, one that most readers -- even those without interest in military or history books -- will find impossible to put down, even though the outcome is well known. Cornelius Ryan brings surprising clarity to the multi-faceted D-Day operation, allowing us to view the events of June 6, 1944 from many perspectives: German, French, British, Canadian and American. My only complaint with \\"The Longest Day\\" -- a quibble, really -- is that the soft-cover version I purchased lacked any maps, which would have been useful for a geographically-challenged reader such as me.If you've seen the movie, I'd encourage you to read the book. If you haven't seen the movie, read the book and then rent the movie. You'll find it an enjoyable experience, worthy of all the 5-star ratings you see here."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first WW2 book.","review":"I read this book when I was 12 after seeing the movie on TV.

By focusing on the men and women of both sides Ryan allows the reader to identify with the participants and understand the significance of D-Day on a new level."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a GREAT book, its a must read.","review":"This book gives excellent detail of D-Day. The way he writes is superb. He writes it from the prespective of the German and American.

Were it not for \\"D-Day\\" by Stephen Ambrose, this would be THE D-Day book. Nonetheless it is an extremely good book. It's informative yet very easy to read. It's historical but has a personal feel to it. Read \\"D-Day\\" by Stephen Ambrose. You'll love both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding.","review":"I was sorry when I had to put the book down at the end.Two things bothered me:1. Page 125 mentions PFC Colin Powell in a way that indicates he survived the war, but he is not on the list of \\"where they are now\\", although he's in the index. Who was he? The Colin Powell who was a general and US Secretary of State was born in 1937 and would have been seven years old n D-Day. And he was never an enlisted man.2. The German office who put his boots on wrong: In the film, he dies with his wrongly-booted feet in the air. In the book he survives the war. Which was it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy, yet startlingly evocative...","review":"...this book is a no-nonsense telling of the events that surrounded the June 6, 1944 invasion of Normandy.Having been born twenty-five years after the date, I have grown up with an interest in the D-Day landings. I first read this book as a child, and it brought tears to my eyes. If you have seen SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, you owe it to yourself to read this book. If you live in the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, or France, you owe it to yourself to read this account of the men who fought and died on the beaches of Normandy.Along with THE BATTLE FOR PUSAN (a Korean War narrative), this book is a must-read for any student of history or warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality sound, Poor power supply.","review":"I purchased these based on the previous reviews on this page.My advice? Look elsewhere, I picked up two sets of these (one for my each of my computers). It only took about one week for the power supply to fail on set one. I noticed that the 10V power supply (included), fits quite loose where it interfaces with the unit. (This holds true for both sets). I was unable to get the first set to power up, even when using the power supply from my 2nd set. The sound is barely acceptable. The treble end is severely lacking. Even after playing with the EQ on my mp3 player, I could not strike a good balance of treble with the over powering bass.I would not recommend this product. BOO!Update: Only two months later, the power supply on both sets of speakers has failed. These speakers are a waste of your money, steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every penny","review":"I must say that i am very happy with the performance of these speakers. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value and stylish","review":"These speakers sound good and are inexpensive. Their subtle black and sliver styling matches well with most recent computer equipment including monitors, laptops, and mice. The bass has the ability to overwhelm the satellites, so be sure to place the sub on the floor and as far back as possible to tone it down a bit.I've used these speakers to listen to rap, jazz, and watch DVDs on my computer. While they don't sound as good as my home theater system they get the job done. I highly recommend them for anyone on a budget or looking to purchase speakers for a second computer or a laptop that mainly sits on a desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"It is not great but enough for laptop. If you want to turn on the music and go to kitchen to wash the dishes it may not be enough though. But if you think of the price, that is more or less what you would expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much bass!","review":"It may be hard to believe that you can have too much bass. You can. Simply put, I purchased this set for my computer and I must say it does not work properly. I had to adjust the equalizer in my system just to get a listenable mix. I suppose it might be O.K. at very low volumes, but it distorted severely at my usual listening levels. I can say, on the positive, that I plugged these in to my cheap portable CD player and they sound awesome. So for that purpose I can recommend these speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the bad reviews--too much bass, tinny satellites, no power","review":"I bought these speakers thinking that the bad reviews were probably just that--bad reviews. Unfortunately they turned out to be spot on. There is way too much muddy sounding bass produced by the subwoofer, and there is no way to reduce it except by using an equalizer such as through Itunes. And the satellite speakers, besides sounding tinny, produced very little sound. With everything turned to max that could be maxed, the volume was moderate--forget about cranking it up a bit for a song that you like. In this case you really do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality for the price","review":"Both sub and speakers are very sturdy and sound good. The system won't blow you away (although the sub packs a good kick!), but its a must have for anyone not wanting to spend big $$$ to replace their basic speakers. Try messing around with an equalizer if you can to boost it a bit without causing distortion. Overall happy with this product.*Update* Because my PC sound supports 4 channel audio, I bought a second set to use as rear speakers (unfortunately I can't use a 6 channel 5.1 setup, but I'm happy with this for now). Both sets combined provide plenty of power and give games and music an extra kick. I can now hear (and sometimes feel) anything exploding behind me. Works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So you're wondering \\"who the hell is the Big F?\\"","review":"The Big F is essentially Berlin, without the chick singing. But the music is much, much harder. Though nowhere near as slamming as their self-titled debut \\"Is\\" does contain some great songs with \\"Patience Peregrine\\" the stand-out track. A hard-driving rhythm section pounds behind anguished vocals and non-linear guitar playing to create a sound so original no one wanted to hear it. With their albums long out of print, used bins at record stores are about the only place to track their masterpieces down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lyrics, Nice beats","review":"Comical from beginning to end. It flows with tight beats and the lyrics are original. It is not much different than the other albums in terms of what you would expect from these guys. Buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Need A Vacation...","review":"This album is straight up feel-good music, no matter how you cut it. The album kicks off with Opening Act, which explains Ugly Duckling's position in the concert world. Haha, if you heard the track, you know what I'm talking about. It moves on to Turn It Up, which is one of the best on the album. This is one of the few CDs that gets better later on, with tracks such as Potty Mouth and Pass It On. Young Einstein really shines on this one, even more than Journey To Anywhere. The album is not perfect, though. I just can't seem to get into Mr. Tough Guy, and I'm back and forth on Energy Drink. Also, the whole Meat Shake theme can get a little stale after multiple listens. For the love of god, though, don't let this turn you off from picking this one up. You'll be quite pleased, if I may so myself. Goodnight now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing back the sound","review":"This album is perfect pure genius. This is what hip-hop used to be about. When rap and hip-hop was about the rap not the rapper. Even before De La Soul, back to Grandmaster Flash days. \\"Have you ever been over a friend's house to eat and the food just ain't no good?\\" This album is easily the most innovative, creative, successful album I've heard in years. Listen to it. Listen to the flow and the beats. Listen to the rhymes. Don't talk about how \\"goofy\\" or \\"funny\\" UD is. Pay attention to how smart and skilled UD is. One complaint. Where's the props for the album that made this album possible; De La Soul is Dead? Biddies in the BK Lounge?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I loved Ugly Duckling's first two albums, and their live show was outstanding. Seeing as I downloaded the first two albums when Napster was alive and well (ahh the good old days!) I immediately purchased this album with no delay. Boy was I dissappointed. Aside from the cheesy skits, the production fell short of the first two albums (especially Journey to Anywhere). Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for profound, life-altering lyrics in all the music I listen to, but some substance to work with is nice. I always thought UD was funny, lyrics were creative, and Andy especially can flow better than 95% of the MCs out there, but this album is really sorry. All that being said, I will continue to support UD on their next release. Using my logic, I downloaded 2 albums for free, so I still have to buy one more to even things out. If you're new to UD, I would recommend Journey to Anywhere first and Fresh Mode second. Save your money on this one though, it's pretty bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Plain and simple, this album is overrated. First of all, the whole meat shake thing is stupid. The skits are not funny, if I was back in 7th grade, I might find the humor in it. They center the entire album around such a lame concept. Second, the emcees are average at best. The beats are alright, but nothing we haven't heard before. The only song on the album I really liked was La Revolucion. For some reason, a lot of the emo-hoppers have praised this album. Just another reason to dislike it. Save your money and pick up some real hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie Pergatory","review":"Normally I wouldn't define it so precisely, but early scenes literally scream \\"symbolic other world.\\" I suppose it has something to say about futility, meaning, boredom, and the constant desire to feel something new.

Such a shame because if only the movie had a better ending I might not have felt like I wasted my time.

Skip it and spend your time on something better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite theatrical farce","review":"The fact that this work has been critically acclaimed these days testifies to how low people's tastes have dropped. Yet another farcical melodrama featuring such novel emotive device such as bodily amputations, nostalgia for the idyllic life and caricature of materialism. Yes, people these days watched Hollywood too much that they forgot about these themes which have been repeated million times by junk literature writers, but that does not make this movie less banal. The screen writer seems to hold the belief that his audience is so stupid and insensitive these days that he can just stuff all these well-rehearsed themes into one big splash and get away with it. It is unfortunate that people do seem to respond that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kafka would have made this film if he was around today","review":"Call it existential angst, or to be less pretentious, a feeling that 'there's more to life than this' - either way, that's the movie's theme. If you understand that feeling, you'll relate to the main character and understand the movie. If not, this isn't the film for you. This is a 'love it or hate it' type of film. It's unsettling but unique, it has very much the same feeling and theme as Kafka's 'The Trial'."},{"rating":"2","title":"things happen in this film that are not - and should not be - easily explained","review":"I have just a couple of things to add to previous reviewers who have already covered this film quite adequately.Point one is that, if you are the sort of person who likes mysterious films to eventually have clear explanations, perhaps you should look for a different movie. Unlike a typical Twilight Zone episode, there is no narrator to explain what happened here in case you missed it, you will need to figure it out for yourself.Point two is that I was surprised how bloody the film was, I guess I made an assumption given its lack of a rating. I'm guessing this movie would be rated R, if it were rated, for two or three moderately gory parts and some (darkened) bedroom scenes. Not for children or the squeamish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Current","review":"This book is NOT what it's advertised to be.

They work as swimsuits, if you don't want one of today's bulky saggy soggy neon beasts covering half your body when you swim. The only downside to the target ones is that the elastic ages pretty quickly from all the (chlorinated) water.These were more expensive and slightly longer, but swimming in silk still beats most other materials, so I gave it a try.They aren't as comfortable, as briefs. They do move around and get stuck more than they should. The elastic, while nicely stronger than the target ones, feels slightly too industrial to me. The fly is, for whatever reason, too easy to, shall we say, accidentally bypass.And I know they aren't made for swimming, but I do want to add that the fabric seems to be aging VERY quickly - after only half a dozen uses, it feels thinner and stiffer than it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"silk boxers","review":"It's hard to buy clothes without trying them on first, even underwear.

Nice material just to short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boxers are for old men, get a thong instead","review":"My opinion as a woman: I don't understand why men keep thinking that Boxers are in and cool.

My female friends call boxers, grandpha briefs.Also this boxer does not provide support for men where they need it. and it is a known medical fact that lack of support can cause organs to sack.Get a thong instead.

The alternative left is to be histrionic and let THAT be the suggesstion to project the depravity this film wants to play out. Of course many don't recognise it as bad acting so that works too.For me less is more ( ie : Audition ; Silence of the Lambs Blair Witch ) ) and histrionic overkill just brings out my dark sense of humour which is a scary-funny horror genre of its own too.That said this film comes up with a few nasties I hadn't heard of.

The video was good when it first came out, I thought I'd buy it now and see if what I was watching years ago, was still funny to me, and it was.

It's a necessity when you're out for a run or just out.I didn't give it 5 stars because the cup holders are not good for big drink cups, only cans, water bottles and narrow cups. Also, there is a lot of extra space. It would be nice if there was another pouch to separate your stuff.

Honestly, I feel like Bob should include cup holders on their strollers to begin with, so it's an annoying product to have to buy (their strollers are already so expensive!), but it works.

We LOVE LOVE LOVE the Revolution Duallie Stroller. Worth every penny. But for $500, it really should come with a cup holder! Also, the entire tray is very flimsy, the pack in the middle is tiny, and the cup holders are narrow. They are deep, which is why this product got two stars instead of one. But it's just ridiculous that such an expensive, and high quality stroller does not have a high quality accessory to go with it. Very much not worth the money. Either buy a generic one, or hold on to your drink and put your stuff in the many available pockets on the stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to buy this","review":"You have to have this for your Bob double stroller.

For $600 I would expect that it would have a cup holder. Every other stroller I have has cup holders and they were under $100. Seems to me a way to nickel and dime customers after having purchased their product.

One can find it, live it, be fortified by it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate it and teach it.\\"Like any good book it only raises questions and asks you to find your own answers.

But overall good.","review":"Siddhartha is very interesting but it is also hard to understand. Unless you are searching for truth like Siddhartha, this book may not interest you as much as if you were experiencing similar struggles. Fairly easy reading and you'll be glad you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wisdom Is Not Communicable","review":"First off although my copy of the book has the copyright publication date at 1951, a blurb at the end states that Hesse wrote this in 1922. That's incredible to think of considering the massive amounts of reprinting and influence of many aspects of this novel in the United States during the 1960's.It's a short novel, only 152 pages, and would be even less if published with the smaller font and spacing typical of most recent published paperbacks. It's a novel of young man's attainment towards self-understanding and wisdom, via a myriad of events through life, including a humble life as a beggar, an affair with a manipulative wealthy woman, and even life as a rich man himself, and an eventual return to a humble life.Many of the characters refer to themselves in the third person, so this may be confusing in the first few pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers a captivating look at Buddhism and one's self","review":"This incredible book draws you in from the start with a captivating story of a young man searching for the right path in his life. From Brahma to ascetic, to merchant, the journey of Siddhartha makes one look at his own life while aptly conveying popular Buddhist ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring piece about a young man's spiritual search.","review":"Hesse wrote a book that proves that pantheism is a world view that neglects to explain human nature as we find it, just as much as it explains human nature away. Herman Hesse attempted to present an eastern religion that worked, in this piece he came short of an answer. Siddhartha attempts to break free from suffering and into oneness that his religion forcefully conformed him to. In the novel Siddhartha finds himself in situations of denial, indulgence, and synthesis. All of this in order to realize that life isn't made up of the individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"a male journey of discovery...","review":"that happened to be the comment that a woman friend of mine made when she saw me with the book, as in 'god, what's with you men? all men seem to relate to and own this book!' and that really got my attention, so when i read it again (about 5-times by now) i felt that hesse had in reality given short shrift to kamala the female lead. hesse has used kamala to epitomize the eastern woman (she's a courtesan!) and has somehow left her completely shallow. if he were around and given the modern predilection for sequels, prequels et al, i'm sure there was enough in kamala to merit an even longer book.i've subsequently bought narcissus & goldmund and that too is about men. and even in the early part of the book, the women seem to lack depth. will be more informed when i finish.nevertheless, siddhartha does make very involved reading with many layers of personal meaning. it has charm as an eastern novel and also depth if you're introspective. enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a falling leaf or a star?","review":"A sad story .. so cold .. what a hard life! I am not interested in Buddhism but I like Hesse! He is so sensitive and realistic ..just like a painter taking his time to finish his portrait after studying every stroke and every color..Despite all the hardships that Siddhartha go through, you always feel at ease, relaxed .. totally enjoying the story.. It is full of wisdom .. extreme measures .. but as Siddhartha said no one can feed you his/her experience you have to try and learn .. you can choose to be a falling leaf or a star?! searching and looking for answers .. we can make our own future .. depending on which path we choose .. but fate and luck are part of this future ..and Love conquers all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Enough","review":"This is an easy and quick read.

It's worth reading over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"the same thing over and over again - redundant","review":"The book had a message, and Hesse managed to say that message in so many different useless words of verbiage in all its 80 some pages. The absolute oneness of the universe, the transcendental power of time and space, the 'om' of all people and things: Hesse pounded it into the ground in the last 30 pages while Siddhartha was at the river. The point was gracefully made the first time and did not need to be repeated endlessly. A simple message that I've heard many times, and still no real proof to it...I was disappointed from what I thought would be a good book at the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hokey","review":"This book is no doubt well written and a quick, easy read. However, I found it to be very hokey. If you are very spiritual and you like the Celestine Prophecy, then you'll probably love this book. If you are practical and down to earth, I don't recommend it. Many reviewers say that this book changed their life. I don't get it. Maybe I skipped a chapter...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable novel about spiritual awakening","review":"This short book contains some profound lessons about religion, faith and coming of age. It is a book one can read quickly but it is not quickly forgotten. While Hesse won't blow you away as a writer in some respects (style, plot, dialogue, etc.), he does a wonderful job of character development in this novel (though be aware that the book is primarily focused on one person). This book is very enjoyable and can be digested by a variety of ages. I imagine this is the kind of book that will yield something new with each reading. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived on tie","review":"Arrived right on time and great quality for a good price. Will come back again for more books. Thanks alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend this book.","review":"If you want to read a short novel I definitely recommend reading Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. This novel tells about all the hardships that one man went through to find himself. Siddhartha was not happy until he found the true meaning of life. On his quest for knowledge Siddhartha learns the meaning of love both physically and emotionally. He also learns that life isn't something to be taken advantage of. This book is very toughing and it is easily understood. There aren't many twists and turns so it is easy to follow. Read Siddhartha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book with wonderful philosophical insight","review":"Siddhartha was a wonderful book that describes a young man's journey through life to find inner peace. The ideas brought out about life and its cycles and connections were quite amazing; I highly recommend this novel for anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...But in ourselves, are triumph and defeat\\"- Longfellow","review":"Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha (1922) is a masterpiece. This book was on my wish-list for a while but it was just couple of days ago when I finally checked it out from NYPL. Its a fine little book to own. My only regret is not having read this book earlier. To get a deeper understanding of its contents I would recommend finding out more on some of the popular Sanskrit words used in this book and their origins. Hesse's lead character Siddhartha portrays a familiar human condition- the constant internal struggle to find purpose and meaning in life. In the process he meets several people erudite and the commons and he learns something about himself and how this wisdom fits in the larger scheme of things. This book is as laconic as can be yet leaves you thinking, self-contemplating and enlightened.

There are a few more recent translations out there that are better. I like the one by Susan Bernofsky best, but there are others to pick from as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome deep thinking book","review":"One of the best books I've ever read, next to Catcher in the Rye. Steppenwolf is on one of my next books list. I usually hate reading, but that was a great book because it dealt with the deeper meaning in life and made you think. It also made you realize how you can only be happy with simple things and with whatever makes YOU happy. It also deals with the fact that although there may be obstacles in your path, you must always follow your true destiny to uncover your Nirvana. 10/10!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch a special on Eastern Philosophy instead","review":"The breadth with which Siddhartha covers Eastern Philosophy could be conveyed in a Discovery or PBS special.

I would advise you to choose another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather hideous...","review":"I was assigned this book by my literature teacher, and just by the name I quickly assumed that it would be a slightly tedious religeously motivated book about some fellow from Asia looking for answers. After reaching chapter 5 I didn't find it boring as much as disturbing. The main character, Siddhartha, seems to be soul searching, though his soul searching doesn't seem to involve morals. I was reading out loud to a friend of mine and was quickly shocked to realize that I was reading out loud Hesse's rather graphic description of a somewhat erotic dream of Siddhartha in which his best friend turns into a female. Aside from the fact that Siddhartha is an egotistical snob, he's also rather permiscuous. His constant speaking on how wonderful he is compared to the rest of the \\"common ignorant people\\" is rather tedious to read. Perhaps it's because I had to read it all in Spanish, though this still isn't a book I'd like to read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the spiritual epiphany I had hoped","review":"I had to read this book for my 11th grade english class, and at first I was very excited. From what I had read on this site this book was going to be a very spiritual experrience. It was going to change my life. But the further and further I got into the book the more disappointed I got. This was not what I had expected. The charachters were all extremely shallow, except for Siddhartha. And I found Siddhartha conceited and macho. Two traits I had hoped that Buddha had not had. Maybe I was looking at it from the wrong perspective but I was let down by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the GREATEST BOOKS of ALL TIME","review":"Hey ... one of the earlier reviewer missed the boat on Siddhartha ... he is not merely a :contemporary: of Buddha ....

He seeks to test the limits of love-hate, of body-emotional-physical, of joy-sorrow (despite of his claim that he is devoid of any feeling). He seeks knowledge and a teacher. Siddhartha (not to be confused with Gautam Buddha) takes it upon himself to experience the pleasures (Samsara) which he was denying himself for true knowledge. He submits self to each extreme to understand the virtues and vices of each.A very grasping and enlightening piece of literature as it poses several questions in front of the reader. This book challenges and eventually affirms many Buddhist beliefs.Herman Hesse, a man who can use words and make a simple story enlightening and a spiritual journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My Perspective","review":"Siddhartha was an amazing book. I had a difficult time starting to read this and trying to get into it since it was required for a college class. However, Siddhartha's story started to unfold and I found myself wondering what he would experience next and where his journey would lead.

If he just stopped analyzing everything for one second, he'd realize that all is well, you can be happy. To him the world is a terrible place, until he finally finds peace at age 60. Gee, that took a long time! He was never satisfied and blamed it on the world around him. Get over it!In other words, I've had more fun reading the ingredients on food labels.

However, now that I've read it, I've realized so much, and changed so much, about my natural way of life. Everything seemed so simple! As an average American kid, I always have 'places to go and people to see'. After I read Siddhartha, I tried to slow down.

That's the case with this book and the Nick Drake's song \\"River Man\\", which I was very attached to before reading Hesse's Siddhartha.The book it's very precise in its objective, never surrendering to secondary characters, while being very economical both in its prose and in its subject, but, at the end, the reader may feel there's little to discover in Siddhartha as a man: even the description of his first sexual experience is painfully passionless. The novel borrow its form from short stories, and Hesse reveals his true talent throughtout the metaphorical context he surrounds his characters.Even though the reader doesn't agree with Siddhartha's conception of life as a whole, the novel is interesting because it portrays a man's itinerary throughout life, and this may explain the wide enthusiasm it still evokes in young people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional fable","review":"Siddhartha is a young Indian man who goes in search of life's answers, and finds them, but not in the form he anticipated. He encounters the Buddha, but is not content with the role of disciple, and so continues on his journey. He learns from everything and everyone: a beautiful courtesan, a merchant, a ferryman, the river. At last, toward the end of his life, he finds the peace for which he'd been searching. Blending Eastern and Western philosophy and spirituality, \\"Siddhartha\\" is a deceptively simple fable with a deafening resonance about spiritual exploration. This is a book to savor, to take one's time reading, to enjoy each nuance of phrase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think, Fast, Wait and Learn Lots!","review":"Although at times I found myself falling asleep, I could pick up the book again and continue. The book reminds me of the film \\"Little Buddha,\\" with Keanu Reeves sitting under a tree. Siddhartha does the same. There is more to this book than meets the eye. We can learn footsteps of a young man growing up--leaving home, discovering wealth, love, and then being alone. The magic of the river intrigued me with its sounds and the everlasting \\"Om.\\" In the end, I found myself almost in meditation and wanting to walk to the nearest river... to listen.- Mr. Lem, BDHS English 12 Teacher"},{"rating":"2","title":"splendid!!!!!","review":"This book helps you think and ponder on stuffs you should do.It has some simple rules of life to make it better and worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but by no means Hesse's best","review":"This is Hesse's spiritual book about Siddhartha and the quest to find one's true Self. It pales in comparison to Steppenwolf and Demian, but it is still a very worthwhile read with a vast amount of depth of thought invested into the short book. Resembles Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra in some respects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost thought-provoking, but not quite","review":"Siddhartha wanders through life in search of meaning and finally deludes himself into believing that he has found it. The writing isn't that great, maybe it lost something in the translation, and the plot leaves much to be desired, so all this novel has going for it is that it's profound. Almost. Throughout the novel, Siddhartha rejects just about every belief possible, until he decides that the only way to live is to be happy with everything. \\"Contentedness with everything is the key to life\\" is the only truth revealed in the entire novel, and it is a truth that I do not agree with. I suppose you have to give the guy some credit for punctuation and an honest effort, but I draw the line at two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Siddhartha","review":"Although this book (Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse) is considered a literary classic, this particular translation was very poor with many typos and grammatical errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not nearly his best","review":"Siddhartha is well written, enjoyable, and rather easy to understand. It provides a basic outline of Hesse's style, an \\"introduction\\" of sorts, to his other, more elaborate, more intelligent, more oxymoronic, yet perfect. I suggest, especially if you enjoyed the book, reading his other books (especially Steppenwolf and The Glass Bead Game)."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELPFUL & ENCOURAGING!","review":"I'm not surprised that this book was published in 1971 and it's still selling strong. I agree with other reviewers who think it's therapeutic. Like them, I was struggling with a problem when I read it and advice in the book helped me put the matter in proper perspective. I truly rely on the Bible for day-to-day living, but it's always good to read other encouraging, optimistic material. I believe this book has helped many people find their way in life. It will never take the place of the truth in the Bible, but it explains things in simple terms that are very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine the Bible written by Hemingway","review":"Hermann Hesse relays a beautiful parable.

Your comments are wonderful and as with you I read this the first time when I was 19 (1969) and again quite a few times over the years and have passed it on to many in my own travels. Your comments concerning the self self self is understandable but think that you missed the most important aspect in all of that which is that you have a hard time in life finding all those other things you mentioned if you cannot find and know yourself. To me this is the meat of Hesse's understanding (along with the idea of all searches in all religions, in which he was aghast that Budhism even became a religion)of first knowing yourself and then find how it fits into the world around you.My 2 cents"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!! 5 Star all the way","review":"I can't think of anyone who would read this book and not find something to grab onto from reading it. I think just about anyone can see a little bit of themselves through the character of Siddharth, the journey for authenticity which only comes through living life. Wisdom has to be experienced and we learn that from this book. Each of us has so many potential paths we could follow or so many different lives we could live but in the end how things play out is the one we were meant to be on. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read. To the reviewer who said its all about the self.

I'm 15 and maybe when I'm 30 I'll like the book but I had to read it for an english class in 10th grade and it was awful reading. to anyone who has a choice to read this book or anything else, pick the latter- it drones on and on about siddhartha finding inner peace, exploring different ways of life, and \\"discovering himself\\". it sends an awful message to kids as he contemplates suicide not once but twice because he is merely unhappy with himself at that moment. there are pages upon pages which are entirely composed of siddhartha talking to himself, then contradicting himself, and so on. in all, the \\"action\\" in this book could be summed up in about 2 pages and I had trouble staying awake through even the first chapter. if you have to read this, heres a tip: get sparknotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Cure For Insomnia","review":"When I first read this book as a junior in high school, I though I would die from boredom. Don't get me wrong, I loved English and enjoyed most of the other \\"classics\\" we were assigned to read; from Shakespeare to Vonnegut to Salinger to Steinbeck.Fast forward 25 years and my son was assigned this book in his AP English class and I thought I would give it another try. Maybe as a more mature and experienced adult, I would enjoy it. Nope. It is still the same 160 page sleeping pill.

I was forced to read this terrible book in my Honors English class and I didn't realize cruel and unusual punishment was back in style. Siddhartha is a very self-absorbed and arrogant character. The whole plot was about his very very very slow path to enlightenment. Who CARES!?!?! I think there are better books out there for young readers than the story of a modern Buddah. All Siddhartha is concerned with is himself and his personal quest, he doesn't even try to make his son happy. In the selfish world of today, books like Siddhartha only make things worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy read.","review":"I picked this book up one weekend last summer, thinking I'd have it read by the following Monday. It looked like a thought provoking book under 150 pages and with a low cost. Well, as I was reading this, the only thought that slipped into my mind was that of sleeping. The language was difficult to understand (I often found myself reading the same paragraph several times, to no avail) and many other confusing factors added to this novel that made me go beserk. It took me almost a month to read this and understand it, and I barely escaped with my sanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"RE-READ THIS BOOK!","review":"this is a book that not only everyone should read, but if it is a long time since they read it, it is worth every moment to read again! not many books truly fall into that category. siddhartha is one of those classic tales that grow more meaningfull as you grow older. it is a tale of eastern religion and thought, one man's path to enlightenment, that is written in such a simple and elequent manner as to be thoroughly absorbing to western minds. it is the perfect antidote to a society obsessed with \\" the material world .\\" we follow siddhartha through the three main stages of his life, in his quest for enlightenment. at times he rebels from the conventional wisdom of his day, at times he loses his moral and spititual compass, seemingly completely, but yet he always finds his way back. this is a brilliant tale that can help each of us focus on how we conduct ourselves in a very complicated society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaining Wisdom","review":"One point this book made that I especially enjoyed is that it is only knowledge that can be taught, but not wisdom. In the end Siddhartha become One with Gotama but it was not by following Gotama's teachings or being his disciple. His own self-reflection of the experiences that he gained by following his own path led him ultimately to wisdom and to Gotama. I believe that this is true not only for Buddhism but many other religions. For example, becoming closer to Jesus, understanding the meaning of Christianity is not necessarily acheived by following the bible line for line (as some fundamentalists are apt to do) but by straying from the \\"right path\\", by questioning the teachings and gaining experiences. Only by seeking our own path can we gain true understanding of the meaning of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, very sad","review":"I started reading this book because I play Go. I kept reading the book even after I figured out that it doesn't talk about the moves in detail because it's a damn good book. I'm one of those people that is always thinking about where other people around me have been. The idea of two people from such different lifestyles coming together and playing Go without speaking to each other about themselves tantalized me. I could put myself in the girl's place. I could put myself in the man's place. This book made me no better at Go, but it touched my heart. It made me cry and smile and quote passages aloud to friends. A good read for Go players, students of Japanese or Chinese culture, soldiers (or veterans of course), students of the Pacific War, people in love, and practically everyone else as long as they don't mind a very sad ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"~(tm)","review":"This CD is great.

I ain't hatin on Bubba because he's white, I don't like him because he sucks and makes terrible music. Support real white rappers like Eminem and Lil Wyte, hell even John Cena is better. But don't support this redneck idiot because rappers like him, D4L, Dem Franchize Boyz, Mike Jones, Paul Wall, The Yin Yang Twins and other garbage is what is ruining rap.

With a speech level training teacher I went from not being able to sing to singing in 1 month. I'm not kidding! However, this book is a real disappointment. Although it is great for explaining the method and as an introduction before getting a teacher, you cannot use it to practice with, and here's why: ALL OF THE EXERCISES ONLY GO UP THE SCALE. So, if you want to practice with the CD, forget it. You will still need a piano and will have to know how to accompany yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!!!","review":"I've been singing with Rock and Roll bands for over 20 years. I've taken lessons from many excellent vocal teachers and spent a lot of money learning how they wanted me to sing.

Over the past several months, working on my own and \\"putting\\" the time in to rehearse each day for a minimum of a half an hour, I find my range has increased, I have better control of my voice and the original \\"breathing\\" techniques I was taught almost got in the way. This is an excellent investment and works!!! You can also find teachers in your area who teach Seth Riggs style so you can improve beyond this. As it states this is a complete program. Follow it and you will become a better singer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Competent Singers","review":"I really like this method book for expanding the flexibility and range of the voice.It should be used by people who really can sing and have excellent pitch matching AND BREATHCONTROL, not with beginners of any sort or elementary to middle school kids. It is my recommendationto use with high school age talent and older. The CD's are helpful and clearly understood.The price is right and it is good to listen to the CD's completely before using them witha student. If you are buying this for yourself, I would advise getting a voice teacherwho can work with you unless you know how to sing properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially great for SLS students on the go","review":"I don't know that this book alone will make you a better singer, but for any Speech Level student that can't do regular voice lessons, this is a great resource for keeping up with the techniques. It also goes in to more detail with respect to the warmups than your SLS teacher may go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"Well, I recently received this item. It is totally not for me. Personally what I think, is that this would be for an opera singer that is experienced, but just wants some exercises. The singers that demonstrate the exercises both sing using an operatic voice. They don't even sound good. And they sing the exercises very fast. It is hard to hear the right key they are playing on the piano so you can practice the exercises. The whole thing is too fast. My personal opinion is that it wouldn't be for people that want to sing pop or a style like that. To me, the book consists of two parts. The first part tells you about your voicebox, and the second part goes over the audio CDs. The text just says what Seth Riggs is saying on the audio CDs. I'm going to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw an improvement the first week!","review":"I used to sing rock & roll, forcing my chest voice into my head range rather than using my head voice, and had never learned to use my head voice. I always considered myself a contralto and figured my head voice was mostly useless. After just the first lesson with this method I was able to feel the difference between using my head voice and forcing my chest voice up and was amazed at how hard I used to work to hit those notes. Now, four months later, I can actually sing mezzo soprano with quite a bit of ease. I am now able to cross my switch point going up without hanging onto the chest voice, and going down it's become seamless. And I haven't even done all the lessons yet! There are some lessons I am unable to do properly because I have never been able to trill my tongue, but there are enough lessons that muddling past those has not been a problem. I would highly recommend this to ANYONE who has trouble with their head voice and/or their switch point!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good concept to learn, leaves you wanting more","review":"I really like this book. It states basically the same concept my voice teacher has been teaching for a year or so, but it puts it in more understandable terms and uses better exercises that work right away. The only complaint would be it leaves you wanting more. For 2 cds, there aren't really that many exercises. I like it, but I'd recommend a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this book up","review":"The biggest problem this book has is that it is not very broad. These few exercises that encourage a larynx at the position of speech have two main problems. First, we don't sing with our larynx at the position of speech. Second, these exercises may encourage the frozen, and/or compressed larynx that is not a quality of either speech or, and more importantly, singing.A good vocal pedagogy education shouldn't be needed for anyone to see that this book and Speech Level Singing fall way short of an actual useable \\"method.\\" In fact, when we voice teachers no longer get former Speech Level Singing students in to our studios that need to be retrained, I'll be more than happy to revisit my opinions on this book and SLS.If you are looking for higher quality books/CD/DVDs, check out such authors as Gillyanne Kayes's Singing and the Actor, or Lisa Popeil's books CD/DVDs, and Elisabeth Howard's Book/CD/DVDs Sing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sfs","review":"Great product, I can feel more control of my voice after each exercise!

A friend to whom I gave the book had a similar experience -- frustration, boredom, no results. I had high hopes for this product when I bought it, but I have gone back to Roger Love's book (Set Your Voice Free). I understand that he was a student of Riggs, and perhaps that is the source of his ideas; but I at least found his book much, much more usable. I have taken singing lessons since then from a professional voice coach, and I must say that her approach (which has given me excellent results) is a lot more accessible than Riggs, as well. So, if you are a semi-professional singer with years of experience and the ability to sing very fast scales, this book may be quite useful.

Now that Tara is older, I think it would be great for her to perhaps re-write this book, almost into an entirely different book, maybe contrasting her new pro life with her amateur career, with her insights into both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"What a great role model for young girls.

Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"Um, this is just how I pictured it: Tara showed a lack of maturity on and off the ice; like her skating, this book shows how self-centered and cold she is about not being sincere to anybody but she just think she is the best. I would have given it no stars at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tara Lipinski writes like a child.","review":"Tara's book was written for a child. It seems as though she did not put any real thought into her book. She should get some pointers from Michelle Kwan, who's book, HEART OF A CHAMPION, was exeptional. It was not only interesting, but it was also humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to say....","review":"Well lets just say, I would leave this book off your wishlist if I were you. I was very excited to read it as it was the first Stake your destiny book I've read. It sort of ruined them for me. It was terrible. The dialogue was bad, and made all of the characters seem stupid and annoying. The plot was poorly thought out, and the action sucked.

I was very pleased with them. The honey has a strong lemon taste and is perfect for sweetening both hot and iced tea. Just make sure, of course, that you put the honey into the iced tea pitcher before it has cooled down, or this honey won't dissolve properly. It seems to match best with green, black and herbal teas. It seems to overpower fruity teas, though. I am very happy with this product but not sure I would buy it at full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy and boring","review":"I was really looking forward to this game. I remember the first Reach for the Stars and how much I love the game, and I find it truly depressing that it's image has been tarnished with this title. The game crashes repeatedly, has image glitches, and scratchy sound. The technology tree is almost pointless since the technologies of the latest \\"era\\" completely supplant the previously researched technologies. There is so little variety or options for error in this area that you can rely entirely on the production and technolgy queues...which basically means that you spend the game moving fleets around and fighting battles. Since the battles are essentially just a series of choosing the formation and hitting end turn...it gets boring extremely quickly. If you want a good space strategy game, go buy a copy of Master of Orion II...this one wasn't worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"half a review","review":"Ok so the game has not been released, however you can download a 60 turn demo from mindscapes website. It looks like this could be a nice game.The game takes much of the tedium of controlling a large empire away by pooling all resources, and allowing entire colony build profiles to be created with a single click. there appears to be a large tech list to research, and the presentation and interface a very polished.the downsides:the space battle look fairly simplistic, and uninvolved: you get to pick tactics - which seems to play like a more advanced paper, scissor, stones game. Its a shame they did not take the master of Orion route with combat. Also despite being able to design your own ships, it is hard to determine the affects of different configurations because you are so removed from the actionStill All said i am looking forward to seeing what it is like, and hope that some of these failing have been delt with for the release version.James Tory"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Buy Space Empires IV or V Instead.","review":"If your looking for a good 4x space conquest game then this game is NOT it. I strongly recommend that you go buy Space Empires IV or V (released just last month) and enjoy them.RFTS came out in 2000 and I was one of the first people to buy this horrid game. It look great on paper but after about 20 minutes of playing it I found that I simply just wanted to uninstall it and go back to playing Moo2 or Stars. But I stayed with the game, played it through to the end of what can only be consided a comapain, and then unistalled. I found MOO3 to be a better game than this, and that is saying a lot. (Moo3 was one of the worst game ever made IMHO.)In a nut shell, you will be better off if you buy SE IV or V (Or both as both are very good games) than if you spent your hard earned gaming money on this less than stellar attempt at 4x gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"as described, perfect!","review":"I was looking for a nylon washer to use with M2.5 screws and these were perfect.

The opening isn't large enough to hold our ginormous local bagels (I wish they sold the size the device is designed to hold, but that's another review.) And if I do manage to stuff all that bagel into the device, it just doesn't secure the bagel well enough to permit a clean easy cut. Yeah it's probably better than holding the bagel in your hand to slice it and risking a trip to the ER, but if you can bear to have yet another plastic thing and can afford it, go with a bagel guillotine."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your $$","review":"Knife does not line up with both sides of the cutting slot (checked the knife and the slot, they were both straight).

I had bought them Shrek 2 previously and they LOVED it! I thought this would be another great addition to the Shrek collection- but I was wrong! It is a boring game, the graphics are poor and the story line is really lame. If you want a great Shrek video game- go for Shrek 2. It is more fun and more entertaining than Shrek The Third. There is one advantage of this game- it helps me fall asleep on the nights I'm suffering from extreme insomnia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is condensed, short and easy to read.

Would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Christianity and the Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for a Christian teacher","review":"I enjoyed reading the original Case for Christ book and thought it was an excellent resource. The book is written in a format that should be easy for most middle-school grade levels to read, even students in the upper elementary grades as well. There are a lot of visual charts and text boxes that capture the attention, but it still delivers that same type of evidence found in the original book. The only thing it really lacks compared to the original is that it doesn't have a bibliography at the end of each chapter, but since there are probably very few students who would make use of that anyway, it doesn't take away from the book's purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good..","review":"I was really disapointed after everything I read about Strobel's first book. Not a total throw-away but I've definatly read better. Not recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliantly misleading","review":"Right off the bat, some of the claims in this book didn't pass the smell test, so I Googled both author Strobel and some of the \\"scientists\\" he interviewed. The inescapable conclusion is that Lee Strobel is falsely portraying himself as a skeptic in order to push his personal agenda. Most of his \\"scientists\\" are actually theologians or philosophers, and it seems that literally all of them are advocates of the \\"Intelligent Design\\" version of creation. Worse, he blatantly misrepresents such things as the opinion of Albert Einstein. His journalism is terrible, his science is phony and his book is disingenuous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"I have read the original \\"The Case for Christ\\" and was very pleased to see an edition written for teens. Although this edition is shorter it is written in a stimulating format using numerous windows and charts, none of the powerful defenses for Christ are lost. This book demonstrates that Christianity is not just another religion to choose from, but a belief based on facts, history, and logic. With the culture our youth are living in today, I believe this book will help our teens and preteens strengthen their faith, and motivate them to defend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Case for Christ Student Edition","review":"My son, who is 12, has taken this book and is absolutely devouring it.

For me, reading this book was a waste of time and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloids from the 16th century!","review":"While Micheal White's book does serve as an interesting introduction to some of the biographical history of the iconoclastic Leonardo, White includes so much subjective narrative following up the context of each chapter that he turns the \\"total man\\" goal of his study into a hyperbolic and titillating read that could very well have been lifted from the \\"Milanese Inquirer\\", if such a tabloidic rag existed so long ago! Hey, it probably did! But do we have to pay [money] for a ... Italian rag?

Homosexual?","review":"Michael White spends more time trying to use very tenuous evidence to ascertain whether or not da Vinci engaged in sex with other males than he spends trying to convince us that da Vinci should be classed as scientist. What is the purpose of this effort? Does da Vinci become a more credible scientist if White convinces us that da Vinci can be classed as a homosexual? In attemtping to convince himself and his readers that da Vinci would fit into either class -- scientist or homosexual -- White pursues a useless game. Why not simply tell us of the very superior insights that da Vinci achieved in his explorations and let us revel in the man's astouunding creativity. And, who cares about da Vinci's sex life? What difference could it possibly make relative to his creativity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"B Weiss is a real attention giver.

Easy to read and understand with great insight - couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need is love","review":"In this work, Brian Weiss collects all of the wisdom of the Masters he has gathered from his sessions with all of his clients. The messages are all about love, and I think those who have suffered the loss of a loved one will find much comfort in this book. I know I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Having read many spiritual books, this one, in my view, is among the best. It provides answers to many questions. The author seems to take into account that not all readers may be as spiritually evolved as himself and takes the trouble to explain in a manner that is easily understood. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reincarnation of his previous works","review":"I will not claim that whatever Mr. Weiss has experienced is not true. But from the perspective of originality and evolution of its teachings, this book does not include anything that he has mentioned in \\"Many Lives Many Masters\\". Actually this book seems to be the consequence of some pressure from his editors to come up with another work, so suckers like me who liked the previous ones, will fall in the same old merchandising trap which sequels are.I do not believe that Mr. Weiss requires more money from royalties. So I do not know what moved him to write such a lame book of which he must be aware is just a blend of his previous work \\"reincarnated\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Messages are the Same, but do you GET them?","review":"Universal truth is not boring, just hard to incorporate into daily life. There may be some redundancy here from Weiss' other books, but maybe we need to hear the messages (or teachings) one more time. This book is different in how it concentrates information. One page may contain too much to digest in a month. That said I wish Weiss had bulleted his stronger points so that they get the importance they need.The book is easy to read, but so are most of the Eastern teachings that contain the simple truths. Compare it to Lao Tsu's writings. Same messages, but hard to really \\"get\\", and harder to live.Also highly recommended: the movie \\"What the (bleep) do We Know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A far cry from his original best seller","review":"I have read three of Dr. Weiss' books on the subject of reincarnation. In my opinion, this book is opportunistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book, one of the best I have EVER read!!","review":"Wow, all I could say is that Brian's words of wisdom had some kind of postive touching move on me that I could not explain. I love the fact that he explains about how most religions are based on the same concept regarding love, compassion and empathy. I love how he writes..he's a very good and inspiring writer. I would love to meet him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No love for this book","review":"After wasting my time reading over 50 pages, I am convinced this one of the worst books on this subject .I have no doubt in my mind that none of this was a true story(which is legal).You can clearly see by how badly it is written that it is a book written by someone with a gift for \\"story telling\\". Anyone could make this up. This was truly a complete waste of time and paper. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are searching for some kind of answer","review":"I found this book several years ago, at a time in my life when I was unsure about what to believe in. I had certain beliefs on what afterlife, but I was still searching. I came upon this book because of the author, and I have to say that this book not only changed my outlook on relationships, it changed my life, period. I found myself not only understanding current and past relationships I had had, but WHY I chose them. It made me have a completely different understanding on those I loved or disliked. It also gave me the realisation that hate was a useless emotion.Although this book doesn't hold ALL the answers, it supplies the reader with the means by which they can heal old wounds, and learn that LOVE is the only answer. When I have a friend or loved one that is searching for answers, I gift them this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Guide","review":"After having read all of Dr.Weiss' books, I can't help but think that his teachings are a guide to our Soul's Journey. I have pased on many of the books to friends who were intitially drawn to past life research through interests in Living History. The direction of the Soul's Journey was an inevitable path. It is the most important message we can receive and give. I recommend it to friends who are on a search within, as well as a good path through our present life. It works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Messages from the Masters","review":"We are Hospice volunteers and have had many questions about the dying process.

Once he was finally moved to this and we removed any other allergin causing items from his diet he began to gain weight and thrive again.

They bill it like he's hanging out the whole time. I have no idea what the Unrated deal is all about. There is nothing very over the top.

This movie relied on cheap, vulgar tricks and jokes. As much as I like Adam Sandler, I liked this movie. Which means, I really don't like Adam Sandler's humor.It just wasn't all that funny collectively. The plot didn't really happen until 15 minutes until the movie ended. Then it seemed like the director thought he should end the movie with some sort of competition and victory. Very poorly written. The characters were interesting. A guy who lives with his Grandma, a has-been-matrix-wanna-be, and the grandma herself. It could've been much better. A 30+ guy living with his grandma is funny in concept. But, not in this movie. I didn't even feel for his character.

Maybe I'm working in the wrong spot...Anyway, the movie is still fun as hell to watch. And the three old ladies are absolutely adorable, especially when they're baked on the weed-tea.Did anyone else notice that the game Alex was designing was a little re-vamp of the alpha stages of the Predator Concrete Jungle game?Anyway, I thought this movie was funny as hell. A note to aspiring testers who may be watching this movie: don't take the exagerrated portrayance of testers seriously.

The writers and producers have done a great job with seasons 1-6. It's funny, whimsical, and has good plot lines. But that comes to a crashing halt with season 7. They have completely disregarded the previous six seasons of character development and have turned the show into nothing more than a bad joke. Season 7 is the most insulting thing I have seen in this series. It seems as though they have put more into the animations than story lines and wit. Previous seasons have been stellar, but this season is a waste of time and money. Any time an animated series brings an actual person and more songs than dialog into an episode it's time to stop. Unimpressive and stupid. If you enjoyed seasons 1-6 stop there.

Clair argues with Theo about the new highrise being built, as she is upset about their water usage. Cliff reveals that Theo is interested because he heard 55 stewardesses would be moving into the highrise. Also, Dr. Burns (played by Danny Kaye) tells two jokes with the big teeth model instead of one.

The overall arc of the movie is similiar to that of 'The Evil Dead' only with Cat Girls. The writer threw in just about every spoof he could do on a budget, and then some, including not only anime and horror movie references and jokes, but also Video Game, Sci Fi, and a few Cinema Classics. There is a good 5.1 Surround sound mix for the movie, and an OK Directors Commentary, with Bloopers and Promo stuff for bonus material, the disc is better than what you would expect from a Low-Budget movie.

The conclusion is enigmatic enough to satisfy urges for realism.Private scenes satisfy those curious to watch the evolving relationship as well as giving a little to voyeurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beau Pere - Ariel Besse","review":"There have been many great reviews about this movie already so I'll just supply the information that everyone else seems to leave out. Ariel Besse gives a great performance but if you're looking for a lot of nudity and sex this film is not for you. While you do get to see Ariel topless a number of times, you don't see complete frontal nudity. And all you get is a slight glimpse of her nude backside when she's walking to her room. You can also see part of her rear when she's sitting on the bed. Excellent story and well acted, but very short on nudity, especially when Ariel is such a pretty girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie from start to end.","review":"The movie starts out with the death of a young girls (14 years old) mother.

Apparently, the full frontal nudity of Ariel Besse was too much for the US censors, regardless of the importance of the lines to the plot. The picture and sound quality are great but the subtitles were off by a scene or two in the middle. Not sure if this was the disc or my laptop. Regardless, I enjoyed the movie for what it is, the story of the death of a mother, a teen girl's first love and the unfortunate schmuck of a step-father that is the target of her attention. Yes, there is nudity but the emotional upheavals of the main characters are the important issues in the movie. The acting is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Obviously, the ideas presented by the author of this book are totally wrong. Since the publication of this book, the field of science has made many advances which show that not only is science not at its end, but the potential of science is increasing over time. (For example, consider nanotechnology and reprogenetics.)The author of this book makes a mistake that is actually common among scientist: assuming that technology will always be the same as it is today. The credibility of this book ranks among that of those who have said, \\"man will never be able to walk on the moon,\\" or \\"scientist will never be able to clone the DNA of a somatic cell.\\" The author reminds me of a top-ranking administrator at the patent office who, in 1901, recommended closing the patent office because he couldn't imagine that any further important inventions would be made.Don't waste your time.

I did enjoy though his portrayals of eminent scientists as old foggies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Church of the Holy Horror?","review":"This book underscores, with unconscious precision, the fallacies of intellectual life in the late twentieth century. In a series of revealing profiles of top scientists, Horgan unwittingly exposes the link between a common scientific worldview and Horgan's own jaded attitude. Horgan does not seem to grasp how much he has in common with his interview subjects! His cosmic reverie at the end of the book, flat on his back on a suburban lawn, mirrors the scientific impasse. In the vision, Horgan recapitulates the entire history of the scientific revolution (growing insight, seemingly unlimited power, hubris, cosmic aloneness, etc.). As put by Conway Morris, the idea that human destiny is entirely mundane may be the most peculiar error of the moderns. The End of Science is symptomatic of that error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uneven writing.","review":"I agree with the review by rickert@acad.udallas.edu. Horgan's editorial license in describing the words and mannerisms of his interview subjects are at times downright infuriating. His dime-store explanations of complex principles is at times laughable. He merits my rating of 4 points only because he included so many of the intellectual giants of the late 20th century in his interviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new in the book - just a populistic book to make money","review":"How come that the author Horgan misses to refer to Derek J. De Solla Price - maybe the most important science historian?In his book \\"Little Science, Big Science\\", Columbia University Press (1963) De Solla Price already predicted and discussed a form of saturation of knowledge.I would recommend to read De Solla Price's books.Horgan's book is just a tabloid press book which doesn't explain anything and just ain't worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A narrow state of mind","review":"What a waste. Talking to all these highly intelligent people and framing them in such a narrow-minded structure. A more suitable subtitle would have been: \\"How John Horgan Borrowed Big Names to Spread his Limited Positivist View on the World\\". The book really tells more about the writer than about the people who have been interviewed. The conversations are flimsy, lack any depth and turn knowledgeable people into flat characters. Putting aside the issue of insights and content (Horgan just doesn't know his stuff, esp. not on philosophy) the book is not nice to read. The plot is predictable and rigid. Horgan's gospel is boring to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of science....I don't think so","review":"This is a provocative book that everyone interested in science, or interested in more general questions about the evolution of knowledge and our culture, should read. However, I wouldn't say the book is great or even that convincing in its arguments about science approaching a dead end, but nonetheless it raises important questions and gets a dialogue started. To his credit, Horgan has interviewed a number of interesting and influential scientists, and this improves the book substantially. It's pretty well-written, too. Overall, a book that will interest nearly anyone with a curious mind. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow presentation of science and limits of knowledge","review":"I did not like this book much because it presented a shallow view on scientific knowledge. He presents numerous viewpoints of others to support his viewpoints, but all this shows is that some people agree. His arguments are easily refuted. For example the whole thrust of his book is that knowledge is limited. But this isn't true. Philosophers have long known that something cannot come from nothing. Reality is eternal. It has no beginning nor end. It is infinite. Knowledge which is our interpretation of reality is also infinite. There cannot be an end to knowledge. The universe, one scientist said, is not only strange, it is stranger than we can imagine. No doubt. Horgan does not consider this, or other skeptical arguments. We are left with a biased viewpoint, that leads nowhere. Scientists, are not at the end of knowledge, but barely scraping the surface of infinite knowledge. Science may run out of money, but it can never run out of knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalists are not scientists!!!","review":"\\"The End of Science\\" is a stupid book written by a stupid science fanboy journalist with a big case of envy for Francis Fukuyama's \\"The End of History and the Last Man.\\" \\"The End of Science\\" is what happens when journalists spend so much time hanging out and fawning over scentists that they start believing they're scientists themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drek","review":"In case you've ever wondered what \\"drek\\" is, we have a fine example here. The book is bereft of intelligent analysis and is primarily a book about Horgan and his emotional state, since he has no discernible intellectual state.One reviewer called the book \\"sophomoric\\", a comment with which I disagree since I consider even that comment to be far more positive than the book merits.Horgan's basic thesis is that the major scientific fields have reached resolution aside from \\"details\\". Maybe I've missed some spectacular recent announcement but we still still have no idea what gravity is. Yes, I know it's supposed to be a function of mass (try proving that point) but that still doesn't tell us what gravity is, or why it is. Nor do we know how life began. Or what life is.Of course in Horgan's world these things are just details since the only truly important issue is his ego."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Listen, I'm a layman, although I enjoy many science-related books, and I don't agree with everything Horgan says. That being said, I find myself re-reading bits and pieces of this book all the time. If anything else, it is lively and entertaining, with really great looks at modern science's most intriguing characters. There are people behind the ideas, with all the accompanying pettiness and backstabbing and pride associated with them. If nothing else, that's a refreshing lesson, is a world in which scientists are presented as having had their theories handed down from on high. Give this book to a high school senior, which is when I first read it, and watch their interest in science bloom, not falter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is to Science what Karaoke is to Opera","review":"I'm a mathematician by trade and I feel this book grossly misrepresents what we mathematicians do and where we're going.

The most noteworthy sound bite in the book, to me, is Horgan's term Ironic Science. This seems particularly applicable in the field of physics and cosmology (with Stephen Hawking the head wizard) where string theory and multiverse theory have become the recent rages. It's like the most talented modern scientists at some juncture realized that they could either devote their careers to \\"the mere filling in of details\\" of some existing groundbreaking work such as relativity, or they could propose a truly new and probably unprovable theory that would garner some acclaim for them in a wider sphere. Naturally some of these ambitious fellows chose the latter course.

I liked them both and would recommend both.

We also see a new family living in the Chicago apartment building that Jake had lived in and it seems as though the curse still lingers there. It is up to Naoko, a relative of Kayako's, who has arrived from Japan to put an end to the curse.The Grudge 3 is surprisingly effective and a fine sequel to the Grudge trilogy. There are some genuinely creepy moments and fine performances from the lead cast. It's a bit more gruesome than the previous films (now with an R-rating) and a bit more is revealed into the Grudge curse. While not a masterpiece by any means, it's a fun little horror movie.

But this film well lets just say that i was waiting and waiting and waiting and again waiting to be scared out of my skin and well as it happens it didnt and im not afraid to walk alone in the dark. In my opinion this film could have done things alot different and alot better. But you know what this is just my point of view on the 3rd grudge film, others may have liked it alot better than i did.

The story continues with the Chicago apartment from the previous film (which I thought was the weakest part of the film). One cast member returns briefly and everyone else is new or is replaced by a new actor. I loved Kayako in the previous films, but didn't care for her in this film due to the new actress. The plot is pretty boring and at times I wanted to shut the movie off. The film also ends on a cliffhanger, which is likely to never get resolved. There are a couple special features which are pretty boring and a bunch of trailers for other films. I only recommend this film if you really love The Grudge series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Too Often To The Well","review":"I think it's time to lay the Grudge franchise to rest.This 3rd installment is poorly written, poorly acted, re-visits familiar territory and adds nothing to the legacy of the first movie.I found 2 fairly good \\"scare\\" moments in the film, but that's about it. The first Grudge film managed to be scary throughout by setting a tone and mood. The films since the first one have not been able to capture this eerie feeling.Grudge 3 just doesn't work. It's not scary, the characters are uninteresting and the new pretzel ghost can't hold a candle to the original.I found it funny that the kid ghost is now bigger, taller and has taken to wearing brown shorts. I wonder if he'll be a teenage ghost in the 4th one?The first Grudge is a horror classic as far as I'm concerned. Although the 2nd one was not bad it did not measure up to the first.

In this terribly low-budget slice of cheese, these two figures are the only demonic monsters. I hit the reject button after the main male figure becomes possessed by an evil spirit and proceeds to stab a woman who doesn'try to escape--she just cowers and watches him come toward her with the knife. And watching this happen is the heroine and child who also just stand and cower and weep. No one ever tries to escape the evil spirits. They merely bulge their eyes and freeze.

She is fearless, strong and loyal, and you can forgive her for her being a bit star struck by the aristicrats of England, although it takes Jack a bit to find his way of doing so. One of my favorite scenes is when she is caught as a stowaway on his ship, cornered by Jack, he demands her weapon, so she hurls her machete to strike the wood right near his head.

I loved the scene where they meet - she is sitting on a tree above a river and came down the river on boat. It was hilarious:) I also loved the part on the ship - although I must confess that I have a certain weakness for \`ship romances'. However, from the page where they arrive to England, the book lost its charm. All the other members of Knight family intrude, and Eden changes dramatically. I didn't like her then - she didn't seem to love Jack anymore, and I had the feeling that she was only using him to get to England - once she got there, she had no further use of him. Shame on her!Well, all turned out just fine in the end (of course), and this is still a book I will most certainly re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, contrived garbage","review":"This is not the real Trockadero.

But I must admit to being disappointed by this Harper anthology which is not all inclusive). The tales vary in length from rather long to absurdly short. Despite the author's occasional subtle humor he intrudes too much of himself into many tales, as if readers were really interested in hearing about the actual storyteller. One wonders if he were trying to curry favor with royal patronage at times. Some tales are brutal or grisly; others seem legitimate pleas for social reform. His favorite themes for general moralizing depict the dangers of excessive: greed, violence, and vanity.

The photos are lovely and present some nice ideas. Unfortunately, that's the total value of the book - some pretty pictures. The text is not particularly informative, but it does provide some basics.Of course, the greatest problem with this sort of book (even if it had been a fantastic book) is that things become outdated. A magazine on the topic, something printed last month, is far more likely to yield useful, current info.

Captain Galula was revolutionary (no pun intended) in that he broke from traditional doctrine and experimented with new concepts in a new type of warfare.This book is excellent because it reads more like a story than an instruction manual (like many counterinsurgency texts do).

The blue ball that the treat sticks in is just great for my dog to chew on. There are are slots on each side, shaped like an X. I found putting other treats (i.e. piece of a milk bone) into the center of the ball provided much more enjoyment for my dog. He has to roll it around, chew on it, slobber on it and use his paws to get the treat.Still, it's not everlasting, but I suppose every breed could have a different response to the treats.

I assumed I could place the divider right down the middle so each puppy could share in a \\"duplex\\" situation. Well, that definitely does not work. If you place the divider in the center, you have to attach it to the door. If you attach it to one side so the door can still be opened, that closed-in side becomes useless. So, I had to go Petsmart and purchase 2 additional Midwest metal dog crates. That solution works, but their play area inside the exercise pen has been dramatically reduced in size because the 2 crates take up so much more space than just the one. Later, I learned I could have purchased a three-door crate that just might have been perfect. Oh well, you learn from your mistakes.

I have rottweilers and need a sturdy crate. This is not the crate to use for anything that breathes. I had to re-enforce these crates in six places with stainless steel clips to prevent it from collapsing on itself. A stiff breeze will cause this crate to collapse in on itself. I have bought a lot of different crates over the last 20 years and I have never had to deal with such a poorly designed crate.I thought that Midwest was a reliable brand, but not any more. In the past I have been happy with my Midwest crates. I am very disappointed in the quality of these of these crates. I still have the 42\\" crates from General Cage that I bought 16 years ago. I can't imagine these crates making it a fraction of that time. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crate","review":"Bought this crate for our Golden Retriever pup when we got her at the age of 2-months. The divider was nice because you could continually make the crate the appropriate size for a growing pup. The divider was fairly easy to move, sometimes a bit of a pain as the hooks (shaped like J's) would get stuck on the crate-wires while trying to move it. It's manageable, but something easiest done on your hands and knees inside the crate. Our Golden's now 6-months and we no longer use the divider. The crate is very sturdy and it's collapsibility is great for taking it from the house to the car. We liked it so much, we bought a second to replace the other crate we had."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEFORE YOU BUY...","review":"This crate was cheaper than most other crates but after I opened it, I saw why.

Arrived generally when expected. Box wasn't too beat up.Product:pro- easy to set up.pro- the size, doors, plastic tray, divider. Just what we needed.con- missing spots of black paint here and there; some look like chips, some look like they were simply never sprayed with the paint. Thankfully we won't be using this extensively, so we don't have to worry about wear/rust around the latches or base.con- the sides and doors don't quite line up. I have to press the bottom with my foot, in order to get the top latch to line up; the whole side is a smidge askew. We've tried to fix it, but there was no way to shift the grating straight.

The crate rusted and left stains on my carpeting.I have switched to an enclosed, plastic airline crate and she no longer urinates, doesn't escape and is much, much calmer.

The cage comes with a divider which works out great to keep the living space puppy size for now with room to grow. The hard plastic pan is smooth & appears to be of good quality & is easy to work with. There are also two plastic handles which snap on to the cage which makes it easy to carry like a large briefcase. There are two latches on each door & they have been working well for us.

The adjustable divider is helpful for my puppy so he doesn't soil in his crate during his housebreaking training. I bought a Lixit water bottle for him to sip on throughout the day and it doesn't spill or take up any room inside the crate. I think this crate is well worth the $28 I paid for it.

For me, I find it a bit too heavy to carry, but that's about my only negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I found the crate to be well built and a good value for the price that I paid. The divider allows me to make the crate just big enough for her as she grows to discourage her from soiling her bed.

Now just three months into use it is unsafe to continue to use. The clips can be popped off by my puppy who tries to eat them. Not only that the front door never sat quite right and just continues to get worse. At this point my puppy can pop it right off. Last it is rusting out all over the place which makes no sense since we use it in our sun room not outside. I wish now we would have bought two plastic crates (we bought our other puppy a plastic one which has held up great). I am so disappointed in this product which now needs to be replaced.

The FedX guy was still in the driveway and I had him take a look - the pan for the bottom has a gash//crack in it and that makes it useless and frankly dangerous for a puppy.The gauge of the wires is superior to most, which is why I ordered it. However, due to it arriving damaged I had to beat feet for another one here in town and I'm not happy about that, not as sturdy.Sort of defeated the purpose of ordering to save some money and time.

The moveable wall inside makes it easy for potty training. They do fold fairly flat and without too much trouble. We like that the pan in the bottom slides out for cleaning. My only issue is that Midwest doesn't make a crate cover for this size crate. They make a cover for their 35 inch crate that is exactly one inch smaller in each dimension. Unfortunately the 35 inch crate doesn't have a moveable wall for potty training. Too bad because if you try and find a cover to fit this 36 inch crate you'll pay at least 60 bucks.

I am returning this item, a big hassle to repack! and I've been waiting for a week now for UPS to show up to get it.

This cage was great when my puppy was little, but now that he's grown into it, he can break out really easily because the hooks don't line up properly. The bars also bend really easily, so now that he's been pushing on the inside of it, it's even more difficult to get it set back up once he gets out. I spent a substantial amount of money on this, and now I'm going to have to go buy a new cage (that will probably be more expensive) just because this one couldn't hold up to a 35lb puppy. I definitely wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless product, worthless seller","review":"This product arrived defective. It is supposed to be a foldable wire crate.

Also comes with detachable handle bars for carrying the crate.

I got this to keep them from chewing through it and it definitely worked. It literally took about 2 minutes to set up, it is pre-assambled, you just need to stand it up. It has a front and a side door. it has plenty of room for both of my pit bull mixes. It is a bit cumbersome if you have to move it but it isn't really meant to be portable.

He was waiting by the door for us when we got home. We feel lucky that he didn't harm himself in the process. The wire gammetts used for attachment are weak and the wire cage is bendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"From an Exhibitor... dont buy these.","review":"These are the worst crates I have ever owned. I bought 6 of these crates for home and travel (I have shown and owned dogs for 15+years). These crates are flimsy, the tabs ment to hold them together slip- two of these have collapsed with my dogs inside of them. I do love the size of these crates (more of a square than rectangle)but now have just zip tied them together to remain stationary. The clips that hold them together when they are folded bend and warp and get caught on everything. I will never stray again from precision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our 40lb beagle/lab mix","review":"When we brought our puppy home from the shelter, we ran out and bought a crate that we had high hopes would fit him for awhile. That lasted about 2 months before he couldn't sit up without having to duck his head. We found this larger crate online for a great price and decided to jump on it. We've used it for 3 months now and it's great. The door on the end sticks a bit, so we're mainly using the door on the long face now. Construction is solid. Our now 10 month old pup spends the work day in here and so far, we haven't had any trouble with it. He's topped out on his growing trend, so this crate should continue to be his home for many years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great crate","review":"This crate is perfect for my 30 lb shepherd mix.

This crate was such a great price on Amazon, and although it was considerably heavier than I imagined, it was easy to \\"assemble,\\" which basically consists of popping it up.

It's working well so far for my 11-week-old puppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midwest Life Stages, average crate","review":"Well, this is my second crate (a replacement) and I'm not pleased with the quality (AT ALL). The first crate was bent due to shippng and the new crate door hindges are not tight. The puppy scrathes at the door and the latch comes slidding across making it possible for him to get out when he is home alone. Also the crate has these latches that stick out next to the tray and are very annoying, things always get stuck on them, i.e. shoe laces, cords, tripping hazard!. They don't fold up and stay there. These are the latches to hold the crate closed when you are traveling or to fold the crate up and hide it away somewhere. The price was nice. But sometimes, you get what you pay for. I would not buy this product again. Nor would I recommend a friend to buy it either. I only kept it because it is a hassle to take this thing back to the post office to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"If you are trying to keep your dog from peeing or pooping in the house these are probably the best crates to buy. It's convenient, and works. We started by blocking off part of the crate for our mini schnauzer when he was a puppy and 3 monts later we have opened it up to full size. He knows when he goes in there that it is bed time, and he won't use the bathroom inside of it. It has helped us tremendously. I highly recommend this product for these reasons. Plus having two doors on the crate makes placement in your house a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Deal","review":"Found this to be very good quality made and also easy to open and close for storage.

Glad I purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"The crate is good, the bottom tray is not so good","review":"We used this to keep 2 puppies full-time in from the age of 3 weeks up to 5-6 months and part-time now, when they are 8 months old.I have no major issues with the cage. It was relatively easy to unfold, the wires are strong and the 2 doors are most convenient. They allowed us to set it up in a such a way that one door was open against a regular dog house while the other door was the exit. This way, our 2 puppies had a 2-room apartment with the crate as the dining room/living room while the dog house was the bedroom. It worked well.The only issue I have is the bottom tray. While it's convenient and allows for easy cleaning, the plastic is quite thin and, eventually it cracked. We are still using the crate and the dogs return to it to sleep at night - with the door open - but... the tray IS cracked and I expect it to completely fall apart within a month or 2. When that happens the crate will have no floor and we'll have to think of a solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I bought this for my pug and he loves it!

After reading other reviews this seemed like an average to above average kennel at a great price. Good news! The good reviews were actually correct. Out of the box it's easy to set up. It snapped together well and didn't need any additional support like zip-ties, as some people have mentioned. It turned out larger than I had pictured so now both my dogs, a beagle and pitbull, snuggle together in it and even hang out inside it when it's not time to \\"kennel up.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for all dogs in this weight class","review":"I just adopted a 45 pound redtick coonhound and he cannot comfortably stand up in this size crate.

But there is one thing that i did not like and that is the fact that the divider was REALLY difficult to get in there. its almost too small. but other then that its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice crate","review":"I adopted an Australian shepherd puppy, and bought a crate from the pet store that would be way too small for his adult size (30\\" x 18\\"), so I had to get a bigger crate. I bought this one in the 36\\" x 27\\" size and it's working out wonderfully! My dog can comfortably sit, stand, lie down, etc. in it, and he's very comfortable. For the price, this crate is very sturdy. The only issue I've had is that the latches on the doors are a bit tough to close. You just have to push down on the doors to make them fit, though, so this isn't a huge problem for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not recommended for a new puppy","review":"I purchased this crate and paid for Saturday delivery so that I could have it for my new 7 week old puppy. The crate is good quality and will likely serve us well as the dog grows, but I cannot use it yet. The problem is that the gaps between wires are too wide, allowing a small puppy (or small breed dog) to get his teeth and jaws through them - with the strong liklihood of injuring himself or traumatizing himself by becoming stuck that way.I had to rush out the same day to a local store and purchase a smaller \\"travel crate\\" with smaller wire openings in the door. He will stay in that until he outgrows it.**EDIT**It would be only fair of me to say that once my dog grew enough to avoid the hazards mentioned above, this is a great product. The crate is very durable and safe and has served us and our large German Shepherd very well for the first year of his life. We still use it daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"Well made, went together perfectly.

It doesn't fold up very well, the door is bent (and I can't seem to get it straight) so i have to force the locks, and the hinge that's supposed to hold the pan in place drops down sometimes. After it fell one time, my dog was able to move the pan over a few inches, then scratch to bits a 6\\" by 2' area of my hardwood floor.It works well enough, but it is not worth $92. go spend a few more dollars and get one that won't have issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a good crate for big dogs","review":"We got this crate for our great dane puppy. She outgrew the kennel we had and knew we needed something that would accommodate her as she grew to her full size.

There is also a tray that is easy to slide out and clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"Really does a nice job of keeping our beagle safe and secure.

I can't believe we received it Fed Ex in only 4 days from the day we ordered it. The shipping was free. It is 24\\" X 18\\" by 21\\" tall. It is for our little chihuahua. The crate may seem big for such a small dog, but we bought her a big bed which is like a donut and she can snuggle up on the bottom of it. Plus she will be getting bigger. She is only 10 weeks old now and weights 2 3/4 pounds. Plus we always have the divider which can make the cage a little smaller. We originally ordered the Extra Small cage which midwest recommended for chihuahua's which was 21\\" X 13\\" X 16\\" tall, but her bed didn't fit in it, so we returned it to Amazon and got this one. She really loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth it!","review":"After shopping around at pet stores in my area, I decided to check on-line for a large crate for our new dog. I'm glad I did since I found this one from Midlife Stages for much less than what they are priced in stores. Shipping was free and on time. The best thing was I didn't have to haul it home myself! Our dog loves it and makes a great 'den' for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great crate, great price","review":"Arrived quickly. Just as described. Easy to put together and works great for our dog.

I probably could have used a size smaller but I needed the height of this one, 31\\". He has plenty of room to stand with head held high and move around. The double doors are wonderful. It makes it nice to be able to place it where ever you need it. It was easy to assemble. This is my first crate for my almost 1 yr old dog. Haven't shut him up in it yet, so can't say much about the strength of the crate. He will go in and lay down with the door open so he must like it so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for large dogs","review":"I bought the 48\\"L x 30\\"W x 33\\"H for our bullmastiff/lab mix. She doesn't particularly care to be crated but it's needed to keep her out of trouble while we are out running errands. First time we left her in it she was able to bring the walls down and escape. We put it back together and started using cable ties on all the corners. Solved the escaping problem for about 2 weeks but then she bent the bars around the door up so much she's able to jiggle the door until it opens. I come home to a free dog with a slipper in her mouth. For a determined dog with any strength this is worthless and flimsy! I suppose it would be just fine for a smaller breed or a puppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"30x21x24 Crate","review":"Overall good deal. I like (personal taste) the black finish vs the typical gold I saw everywhere else. It folds up nice to tuck under a bed or for traveling as well. The plastic pan is nice since it seems to have more rubber than brittle hard plastic in its composition. Folding and setup is quick and solid. The one smaller end door is a little off so you have to pick it up a little to slide the latch. Again, not a big deal since most I have had are like that. It is simply bend metal rods that comprise this crate vs a residential door. Little nails are still loud but it is typical of any crate pan. I always place a smaller doggie bed for comfort since my little princess is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dog crate","review":"I got this for my German Shepherd/Blue Heeler mix and he's about 32 lbs. He's tall and skinny and this cage is the perfect size for him to stand, turn around, and lay down comfortably. There's not enough room for him to go to the bathroom, and it really helps him feel calmer (he has a lot of anxiety). I like that there are two entrances/exits even though I mainly use just one. The only problem, which I think occurred during packaging, is that it was really hard to pull up and towards me. It was hooked to itself on all sides, and I had to take each side apart just to get it to a point where I could pull it towards me easily. I've never had that problem before in any other crates I've bought for my smaller dogs, so I think it may have just been an anomaly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all","review":"I wouldn't recommend this cage for any dogs with reasonable strength. So far my black lab has broken out twice. The first time she managed to make the front part unlatch and fall in so to fix that I ziptied it all along the sides and top. Today I came home to find that she literally broke the main latch off the door, it snapped at the welds. So now I'm in the process of adhering that back on but overall I'm severely disappointed with this cage. She's been able to bend several of the bars in different locations so it's obviously not made out of the best materials but for the price I expected better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with treasured insights","review":"Now available in a new and updated second edition, Compassionate Living: Everyday Spirituality is a gentle, humorous, compelling and practical guide to living a truly spiritual life.

Mr. Dickey provides a very lucid account of the experiences of several westerners living (or passing through) different countries of the middle east, in the process shedding light both on the indigenous cultures as well as the one they create for themselves once there.The only reservation I have about the book (and it does not take away from its overall merits) is that Mr. Dickey's singular window into the lives of non-Arab expats is not matched by any similar insights into the lives of Arab expatriates. This glosses over the rainbow of cultures which exist in most of the Gulf countries, and often impede many westerners from being able to appreciate the diversity that awaits them.Overall, an easy, engrossing read... with wonderful anecdotes and a singular view into a group of people which most people are not even aware exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS IN SPANISH !","review":"IN THIS ALBUM DON'T MATTER IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT SHE SAID I FEEL SO PROUD TO KNOW SPANISH AND SHE IS FROM Canary Islands and her song talk about love etc...she is amazing if somebody can translate this song would be GREAT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Win Win Investment","review":"I have spent a lot of money and time with attorneys,etc. to put together a sound and productive estate plan.

By the middle/end of the book, I wasn't emotionally invested in any of the characters; which is a shame because the author uses every dramatic tactic in attempt to pull the reader in.The story isn't told in chronological order. The multi-generational storytelling and over-dramatics makes this a draining read.This story is a lazy mix of \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" and \\"Scarface\\".I wouldn't prevent anyone from reading this book, I just wouldn't recommend it.
