I was very pleased when I finally did. I have read numerous books on Le Mans through the years, but this is absolutely the best. Some tend to be too laborious, but Laban's book strikes a near perfect balance in its quest to cover the whole history of Le Mans since 1923. It kept me engaged throughout as I discovered details that I hadn't known, yet it was perfect for anyone who is even casually interested in this great and historic race. At a very reasonable price with great photos and organized text that enabled the reader to keep up with details. I loved the size and the layout and the quality of stock was spot on.

This book at least was written while Amy was young and in prison so she was much more humble and I feel, honest. It is well written and pretty interesting. I definitely learned a lot about the escort industry...whether I ever wanted to or not!

The title was rather misleading, especially since 'they' came during the day as well. The movie spent way too much time on weak romantic character development and not enough time on suspense or scares - unless you are frightened by rustling leaves and shaking branches. Without the usual formula of naked women, gore, or scares to hold your attention, not sure what the intended purpose of this B-movie was. The whole thing seemed rushed, and frankly, I was in a hurry for it to be over as well. The premise and appearance of the creatures ripped off Predator.

To this end, the author does a somewhat good job. He really does spend a lot of time explaining how irrelevant and/or incorrect his survey predecessors are. Ostrogovsky gets a good pummeling throughout the book. But the fact of the matter is, Treadgold never does much of a convincing job in explaining how any of his positions are even different from Ostrogovsky's, let alone more correct.At the same time, Treadgold every so often indulges in Christian Apologia -- explaining why this or that heinous action by Christians was inevitable or done to save the religion, etc. I don't mind that kind of thing too much, but it does feel very jarring in the middle of a history survey text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for better","review":"Trims well in detail places without guide.Does poorly with uneven cut on heavy beard.Tines on guide are wide, tend to push beard down instead of combing through.Will not make a heavy cut.OK for travel kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really what I ordered....","review":"too expensive, found for less on other sites.

When my wife and I saw this matchbox set discounted at a toys-r-us before Christmas we knew he'd love it.This is part of Matchbox's Hero City line and features a neat haunted house set-up as a car is elevated to the top, travels across a bridge held by a skeletal hand, then rotates inside the house and down a platform, then pivots and travels along it's way with a helpful shove from a ghost, all with spooky sounds playing. My son just loves it. It's eay to assemble and the only problem I found is that when it has to rotate in the upper room of the house, the mechanism sometimes becomes jammed but it's easily corrected.A fun toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"super fun and cool","review":"This is so cool.

Ideas discussed in this book are very complex, yet broken down very well into understandable chunks. Still, a general backround in the physical sciences is necessary to really grasp what he's saying. One way he makes ideas understandable is by using simple analogies. For example, he is talking about how as the universe expands, all bodies around the earth move away from it, making it seem like we really are the center of the universe. However, he clears this up by offering the analogy of a balloon being blown up that has dots all over it. From the perspective of any dot, all the other dots are moving away from it and there really is no center. I found it to be a fast read, but one that I wanted to go over once again just to understand things better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must be nice to be this smart","review":"Hawking is a miracle.

One can guess the mystery, though clues are rare, but the author presents a double-whammy ending that blows you away. Unfortunately, it's a bit disturbing. The title is key to understanding Miss Pym, so-called expert on psychology. However, I think there's another explanation for her \\"action.\\" After all, she could have acted again. So, to understand the book (whether this is what Tey meant or not), consider that individuals have styles of activity including: compromise, negotiation, directive, collaborative, & avoidance in varying measure. Usually one predominates. Seems to me that the last one predominates here. From a moral point of view (let alone legal), it also seems to me that the book demonstrates the risk of playing God.

All these songs feel so good to listen to. I think this is the CD that the two of them were at there absolute BEST. Overall I rank this one in my Top 10 Blues CD's that I own.

This complete album was made in November 1957 and is typical of what they were doing at this time. By typical I don't mean average, but very good. The material tends toward folk blues - older styles, traditional verses, etc. JOHN HENRY gets yet another treatment and OLD JABO, a minstrel tune, also appears. Sonny sings a tribute to Huddie Ledbetter (\\"Leadbelly\\") in BEST OF FRIENDS, a tune he also recorded on the Bluesville label. Although nothing here really jumps out and bangs you on the head in ecstasy, everything is done professionally and consistently well.

Very cheap manufacturing, especially for a toy geared towards little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS TOY","review":"First of all, DO NOT pay anything more than the $19.99 that Toys R Us asks for this item in the store. It's not remotely worth $20, but at least you won't go broke for the 2 days your child will be able to play with it before it breaks. My 2 yr old ADORED this toy but the first one broke (the shaft snapped in two when he tripped while holding it) within 5 days of opening it, and like a fool I bought him another. That one didn't last 48 hrs. (the shaft broke again, this time when he dropped it... from about a foot off the ground.) And thank goodness Toys R Us has a generous return policy and gave me my money back both times. Do your research before you purchase this. The internet is filled with horrible reviews of this product. My son is crushed that he lost his favorite toy -twice- and I'm angry at the manufacturer for making such a shoddy product. Save yourself some money and save your child some heartbreak."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Junk!","review":"My son got this and & the leaf blower for his birthday and less than 15 minutes after it was opened, it was broken at the extension point.

He has a blast with the leaf blower but I am not thrilled with Toys R Us and probably won't shop there anymore. Extremely poor customer service.

I saw the reviews that said the shaft breaks and it is just down right not durable. I convinced myself to buy it by thinking, \\"Our kid isn't destructive with toys.....and it would really make him happy. I'll take my chance that maybe the others who commented just received a lemon\\" Well, sure enough, the shaft broke by New Year's Day and to this day the weed wacker is covered with gray duck tape just to keep the thing together. Bottom line, it is a fun toy, but it is made so extremely bad. Bummer. Read the reviews before purchasing this product, they are real and they will save you money. I notice that John Deere has a trimmer out this year. I believe I may look into the John Deere for this Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible durrability","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this toy due to the price but I knew my son would absolutely love it. From the time he opened it he ran around and pretended to weed eat like daddy, unfortunately it lasted less than a day. The weed eater shaft has a push button lock that allows it to collapse and expand. Initially, I thought it was a decent idea but after playing with it for about 4 hours the shaft detached from the motor and exposed the wire that runs to the end of the unit. Once this wire becomes detached, the unit will no longer make any noise or do anything. I would be reluctant to buy this product but if you do, I would highly recommend using plastic epoxy or super glue around the collapsible portion of the shaft to keep it from pulling apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"At first I was very excited to get this toy as a Christmas gift for my Grandson, however when he opened the package he was so excited to get the weed timmer and while Daddy took it out of the box it fell apart.

While I was waiting on the replacement from the company I found the exact same toy on line from Toys R Us for $30.00 less than I paid for it.

It was never dropped or mistreated. It just stops working! It is only a matter of time, I'm sure, before this one stops. I am not an idiot for buying #3. When your 2 year old looks at you with tears in their eyes because their toy won't work, it kinda tugs at your heart-strings! It is crazy that this toy will not last longer than it has for us.

I don't know anything about the author, but I would bet my next paycheck that she's never been overweight. She's completely clueless. To top it off, the entire book was written by somebody with what seems to be multiple personality syndrome.

It's rolling right along with the lives of Jemima and Ben with the author letting you get inside of their heads and up pops Brad and Jenny. This is when the story totally broke down for me. I can understand Jemima having to come to terms with how she wants to live her life but this was a little over the top. By the time the author works through this she has only a few pages to wrap up the life of the heroine and add a one page epilogue. Disappointing to say the least.

It was a fun read, I found myself flying through the end desperately trying to find out what was going to happen to the loveable main character, Jemima Jones.I would NOT recommend this book to my \\"chick-lit\\" obsessed friends though because of the unrealistic way the character is completely OBSESSED with food and then goes in completely opposite direction, which anyone who is signficantly overweight knows that it is HIGHLY unlikely for that to happen. (And according to the back cover, JJ is 100 lbs. overweight)It seems as though this book was written by a skinny author with skinny friends who really didn't know or never will know what it is like to be that overweight.

The perspective, alternating between first and third person, was confusing and ineffective. The plot was terribly obvious and predictable, from the third page on there was no suspense. And, moreover, it was insulting to overweight individuals, the concept that someone who loves a large person must have a fetish and be ill, that Jemima can only be sociable once she has lost weight, that someone who was supposedly close to her didn't even recognize her (3 times!) after she lost a few pounds. This book is pathetic, it fails to be inspiring, or even mildly entertaining.

Watch Harold and Maude instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down, BUT...","review":"It's an odd thing about this book: the \\"fat\\" Jemima J (who at 217 pounds wouldn't exactly be freakishly obese), is a richly detailed, likable character. The thin Jemima is nauseatingly perfect, and has no sense of humor. And every character other than Jemima is completely two-dimensional--everyone is either great or awful. And why does \\"fat\\" Jemima have to be such a loser? Sheeeesh! Most fat girls have more than two friends. This book is really clever at the beginning, but it turns into Harlequin drivel about halfway in. The ending was so dull and predictable it drove me nuts. And here's my biggest issue with \\"Jemima J.\\" Why couldn't she have just become a fat swan? If Jemima is so gorgeous when she's thin, chances are she was pretty when she was fat, too. This book is going to make a lot of women feel bad about their bodies, even though it tries not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting both to intellect as well as morality","review":"This book starts out promisingly, with the voice of a woman who feels invisible due to her body. I really wanted this book to be good but it was awful. The book was predictable, the literary device of switching from 1st, 2nd, 3rd person was terribly applied (didn't really make sense and you lose the momentum very quickly). I can't believe this book got past the editors. The plot was contrived and terrible, and the last 2/3rds of the book were shallow and repetitive - every other adjective was \\"beautiful\\", \\"stunning\\", and \\"gorgeous\\". This book disrespects and insults women of all sizes, not just overweight women. I had to finish the book for hope of some kind of redemption of character. Finding nothing, threw the book across the room in disgust.If you want a book written with a more respectful voice, read Lady Oracle by Margaret Atwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR IS TOO HIGH","review":"This book was awful. The twists and turns the title character went on -- simply ridiculous.Anyone with a weight issue -- forget that-- with a brain will be sorry they wasted their time.The character in ONE SECOND goes from being 100 pounds overweight to normal size... basically never to binge again and to proslytize to any one who will listen now that she is model pretty.I could go on and on about how bad this book was...(Switching first person to third person, \\"thin\\" plot lines, 1 dimensional characters.)I too, was deeply looking forward to a plus size heroine... but the fact that this was not the case was only one small (no pun intended) component of why this book is not worth your bucks.-- keep looking... pass this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weighty disappointment","review":"I was excited to start this book, thinking back on the recent crop of British 20 something stories that have entered the market. This book was a real disappointment. The most annoying part of this book is the way the author narrates from time to time, explaining the upcoming scene or the characters' feelings, in third person. The story is thin and predictable and the characters are one dimensional. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A happily married fat chick's review","review":"I'm ordinarily a huge fan of chick lit and cute, fun, escapist novels. Jemima J is not cute or fun; it is vile, revolting, and vacuous.Jemima J, the story's miserable and annoyingly neurotic heroine, is 5'7\\" and 217 pounds, and according to Jane Green, this is a disgusting, fat-lady-in-the-circus type of weight. Jemima loses 100 pounds in 3 months, and her life, which had previously been pathetic and loveless, becomes perfect.Oh Jane Green, thank you so much for writing this book! I now realize that if I were a less disgusting person with one iota of willpower, I, too, could lose weight at an alarmingly unhealthy rate! I see now that as a fat person, I am pathetic and unworthy of love! My appearance is all that matters to anyone! You have shown me the light...NOT!!!!!Anyone intelligent would never get drawn into this book, with its superficial, insulting ideals. Skip this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked Naomi Campbell's ghostwritten \\"Swan\\" ...","review":"This was perhaps the worst book I've ever read in my life. It occurred to me that the author is either a lifelong shut-in or 12-year-old girl recording the dialogs between her Barbie dolls.Lest you think I'm a bad sport with no sense for the whimsical, I do recommend it. But read it for comedic value only (and then do it at your own risk)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and frothy","review":"Probbaly more like a three and a half star but I will average up.Don't read this book if you are expecting something educational, something that you will think about, or something that you would unabashedly recommend to your friends.But if you are looking for something fun and light, then you will enjoy this book.Jemima J is definitely a flawed personality who desperately needs to learn that what is inside is much more valuable than outside. Nonetheless, we still feel sympathy for her and can enjoy her adventures as she uses online dating to meet the man of her dreams and how she eventually comes to terms with herself and her friends.Yes, it probably sends bad messages about body image but lets hope that's not why you are reading it.Still very fun and a great escape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat and alone .......to semi-skinny and in love","review":"I LOVED this book, I started reading the first chapter and I found myself obsessed. I couldn't put it down I read the whole thing in one day. Though the story itself gets a bit confusing on the ideas of body image. I still felt connected to Jemima through out the entire novel and I saw a lot of myself in her. For any woman who has ever felt that she was less than, this book is absolutely perfect to read. And if you're a woman that has and an online love afair good or bad you will get a kick and perhaps a cry out of it feeling the personal details of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will not read this author AGAIN!","review":"Instead of saying that this is a novel about \\"ugly ducklings and swans\\" why don't they just say \\"this is a novel about fat people and skinny people?\\" Jane Green has committed a major blunder for womankind with the writing of this book. The plot is stupid: fat girl falls in love with hot guy..loses weight so he (according to her) will love her....etc. etc. (don't want to give away the whole story...) Yes, I read it very quickly, but only because I wanted to see what stupid thing would happen next. (And believe me, stupid things run RAMPANT in this story).This story thrives on the principle that you need to be skinny & beautiful in order to have friends, boyfriends, a good job, a sex life, etc. This is not how the world works. I am offended that a woman would write such a novel like this.Yeah, it's just a story, but why write something so unrealistic that it just winds up sounding stupid?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lame Cinderella story","review":"I plodded through this book in the hopes that it would eventually become interesting. It never did. The author tries to knock-off \\"Bridget Jones,\\" but the title character, Jemima J, never develops enough charm to make her somebody you'd want to root for. In fact, she's a rather dull and very unrealistic character...the woman lacks basic common sense, yet the author wants us to believe she's above average intelligence. Nothing about the story makes sense, and it's far too unexciting to ever be considered a fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.","review":"When I'm told that Jemima is GROSSLY overweight (\\"At least 100 pounds!!\\"), and basically spends all of her time fondling her mountains of flab and stuffing bacon into her hole, and not being able to walk a few feet without stopping for a breath, I figured that she had to be over 300. How surprised was I to find out that she was supposed to be 217. Add to my overall astonishment and horror the fact that she lost 80 pounds in three months, with only one passing comment from the author about how unhealthy it is to crash diet and work out obsessively. The message is clear. Fat is bad. Skinny is good, no matter how you get there. Good job, Jane Green. You're obviously a much smarter woman than I, a simple American. Oh, wait--a simple thick headed American.Save your money. Better yet--wait till this nonsense is made into a movie, with some rail thin actress in a fat suit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is such an awesome book!","review":"I have read this book so many times and I'm still not sick of it!

Anything is possible and this book tells you all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning - mediocre ending","review":"I loved the first half of this book - I couldn't put it down. As a somewhat overweight twentysomething, I could identify with most of what the character was going through. The second half, and especially the ending, was not as nearly as good. Overally though, it was enjoyable - fast and fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"Jemima J caught my eye right off. Standing in the bookstore reading the back cover i knew this book was for me. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. I immediatly conncected with Jemima Jones. This book has several twists and turns. I ablsolutely loved the last page (epilogue) of the book, I read it three times. This book is for anyone that is or has been a larger lady. Jemima Jones is someone that you can relate to. This is a completely excellect book.

A great read for people who like chatting on the internet, thart's what made me pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"This book is so completely stupid that I can't believe it ever got to print. I found it at the library. I was looking for something more like Bridget Jones Diary. This was not it. It doesn't seem like the writer took more time to write it than it would to read it. It's so crass, offensive, and misogynistic that it's stunning. I didn't even make it to the end. Men don't write such hateful books about themselves so why do women? I'll never understand. I will keep this review short as another reviewer who made a point by point analysis really did it best. I just wanted to throw my two cents and one star in."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"I should have read these comments before ever wasting money. Surely the Author Jane Green cant be proud of her work?! Can she? This was a horribly written book, weak story line, and seemed to just end abruptly as if Jane Green got tired of writing it. I know I got tired of reading it. Seriously, there are parts left out it seems. Richard - Ben's best friend - introduced quickly and then out just as quick. I dont get it. PLEASE save your money, and more importantly your time and pass on this one. You wont regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"373 pages of rubbish","review":"i picked up this book based on some of the amazon reviews. i was expecting a funny, brit-wit kind of read. this book feeds into the theory that if you starve yourself, dye your hair blonde and buy trendy clothes, men will want to date you. i tried to be neutral about it, but even when Jemima gets down to 120 lbs, she is still as insecure as when she was overweight. and the male characters don't do anything to win over our favors. don't waste the money on this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME READING THIS!?","review":"If you are interested in reading an unrealistic story about a poor fat girl who suddenly becomes thin and thus, happy, ...well, this book would still be terrible. I'm just glad i checked it out of the library and didn't waste money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent writing, but awful book.....","review":"I was stunned by the thinly veiled message here that fat is simply unacceptable. Jemima is badly dressed, unhappy and overlooked as a fat woman -- and suddenly becomes chic and people love her when she's thin.... This is just part of the anorexia train..... Not a power book for women AT ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put Down","review":"I don't necessarily like the writing style in that the author switches from 1st person to 3d person, but the plot is great. I couldn't put it down because I couldn't wait to find out what would happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"The constant shifting of tense and person just annoyed the heck out of me with this book, which is pretty significant, considering how annoyed I was by the premise in general. The book was insulting at best. I agree with the other reviewers who recommended Jennifer Weiner's *Good in Bed* as a better alternative -- after Jemima J, you'll need a good dose of Weiner's Cannie to bring you back to your senses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This book is truly amazing. It's for light reading and it's quirky. It's easy reading and I can't wait for Jane Green's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, clever, and inspiring story!","review":"I have really enjoyed all of Jane Green's books, but this is my absolute favorite! I think every woman can relate to the body image and weight issues that Jemima deals with, and the plot has some very interesting twists as you go along. It's well worth reading and making part of your home library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Fabulous Read","review":"This book was a fantastic and quick read. I adore Jane Green's writing style and her characters in this book are so easy to like! Everyone, both 'singletons' or 'marrieds', will appreciate Jemima J's trials and tribulations. I picked this book up in an airport while stuck on a layover--knowing nothing about it at all--and found it to be a great treat. I've already loaned my copy to a friend and recommended it to 2 others. I can't wait to devour all of Jane Green's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great twist","review":"At first, i thought the book would be another pointless story about a miserable over wieght woman but i was wrong. The book had wonderful unsuspecting twist and turns to it. I would have never thought of putting such complicated but yet simply and logical twist to it. Once i got to the climax i couldnt put it down. I became jumpie and overwhelmed with anticipation to know what would happen next. The book is very well written and has a very good lesson to learn. Needless to say, i have very high recommendations concerning this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let your daughter read this book","review":"Even though this book is British, it can still be obtained in the U.S. and cause detrimental effects on younger and even older women. In this book it seems that an eating disorder is glorified, and that by becoming thin one is happy. Only in the epilogue does the author state that now Jemima is a \\"normal\\" size, a 10,and she is extremely happy. Why couldn't she attain her goals when she was overweight? And how bad is it for girls to read that a boy didn't like her when she was overweight but feel in love with the skinny version???"},{"rating":"1","title":"book gives a horrible message","review":"I have to admit-I almost couldn't put this book down. I felt that I identified with the \\"first Jemima\\"-that is the heavy one. But I really resented the fact that as soon as Jemima lost weight, Ben-the love of her life, became interested in her. This can really make women feel that weight is everything. It doesn't teach you that being thin will not always make you happy. I resent that. The book would have been so much more realistic if Ben didn't like her despite her losing weight. Coming from someone with an eating disorder, this book can really encourage a girl to stay or become anorexic or bulimic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh puhleeze!!!","review":"Ok, so I bought Jemima J thinking that it would be a book about overcoming your insecurites as a woman. If I had none that this would have been such a blatant [copy] of the Diary of Bridget Jones (even their last names are the same) I would not have bothered. Both books are about young overweight women in England who are searching for love while trying to find a better occupation. Could Jane Green be jealous of Helen Fieldings' success? I think so, because what other reason would she have for writing the uncreative and dull jemima j? Borrow it from the library if you are really that interested and have nothing else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I totally identified with Jemima J.","review":"Being an avid internet user as well as single and on the heavy side, I was able to quickly identify with the main character. The book touched on a few issues such as, self perception, self esteem and the perils of dating men you meet from chatting on the internet. Jemima J. is a quick read and you will find yourself routing for the Jemima as she discovers herself and her the true meaning of love in the age of technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely enjoyable!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's just a bit of a departure from the slew of single women books that are following in Bridget Jones' footsteps. It takes quite a while for JJ to get as ballsy (can I say that?), as Bridget is from the beginning. JJ has weight issues, confidence issues, men issues, food issues - she's just sort of a mess. But all of those things and more are part of her charm. I could completely relate to her, although I've never had to fight the weight problems to quite the extent that she did.I appreciate that JJ doesn't really do things right, but who does? She does learn and so do the rest of us. Don't expect any great moral lesson, just a tiny one but it's still important. Confidence in oneself and your own self worth are very valuable, no matter your size."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know why everyone is complaining it is a fun book.","review":"I ahve read this book a couple times and have lent it out to a bunch of my teammates. These are girls ranging from 305 pounds all the way down to 105 pounds and they all loved it. It isn't a book that is going to change your life or anything but it is most defiantly a fun read and interesting story and totally worth the money.People complain about how Jemima is portrayed in the book as being soooo fat no one could love her. The thing is Jemima see her self in these negative ways. As she begins to be more confident in her self and gains some friends other can't help but love you. It is a message for everyone that once you love yourself others will love you.A fun story about love, life, london, and L.A. All the importants Ls in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I loved this book and couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting. It is a perfect light, entertaining read for the summer. I actually reread it recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way past a little unbelievable....","review":"This could have been a great story...unfortunately, it was ruined for me by a completely implausible plot. When Jemima loses weight (and shows signs of a serious eating disorder) she appears to lose her mind as well....how else to explain her relationship with Brad? I greatly enjoy creative stories, but this book was completely unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read, but rather heinous","review":"I bought this book in London to read on the the 15 hour flight back to the states. I finished it on the plane. It was a rather quick and painless read, but oh so lame. I felt that women were depicted very poorly, especially overweight women. Green harldy touches on the self-esteem/mental side of being overweight, and chooses to focus instead on the more shallow aspects (i.e. thin = happy, love, money). I didn't HATE the book, but I felt it was poorly written, and many of the characters were undefined. JJ was very unlikable because she was so shallow. A decent book to read if you have several hours to kill and there is nothing better around. Otherwise, avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and insulting","review":"This book is insulting to all full figured women. She never loved herself as she was - she had to get skinny (in an unhealthy way) to appreciate herself. She was fine the way she was (and 217 lbs on a 5'7\\" frame is not \\"100 lbs overweight\\"). Jemima (sorry - could not STAND the name, reminded me of bottled syrup) never suffered the consequences of starving herself and over - exercising. Any woman engaging in that behavior would have collapsed or lost hair. If you want to read an empowering book, read \\"Good in Bed\\". Forget this pap."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This book was not worth the time. Characters are not developed, writing is flighty. Reminds me of jr. high fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"oops, again??","review":"first, when i read this book, i found myself in this book.jemima j was quite similar.. no, she was just same with me.i expected some curvy or over weighted girls(women, anyway) to be proud of their own selves at the end of this story.but, oh gosh, it's again..why do those writers always think ONLY slim, well, SKINNY women can make men's knee to be weak??jemima takes some serious diet, she is eventually being skinny.i'm so exhausted by this kinda story. really enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"Why oh why do people like this? This is the most narrow-minded book I have ever read! According to Jane Green, fat women are unattractive, which means that they can't have good jobs, boyfriends and a life. I have a lot of great overweight friends. They are all confident and have lives. Oh, and I also hate the stereotypes in this book. For instance, she says that Americans are thick-headed. I so disagree with that ignorant statement. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not worth the time or money.","review":"This book was horrible. I have to say it is the worst book I have ever read in my life. I picked it up because it had a good point. 'Big girl meets guy on internet and loses weight. Then realize that the guy she should have been with would have excepted her big.' But the story was all wrong. It was painful to keep reading it. I had to skip a few pages. That's how boring it was. I do not recommend this book to anyone. It is truly a boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to chime in.....","review":"Read it in 2 days and was sorry I did. I too skipped pages, as a previous reviewer mentioned, and it made no impact on the predictable and boring storyline. If you're a real, intelligent woman with an actual life please skip this book. PLEASE no more \\"single-chick\\" books, esp. those set in the UK - the British witticisms and jargon are not nearly enough to save these stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am a big fan of the new escapist Cinderella genre, but this book is the worst I've ever read. The characters are beyond one-dimensional -- in fact, they are defined 100% by their appearances. Pretty strange for a book in which the ostensible theme is that appearances shouldn't matter. Even if you are just looking for mindless fluff (and, I say, there is nothing wrong with that), you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books i've ever read","review":"it's been awhile since i read this book but i remember being severely disappointed; aside from the story being completely unrealistic, it ends with a muddy fairy tale wrap up that reinforces the idea that losing weight and changing herself to capture a man was exactly the right solution, though it wasn't the man who inspired her to do it in the first place.dumb, dumb, dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it out after reading it!","review":"I found this book to be very insulting to larger sized women. I bought it because it seemed like it would be light hearted and uplifting. NOPE!

A definate must not read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Jane Green Novel","review":"I have read many of jane green books with my first book being babyville, Straight Talking & others... Jane Green books really didn\`t account as great books but its kind of entertaining... But for Jemima J, which I had read about a year ago & still leaves a very deep impression for me, Ms Green scored it! I was so captivated by Jemima and her obession of being skinny that I found myself laughing out loud & cheering for Jemima many a times. The ending was believable too which I\`m sure will be inspiring for all. I hope Ms Green will continue to produce works having the same brillance of Jemima J... A GEM! I Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Message clear","review":"I love this book! I have read it more than once and never get tired of it. I found JJ to be a wonderful person inside and out. There is no doubt in my mind that JJ's true love, also loved her when she is just Jemima. The book doesn't center much on the progression of feelings on his part, as there are only slight hints.This book is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nellie's review","review":"well written - i really like her writing. very much my style and I am an actress and writer. it's chick-lit, but not in any way sappy or Harlequin romance-ish, which I find in some chick-lit, and that is not modern. Jane is - a modern woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"When I picked this book up I didn't want to really read another Bridget Jones wannabe. Neither did I want to be depressed by the hard luck story of a misunderstood fat girl. This book was neither of these. The story was light, original, and more than a little bit inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This book is incredible-I simply couldn't get enough of it! The minute I finished it, I ran to the bookstore to buy another title by Jane Green! I will definately read everything this woman writes from here on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, full of cliches and predictable","review":"My interest was high when I spotted this book. I am a woman-of-size who has a lifetime of experiences making peace (or not) with my size. But after a few pages, I was disappointed by the bad writing, trite scenarios, and unrealistic dialog. The idea of a big woman as heroine is great, but this vehicle was not my cup of tea (sorry, Jemima)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great holiday read!","review":"This is a third book by Jane Green for me and I loved them all. I am now looking forward to Straight Talking, Jane's first novel. JJ is so much like many of us and if she can do it so can we!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern-Day Cinderella Story!","review":"This book was the best one I've read in ages. I loved the way Jemima matured in this book, realizing that all is not what it seems, especially in the world of images. This character gives the single woman with the not-so-perfect figure a fresh new perspective on what's really important in the world. I loved the way the words illustrated this woman's transformation. If only everyone could have such an experience -- it would make for a lot less therapy bills. The author should be applauded for bringing this character full-circle. I have never read a book from cover to cover in less than 24 hours, yet I just couldn't put this one down. I just HAD to know what was going to happen next! For the record, I'm anxiously awaiting the next book about this character. She should definitely be a series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's different.","review":"I liked the book. Sure it had its low points but overall it was a good book. It shows you that if you love how you look then that's all that matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book","review":"I was told to read this book by several of my friends, who had to read it for a class as a reading requirement. I think they truly believe I will be like Jemima and end up meeting a man on the Internet and fall for him. I see this book is a sort-of take on Cinderella, with twists thrown in. The author makes a social statement with Jemima's transformation, and her new found attention because of her new thin appearance. This is her way of showing that society is too concerned with physical appearance than the true character of a person. And I'll admit, I'm a sucker for a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virginal Fat Chicks? No WAY!","review":"This novel is clearly is based on the Bridget Jonesian model but with a supposedly new and different twist: Jemima J is fat; the stereotypical fat woman at that. She eats constantly, has no life, has no friends. And why is that? Because at 5'9\\" she weighes 200lbs. That's about a size 16. 100 lbs overweight indeed! A woman at 5'9\\" could not survive at the \\"ideal\\" weight, not to mention the book advocates using anorectic methods of weightloss. She works out to exhaustion, skips meals, etcetera, in search of a more socially acceptable body. I'd like a to read a book that questions the system that makes a woman feel inadequate when she is a size 16, like the majority of American women are. If you are fat this book will bum you out. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly","review":"This book was silly & unrealistic. It was an easy read & entertaining enough to read all the way through but that isn't saying much since I hardly ever decide not to finish a book. I doubt Jane Green has ever been in a book store in LA since she thinks the chain book stores sell nothing but books on the film industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"great light reading","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It hooked me from the very beginning. I learned of this book in a list entiled Beyond Bridget Jones....and I'm so glad I looked at that list. Jemima is a heroine I could really root for, and identify with. I could relate to how she felt living life as a larger woman, and the way you still feel even after losing the weight. I've already shared this book with a friend of mine, and she is enjoying it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beach read only","review":"Predictable, cliche-ridden but a quick read. Written mostly in the first-person from Jemima's perspective, the book occasionally lapses into a greek-chorus-like third-person omnicient which can be intrusive and ruins the flow of the book. It's as if the author knew she was writing a slim fantasy and wanted to give it some moral or literary heft by using this device.And if you have ever lived in Los Angeles, prepare for some unintended laughs - inexplicable geography and lazy stereotyping of LA denizens.That being said, Jemima J. is a nice, light little fairy tale. I really didn't hate it - it just doesn't stand out from the rest of the single-gal books out there, or add anything to the genre. And the fact that all of the major characters either are or become physically stunning totally contradicts the supposed theme that beauty isn't everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but...very odd","review":"This book is very readable, but at time to time it reads very srangely. Its told in first person, then third person, and some of the plot left a yukky taste in my mouth,and was quite disbelieving. It's quite a sophomore effort from Jane Green, and lets hope with more writing practice she gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I liked the book, but the author has no idea what it is like to be a fat person. i weigh in at about 200 lb and i don't think i am 100 lb over weight (which is what the author says jemmia is) if jemmia weighed only 100 lb for her height she would be sick not healthy. i also don't think people stare at me like i am a big gross blob, i know i am over weight but 200 lb is not that big as the author makes it out to be. go to a web sight and type in jemmima's height and it will tell you she should weigh around 160 not 100"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this got published.","review":"I'm nearly finished this disaster of a \\"book\\". Green writes one-dimensionally with flat humor and broad, BROAD stereotypes. For instance, her heroine is up to here w/ dumb, fitness-obsessed, dim-witted, culture-deprived, sarcastic-less Angelenos (can't remember the last time I heard that word used). Come to think of it, I think Green throws in all of America into most of those stereotypes.Green switches from first to third person throughout the book; not only does it lead to a rocky read; it's just bad form. It's really, really bad.And, while I can agree w/ another review that mentioned the initial potential of Jemima Jones. It fizzles quickly.This book is literary nails on a chalkboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written","review":"I didn't think the plot was very well developed, and I didn't particularly buy into the assumptions underlying the story, but all would have been forgiven if the novel had been witty and well executed. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book ever","review":"This was the most disgusting piece of trash that I've ever read in my life and believe me I plan to never read anything by this author again. This book doesn't deserve one star but since thats the lowest on amazon one can give a book I'll go with that. For some people who think twilight books are horrible this just shows you it can be worst with an author that doesn't research, stereotypes throughout a book about Americans, being overweigh, people in general.I don't know why some authors think that they can write trash like this and called it literature this novel is not witty or romantic in any way just a pathetic excuse of writing.Although this is the 1st book of the authors I've read it is also my last. My hard earn dollars are not going to be spend in anyway to help this women write more nasty crazy etc.. books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"this is by far one of the worst books i have ever read. totally [dissatisfied]bridget jones, minus all the talent, humor, sparkle, wit, and writing skills of ms. fielding. the style of \\"jemima j.\\" reminds me of some really unintelligent high school kid who aspires to be danielle steel. but even this one probably has some sense of tension, action twists, etc. the cliches are packed by dozens on each page -- fat girl turn thin girl, heart of gold throughout, good gorgeous guy (i feel faint every time i read \\"ben's looks\\", \\"because ben is so handsome\\" -- this is the most extravagant description of ben-being-pretty in the book, btw), bad gorgeous guy, two nasty roommates, blah blah blah. and of course, in spite of the writer's intentions to show beauty under layers of fat, it's all about how life is good only when you are pencil-thin. oh, this stupid book made me so mad. though the message is not as infuriariating as the lack of talent it displays in every single line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"The mere indication that overweight women dont have a social life and need to starve themselves to have a great love affair makes me sick to my stomach as did this book. And what was with speaking in second and third person? If you pick this one up .PUT IT BACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"I just read my first Jane Green novel, Mr. Maybe, and I really enjoyed it, so I thought that I would enjoy Jemima J as well. What a disappointment! It keeps switching back and forth between the first person and third person, which really kills the flow of the story. The main character has no personality and no friends, until she loses weight. All the characters are one dimensional and shallow. The plot is not very believable. The author keeps saying how beautiful and fit the women in Los Angeles are, so why would the \\"gorgeous\\" gym owner, who has access to these beautiful, fit women all day long, need to go on the internet to find a beautiful, fit woman? It just doesn't make sense.Skip this book and read Mr. Maybe. Or better yet, go back and reread the Bridget Jones books. They are way more entertaining, even the second or third time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common ground","review":"I guess the reason I loved this book so much, and have read it at least 3 times in the past year, has something to do with the fact that I can imagine myself as the character, Jemima. Being overweight and trying to lose enough to get the guy of your dreams isn't as easy as she made it seem, but either way, I loved the book, and I plan on reading it yet again. I love the story, and how she makes her journey towards happiness. Everyone knows what's going to happen at the end, as usual with any love story, but the story that takes you to the end is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Even Finish It!","review":"Being that I could not force myself to waste another minute of my life and finish Jemima Jones, I might not be the best reviewer. Once I decided to quit reading it, I felt myself being shallowly pulled towards it. Though, when I considered the completely unrealistic plot and annoying tense shifts, the pulls weakened. The character transformation of Jemima Jones was laughable. A woman who could never control her eating habits suddenly becomes practically anorexic in the name of an online love! It would take a little more motivation than that to completely reverse all your bad habits and food mentality. Don't waste your time on this book. I suggest \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" and \\"Bridget Jones': The Edge of Reason.\\" They are so much better than this fairy tale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will make you smile","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of a friend.I'm glad I took her advice. Jemima J is a book that was easy to relate to, and made me smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I loved this book! As an overweight young person struggling to lose weight, I found this book to be relatable and inspriring. While parts of the book are a stretch, one must keep in mind that is is a work of fiction, others are examples of life where you can say \\"Yeah, Ive been there!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect romantic comedy","review":"I read Jemima J last year and have since recommended it to all my friends. It's a very entertaining and funny book. Jane Green has a great sense of pacing, and this book moves well from the first page.Jemima is a character so many real women can relate to - smart, funny, talented, overweight, and surrounded by ridiculously skinny people. She is a character you root for throughout the whole book. My friends and I are still talking about the twists and turns this book has to offer. All the characters are well developed, and it's not everyday that a book makes me giggle outloud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"If you are more than 10 lbs. overweight, I suggest staying away from this book. When the author first described Jemima, I expected her to be around a size 24 and over 300 lbs, only to find out Jemima is 5'7 and a little over 200lbs--not thin, but definitely not a beached whale!Jane Green shows she has absolutely no idea what it is like to be overweight. The way Jemima J is written, you'd think Jemima just likes food. In reality, people who overeat to such a large extent usually have an emotional reason for eating--don't expect to see any sort of realism in this book.Also, the way the book is written is terrible. It constantly jumps from 1st person to 3rd person, and it does not compliment the book stylistically. The characters are uninteresting (even Jemima J has no personality) and there really is no point in reading the book. If you want a fun book about young English women, try Bridget Jones or Confessions of a Shopaholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Unrealistic","review":"Even if this story is supposed to resemble the Cinderella fairy tale, the plot is still overly exaggerated. First off, there is no way Jemima could have lost that much weight in such a short amount of time. Second, the prince charming parallels are rather rediculous. I understand the point that Green was trying to convey through this story- that good things can happen to anyone, no matter who or what they look like- but the story does not support this idea. Green is telling her readers that essentially they have to become the picture of perfection first before dreams start to come true. It is books/movies/images like this that help give woman such low self esteems. Writers should be focusing on characters that are real, and who stay real. NOt ones that submerge themselves into crash diets, and then find that life suddenly turns perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCRUB YOUR GROUT INSTEAD","review":"As a mother of 3, my reading time is so precious and I can't tell you how robbed I felt when I finished this book. The first few (very few) chapters were promising. It seemed Ms. Green really had some insight to the weight issue but, unfortunately, it took a downhill turn and spiraled into an unrealistic, shallow and just plain STUPID story! I believe Ms. Green wanted to write a message along the lines of \\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\", \\"beauty is only skin-deep\\", etc., but she constantly contradicted herself and ultimately sent the message that you DO have to be thin to be worthy.There are too many good books in the world to spend your precious time or money on this one. Scrub your grout instead ~ it'll be more enjoyable and at least you'll feel like you've done something worthwhile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers with _no taste_ agree...this book is great!","review":"A more brain-numbing waste of my time could not be found. The three days I spent struggling with the vacuous, vapid Jemima J were horrendous. When I first saw the book, it seemed an interesting premise. (What was that Mom said about not judging a book by...oh, never mind) Then, it became everything that could possibly be horrible about a \\"feel good fat chick\\" book. The characters in the novel had as much depth as each separate page of this drivel-ridden book. Green seemed to plod through her book, writing only what would be expected in a Book Like This (oh look, she really *was* pretty under all that fat!). I would have rather read an Oprah Book Club book. <<shiver>>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and offensive","review":"Please, please, please don't read this book. If you are larger than a size 2 you will want to throw yourself out the window by the time you've reached the third chapter. This is so offensive and mean-spirited. The main character is described as a gigantic, disgusting, sex-depraved (she's so fat and ugly no man would even touch her) hideous beast of a woman. She has no friends. She eats like 15 bacon sandwiches for a mid-morning snack. She is so fat and lazy she can barely stand up and walk across the room to answer the ringing phone. Then they tell you how much she weighs. She's 200 pounds, 5'7, and a size 14. Um, excuse me, that's NOT that fat. Not at all.If you want to read a good \\"big girl\\" novel that's not offensive and that will touch your spirit, read The Next Big Thing by Johanna edwards, Good in Bed by Jennier Weiner, or Inappropriate Men by Stacy Balis. All so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Being a horizontally challenged woman my entire life, I was looking forward to cracking open this book and finding a kindred spirit in Jemima. What I found was a grossly exagerated character created by someone who has obviously never been fat a day in her life and cannot even imagine successfully what it might be like.Poorly written, boring at best (had to FORCE myself to finish just to see how this travesty would end) and laughable...but not in a GOOD way.Not to ruin the ending because you're not going to waste your money on this book anyway, but Jemima's life ends up hunky-dory after she starves herself, loses all of that disgusting weight and gets the guy of her dreams (who ignored her when she WAS fat). GREAT MESSAGE JANE!!!!!If you want a free copy I suggest you visit a landfill in Illinois where mine is probably resting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Not recommended for impressionable audiences","review":"This novel has a negative message about loosing weight for the wrong reasons. Reading this book will give you poor self esteem based on the way that \\"fat\\" people are portrayed in this book. In my opinion there are no possitive messages in this book. How many times does the ugly duckling into a man seeking swan scenario have to play out in novels that are geared towards women. There is no room for diversity in this book so if you do not fit into the western media idiology of what is beautiful dont read this book, it might make you depressed. Why does Jemima's character need a man so bad? This book is reinforcing the idea that women arent good enough the way they are and that they need to change in order to be accepted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing!","review":"Honestly, one of the worst books I have ever read. Jemima, completely obsessed with food--so much that she eats 2 bacon sandwiches on her way to work every morning--suddenly does a complete 180 overnight and drops 100 lbs over the course of a couple months. Her regimen? Eat iceberg lettuce and exercise 2 hours a day, at least. Then, and only then, does she find true love (sigh).In the beginning of the book, I was quickly bored by Jemima's whining (and Green's writing). By the end of the book, if I had to read one more chapter about Brad and Jemima's daily routine of coffee, rollerblading, or what a beautiful couple everyone thought they were, I was going to scream. The book could have easily been 50 pages shorter.A complete waste of time. A poor excuse for \\"chick lit\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible for your self esteem...","review":"I feel like I have two reviews of this book depending on how much I actually think about it. The first review is my opinion when I don't look too deeply into the book. It's cute, irritating sometimes with the change in narration (from first person to third) and overall a no brainer beach read.My second review goes something like this.---Possible Spoiler---Fat girl loves incredibly gorgeous boy, boy doesn't notice girl, girl loses 100 pounds, boy falls in love with girl, they get married and live happily ever after.How's that for a message sent in a book? Be thin or else you'll live a miserable lonely life.Overall I can think of better books to spend your time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Losing Weight Mean Losing Character?","review":"This book began with so much potential. Jemima J was witty, amusing and any woman could relate to her on some level. But once our heroine looses the weight she also lost her personality and became a bland woman with nothing else on her mind besides men and food.Besides the unfolding of this story, another problem I had with this book was how it made anorexia seem so normal and even necessary for weight loss. And the fact that men were attracted to her once she became so thin that she attained a \\"boyish\\" figure was a disturbing, yet untrue, message.Sorry Jane Green, but Jemima J was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Read....If You're 12","review":"I bought this book shortly after the \\"Bridgit Jones\\" phenom, thinking it would be a fun read.Wrong! I was reading books with more intellect and better writing styles than \\"Jemima J\\" when I was 12. To make a long story short, it's a very bland read with a forgettable character, an unreal plot (Jemima drops 100 lbs. in three months), and dialogue that is so bad it's almost amusing.Jane Green is making a small fortune writing awful books. If you're over the age of 14, hopefully you'll be smart enough not to contribute to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother....Bridget is far superior!!","review":"Being a loyal fan of Bridget Jones, I was interested in reading something that claimed to be similar in nature. I thought it was a decent story, but as people have already mentioned, quite unrealistic (which, granted books don't have to be), but the idea of losing that much weight in such a short time is unsafe and unlikely...and let's be honest, the skin doesn't follow that quickly. I can understand the appeal of the \\"ugly duckling\\" becoming a \\"swan\\"...who hasn't wished the same thing? However, beyond the unbelievable story, I found the writing style distracting and at times unbearable. Stick with Bridget, she is much funnier and Helen is a far superior writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits Amazingly Close to Home","review":"When you first pick up the book, and start reading the pages you'll find yourself a tad bit lost. Maybe it's just me, but I did. She changes the tenses and sometimes speaks directly to you.However in the end this is a great book which has simply put a smile on my face, tears in my eyes, and a warm fuzzy feeling in my heart.For anybody who has ever been overweight, been told they would look wonderful if they \\"lost a few pounds,\\" or thought they'd get somewhere if they were skinney needs to read this book.It's renewed my faith in men, let alone myself.Brilliantly amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There goes another 11.95 I'll never get back...","review":"This novel started out with good intentions, but then exploded in a fiery useless flame by chapter two. I finished the whole thing hoping and praying that it would get better, but alas it was all in vain. I'm not sure what message this book is trying to get across, but whatever it was, it landed a few miles short of it's destination. If you think that snagging a good looking television star boyfriend and becoming a \\"curvaceous\\" size ten is the road to happiness, then this book is for you. However if you crave anything semi-substantial or meaningful in your literature, stear clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone.","review":"I didn't really enjoy this book. It wasn't particulary wellwritten and I found the constant switching from first to thirdand even second persons to be rather annoying. I would notrecommend this book to those who have little patience for authorswho have not honed their writing skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Book!","review":"When I first started reading this book, I had a hard time getting into it because the beginning is a little slow, but as soon as the plot started to thicken and I learned more and more about all the characters I couldn't put it down. I put this 300+ page book away in 2 days, and was craving more! Jemima became a real person to me, and I felt like a fly on the wall in every situation she was in. I would love to see Jane Green turn Jemima's story into a series of books. I can't wait to read more from her! A++"},{"rating":"1","title":"you can pass on this one...","review":"after hearing from several of my friends that i'm going to \\"love this book\\" and i won't be able to put it down, i decide to read it, having borrowed it from a coworker. i realized very quickly how easy it was for me to skim over pages at a time. (mind you, i NEVER skim books) the first/third person switch was not well done, and it was highly annoying when, in the third person, the author would write \\"jemima jones\\" or \\"ben williams\\" redundantly over sentences. basically i felt that most of the story written in third person could already have been understood by the reader. i really didn't see the point in having both third and first person narratives.it was lighthearted and an easy read. if you're not looking for substance, then it's a decent book. but there's definitely better ones out there.just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Green's books are the best!","review":"I absolutely loved this book and found it extremely hard to put down. I loved everything about it, and actually found myself becoming the character. The book puts you in the best mood, and makes you feel like you can do anything. This is a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most entertaining reads","review":"First off, I loved this book. Yes, it was unrealistic on the surface, but when you dug deeper most women can relate to it. I think people are looking at it differently. It doesn't mean that you have to lose weight to get a man, but that you need only be who you truly are. She lost the weight, but didn't get what she really wanted or needed. She had to find herself and love herself first, and when she did that, then and only then, did she find true happiness. Loved the story. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I thought this book was kind of an insult to larger women. Obviously the author is not one, and it showed. The ending said Jemima is now a size 10, a voluptuous woman. Since when is size 10 considered voluptuous?"},{"rating":"1","title":"some cheese with your whine?","review":"For all of you who are whining about Ben only liking JJ after she lost weight - here's a newsflash: SHE liked HIM because he was physically fit and attractive! The book is not saying that overweight people can't find love at all, just that they can't find it with a hottie unless the hottie is into large women. Why is that so difficult to understand? We are hardwired to admire physical attractiveness - and physically unattractive people will generally not be able to pair up with those who are, and they should not whine about it, because they are liking those people for how THEY look! It's pure hypocrisy. I had absolutely no problem with this book's take on the issue, I thought it was spot on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable, yet worthwhile","review":"This book was recommended to me by my therapist (how typical), and has provided yet another stepping stone on my path through treatment of an eating disorder. Although the book was rather predictable and at times downright cheesy, it was very refreshing, and reminds the reader that looks alone are usually deceiving. Jemima is an overweight young woman struggling to hide behind her 'fat suit' and keep relationships at a safe distance. When she begins starving herself and obsessively exercising to lose weight, she realizes that although being thin does make life easier in some ways, it really complicates it in other ways.I would warn those who may also be recovering from an eating disorder that I found this book to be very triggering, and it poses great potential to instigate a relapse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major mixed messages","review":"I love this sort of single-girl Brit-fic, so I was really looking forward to Jemima J. I was incredibly disappointed, however, to discover that the author seems to have missed the point of her own message. Yes, Jemima undergoes the transformation that's standard for these heroines, but she is rewarded ONLY because she's now thin, not because she's become a stronger, more confident person. Her \\"happy ending\\" is happy because her secret crush finally notices her...because she's thin! Besides the stereotypical presentation of a fat woman who has no life, no friends and no personality until she loses weight, the pathetic codicil at the end of the book assuring readers that Jemima eats \\"what she wants, when she wants...in moderation\\" feels like a tacked-on legal disclaimer. Green's breezy prose only partially masks the questionable underpinnings of her plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"It is obvious to me from reading this book that the author has never been fat and that she believes that skinny equals happy. As a fat and happy girl I was offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"What a complete bunch of drivel. The writing was boring and rudimentary. The story was predictable and vapid. The characters are thoroughly unlikeable and shallow. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good but Might Work if You Must Have A Bridget Stand-in","review":"I picked up this book because I was missing a good book on sex and the single life. However, that is not what I got. The author and publisher are feverishly exploiting the Bridget Jones inspired Sex and the Single London life craze. The book doesn't pass muster on any level -- story-telling, narrative, characters, etc. Its not horrible and I got through it but I want to agree with some of the other reviews here, it could have been much better. Most annoying was the switching randomly back and forth between first and third person. And the final plots twists were so nonsensical as to defy even the wildest imagination. A good Cinderella story it is not--but if nothing else is around and you have to read about a young woman living in London--it might do."},{"rating":"1","title":"could we have more stereotypes in one book?","review":"I recently discovered Second Chances by Jane Green and liked the book so I was pleased to find this one but wow.....basically if you are a fat girl you have 3 double chins, could never have had a boyfriend, and are boring. The twist in the book was ok but little else was the roomates are vapid copies of ugly step sisters and the two girl friends of our lead are interesting relationships for what they play in the book but there isn't enough time spent on developing a likability and really the overall message is excessive exercise and dangerous near anorexia eating habits pay off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escapist Chick Lit, About Average for the Genre","review":"A fluffy, chick lit book in the same vein asBridget Jones's Diary(right down the last name!) about love, weightloss (and gain) and the typical chick-lit fare. All in all, it was fun, but in an odd writing style, switching from first, to second, to third person P.O.V. willy-nilly. This really grated on my nerves and detracted from the rather lighthearted story. I have read a few of her other books in the past, and didn't recall this as an issue... This just wouldn't be my go-to choice for a light, romantic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the movie...?","review":"I read this a few years back. I found it totally engrossing and found myself assigning actors to the various characters in the book, something I do often if the story merits it. Jemima J would make the perfect romantic comedy film. The characters were believably flawed yet endearing. Thanks, Ms. Green for a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I found myself starting to like the characters in this book, but I at the same time I found myself disliking the author...if that makes any sense. I don't think she really had a sense of what she was talking about, maybe those who have never been obese shouldn't try to explain it. Also, I didn't like the overall morale of the story...I you do something dangerous that could cause you serious health problems but makes you thin, all your dreams will come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Her","review":"Jemima J is full of characters that I love to hate and hate to love. The characters were written about in a way that made me feel like I was walking down a street in London with them. While Jemima's drastic weight loss was hard to believe, the story stayed true to its characters. Jemima's character showed the readers that no although she was thin, things werent as perfect as she always expected they would be. Although the book seemed to have an awkward writing style, I found myself totally engrossed in her life and couldnt wait to turn the page to see what would happen next. A great brit girl novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"I was so excited to read this book, as it seemed like something I could relate to and enjoy. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Yes, I finished the book (record time = EASY reading), but I was frustrated with it all the way through. The switch from first to third person storytelling was annoying, and the writing seemed either condescending or ... does the author really think we are idiots? I guess she chose this style intentionally, but - why? Plus, I think it sends a bad message about women, men, image... believe me, I like Cinderella stories as much as the next person (probably more), but this just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter waste of time","review":"What a disappointment. The story starts out nice, but turns into a complete farce. From 200 plus pounds to 120 in 3 months?? Give me a freaking break. And not only does the heroine drop weight in the blink of an eye, she's **gasp** the most beautiful person in the world and **gasp** every single man who meets her must have her. Whatever. Thin people should do a little bit more research before they decide to write a \\"fat girl\\" book. There's just too many of us who are going through it to buy into this ... .Do youself a favor and read \\"Getting over it\\" or \\"Good in Bed\\". Those are worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody rubbish... is that English enough?","review":"It started out unintentional enough; mildly offensive, but this type book usually does have a slight glaring edge when written by someone who has never experienced a true weight problem.Most disturbing is the mantra it seems to drill into your head - no man will ever want you for who you are. It's OK for a daft idiot of a man to ignore you while you're a \\"fatty\\", only to discover that you really are a human being now that you're obsessively, unhealthily skinny. Oh my, you're actually worth loving now that you're thin. Yes, that's the message in a sad little nutshell.What a load of crap.Ladies, if you're reading this book and you feel you are overweight, BURN YOUR COPY immediately!!!! You are wonderful and beautiful and worthy of everything good in life. This book will not pick you up - it will tear you down. Certainly we should all strive to be healthy, but at what cost? Never at losing your self-respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Excellent","review":"This is such a page turning, satisfying, brit-chick-book. Jemima (JJ) is a character you cannot help but to cheer for, cry with, laugh with and love. JJ transforms her body for an internet mystery man half way around the world, when her heart is truly on a man right in her own world. Although the man over seas turns out to be -- well, not what he appears, he may be the best thing to ever happen to Jemima. As does her trip to LA. For not all fairy tales become reaility, but sometimes, life can be just like a dream. And in the case of Jemima, the reader cannot help but to want it to. Jemima is a real, intelligent captivating character who anyone can relate to. This is a great pick-me-up book with laughs, tears of joy, and appreciation for the new genre of brit-feel good books. I recommend it to anyone who wants a light but satisfying and delicious read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green believes that love and obesity are mutually exclusive","review":"Jemima only fulfills her dreams of love after she loses weight and gets surgery. What kind of message is that to the world? She is still the same kind, loving person as she was when she was fat, but it is only when she is beautiful as well that she gets the man of her dreams. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quick Read","review":"Its a wonderfully insightful book that is also a delightfully quick read. I read the book in just a few days and had a hard time putting it down. The author has a deep understanding what overweight girls are thinking about as you delve into her thoughts, but she also does something I found clever. She takes us outside of Jemima to see what others are thinking and feeling. As the reader, we not only get to follow Jemima through her struggles, we get to see all the other character's struggles with their own lives. It also has an interesting ending, let's just say it pleasantly surprised me. Its not often that I am surprised by an ending, usually you have it all figured out in the beginning. This was a good afternoon read if you like a fun romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I expected a lot more from this book but was left disappointed. The pages went on and on without an end in sight, so I started skipping to the end just to see what would happen. The fact that Jemima lost 100 pounds in three months was so unrealistic and unhealthy. For everyone who has ever dieted, you know that's impossible. I recently purchased two other Jane Green books - Mr. Maybe and Bookends - and am hoping those don't leave me disappointed as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Bridget Jones . . .","review":"At first glance, this book seems to be just a Bridget Jones knock-off. After all, it's about an overweight, British twenty-something who's in love with a gorgeous man on the job. (In fact, Jemima's last name is Jones!) But, there are subtle differences that make this book better. First, Jemima seems to be much more self-confident than Bridget, which is refreshing. Although she'd love to be thin, she recognizes her own attractiveness as well as her writing talents. Also, she isn't nearly as obsessive as Bridget. (No counting calories and cigarettes in this one.) What kept me from giving the book a five star rating is the fact that somehow Jemima loses 100 pounds in three months--not realistic. Also, the plot unravels very strangely towards the end. But, overall it was an entertaining read that gives a great glimpse into how society treats overweight people."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're A Sucker For Romance....","review":"...then this is the book for you! I definitely have to agree with \\"KO\\"...it's a light read and written in a very unique way! I thoroughly enjoyed it! Might be unrealistic, but then again, novels are escapism anyway, right? So, just throw sense of reality to the wind and just go with this book. It was definitely not a disappointment for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape into her world!","review":"Jemima JThis beach read was a true \\"thoughtless\\" pleasure for me to turn the pages of. Jemima J is not the most realistic character in the world, as she looses a massive amount of weight in a short period of time, but Jemima is someone whom everyone can identify with. Jemima longs for a man, for whom she feels she can not have (Ben Williams) because of her outward appearance. Jemima is a writer in a small paper that has dreams of becoming something else. Jemima meets a man, whose outward appearance is what she dreams of, but inside may not be what she needs. Jemima has a great friend (Geraldine) who is a 100% supportive fabulous friend, but Jemima is so very envious of what Geraldine looks like. Everywoman struggles with all of these things.This writer did not seem to intend to make this a book you had to ponder though, but intended this book to be an easy read. I loved it! This book took me away from my present and let me escape into the world of Jemima!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrealistic ....but then again it is fiction!","review":"Jane Greene may not be the best author when it comes to literary styles and organization, but the book was really funny & very enjoyable. I could not put this book down. I read it instead of watching t.v. or going out.True, the book isn't very well researched ---I mean if you lose over 100 pounds you are going to to have stretch marks. Also, the plot involving the Californian hunk was very weak.Overall, this book was not meant to be over analyzed. It's in the \\"pink book\\" genre as I say. This book takes you away from reality and is a page turner. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read - US readers keep size diffs in mind though..","review":"My sister loaned me this book and I tore through it in two days. I did think the end bit was a little low-key, but for the most part it was an enjoyable read.Just a note to United States readers: Keep in mind that sizes run DIFFERENTLY in the UK than here in the States - so when Jemima is described as a size 10, that's a UK size 10, which is probably more like a US 12/14 judging from my experiences shopping in London! (could be sort of depressing really...although London does have GREAT clothes!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not think the ending was at all fulfilling. I liked it until the last 75 pages or so. I was very disappointed from that point. I wish I would have just stopped reading it, I would find it more fulfilling to have not had the experience of the disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this book sold even 1 copy - to me!","review":"Other women I know liked this book. We are no longer friends.I, in fact, was sucked in my the \\"chick lit\\" friendly cover, thinking I was about to read something of the caliber of Laurie Notaro or Amy Sohn. I was sorely wrong. It was awful, horrible, disgusting. The worst piece of trash I've read EVER. The only reason why I read about 60% of the stupid book is because I would toss it away in disgust, follow it up with disbelief, which led me to pick the freaking thing up again, read more, then repeat the process all over again. What I have left is a worthless, terribly battered copy of this book and an extremely bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly disappointing in both craft and story","review":"From our first glimpse of Jemima, we are led to believe she is grotesquely obese. She is dripping with fat and food rolls down her FOUR chins. Later on, however, we learn that Jemima weighs only two-hundred and seventeen pounds. This is a terrible dramatization on the author's part. It is fiction, but a story set in such realistic places with realistic personalities should at least LOOK realistic. This story sends the wrong message: if you weigh more than one hundred and twenty pounds, you have no life and no one could possibly love you.The writing was good in spots, but I found it to be confusing with such rapid changes in points of view, many times without any warning. This book was a complete waste of reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Several people recommended this book to me, and as I am British and usually love the 'chick lit' books I tried it. I was so disappointed! Is this what feminism, choice and tolerance means to twenty year olds? The theme of this story is fat girl gets thin and wins the man of her dreams. Not exactly a cry for feminine independence and such a waste of a good story. The author also has an irritating habit of dropping in on the narration and telling the reader what is going to happen next, or what the reader should be thinking. This made me feel even more distanced from the characters who seemed pretty shallow anyway and it annoyed me that the author didn't allow me to make up my own mind. The women are drawn much better than the men and the hero did nothing for me-why couldn't he have appreciated the heroine when she was fat? She was still the same person. Read Marian Keyes, Sophie Kinsella, and of course, Helen Fielding for much better takes on the lives of a British twenty something."},{"rating":"1","title":"if I could choose zero stars, I would.","review":"Yes, it's that bad. It may actually be one of the worst books I've ever read. Not only are all the characters completely unrealistic and two-dimensional, but the \\"message\\" of the book is horribly vile and vapid.I was initially intrigued by the premise--a commentary about body size and social status, and of exploring the idea of online love connections. But, this book told us that if you're fat, then you will have no friends, no professional future, no love life, but if you starve yourself and lie to become what you've previously scorned (airheaded social climbers), then everything will pretty much turn out great!I really liked Bridget Jones, Good In Bed, and other books of this genre (British working girl in her thirties, having a life, being funny), but this is bad, bad, bad. Please don't waste your time or money on this trash. You'd be better off with a Harlequin romance. For real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what the world needs....","review":"Something else to tell women that fat = horrible lonely person and skinny = beautiful wonderful person. Sheesh... Isn't there enough self-loathing brought on by the rest of the pop-media? Women of any weight and age don't need such a petty narrow-minded mirror to hold up to themselves. I would give it 0 stars if I could. And its not even well written, to boot... or should I say boot-cut jean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Message","review":"While it was an easy read, it wasn't even worth the short time it took to get through it. The heroine, if you can call her that, is obsessed with her looks and had nothing else to offer the reader. The way she loses weight screams \\"eating disorder\\", but is not really addressed in the book. When she starts her diet plan she is doing it all for men. She doesn't do it for herself at all. She is descibed as hideous but when she loses weight she is beutiful. I think that some people would see her bueaty despite the weight. I would not recommend this book. It is very insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good chick book","review":"This book kept my attention the whole way through. I never got bored with the story, and I think Jemima is a girl that many of us can relate to... always wanting something that never seems to be there. I would recommend this book, as well as author, to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. Is it great literature? Of course not, and it doesn't pretend to be. I read some of the reviews and wondered at the review that said her anorexic sister recommended it and anorexics are the only ones who could relate? Excuse me? The woman was overweight; overweight women can relate to how she felt when she was heavy and how she felt when she lost the weight. That review also decried the book and its style. It's not Anna Karenina and if you thought it was, I think the cover alone would have cleared that up. Let's review books for actual content and not just try to be clever and see our name in print. Great light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Oh please..this book was awful. Only if you get thin will you be happy and get prince charming? It just feeds into the horrible lookist society we are in. The writing was not terrible which disappointed me even more...it could have been a better book..if she hadn't copped out. Soo depressing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CurlyD","review":"I have never written a review before, however, after reading the reviews for Jemima J. I felt compelled to write one. I really couldn't finish reading Jemima J. I was drawn in by the simple fact that it reminded me of Bridget Jones's Diary. However, don't be fooled. Bridget, no matter how over weight wasn't as pathetic as Jemima. Bridget was easy to read and so funny, I really didn't find any humor in Jemima only self-loathing. Truly for a fun summer read skip over Jemima J. and go straight for Bridget Jones! Hurrah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypically \\"Fat\\"","review":"As others have said, Green's views of the world are extremely shallow & stereotypical- from the overweight to the good-looking to Californians to bosses, every possible stereotype is thrown in here & embellished in the most petty way possible, right up to the \\"twist\\" (which is a pretty crummy twist, may I add). I had heard good things about this book & was excited to read it, but I was severely disappointed- this book definitely falls flat of witty & insightful. Go bridget Jones instead, PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!!!","review":"I had high hopes for this book based on the reviews. However, I was very disappointed. The plot was not even decent fluff! The characters were pathetic. The message that it sent was that it is okay to be a brainless twit who's only goal in life is to get a gorgeous man at any price and to surround yourself with uncaring, egocentric \\"friends\\". 1 star is pushing it on the ratings. This book is definitely trash can material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very lame Bridget Jones wannabe","review":"I tried and tried to get through this book and was continually discouraged by the amateurish and plodding writing style. Jane Green doesn't write in a very engaging way and the narrative is dull. Jemima is a fat girl, lusts after cute boy, has thin gorgeous friends and roommates, boring career. Ugly-duckling-into-swan story, a cliche even when done well. It tries to be Bridget Jonesy and isn't half that book, which in itself is no great work. I couldn't get past 50 pages in this book even after giving it multiple tries. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow book with an ok story","review":"This book is about life Jemima Jones, a girl whose life is miserable and she is unnoticed until she loses over 100 pounds. Then her boss starts giving her promotions and men can't keep their eyes off of her. The story is very shallow and I think an insult to overweight and thin women alike. It is written very poorly in first and then out of nowhere 3rd person comentary. I recommend this book to teenagers with nothing better to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just enjoy the ride!","review":"Had to write a review because everyone I know is hatin' on the book. It was fun fun fun! I can totally relate to the character and even though you have to suspend reality time to time in order to accept what is happening- IT IS FICTION FOLKS- it is suppose to be fun in that way. It is really little more than a cinderella story, but hey, it is light and frothy and has way less calories than chocolate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Admit I read it, but rolled my eyes all the way through...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think books like this are great fun. I didn't have a problem with the story, they're all the same, down to what they drink and smoke and watch on TV, but the writer's \\"style\\" was grating. Her popping into the story, I think it was her, at least, was annoying, hacky, and contrived. Oh, yes, it was. And how do we know that? Because we spent the money, spent the time and read every word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Jane Green but didn't love this book","review":"Love Jane Green's other books - hated this one. Had heard it wasn't good but downloaded it anyway as have never gone wrong with a JG book. Don't go there. Full of outdated technology & references and unpleasant and stupid characters. Sorry Jane but wasn't good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible book!","review":"Jemima J is FULL of trite writing and ridiculous stereotypes, not just regarding overweight women, but men, Californians, thin people... Honestly, how many times can an author describe a person as a \\"gorgeous Californian babe\\"--who talks like that anyway? Jane Green's description of Internet usage was almost painful to read--yes, we get it, \\"LOL\\" means \\"laughed out loud.\\" The switching from first person to omniscient third person served to pound any subtleties out of the writing; Jane Green must have thought her readers would be completely oblivious to the plot were it not for her to make everything so ridiculously obvious. The only reason I finished reading this book was that I made the mistake of paying for it and listened to the bookstore clerk's recommendation that it was like Bridget Jones. It's NOTHING like Bridget Jones, both of which books were wonderful, witty, and humorous. Save your money, or better yet, buy the Bridget Jones books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing I've Ever Read!!!!","review":"How do people like this get published? I could spoil everything, alas there is not much to spoil. OF COURSE, being thin makes all your dreams come true. <<barf all over this book>>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close to Real","review":"I was encouraged and surprised when I found this book, to finally see a story where the heroine wasn't a model. But that was where the love affair with the book ended. It plays on one stereotype after another and not just of people, but of places and nationalities. This author is seriously out of touch with how a plus-sized woman feels and operated in the world. The heroine is pathetic, desperate and unhappy until she magically transforms herself. It is as if he life doesn't begin until she's thin. This is the fat-girl's Bridget Jones, and this version is poorly written, with characters you don't really care about, trite twists of plot line and oh so predictable. if you want to read something worth while featuring an overweight title character go buy \\"Good in Bed\\" by Jennifer Weiner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and pointless","review":"I was interested in this story because I too had lost a large amount of weight. I found the story dreadful. Ben was simply a joke, supposedly a regular guy, not into superfical fluff, but why was his dream job to be a TV anchorman?And all the men who noticed Jemima when she was 121 lbs, thinking she was incredibly good looking, admiring her toned body, including Ben, though, according to our narrator, she is supposed to be at an unhealthy weight? It's just too many mixed messages, and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"It would appear that the author has (a) visited Santa Monica, California, specifically the area within walking distance of the pier, and thinks someone flying to Hollywood would stay at Shutters-HELLO, there ARE hotels closer to Hollywood (b) believes one can lose nearly 100 pounds within a very few months and become nearly anorexic without losing her hair or having saggy skin, and cure her own eating disorder by falling love,(c) likes to generalize about Americans (Californians) as too friendly, dense, shallow, obsessed with body image and obviously not smart enough to be British."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad - cute, fast fun reading!","review":"I like the style Jane Green uses when she writes - very easy to read. I like her character development & the London tie-ins. (I'm a huge Anglophile) Jemima J & Mr. Maybe are very good 'light reading' books - they do have a predictable ending (oh well) but I enjoyed them much more so than Bridget Jones Diary. Too bad the producers of that movie didn't read Jane Green, would have made for a much better movie, perhaps she should get the same Manager/Publicists/PR person that the author of Bridget Jones has and land a movie deal for one of her books! A nice way to spend a weekend. Looking forward to her next books - hopefully she will add plot twists and not so predictible an ending..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read","review":"I read this book on the subway going to work to kill time, often I would find myself reading it during work. Its quite a page turner. The protagonist, Jemima has quite a few adventures, traveling from her home in England to LA to meet a guy she meets on the internet. Not only does she travel 4,000 miles but she dropps about 100 lbs too! When she finally meets him, she's in for a great surprise. You'll never beleive what happens. Don't want to ruin it, but I must say in end she does find true happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jemima J doesn't live up to the hype","review":"Entertaining? Yes. Funny? At times. Jemima J is an easy read with interesting characters and a good laugh or two. However, from all of the hype I expected to read a story of a woman who moved beyond her body obsession to a better place, both physically and mentally. What I found was a story about a woman who goes on some bizarre starvation/ninja exercise regime and voila--the man of her dreams falls into her arms. Yes, there were some cautionary lines about how she shouldn't be doing it and at the end, she chooses a more moderate path. However the underlying message was: to get your man, buy into all of the supermodel hype, lose 100 pounds plus, and Mr. Dreamboat will come to you.Highly disappointing, despite some original plot twists and turns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Ending","review":"I was totally absorbed with this book throughout until I got to the end. I wont reveal what happens, but basically everything is resolved in about a page, leaving me wanting to know more. The book just follows the formula too well, dragging us through Jemima's life, wondering how it will all turn out, only to leave me dissapointed in the end. Also, the changing voices of narration was odd and at times distracting. Also, it seemed that several threads were never really dealt with, just mentioned once or twice, leaving you to wonder. I hope this doesn't mean there will be a sequel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"This book was obnoxious, if it's fully possible for a book to be obnoxious. As a twenty year old woman who used to be obese, and has worked extremely hard to become thin, and beautiful; I completely feel like the way that Jane Green has written this fluff novel proves that she has never dealt with weight/weight loss issues. The story is far-fetched, stupid, and it is surprisingly horribly written. She writes in a way that makes me think of those cheesy movie commercials when this third party person is saying \\"Things are going really well for Paul Grant, but it wasn't always that way\\" with annoying, cheesy lines. Blah! It was literally awful, out of touch with reality (to an extent that was annoying), and almost offensive. I highly recommend reading something by Sophie Kinsella or Meg Cabot rather than this author. The Size 12 is not fat novels by Meg Cabot are hilarious and not at all horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Book","review":"A plausible and promising plot sagged before the middle and dragged on and on all the way to the end. I only finished it to see if the writer could redeem the book at last. The plot twist might have made the book terrific, but didn't quite work--it was rendered more incredible than believable and fell sadly flat. This book seems not to have seen the hand of an editor, ruthless or otherwise. There was entirely too much of it, but not enough credible detail or drama worked into it along the way to either make it work or sustain it. It demonstrated a nice flair for writing and language, but was weak on storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A loveable character, a poignant message","review":"Jemima J quickly endears herself to the reader while offering a valuable message in moderation. In her journey from obese, to pencil thin, to just right, Jemima J learns about self-abuse and emotional isolation, friendship, exercise and the joy of movement, the perils of superificiality, and the benefits of balance. Neither a treatise against fat nor a celebration of diets and starvation, this is the story of one woman's quest for self-realization. It could have easily been subtitled \\"Becoming Comfortable\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly ducklings, we are not!!","review":"Yes, I will agree that I just could not put this book down....no matter how mad I became, I wanted to see what would happen next. But I was upset!!! If you have ever been overweight in your life, don't read this book. I could not believe that Jane Green described Jemima as grossly overweight, so much so that no one would give her the time of day. Then, in the middle of the book, Green tells us that Jemima is 5 foot 7 and 217 pounds!! Then you look at the picture of the author on the back cover and you understand everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This One","review":"I don't put books down. But by the end of the first chapter, I was ready to toss it. I did not find this novel to have any goodness or decency in at all. Within the first few pages one discovers that the main character is overweight, has no self esteem or friends and finds solace in food. Losing weight and finding a man will not change all that. If you want to read a book about a woman to identify with, try Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\", which despite being written by a man, I found for the most part more realistic and less like a thin woman writing about a subject she could not possibly (obviously, it really shows) know anything about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, Hilarious---You won't be able to put this one down!","review":"I have to say, that I have never been able to relate to a character in any book I have read, until I read Jemima J. Anyone who has ever battled their weight will love this book. From Jemima's binge eating to her obession with Ben Williams, this book will keep you intrigued. I couldn't put it down....definetly a keeper. I recommed this to women of all ages....it tugs at you heartstrings one minute and has tears of laughter rolling down your cheek the next. Get it...you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I have ever read","review":"It's ridiculous and insulting. The characters are entirely one dimensional.

If you're a heavy girl looking for a sensitive portrayal of a fat girl in love, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"If you want to read a hilarious book about an English woman looking for love, read either of the Bridget Jones books. If you want to read a realistic and moving story of a fat girl who turns her life around, read \\"She's Come Undone.\\" If you want to read a novel that's not funny; that's not clever or well-written; that has undeveloped, shallow characters (including the title character); that uses unnecessary and annoying shifts in point of view; and that is, overall, a complete waste of time, read this. With those expectations, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a sucker for a book cover","review":"I picked up this book before I boarded a flight. I thought the cover was interesting and truth be know I had been binging a bit on the \\"overweight\\" genre. However after reading this book, I advise not to judge a book by its cover. It was trite, boring and down right poorly written.After reading it, I only wanted to have friends read it just to agree. I don't even want to waste time writing a review.

Totally wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like a handbook for eating disorders","review":"The only thing you need to know about this book is that pro-anorexia websites have referred to it as a motivational \\"thinspiration\\" book. I highly doubt Jane Green ever intended this, but I guess it's no surprise that a depressingly ludricrous weight-loss story that continuously fetishizes glossy images and ideals about thinness has managed to attract such an audience. I hated this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly entertaining","review":"I emphasize the word \\"slightly\\". This book was very poorly written, and I am a bit offended that this woman can be published but many other writers who great exceed her are snubbed. The book itself is offensive in that Ben only finds her attractive after she loses weight. That may be realistic, which is unfortunate, but it shouldnt' be treated as acceptable. Also the portrayal of a \\"fat chick\\" as stuffing her face with bacon sandwiches and washing it down with candy bars is naive at best. The author needs to stick to the old saying of \\"write what you know\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining but offensive","review":"I agree with sparklegypsy. The book is entertaining in a silly sort of way but this author (and much of the general public) obviously have a distorted view of what being abnormally overweight is. People would not ridicule or feel sorry for a size 14, 5'7\\" woman. That size woman would also not need to shop in larger size stores. In fact, she would not even be wearing the largest size at most stores! As a size 14, 5'8\\", 200 pound woman I found this offensive. I think many people would be very surprised if they compared what I look to their mental picture of Jemima. This author should have done more thorough research!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are over 12, let this one go!","review":"I had to write, what an awful read. It is written on the level of the books you used to read in middle school. The fantasy, the coincidental, unbeleiveable, fairy tale ending all play into the pre-teen fantasy of life. Hands-down the worst part was the constant, and without warning, mid-paragraph switch from first to third person. It was no less than maddening!Read Bridget Jones, read See Jane Date, read ANYTHING else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea...","review":"This book to me was everything a novel about a woman shouldn't be. Jemima J finds happiness through others acceptance and not her own. Throughout this book she conforms to society's ideology of what is beautiful. She loses an extreme amount of weight for a man in 3 months which is first of all unbelievable, and gets her hair dyed blond. Is this what every woman should be striving to be like because I can guarantee it won't happen. This book was written in a fashion to make everyone that does not weigh 120 pounds feel inadequate. Before \\"JJ\\" lost her weight no one even paid her any attention, but all of a sudden a few skipped meals and frequent breaks to exercise make Jemima a beauty queen! I personally want to thank Jane Green for instilling in many of us young women that we should all be content with searching for our happiness in what others think of our appearance, not our intelligence.(Not quite)"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This was an ok book. I think it was pretty stereotypical. I am 5'4\\" and 157 lbs., but I have a love life and lots of friends. It was fun to read though. It also gives me hope that determination can get you whatever you want.I didn't like Jemima, because she isn't very kind to overweight people.Even though she is one herself, she portrays them as being constant eaters. Some people really do have problems that don't relate to over-eating and under-exercising.And ::GASP:: some people are BORN overweight, like me!It's not because you are a eating machine. Maybe in her case, but not in mine.And who says skinny is the only size to be beautiful?However, it was a fluffy novel. If you try to ignore the fat and thin people bashing(fat people are pathetic and thin people are shallow), you will enjoy it. I enjoyed quite a bit the first time, but the second time I thought it was kind of stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Novel","review":"Basically, the novel is about a young woman whose overweight has become unbearable. She describes what it is like to live with beautiful skinny people when she's like a big balloon permanently craving for food. She then decides to go on a diet. The next thing you know, she is thin and beautiful. Now a new chapter of her life starts with that new model-figure she's got.When I started reading the book I thought a made a mistake buying it. It started off slow, and in some parts, secondary events in the story are explained with too many details and the conversation between the characters is sometimes prolonged with pointless sentences.However, I started enjoying the book after a while. In fact, I am now very thankful I got it. The story is very inspiring. It gave me motivation to achieve my goals in life. It has very good morals, and a message for every girl out there to overcome her insecurities and achieve the life she dreams of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"I just finished the book today and I *loved* it!! Yeah, it was a little far fetched at some points, but it IS fiction. If you keep that in the back of your mind, you'll love it. The only thing that bothered me was that she described herself as larger than a house, and complained about how huge she was. But then when she went to the fitness guy, she was only 217, and was 5'7...not exactly bigger than a house, and actually mildly insulting to overweight women. However, I completely loved this book, and can relate a lot to Jemima. If you like comedy and have a few hours to spare (because you won't be able to put this down!!) then I recommend it 100% :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up and have fun.","review":"This is a completely light and fun read about the ugly duckling that becomes a swan. There are no heavy ploys here, just a girl gets guy, followed by does girl want guy, and we'll just see about that, type of mentality. It's always fun to see a character blossom especially when she drops a small person, weight wise that is. It might not always be realistic, anyone who has lost weight knows that cravings rear their ugly head at least once in awhile but I found the author delicately and accurately penned the sadness and loneliness that incurs when a persons self esteem is not up to par.I also enjoyed how the narrator let us in on a few secrets along the way, teasing the reader with information that only made me want to read on into the night. I admit that the story got a bit unbelievable at times but it was simply something fun to read and it fits the bill as dependable entertainment.

Hands down the worst book I've ever read!","review":"First of all...100 pounds in like three months?!?!? Secondly, as someone who has lost a lot of weight in the past, I just could not get over the blatant inconsistancies with regard to Jemima's weight loss -- are we supposed to actually believe that after losing 100 pounds in 3 months she's left with taut skin??? Nobody will notice you've lost 100 pounds until you go out and buy new clothes and then all of a sudden you're stopping traffic -- I seriously doubt a girl could go from plus size all the way down to a size 6 without buying anything in between!I thought that this book was just absolutely stupid and the plot twist towards the end and the ending just make it seem as though the author got tired of writing. I would not have finished Jemima J had it not been for the fact that I couldn't believe it would get worse...and then it did, so I had to keep reading to see how dumb the ending would be...and I wasn't let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book!!","review":"I obtained this book by accident. It was given to me by a guy friend that had never read it. I am so glad that he gave it me. I loved it, and read the entire book in one sitting. Jemima is so me. I understand the way she feels, and I think that Jane Green did an awesome job of creating a character that is real. I understood Jemima's fears and reactions to particular events in the story. (Any overweight woman who has ever been to a bar full of beautiful people would!) Yeah, maybe the story is shallow in the fact that Jemima becomes beautiful, and every man wanted her, but who cares. If you lost a hundred pounds I'm sure you would get a few more stares than before. Jemima is strong, and that is the message to take away with you. She decided what she wanted and went for it. If only we could all be like that.Pick this up the next time you are out. It is a great story line, and hillarious at times. A real pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleeck!","review":"It wouldn't let me give NO STARS!Ugh! The worst book I've ever read! What a waste of time. I agree with the previous reviewer who thought it sounded like she was a shut-in playing with Barbie dolls!I recommend it, however, as inspiration if you want to be published...if Jane Green can...YOU CAN TOO!!!i want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have you even read the book?","review":"For those who see Jemima J as negative have obviously not read it. Yes, the character believes that being skinny will make her happy but so do a lot of people in \\"real life\\". Her character, unlike \\"real\\" people, discover what truly matters in life and that is real friends and love and being true to yourself. She realizes this after she loses weight but it is not being skinny that makes her happy. This book is not giving out a negative message saying that in order to be happy you have to be thin. It is quite the opposite. The book is trying to show that being thin isn't what makes us happy. I think this book was amazing and I loved the characters. Anyone who has anything negative to say about this book and its message needs to read the ending again...slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I love it, Jane Green has offically done it. She has hit the point that every large woman wants and uses her imagination to express it. She gives a sort of light at the end of the tunnel for big women everywhere...Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE","review":"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING, DID I MENTION AMAZING.THIS BOOK WILL WANT TO MAKE YOU FALL IN LOVE"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN, RIVETING, EXCITING","review":"WOW!! THIS NOVEL HAS RESTORED MY HOBBY IN READING. I CAN'T REMEMBER READING FOR PLEASURE AND ACTUALLY ENJOYING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING TO THE NEXT CHAPTER. JEMIMA J WORKED HARD TO REACH HER GOALS, EXPERIENCED THE PERKS AND THEN WAS ABLE TO COME BACK AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE. I FOUND MYSELF ROOTING FOR HER ALL THE WAY. I EVEN CRIED....THIS WAS A LOT OF FUN, VERY EXCITING, AND SEXY.....SHE REACHED THE UNATTAINABLE. SHE MET HER GOALS!!! THIS WAS INVIGORATING TO READ. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE!!!I HAD TO COVER UP THE PAGE I WAS ON, TO KEEP FROM TRYING TO PEEK AT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT. ANOTHER GREAT READ IS \\"GIRLFRIENDS\\" BY PATRICK SANCHEZ.I WAS SO EXCITED AFTER READING THIS NOVEL, THAT I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ALL OF JANE GREEN'S OTHER BOOKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rekindled my love for reading!!!","review":"I picked this book up while I was out of town. You first need to understand that I haven't read anything for fun in at least ten consecutive years! I picked it up at a chain store for $5.70; not really sure I would even be able to get through the first chapter without dozing off. But nevertheless, I checked out with my book and headed back. When I settled down with this book and a hot cup of coffee on the deck that night, I never dreamt that I would find myself finishing it (Yes! I read it cover to cover) at 7:15am the following morning!!!Since then I have been on a tear of reading, got myself a library card and haven't looked back :) Enjoy this book as much as I did, I promise that it'll be worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is the first Jane Green's book that I read and I love the book. I read few reviews here and some people think it's too good to be true. I must admit that the story is a bit cliche but it's still entertaining. I never thought this book would help me too. I had been over-weight since I was young and I was never able to lose weight. This book actually inspired me to join a gym and I lost 10 kg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrealistic & silly, but entertaining...","review":"I agree with fellow reviewers who describe this book as incredibly unrealistic, but nonetheless I found it a very fun and easy read. I would put this book in the \\"guilty pleasure\\" sub-category of \\"chick lit\\" ... escapist and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Disappointment","review":"How sad I felt beginning the reading of this book. What an opportunity Jane Green missed in dealing with this very important subject of BODY IMAGE issues. She convoluted the real story by adding what I think surely must be a fantasy of her own related to internet porn and foul language. I was intending to use this in a very meaningful discussion on eating disorders but was so disappointed in the beginning that I abandoned the book. Too bad for Jane Green."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was robbed!","review":"I picked this book up on a whim looking for a distraction from a long plane ride. The first few chapters flew by but then came to a startling halt halfway through the plot line. I am not going to give away the story but lets just say save your five bucks and put it towards a cup of coffee or something of more enjoyment. It was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I laughed once...","review":"This book isn't even worth the time and effort that you're going to put into it. I think I finished it out of principal... It's completely unrealistic and anticlimactic. But if you're really into online relationships and crushes then yes... this book is defiantly for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women and weight, something to which we can all relate","review":"Being a person who suffered from anorexia for four years, the book was rather disturbing in that Jemima didn't get her man and change her life until she lost a lot of weight. The author did try to redeem herself in the epilogue when she said Jemima is happy now being a size 10, etc. (I won't give the whole ending away!) and eating what she wants. I am a size 10 who is coming to grips with the fact that I am a good person who doesn't need to weight 120 pounds to be loved. Therefore, I would certainly think a female author would know better than to shove outer beauty on us, unless she's a stick figure and doesn't understand what it's like to struggle with your own self image. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the book and wanted to see how JJ would end up, but I was disgusted that the author didn't allow Jemima's life to change for the better until she became tiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow, predictable, but strangely likeable","review":"Reading this book is like watching a fluff movie. It is sappy and predictable, but you watch, and read it anyway. I don't think I'll eagerly await the next book, or seek out any more of Jane Green's books, but I finished this one. A light summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow....","review":"I was excited to get started on this book, and even more excited to finish it. The writing proved to be shallow and the editing errors got boring to count. The story somehow contradicts itself by seemingly holding the view that weight and looks shouldn't be the basis of how we judge one another, but surprise surprise, Jemima J. only finds herself and her happiness (not to mention boyfriends) when she loses her excess weight. There are a few token comments about how having confidence in yourself is the most important, but they seem out of place to the real message of this book- lose weight and you will be happy. Shallow, insincere, and quite frankly, juvenile."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Jemima J\\" needs a warning label","review":"Jemima J can be an enjoyably light Sunday afternoon read for adults, but I would not recommend this book to impressionable teens. The story line is a fantasy that younger readers may not be able to discern from reality. Developing an eating disorder does not make your dreams come true. It is infecting yourself with a debilitating disease, and no guy is worth that. Writing a nonchalant book about unhealthy weight loss does not seem to be responsible writing, especially for an author who claims the book is a true lesson in life. And finally, the message this book sends about finding confidence through changing yourself to conform to society's representation of beauty is degrading to women. I do not suggest reading this book for an uplifting or empowering message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good message to readers!","review":"I liked the beginning and the very end. It's the rest I have a problem with. With the author's description of Jemima, I pictured her at over 350 pounds until the author reveals that she is about 5'7 and 217 pounds. That was a shocker! A real woman that size does not match the author's description of the character. I also have a BIG problem with the way Jemima quickly lost the weight. It was not in a healthy way! It also seemed like a lot of the book dealt with outside appearances and not what's on the inside, which is what actually matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"What can I say about Jemima J? The story was unbelievable, the characters were unrealistic, and it was just generally unlikeable. It is rife with stereotypes about larger women and sends the message that you can be a great person, but you have to be skinny to really be seen and appreciated. It is insulting to Americans (the only real friend she makes in LA is from England like her) and makes Jemima's anorexia seem healthy (where were the side effects of her seriously unhealthy lifestyle???). The author tries to tie in the \\"self-love\\" theme at the end by saying Jemima regained some weight (insulting her in the process by saying she's not skinny), but ultimately the book is too far gone to be redeemed at that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good read","review":"I liked this book. So what if it wasn't so realistic as others have said, it's FICTION! that being said, i don't think it was ridiculously unrealistic, although it wasn't the most incredible read, i did enjoy reading this book. Although I'm not 100+ pounds overweight I can still relate to Jemima's insecurities; I suspect everyone has some Jemima in them. I thought the characters were well developed, I felt like I knew Jemima, Ben, and Geraldine. This was my first Jane Green novel and I will be checking out her other books. Although it was a tad predictable and a little cliche, overall i thought it was a good, light read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A No-brainer, and not in the good way","review":"Feh. I can say that the only thing that I liked about this book was the eye-catching cover. Not only did I find the story to be forced and unbelievable, but it managed to be condesending to overweight women like the book's heroine. The characters were equally as shallow. It's a bad sign when the author puts the most effort into providing details of a character's hair, clothing, and body size.I loved Bridget Jones, but I loved it for being light, funny, and original. This book came in 0 for 3 on that count and screamed rip-off the whole time.I have to admit that this book wasn't so bad to cause me to abandon it midway through, as I often do. Maybe there was something compelling about the story. Or maybe I just had chores to do that day so reading seemed like a better idea. A good choice if you really want to avoid laundry and there is nothing on t.v."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of the first books I read when I started to really get into reading. Even years later it is one of my favorite books. It's a must read for any single ladies in their 20's or 30's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Chick Lit.","review":"This is the second Jane Green novel I've read. I enjoyed it a lot. It was exactly what I was looking for in a chick lit read. Once I started I couldn't put it down. I did think that that the ending was a bit rushed and would've liked to see what happened with Jemima and her leading man but overall everything I expected from this type of novel. I'll be definitely be reading another Jane Green novel when I want a nice easy holiday book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just read it!","review":"This is a modern day Cinderella story.

If I could give this book more than 5 stars I would!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced due to markup","review":"More than doubling the retail price is hoggish. I wish Amazon exercised at least some control over resellers like this who hugely mark up products that can be bought elsewhere on the web, such as from the manufacturer. I recommend you shop around, both to save more than 50% of the price and in order not to support resellers like this. By the way, a similar review to this one was just removed from the website. I guess the reseller doesn't want it to be known how much they mark this product up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"APPALLING price -- greedy","review":"I love this tea.

This seemed to be the closest to the level of extra features that my old player had. It has SACD which is something I have not had before and not sure I will use. My only complaint, and keeps it from getting a 5 star rating, is the speed of the unit. My old 5 disc unit would eject quickly, switch from CD to CD quickly, and would load a disc within seconds.

I purchased a SACD from Amazon.com (Charlotte Church - Dream a Dream ) and put it in the player and WOW! it sounded like the music was comming out of the walls - the whole room was filled with the music. A friend was in the house at the time and asked, \\"What kind of speakers do you have?\\" I said it wasn't the speakers it was the CD. Too bad there are hardly any SACDs available. If you want to upgrade your Sony system, this is the player to get.

There is a problem with SACD decoding that resulted in the center and sub-woofer channels not receiving a strong enough signal to perceive. The test tone feature of the unit confirms that my cables, amp and speakers are not the problem, since signals sent to the speakers in the test mode cycle loud and clear through the correct speaker at the correct time. Calls to Sony Tech support confirmed the problem was with the SACD player. This is an older, discontinued model and Sony techs admitted to me that it may have issues, especially when used with post-2004 components and SACDs. I'm having to arrange to return the second unit at this point, so I'm pretty disappointed. This is the only Sony product I've ever bought that was not able to perform it's primary function, but hours of troubleshooting have led to the unavoidable conclusion that this unit has a design flaw.

CD playback through analog outs are just not as good as other more higher end players. Probably due to lesser D/A converter.

Sent it back, now I am being quoted $119.00 to repair/replace with probably another lemon. I see new CD players that cost less than that, I think I'll try a different brand.

I have had it in use for about two years and about a year ago the edges began to spring up a bit in the corners causing a very big problem with stock bumping while routing. Needless to say the \\"bump\\" would transfere to the piece and ruin it! I have dealt with this off and on since then (I dont use my router table as often as I could/should) I am now buying an aluminum plate to replace it and wish I had never wasted money/time on the HF unit. I hope this review cause those shoppers out there to pass on this unit and in fact pass on all phenolic plates and go to the metal ones for long term satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"plate not flat","review":"I've used a few router table insert plates. The JessEm Rout-R-Plate is the one I've had for the past five years. I recently decided to add another router table to my shop, and thought I'd try the MLCS plate. I've ordered a LOT of router bits from MLCS, and have never had a problem. This plate, however, is a piece of junk. After five years of having a Bosch 2 1/4 horsepower router hanging under the JessEm there is zero warp to the plate (I just checked... it is dead flat.) The MLCS came out of the packaging with warp in two directions. It warps downward in the long dimension, and upward in the short dimension. The mounting instructions spec. that there is intentional \\"crown\\" to counteract the downward force of the router hanging below. Why? A good plate should not flex, and what do you do until gravity corrects the crown? Also, the removable rings snap in with friction fit - no locking action. That's asking for frustration if not an accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Approximate Size Doesn't Cut It","review":"The product description says it is \\"approximately 9 x 12 inches\\". That may be fine for someone who will cut a hole in their router table for the insert, but for those who already have a router table, the exact measurements are needed. Pretty much the standard for inserts is 9-1/4-Inch by 11-3/4-Inch.

The three videos on this tape are perfect examples of how sound and vision can work together seamlessly. \\"Come to Daddy\\" is, by far, one of the most intruiging and creative videos I've seen. It really should be considered more like a short film than a mere video. It's probably not for everyone, due to its disturbing nature, but definitely deserves at least one viewing. The other videos, for \\"On\\" and \\"Donkey Rhubarb\\", are also wonderfully mesmerizing.

The reader will cheer the two of them as they continue on their journey.One gem in this book is when Rosie gets to the stage where she can't face another meal of Chinese food and no doubt would like a good old American meal of steak and potatoes!!!You will feel like you are in the car with them on this momentous journey. This is a very well written book about a very long, but never boring journey by car.Well done Rosie and I salute you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Series","review":"A few of my students in an advanced level course told me I should give Darren Shan a try. I admit I was reluctant- another series with vampires? So I bought the first book and was absolutely amazed. I returned to school with great excitement about this book and series. These books are appealing because Shan has the gift of writing to make the reader feel personally connected to the narrator, the chapters are short with lots of twists and turns in the plot, and the character, Mr. Crepsley is intriguing. Along with the Hunger Games series, this one is right up there.This will be a recommended series to all of my students next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome Book","review":"My son was a relunctant reader, but when he found this series, it just grabbed him. He has read all of the books in the series, and his reading skills have improved by leaps and bounds. I would recommend this series to any teenage boy, especially, who needs to improve his reading skills. My son said it helped him to focus, because he enjoyed them so much. His speed has improved as well as his comprehension. Because of this series, he is a much more confident reader, which has helped him deal better with books he doesn't enjoy as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is ahh-mazingg!!

This is one of the better books of the series and has a little bit of everything in it from compassion to anger. I am 26 and this is one of the best series I have read in a long time and would recommend this series to anyone no matter their age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Addition to the Cirque Du Freak series","review":"Continuing approximately four hours after the conclusion from book four, \\"Trials of Death\\" tells of Darren's trials that he must undertake to gain support to the vampires. Although the book is a little slow at the begining, it really picks up pace when the trials are selected and what the trials involve. The ending is very cliffhanging because of a traitor that becomes known in the last chapter, and what happens to Darren when he finds out about the traitor. I cannot wait till September when the next book will come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mighty Johns","review":"I was really expecting something special after reading Publisher's Weekly's review. I thought the story was predictable and rather foolish. One football player sends six opponents off on stretchers because he knows physics? I also got a little tired of hearing how \\"brilliant\\" Tor was. Make the point and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I couldn't have been more disappointed in this book. I am huge Baldacci, Meltzer, Green fan as well as a football nut, and I thought this would be a great read (similar to Tim Green's football novels). These stories are so bad, and paint football players in the worst light. Some of this is borderline racist in the way that these authors (Lupica, especially) try to write in the first person as \\"gangsta\\" football players. The editor needs to learn how to proofread, and also needs to make sure that the author information is accurate. If you are football fan and you love these authors, do not be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst read of the year","review":"I read 60-100 books per year; I love football; I enjoy David Baldacci's work. Sooooo, this book would be a natural, right? Wrong! It is the worst book I've read this year, and one of the worst I've ever read. With one or two exceptions the stories were awful; the editing was absolutely incompetent--in fact, I don't believe anyone looked at the galley proofs before the book went to press. If the stories weren't so terrible to begin with, the authors would have ample grounds for defamation of reputation! The money spent on this book was absolutely wasted. Do yourself a favor: ignore the pack of lies on the dust jacket; get an old Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine from the second hand book store for 25 cents and give the remaining...change to any good cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parallel Universe?","review":"I bought this because of the blurbs on the jacket (from Publisher's Weekly and a host of celebs.) Since all of them pertained to the title story, it seems only fair to rate the book on that basis, even though the other stories vary from passable to, actually, quite enjoyable. But that first (title) story is, well, it's abysmal! The plot is inane! The dialogue resembles nothing spoken by living human beings anywhere on the planet! The prose is so many shades darker than purple that no sprectrometer could calculate it! And even the editing reflects all this. No less than three times is the word \\"though\\" rendered as \\"thought\\", several \\"the\\"'s become \\"he\\" and one assumes the printer ran out of \\"w\\" so left \\"was\\" as \\"as\\".In short, this is either one of the most egregious examples of prose by a so-called professional I've ever seen, or I'm living in a parallel universe wherin the matters of style, substance, and grammar are reversed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Tease!","review":"This book was so bad, I can't believe I read all of it! The editing was even worse than the stories! One story began with a character named \\"Perry\\", but two pages later, the character's name was \\"Terry.\\" Baldacci's story was long and slow to get going. His characters were described in such detail, I found myself skipping over half of the garbage he wrote. Other stories lacked detail and were never fully developed. Most of the stories were so stupid, I kept wondering why I was waisting my time reading more. I am a huge football fan, so this book was a massive disappointment. I KNOW I could have written more provacative stories that delivered than this book did. Bottom line, if you feel you need to read it, buy it used or check it out from the library. That way, you'll only feel cheated out of your time instead of both your time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"This must be the summer of the spaced out best selling author. First there was \\"The Beach House\\", James Patterson's preposterous tale of vigilante justice against a super rich sleaze-ball. Then we get Baldacci's even more absurd story about brainy college jock Tor North looking in a maze of tunnels beneath the college stadium for a legendary running back who disappeared 40 years before. The premise, the investigtion and particularly the conclusion are ..., sorry I'm lost for the adjective that expresses the inanity of this story.Two follow on short stories, one a morality play about a murder and a soccer game that took place at the outset of WWI and the second by Brad Meltzer that draws on the classic MIT pranks at Harvard-Yale games, were actually pretty good. WARNING! The unabridged audiobook captures every word of Baldacci's ridiculous novella but omits the stories by the likes of Lehane and Lupica that I gather were part of the book. Don't expect them if you try the audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing after The Mighty Johns","review":"I was terribly disappointed in the short stories accompanying David Baldacci's novelette. The other short stories I took the time to read centered on crimes committed by a football loser. For me, that is not the caliber that I expect associated with David Baldacci's name. I threw the book away after 3 or 4 of those trashy stories. I will never buy another book written in this manner. The only reason I gave it two stars was because, as always, Baldacci captivates his audience, and writes so engagingly it's hard to put the story down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassment","review":"Wow. Some of the stories in this book were really bad. The title story by David Baldacci is absolutely awful. I mean, it's John Farris-bad. Terrible pacing, dialogue, characterization, everything. Lawrence Block's story is the worst thing I've ever read by him. Gary Phillips' story is incomprehensible--I still don't know what happened.Is there anything worth reading in this volume? Yes. Brendan DuBois, Tim Green, Colin Harrison, Brad Meltzer, Peter Robinson, and John Westermann all turn in nice efforts.Unfortunately, this book was apparently never copy edited or proof read. I've never seen so many typos in a published book in my life. Embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to Forget","review":"I did not think that Baldacci could write something this bad. His other efforts I thought were good to very good, but this was one of the worst attempts to keep a reader interested that I have encountered. I am greatly dissappointed with this collection words and in the future spend more time reading reviews before purchasing Baldacci again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tackle This . . . .","review":"After hitting the best-seller's list shortly after making it's way to bookshelves everywhere, \\"The Mighty John's\\" proves itself to be an one of today's few intriguing mysteries that not only keeps you from closing the pages of the book, but actually attatches itself within the depths of your mind and draws you in to the ongoing and complex plot. Combing renowned writers such as Lawrence Block, Dennis Lehane, Brad Meltzer and Anne Perry, \\"The Mighty John's\\" is a must have for all. New Millennium scores once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENJOYED EVERY WORD OF THIS ONE","review":"I must admit, I was surprised when I read this one (after putting it off a number of years). Eisenhower did indeed have a knack for story telling and this becomes quite apparent with the first read of the first page of this book. This work gives us an inside look into the mind of a truely great man. I, like a couple of other reviewers here, was quite delighted with the candor, and insightfulness of this President. Actually, I found the work to be quite refreshing in this area...it is so unlike many of the autobiographies of some of the more recent presidents. Anyway, this book is well written and extremely informative and very, very readable. I highly recommend it to any history buff and highly recommend it to anyone having even the slightest interest in this individual the times he lived in. Recommend you add this one to your libary as you will no doubt want to give it a reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Ease is a small treasure","review":"Written in his own words, no other book offers a better insight into the personal values and character of Dwight Eisenhower, both as a young man and during his career in the Army.

While the aunts are indeed terrible, their insults to James are unnecessarily cruel and prolonged. There are also an infinite number of literary ways to extract James from his predicament without killing his aunts. At one point the characters are actually gleeful about their deaths. Although the rest of the plot is imaginative, it is choppy and doesn't hang together or flow well. The ending, while happy for the characters, falls flat and carries no grand positive message. This is not a book for young children, and I don't think it is a particularly good book for any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good fantisy book.","review":"I'm not really sure why I didn't enjoy this book.

I reccomend this book to exadurated people."},{"rating":"1","title":"James and the jiant peace~ Ronald Dahl~","review":"The plot of this book is for James and his friends, which are insects I might add, to go to the city of New York to be safe from James aunts.It has a good plot, but it could use a little more reason for James to for fill the plot. I mean it was his dream to go there one day, and be safe from his aunts, but it could use a little more reason. For example, It could be because it was his dream to go there and be safe from his aunts, but it could also be because it was what his parents told him to go before the rhino killed them.Over all it is a pretty good book for some, but it just doesn't fulfill my expectations. I like more of mystical books, it does have some magic, but not enough. So if to like a normal book with a little twist, please read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, silly, annoying.","review":"I think James and the Giant Peach is really boring to read.

James goes to live with his Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, but they are greedy and so in love with themselfs. James meets a man and the old man gives him crocodile tounges!

James drops the crocdile tongues on a peach tree and it turns into a ginat peach with a boring adventure to add to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"James and the Giant Peach is simply nonsense. If you like nonsense then you may like this book. The story is as simple as the other reviews make it sound: A giant peach grows, he crawls inside, he meets some big insects. That's basically it.

The line: \\"Don't be an ass.\\" is a well known phrase which means, \\"Don't be stupid like a donkey!\\" It has nothing to do with the posterior region of a person's body. Shakespeare uses this comparison in \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\". The use of the word \\"ass\\" for \\"donkey\\" can likewise be found in the New Testament: \\"And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon.\\" John 12.Dahl is an amazing writer who appeals to children of all ages. \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" is both witty and poignant, and should be read by anyone with a quirky sense of humor.

However, the reason the we purchased cordless was to have the freedom to iron in the middle of the room without the need for an outlet.

We returned the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Recharge","review":"I don't know why people have given so many good reviews for this iron but my experience for the past two weeks is that the iron has to be recharged four times to finish one cotton pants. Pain in the neck! When it's fully charged, it's really great. Yet, iron is useless real quick. Once pressing for steam doesn't work, that means iron isn't hot anymore. So, back to the base, again, and, again, and, again! Then I have to turn the setting from Level 3 (highest) to Off and then back to Level 3, again, so the iron would recharge. If I just leave it on the base to recharge, it doesn't seem to be hot at all. Well, big plus to have it cordless, but, my iron time has more than double. I'd recommend a Rowenta iron which I used to have. It was more effective and lasted over five years. In conclusion, this cordless Panasonic iron is good but not effective!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution","review":"My wife said that it turned off before she could finish ironing.

Well, that may be a stretch but I have to say that I don't mind the task with this very well-designed, user-friendly ironing instrument. Hallelujah!!I am nearly sixty years old; a man who has always ironed his own clothes, starting at about age six (an early fashion plate, or so I thot :-o)! Times have changed; this iron is proof that we continue to do somethings better and better. If only we could iron out world hunger, world strife and world peace as easily as the wrinkles in my shirt. Hope must never die.Honestly, this is a fantastic tool designed to make the arduous task more enjoyable.

I've been using it for about 5+ years now. I love the removable water container and the base but the absolute best feature is that it doesn't have a cord to get caught on everthing. My only complaint is that I didn't buy 2 of them and stick one in the back of the cupboard when this one is done...however...it gets used on 7+ outfits per week and is still going strong. Absolute best iron ever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic NI-L45 Cordless Iron","review":"I have never purchased a cordless Iron before and don't do much ironing anymore, but when my iron stopped heating after a mere 4 years, I did have to buy a new one. It takes re-training to put the iron in the exact slot after ironing along a shirt front, collar, etc. However, I like the freedom of no cord to hold you back. The iron does stay hot. It is light in weight. It was less expensive than my previous high-end one. The down-side besides the re-training of old habits? I have an ironing board and iron holder on the back of the closet door. This iron comes in its own case which I now locate on a shelf...the ironing board is still on the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending it back","review":"I was so looking forward to this iron after reading all the positive reviews. This iron lost heat so quickly I couldn't finish ironing the small area on the iron surface. It had an excellent jet of steam, liked that a lot. Then the iron wouldn't heat back up unless I cycled through all the settings (off, 1, 2 then to 3). This meant it took about 20-30 seconds to heat back up, much more time than I needed to readjust my piece of clothing. This iron is going back and I will be getting an iron with a cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not that good","review":"I gotta tell you -- I'm not sure why everyone seems to be raving about this iron. I've had it for a month and decided to give it away because it just isn't that good. For starters, the cordless feature is not a big deal because you need to have the corded base nearby to return the iron to try to keep it hot. And it just doesn't get that hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great cordless product","review":"I dislike ironing and have tried various methods to make it less undesirable. First I purchased a contraption that kept the cord away from the clothing being ironed. Then I bought one of the early cordless irons, which was very heavy and cumbersome to use -- I returned it. About a year ago, I got a very inexpensive cordless iron that only lasted a year. It never did get very hot, but it was OK. I was playing around on ebay and discovered that a name brand manufacturer was now manufacturing a cordless iron. I checked customers' reviews and decided to try once more. This iron is excellent: the cord retracts; the thermostat is accurate; it comes with a storage case. I appreciate the design and couldn't ask for a finer iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless rules","review":"I bought this iron about 5 months ago. I finally used it today.

This heats up quickly, and yes, it gets quite hot, much hotter than my old Black and Decker iron. This iron stays just as hot between ironing \\"sweeps.\\" The weighted heating base that you set it on actually helps your ironing board to feel more \\"stable,\\" and since you set it down horizontally, you don't have to worry about the iron falling off and crashing onto the floor (like before). Plus, no cord to work with! YIPPEE! This iron is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice if you don't mind ironing in a raincoat.","review":"I bought this iron barely 6 months ago and was thrilled with it in the beginning. It does iron very well. The problem is, it has started to leak. Just within the last month or so what started as a slow, small leak, is now leaking so badly the water is running out through the base. I've tried to call Panasonic numerous times and am now convinced there are no humans working there at all. I could never get past the automated runaround. I've just ordered the Maytag cordless and I doubt I'll ever buy anything from Panasonic again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Thought It Would Work","review":"We've had our iron for 2 weeks now -- and much to our amazement, it works great. At first, I thought the water tank was too small--but using the medium steam setting, the water tank lasted far longer than any other iron we've used. The iron is also not as heavy as prior irons we've had, so it's easier and less tiring to use. It stays hot, just as advertised, and I do not find it distracting to have the base sitting on the ironing board, like I thought I would.The one negative is that the retractable cord not only is not easily or automatically retractable, we could not even manually get it to retract into the base unit. We resorted to wrapping the cord around the iron before putting the top back on the unit to store it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"Usually like to purchase items like the iron at the big box stores.I was pleasantly surprised that the iron works as well as advertised.No problems and fast service from amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"We have had no problems with this product and have been using it for about two years.

He is independent, inventive, original and individual, at a time when it was deadly dangerous to deviate in any way from the crowd. With dread, the reader begins to understand that, in telling this story, the narrator is performing a kind of atonement, seeking to repent of an as-of-yet unnamed sin.A profoundly moving book.

No place to hold the cap while the unit is in the USB slot. The activity LED is small and not as bright as some others (e.g. Lexar). No keychain attachment point, although I don't use those anyway.So...a good idea, the package is nice in some ways, and the memory stick compatibility will be useful to some people.

No matter how hard you press the handles together or how long you bake the cookies, they come out thick and soggy -- rather than their intended crunchy and thin (almost ice cream cone like)texture.Do not waste your money on this iron if you are looking for the real old-fashioned type of krumkake that your grandmother used to make.

The PSX/PS2 USB adapter I got is black and made by a company called Jietron. They call it the Super Dual Box Advance. It comes with a mini CD-ROM with a driver for the rumble. However, the driver wouldn't work for me on XP x64 - no surprise there. The funny thing is, on the 4 triangles web site they depict the Super Dual Box Pro from Mayflash, not that it matters to me.Other than that the thing works great! I use it with PSone dual shock controllers (SCPH-110) with ePSXe. Of course one has to configure this in ePSXe first. Original PSX dual shock controllers I tried also work. The analog sticks feel good, maybe more sensitive on the emulator than the original PSX, but if so, it is not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great. DDR mode may or may not work.","review":"I received the converter and it certainly functioned as I would have thought it would. It allowed me to use a playstation controller with my computer. I mainly use this converter for ddr pads. While I couldn't get the up select start or whatever code it is to work (maybe I just wasn't pressing the right buttons, you know mapping issues and all). My pads are wired in such a way that the buttons can be remapped by hardware means using simple connectors into a control box. I simply rewired my left and up arrows to work as button 1 and 2. The mapping doesn't mind in stepmania and I'm all the happier.Product is great. Does what it should.

I then went into the Control Panel > Game Controllers and calibrated the controller, but I have a feeling it didn't need it, as the axis were dead center already. I gather that if you want the rumble or dance pad features to work you have to go to some website to download drivers for it. I haven't tested that theory.

The book is disappointing, it lacks character development, suspense, or a truly interesting storyline that is the trademark of Star Wars. In addition the true with the Empire is disappointing, unrealistic, and goes against everything the \\"rebels\\" believe in. In addition the authour leaves us confused at many points with his explanations and its narritive.However I do believe that there are other good Star Wars books, The best I've read is Shadows of the Empire, and Timothy Zahn's blockbuster series. (although the second was a little slow)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luke Sywalker has a personality!","review":"I never would have thought it possible! Kathy Tyers succeeds in turning Luke into a halfway admirable PERSON instead of just an archetypal Hero/Marionette. This book is filled with action, intrigue, development of most of the major SW characters, and believable antagonists. I read the Zahn stuff and hated every word of it for being forced, contrived, hoky--you name it. I didn't expect to ever read another Star Wars takeoff as long as I lived.

It is a little hard to follow and to read, but that just makes it better. The Ssi-ruuk are different, I wish she used a better alien race. But even though I did not realy like the Ssi-ruuk, Kathy Tyers did a very good job on them. The book was a little slow, but realy picked up in about the last 8 or so chapters. I wish Lando could of been in it too. Also, Wedge should have gotten a bigger part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little slow","review":"A pretty good book overall, and Tyers does a great job at sticking to the characters personalities, as well as writing interesting and believable new characters. Dev was one of my faves, and I was almost as upset as Luke was at the end. The Ssi-ruu are interesting, and downright evil. I loved them! Tyers' interaction between new and old characters is great, shedding light on a new side of Luke Skywalker, and Leia finally comes to terms with her lineage.The beginning is a little slow, and there's quite a bit of politics involved in the middle, but the end battle is exciting. And seeing the Alliance and the Imperials fight together is new and very interesting.A recommended read to a Star Wars fan, but anyone else had better skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Leia seems to hate the idea of Vader being her dad, and she doesn't want anyone to know it.

I mean, in K.T.'s book names like Ssi-ruuk and Shreeftut, Firwirrung, Manchisco, Ssiruuvi and some other complicated names keep poping up. Why don't writers stick to George Lucas philosophy when writing a book? I mean, how complicated are Luke Skywalker or Han Solo anyway? The book starts weak but takes off on page 100 aprox. It is well writen but names keep making it hard for one to follow the story, like a bad soap opera (Is any soap opera good?)The thing i couldn't stand is this far out stuff about Ssi-ruuks sucking some guy's soul and using it to pilot killer space droids. Get some other S.W. book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"The main problem in this book is that the plot is entirely irrelevant to anything. It has no effect on future conlificts and save for the beginning, doesn't tie into the past... Now, not many women have written Star Wars books but when they do try the plots are hollow and seem too dumbed down... Also, the characters aren't very well developed... The Ssi-ruuk are very cool, I have to admit, but the author didn't really go anywhere with them. All they did was sit around with Dev. There was also way too much description about them. Every single time that it's from Dev's point of view, it restates something about their physical features like their triple-lidded eyes.Also, it's ironic how everything just works out... Pointless ending to a pointless story.This book did make an effort at being good and interesting but it failed. The only saving grace was the Ssi-ruuk but they could have been better portrayed. Nice try."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far one of the better Star Wars books!","review":"I've read most of the Star Wars novels and this one is one of my favorites. I like the way Luke's still young and has a lot of the farm-boy still in him, and isn't the almost-gloomy Jedi Master he becomes later on. I also liked the way the Rebels and Imperials fought side-by-side to beat off dem Fluties. Kathy Tyers is a great writer with a promising future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women writers rule!","review":"It makes the blood in my system boil when I read anti-women comments. Oh my, oh my. What century are they living in? Disgust and loathe! Anyway, as a true SW freak, I say that Kathleen Tyers has written a beautiful book. This is what Star Wars is about. Action, death, fights, weapons, compassion, and love. She has it going on, all signed, sealed, and delivered. It just proves to the men that women can write, and we shall be leaving you in the dust faster than you can say \\"May the Force be with you!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Story \\"Ok\\", Writing Style \\"Blah\\"","review":"I'm not going to go into the story/plot, etc...

It was hard to follow who was thinking, who was she flashing to, and the overall choppiness of concepts.Read it for the story, but don't expect a fast, flowing, easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your tastes.","review":"As a hardcore Star Wars fan i couldn't pass up the oppertunity to read about what happens when the movies end. Over all the story was not bad but not authentic. You have to keep in mind this is not what George Lucas said happend after the movies. The story is just someones imagination on paper. If you are like me i would suggest passing on the book and writing down your own thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh....","review":"I've read a lot of Star Wars novels, and I am a total Star Wars junkie. I've liked, or at least admired, just about everything written to compliment the Star Wars genre, but this ... should never have been written. I can't see how it fits in with Star Wars at all, it's much better suited for Star Trek. I urge everyone to read all Star Wars novels, and that includes this one, but I'd much rather I hadn't bothered. The author captured more or less none of the feeling of Star Wars, and it's blatantly obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good really","review":"boring. the heroes improbably tossed out into the thick of things after blowing up their second death star. hard to finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked Out the Life-Force Like a Ssi-Ruuk","review":"In this installment of the EU, the rebels learn that not everybody hates the Empire and loves the Jedi.

The aliens and there ship were very cool. The book started very well, but as the went on the plot nearly end and everyone just sat around. As the book neared the end the story got more interesting, but there was know reason for the alien retreat. They had lost there flag ship but they still could have defeated the rebels and the empire. They should scrap this book and have Timothy Zahn rewrite it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please wake me up when its over!","review":"This book was way over rated.

Anderson, at least. However, it DID kind of start off the annoying, \\"Let's see how many girlfriends Luke can have\\" trend. The new alien additions were okay, and I would have liked to see them in a later book, but the \\"truce\\" part was stupid. I don't think either the Empire OR the N. Republic would make a truce with eachother. Or if they had, and this book was really serious about a final Empire/Alliance truce, (like \\"Vision of the Future\\" was), then the truce should have showed both sides the benefits of peace and spelled out a new era of trnquility for the galaxy.But if it did, it wouldn't be \\"Star WARS,\\" now, would it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: slow","review":"Never buy a book about a \\"Truce.\\" I will remember this forever. Kathy Tyers was good at molding her additions to the Star Wars universe, including the awesome Ssi-Ruuk, but she couldn't put pictures in my mind and the story that made use of these features was bland. Worst of all, though, was the boringness of the book. Sure, it picked up around the end (although the action never reached a fever pitch like it should), but I was really struggling through it. The one-day-after-ROTJ didn't seem like a fitting timeframe for these events. Some of the names were also unpronounceable. Slightly below average, but not awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Luke Skywalker flirting?","review":"I think the author totally messed up in making Luke flirt with Gariel Captison. Even if he did decide to do any flirting,(which would be a pretty big event on its own), he wouldn't flirt with an Imperial senator who hates Jedi. Dev Sibbwarra was a brainwashed idiot who was just a slave, so why does he get Jedi powers? The Ssi-ruuk were very lame villians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the worst!!","review":"If you're a new reader to the continuation of the Star Wars universe & are overwhelmed by so many books, let me offer some advice: Skip this book!!While not all writer's are going to have a George Lucas-like handle on these characters like Zahn & Anderson does, Tyers has a handle on none of them.Not only that but she's also the worst kind of Star Wars writer - the kind that tries to turn it into hardcore sci-fi & what made Star Wars great was it wasn't sci-fi, it was sci-fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird story, but exciting never the less...","review":"This is a good book for only true Star Wars junkies to read... It suffers from a truly weird plot, and sometimes just doesn't make a lot of sense. I found myself rereading sentences and dissecting dialogue to make any sense of some of the sentences. There is nothing absolutely necessary to read in this book to move along the Star Wars sequel book chain. I just wouldn't reccomend this one, especially to younger readers.

Although a Star Wars freak, I don't read all that many of the books based on \\"before and after\\" the movies; one of the main reasons for this is that authors tend to take to many(in my opinion) liberties with charachters and such. I believe that, to a small extent, that applies to The Truce at Bakura. My main gripe is that there just isn't enough technical Star Warsy jargon. Fortunately, this will only bother real S.W. fanatics(a.k.a. ME).

The characters were completely wrong, especially Luke, who, though the book is set immediately after the destruction of the second death star, is young and cute and enthusiastically puppy-like, not to mention often the fact that he is often described as being blond.

He looks blonde to me! Someone call up Mark Hamill and see what he considers himself! People are also talking about how it was unrealistic for the Empire and the Alliance to team up. But if you read the story carefully, there really was no choice. With the Emperor dead, Bakura didn't have very much defense from the Ssi-ruuvi. Plus, the Rebels couldn't leave Bakura without striking up some sort of deal. And, last, Leia herself said that she had nothing against Empire-ruled worlds, only the Empire itself. To me, this explains the whole deal. Overall, this was a pretty decent book, and I enjoyed reading it. I think some people just need to lighten up and not be so criticizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's just say this book ROCKS!","review":"I've read some of the other Star Wars books, and they've all been boring.THIS one, however...

By viewing it objectively after some time has passed, it fares better, but it's still not the best. It picks up IMMEDIATELY after ROTJ. Like, the next day. They get a distress call from an outlying Imperial world, Bakura, telling of an evil foe come to kill them all. So, Our Heroes go out there in force, and there are forced to make a treaty with the Imperials to fight a common foe, the Ssi-ruk. (who are V-ish, lizard aliens) It's one of the most cohesive books in the series. It sets out to tell one story, and that's what it does. However, much of the plot seems borrowed from other sources, and the Ssi-ruk never REALLY seem to fit within the Star Wars universe. (cross the Borg with the Visitors, and you've got 'em) It's not as flashy as many, but it is a solid read, especially if you aren't expecting non-stop action.

The GC still works great but my controller acts up a bit from time to time. The joystick on it either doesn't work when I move it forward or it hesitates after not responding. This is very very fustrating while playing Rouge Leader seeing how i would like to move down from time to time. Don't get me wrong the controller is still good, but i'm very seriously contemplating on buying a new one.I have also tried other companies brands but they are all worse and I regretfuly still own them.All in all, this controller still works allright with the exception of the joystick. The buttons still function correctly and c-stick still works but using the joystick, now, suxs. BE CAREFULL!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a controller","review":"Face it. Its a conttroler and its just that same as eny other. Don't go and by a sponge bob controler its JUST THE SAME!!! Do not bye this here on amazon. Buy it at wal-mart or target.

Very punctual timing and that's about as postive as its gonna get.First and formost the controlers are knock-offs they might say nintendo on the image displayed when you first look to purchase the product, however when they arrive its a totally different story. In conparision to the regular nintiedo controlers size and weight are different. \\"The knockoffs are much lighter and durable and the size is much smaller. Me and my roomates used the controlers for 2weeks, and guess what they all stopped working. I purchased four of them all in different colors and every single one of them stopped working.

I got mine from Finest Play and from what I can tell, these controllers were all rebuilt fron parts of other controllers that were broken in one form or another. I got one controller that has the orange spice plug at the end instead of the silver plug and the other one had a black plug from the black controller. They are fine functionally but they were in worse condition than avertised. Used very good means that all parts on the contoller match and that they are free from major cosmetic damage. Thankfully I am good with the soldering iron and I got my controllers cord swapped for the spice cord and housing swapped for the one with the black end.

After 6 years of playing Video Games, the Controller acted all funny and stuff. It was acting weird, like the analog stick I wasn't moving but my character on the screen was walking into wall and boxes, without me moving the stick. I turned off the system and read the Instructions. I did what the Insrtuctions told me to do and everything was fine. Then it happened again in about the first 10 mins., I was playing. It was strange because it was working fine the day before that.

It works better than any other factory made controller so just rely on Nintendo products Made by nintendo and look for the Nintendo symbol on packages (I sound like the back of a game box). I don't have this controller but I have a platinum controller that came with my platinum Gamecube and it works alot better on Mario Kart: Double Dash than my controller made by Datel. That controller made me go really slow and the Z button and Start button had to get hit with a wrecking ball just to make it work. I will just sit that aside and buy a new black controller so I can tell which 1 is first and which 1 is second unlike my PS2 controllers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, it works exactly","review":"Great product!

A black Gamecube Nintendo 1st party name brand original controller.I took it out of the bag (A plastic bag inside a brown mail package, not a box) and felt it. It felt like it had a chalky, dry, substance all over it, further inspection revealed that the controller was dirty and had chip marks all over it, they looked like dog bites. Wiped it up with a cleaner, problem didn't go away. Doesn't feel smooth and perfect but it'll do.All buttons are perfect, respond quickly, press down easily and smoothly, feels great in my hands other than the awkward texture.After a few hours of use, the texture isn't very bothersome.So basically this is a great, functional gamecube controller but it may be dirty and a little bit banged up, and it may take some getting used to if you prefer smooth, factory-direct plastic casing. Pretty much what you're asking for, a used product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect GC controller","review":"This is the authentic Nintendo Gamecube controller.

Would do business with again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Controller Crazy","review":"For Nintendo's Gamecube, there are really several choices you can choose from in the way of the controllers for the system. You can either choose the basic third-party controller from another company, that claims to be much better than the original controller's by Nintendo, or you can just stick with the traditional wired controller by Nintendo. The Gamecube controller is very simple and easy to master for several different video games for the Gamecube, and thensome. Nevertheless, many people may not want the original because of the price. It isn't the price, but the quality of the controller is what has to count. I like it in black, and Nintendo hits this nail on the head with controllers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real classic.","review":"Nintendo is phasing these out, but if you want to keep playing the classic Gamecube games you'll need at least one of these and your old Wii. True, Nintendo intends to make some Gamecube games available for download onto the WiiU, but that doesn't mean that all Gamecube games will be available. Best to hold on just to be sure.When you get controllers like these, though, always go with Nintendo-made products; all the others look very similar but you can feel right away the response times are not as sharp. And then later on, you'll see that quality is not as good when the controller breaks a month later (true story). That's when you will be kicking yourself, wishing you had forked over a little more money for a quality Nintendo product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"These original controllers are so much better than the knockoffs - It's cheaper in the long run.

It's remarkable how impending death can change one's beliefs. Now he says he \\"sees God in all things\\". How convenient.Listening to this unrepentant Stalinist singing songs about the birth of Jesus is as galling an experience as I have ever had. Similarly minded communists will buy this album, but only for political reasons.The music is uniformly bland, spare and empty of spirit.

The story is slow-paced but worth reading because of the wonderful characterizations and unusual plot. I really enjoyed the story that was part romance, part horror, and all suspense. The hero is not a perfect investigator, but that makes the story even more believable. I won't post any spoilers, but this book is one of my favorites on the dark side of the paranormal genre. Love the topic, the carefully crafted villains, and the outcome. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable, some flaws but enjoyable","review":"Sometimes I read a book and it feels \\"narrow.\\" By \\"narrow\\" I mean that I feel like I am reading a story that is kept to tight confines by the author - the world in which the characters live is not expansive and not realistic. This book is one of those books.It is also a bit unrealistic from time to time as the author drives the plot forward with bad decisions (like not getting help from the Police, or not asking why someone is being held hostage or not immediately killing the person who discovers the hostage, but instead putting them in a James Bond style situation that they have time to escape from) and unlikely scenarios.That said, it was still enjoyable as light reading with an interesting story and a somewhat clever twist at the end. I'd have given it 3 stars, but I've read some really bad stuff lately, and anything that I put down and consider an enjoyable (even if flawed) read gets four stars from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Diaper Bag","review":"When I registered for my son I registered for the Quattro Tour Travel System in Kenbrook and was upset they didn't have anything to match it.

At first I was using the one the hospital had given me but then I switched and now it is the only one I use. It has plenty of room for everything my son needs when I take him to the babysitter every morning and plenty of room for long afternoon trips. I love that it has the thermal side bottle pockets to help keep his bottles cold. I also love that it has the \\"dirty duds\\" bag, this way there is a place for the babysitter to put his dirty clothes without getting his stuff a mess. I would definitely reccomend this diaper bag!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bag","review":"This diaper bag was given to me from the same person who bought the travel system with the matching print.

There are also little compartments throughout the bag to hold little extra things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geat Diaper Bag","review":"My husband and I are glad we picked this diaper bag.

This glossy, over-produced album never had a chance. Instantly bound for the cut out bins, it never got promotion or airplay, this is his most removed from the ISB style that he ever released. The songs themselves aren't bad, indeed he has keep performing Mexican Girl and a couple of others but, the layer upon layer of slick studio sound tires the ear quickly. Producer Hugh Murphy had hit it big with Gerry Rafferty about that same time, but missed with Mike Heron. For the most rabid ISB/Mike Heron fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the center, a love story...","review":"Peter Claire travels in 1629 from England to Denmark to be part of King Christian IV's orchestra. Swirling around him are tons of stories, and at least 12+ different viewpoints are used in the book, each showing the differences of how people's age, sex and status makes them view events. King Christian and his wife Kirsten's marriage is on the rocks, the country of Denmark is almost broke, and Peter and his love Emilia are kept away from each other. We also see the stories of how King Christian rose to become a king, and how Peter's sister prepares for a marriage at home, while Emilia's family falls apart because of her wicked stepmother's horrible games. You will not be able to predict what will happen next, and you often wonder if Peter and Emilia will EVER be reunited with all lies and deceptions surrounding them. This is truly one of the best historical fiction books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book and writer","review":"A good friend recommended this book to me. I started reading and became totally absorbed. Beautifully detailed character development and intricate yet well resolved story. So very easy to read as well. The book gave me enormous pleasure and an insight into life during the 17th Century in Europe. Fabulous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters in Pursuit of Harmony","review":"Tremain plays with opposites and contrasts, point and counter-point. Intertwoven tales are composed of yearning and loathing, the magical and the mundane, expectation and dread, youth and age, imaginings and realities, miraculous and carnal -- the very stuff of life and death. The book is large, sometimes bawdy, often hilarious. Each character pursues his or her version of harmony. In one of the most striking and ironic demonstrations of power and creativity, Christian IV seems to have brought forth the music he adores from the stone floor of a palace state room. How has he produced this wonder? Dispatched to the cold, almost lightless wine cellar beneath, the orchestra plays the music they must, glorious sound that is conveyed to state room and ears by the King's cunningly engineered system of pipes and grates and ducts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grand Disappointment, and cannot be Silent about it.","review":"I agree with comments made by the other reviewers that gave this book 1 star. When i finished it, and yes it was struggle to do that, I closed it and said out loud \\"are you kidding me?\\" It was convoluted, dragged out, and just plain boring. I even wondered what the was the point of some of the characters? They came and went just to fill up pages. This is the first book I have read by this author, and it will be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting & Excellent character development","review":"I am not really sure why i like this book so much. It is an interesting setting, 17th centurty Denmark, and i always enjoy a good flash of a unique historical setting. It is easy to identify and sympathize with King Christian. However, the most fun character is the queen, or his harlot as she calls herself. She is a nasty woman, unloving of her's and all children, virtually heartless, but she is a lot of fun to read. The character interaction and their scheming and the resulting interplay is also a lot of fun. The author does a great of of writing an enchanting, lifelike, 20th century fairy tale. I love it. Amazon predicted i would, but I remain unsure why I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music and silence-just a romantic romp?","review":"Having just finished what i believed to be a book focusing on music in history with perhaps a bit of romance thrown in, i was disappointed to find a book in which the musician whom we are led to believe is to be our hero, is instead given only passing treatment as indeed is anything musical. In addition to this, tremain sees fit to transpose not only modern language but also attitudes onto her characters, especially those who are female. Surely if she wished to write about such characters it would have saved her a great deal of trouble simply to place the book in a more modern context instead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"i have always grown up eating these beans.

It features a young student who inherits millions (in condition he graduate and marry) and a woman who probably just wants to get hold of the money. Viz were very brave to publish this book because it doesn't offer violence and fantasy related themes and it targets mature readers while the american comics market is pretty much juvenile. It is a very witty book, but if you want porn or violence look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mature Manga for the Mature Reader","review":"Without a doubt, Dance Till Tomorrow is an essential manga for the mature and discriminating reader. The story is complex, funny, and sexy all at the same time. Best of all, it portrays realistic characters in realistic situations. While it is not a kids title, all the sexy situations are very tastefully done and unless you have some real problem with sex, you'll have no problems with this title. So go ahead and read it, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff","review":"Dance Till Tomorrow is an excellent manga series. The humor is adult natured, but is not the typical romantic-comedy that is prevelant in much manga. The main characters are flawed, complex, and often don't even know what they want themselves. I find that a nice change and fairly realistic. The art is high-quality with little use of filler or stock images.Fans of manga like Ranma and Ah My Goddess will find the humor to be a little more adult and the characters more complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not the real McCoy?","review":"As another reviewer noted, this is NOT the music used at the games! Why couldn't they put together a CD with the music used at the opening and closing ceremonies? Why not a DVD of those ceremonies (this time WITHOUT NBC's annoying commentary and constant commercial interruption!)? Those ceremonies, as are all Olympic Ceremonies, are carefully choreographed and usually magnificent occasions worthy of preservation on DVD. Somehow, it all just gets trashed and forgotten. After the tremendous expense involved, that seems incredibly wasteful. The drum beats at the beginning of the opening ceremony sent chills down my spine!

As it nears being done the liquid spatters out the air hole all over my countertop. What a mess! I threw away the packing materials or I would probably return it.

Buy a more expensive rice cooker because they usually make replacement bowls, or go with the Panasonic SR-G10G which has an aluminum pot.When it was actually safe to use, the rice cooker actually performed very well.

It blows out an immense amount of gooey steam water! I cooked brown rice, followed directions exactly, even soaking for an hour first. It was only 2/3's of the capacity, but it blew junk out the sides of the lid and out of the little blowhole and left a large puddle of gooey rice water around and under itself. A MAJOR mess.I haven't even tasted the rice. So what if it's good? You can't cook with an appliance like this unless you put it in a giant sink or outdoors somewhere. What in the world is the deal?

Unfortunately, disaster struck on the first time out. I cooked 2 cups of brown rice without washing it first (my preference). The rice cooked perfectly. There was a little spitting but nothing like the other reviewers describe. I scooped out about a cup to eat and, because the instructions say not to leave the unit on \\"warm\\" with a small amount of rice, I turned it off and let the remaining rice sit while I ate. After about 15 minutes or so I heard a loud \\"bang\\" in the kitchen and found that the lid had broken into a million pieces. I don't see any other complaints like this, so it was probably some kind of defect, but that's what happened!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interactive guessing game - switch turns off before rice cooks.","review":"My last rice cooker worked great for almost 10 years. My microwavable rice cooker is still great about 10+ years. But last year I purchased the Sanyo EC-505.I use the rice cooker maybe once a month. I don't need something programmable and I have steamers and slow cookers.All I wanted was a rice cooker with an 'ON' switch. Apparently, using the 'on' switch proved too much for this workhorse and within a year the switch turns itself 'off' sometime during the cooking process.When? Who knows ... you'll have to check every 5 minutes because you'll never know when the switch will flip from 'on' to 'warm'. Somtimes it's 1 minute into cooking, sometimes it's 15 minutes.Having rice has turned into a fun new game of \\"Whose turn is it to watch the rice cooker?\\"I'm now purchasing a $200 Zojirushi rice cooker because $30 a year ain't worth the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for historic perspective on Central Highlands","review":"A great book for a recent but historic perspective on the Vietnamese Central Highlands and her people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built In Obsolescence?

These problems start between 6 months to a year of use. Each time we have called Dish Network and they have exchanged it, then it takes some time to set up the new DVR and get it synced with your satellite feed etc. Then months later - same thing. I should mention that there was one exception: one DVR that was sent to us for exchange was faulty right out of the box.

I had a hard time putting the book down.This book \\"Vanish\\" is also very captivating and you want to know what happens next. The way Tess wrote the book is by introducing every character in each chapter and bringing the characters together towards the end of the mystery.The reader keeps guessing how the characters are related in this story plot.This thriller will keep you in suspense. I ordered more of this great author's books.Highly recommended to any mystery fan. 5 Kudo Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Back to Writing About Cases","review":"I would have rated this book as 3.5 stars if I could have. Gerritsen's previous books focused on the cases. While the personal lives of the characters were discussed, it was done in the context of the cases.This one focuses almost as much on Jane and Gabriel's marriage and the birth of their daughter as it does the case in question. When she writes about the killings, the book is up to her normal standards. But I got so sick of reading about the baby and how she doesn't sleep or drink breastmilk!I used to love Patricia Cornwell's books, but got annoyed and stopped reading then when she started focusing on the characters. I hope Garritsen doesn't do the same. I would hate to lose another author to the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull in parts","review":"Poor enough by Tess G standards.

This one fell short for me in several ways. I am to believe that a one week past her due date a female police officer would wrestle a hostile defendant to the ground in court. Also that she would continually place her unborn child, herself, and then her newborn infant in critical danger, to the point of digging both their graves at gunpoint. I speak from experience, police work being my chosen profession during both my children's births. No matter the amount of dedication, no woman would behave in this way.

One of her most memorable books was \\"Gravity\\" which I read til dawn despite needing to go to work next morning.However, \\"Vanish\\" is not on of those books. The story/premise, which I will not reveal is quite boring/run of the mill. I don't really mind that Detective Rizzo makes another appearance, but I do object when authors devote more of the book to the old characters than to the story. Hello, these are supposed to be thrillers and not drama books. I do not really need to know that much about Rizzo and her family. Incidentally, that is what has made the TV series Law and Order a hit, concentration on the story and not the characters. Still, this book is easy reading and easy to follow, but not one that will make me Say Wha? at work the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"I love Tess Gerritsen's books! \\"Vanish\\" has the usual twists and turns that keep you reading till dawn.

Sets up a great premise with Jane in labor after a courtroom incident. Then she's suddenly involved in hostage situation while still in labor with any rescue attempt having to helplessly wait outside, you think you're about to go on a wild ride.. but instead what you get from that point on is a long drawn out character study of others and then zooming back and forth and sideways into situations that were not just far fetched but that I found just no emotional attachment, so that for me made it very tedious and boring .Jane is the one we care about and to put her in a dangerous, very vulnerable situation only to switch gears and to then not even make her the central point was totally deflating for this reader. If Tess had stayed more focus on the initial scenario I would of rated it much higher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Tess Gerritsen","review":"A real page turner! As always Ms Gerritsen gives us twists and turns to create a really entertaining read page after page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly tedious","review":"The plot is painfully predictable. The subject -- while one that I wish was more commonly recognized -- is treated with kid gloves on one hand and moaning mournful weeping and guilt-ridden pity on the other. The characters are plastic. The conspiracy is not believable. The action drags especially through the second half, when one might think suspense (\\"or something\\") might be happening. I would rather rub cheese graters on my genitals than read this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an official controller, broke after a week.","review":"I purchased this because it said in the description that it was an official Nintendo controller, it is not. It does, however, look exactly like the official Nintendo controller so I figured there wouldn't be much difference, but boy was I wrong.After a week the C stick would stick, meaning you would have to manually center it when not using it. The Z button also stuck, and I have yet to be able to to fix this... so when I play games with this controller it plays like the Z-button is constantly being held down.Do not buy this, and I suspect many of the other GameCube controller deals online are similar to this.

This one just doesn't last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"These are not Nintendo controllers, and as such they don't have the quality of Nintendo products.

This is not a Nintendo product--even though it says that it is on Amazon. The package doesn't say \\"Nintendo\\" anywhere! I bought these from two different sellers--none was a Nintendo product.

Some of the childhood fears that this book makes references to are things like being afraid of the dark, afraid of going into small spaces like a culvert at the end of the driveway, or being afraid something is under our beds.My favorite story in particular is the one about the boy in his room in bed. He's speaking to the monster under his bed and is under the impression that if he's under the covers, he's safe. That was not a correct assumption on the boy's part.I highly recommend this book, but only for those who have enough courage to withstand the fears that are so intensely described in this book.

In dealing with a language that is largely marginalized, Kanae chooses a new median by which to establish a voice. This voice illustrates the history behind Pidgin, questions the \\"melting pot\\" ideals of America, and encourages others to speak up too. The book poignantly delves into how language is formed and how language can shape a person. My only complaint is a wanting of more with the story of Harold and others like him.

What it does have, however, is an excessive amount of sweetener. I prefer things not to be very sweet, so your taste may differ, but I find it almost intolerably sweet. I also find that when I make it in a blender with ice as recommended it can be rather unpleasantly thick. Here's what I do to make it more to my taste: use only one to one and a half scoops (the instructions say to use two); use skim milk rather than water; and add a tablespoon or so of plain cocoa powder. I've doctored this in many other ways for variety: add mint extract, or cinnamon, or half a banana, etc. Of course, some of these modify the calorie count and nutritional content of the finished shake, so adjust accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't figure how to attach it.","review":"I've put on toilet seats before and they are pretty much no-brainers.

Its perfect for kids age 4-9 maybe but as far as adults, not so much. The graphics are overly colourful and showy. The gameplay is painfully boring. The video that Nintendo is showing of people still on thier couch and watching the screen... pretty much sums up the game. You sit and wait for the graphics to animate on and off then after a few minutes you can stand up and actually do something. Then back to sitting. Its basically a board game with very few and far between moments of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as fun as watching grass grow....","review":"This has to be one of the worst boring games I have ever had the displeasure of playing. It's more exciting to sit outside and watch the grass grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, especially after such a long wait!","review":"As a Gamecube owner who has every one of the Mario series games Nintendo has made, all I can say is that Mario Party 8 for Wii has been a big let down. Party 8 seems more like a demo disc of half baked games than a premium game disc that sells for $50. The games played out more like silly and tedious board games and basically gave me a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth anyones time","review":"This game isn't even worth anyones time or money. I excitedly waited for this game for my birthday to only find out I can unlock the games within 3 hours of gameplay and that most of the games did not utilize the wii remote sensory and advises people to use it as a simple joystick. Also, most of the games and stages are ripoff's of previous mario party games. Even worst is that the computers in the game roll straight 10's or they land on event buttons time after time, even on easy. The fun and challenges once present in mario party is completely lost in this game, especially in the once terrifying duel battles, which doesn't challenge the player nor is anything lost in the end that you couldn't get back within 2 or 3 turns. Buy this game if you want something you can beat a 3 hours and torture your friends with, otherwise don't waste your time. Theirs much better games to play out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, no more Mario Parties!","review":"I'm getting sick of Nintendo releasing a new Mario Party every one or two years. The series has also been lousy, and it's getting worse. The graphics and sound are even worse than your typical Mario Party, in fact they wouldn't even be worthy of Gamecube's average quality. All the modes and minigames are boring. So far in this entire series, no Mario Party game has been unique= less and less replay value. I rate this game 32/100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun???","review":"I bought this game to play with my kids, but really this is not very fun at all.

It really was a lot of fun, with a great deal of competitiveness. I only played one of the games with him, but later went back myself and tried some of the others and the mini-games. It's a fun thing to do during free time, and a lot more fun with multiple players.Some of the objectives and controls took me a minute to grasp (mostly because I don't play with the Wii a lot), but I managed to kick his butt several times on my first time playing, so they're still pretty easy to pick up.Overall, it's not the best game ever made, but it's a lot more fun than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"bought this game for my kids but the whole family has used it , has brought my family hours of fun good game to have for the whole family"},{"rating":"2","title":"Party Time!","review":"This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and I know she and her friends will have a great time with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evan's review.","review":"It's very GOOD but it's HARD!

I used it to get my parents used to playing the Wii. It's a bit more advanced in its entirety than the Wii Play games (bowling, tennis, etc.) It allows someone who is not used to the Wii, let alone video game consoles, to progress to other games like Zelda or Mario Cart.The appeal of this game is that the basic board game play is easy and intuitive. It's simple enough to learn and it keeps newbies involved no matter how good or bad they are doing. The mini-games at the end of each round are always fun. There are so many different mini-games that it's rare the same one is picked twice. These games show off the many unique traits of the Wii-mote controller and is a perfect launch pad to more advanced games.Highly recommended for family game night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Party 8","review":"This is a great family game.

The only problem is that most of the games for it only allow one to two players at any given time, so Nintendo comes out with MARIO PARTY 8! this game is a 4 out of 5 stars in one player mode, but when you get three or four people playing, it ROCKS!!!! this is a SPECTACULAR game to play with your friends. It will entertain you and your guests for hours! The Wii remote is the key to this games great multiplayer action. you can enjoy different kinds of gameplay like 1 on 3, 2 on 2, or every man for himself. each type of gameplay has games that are unique it. Like one of the 1 on 3 games is, one person shoots snowballs at the other three, and another is the three trying to stop the one from making it it the top of a tower. So, in summery, THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game","review":"The only reason why it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that you have to repeatedly press 'A' over and over again to get past multiple redundant menus and prompts.

I am not a fan of the Wii motion sensor controls, and prefer the Gamecube controllers when I play it at my cousin's house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game!","review":"This game is a lot of fun for up to four people. It's a little bit sad if you have five or six people, though, and someone has to get left out. Each game takes a while, so if you do have extra people, they'd have to wait about an hour before you can rotate. You could also hand the remote back and forth during the game, but I don't think that's as much fun. The game is definitely family friendly, though we're all adults and have a great time playing. There is a little bit of strategy involved but it's mostly luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MARIO GAME THAT I HAVE","review":"When I played Mario Party 8 at a relatives house, I thought it would be very fun to have. I WAS WRONG. First, pretty boring game play. All you do is run around a board with whatever character you chose and play mini-games. Second, there is not really much to unlock. There are really only 3 main things to unlock. So pretty much it is just a board game on your TV. I am a Nintendo fan, but this is [...]. My advice is to play it at a friends house or rent it.

I had never played it. I put the game in my Wii and was greeted with a sickeningly happy MARIO PARTY 8!!! What was even worse was the WELCOME TO THE STAR CARNIVAL I had to hear every time I turned the game on. After I got over that shock, I began to play. I soon met the hosts, Ballyhoo and Big Top. They are much more annoying than their names and they sounds they make when they talk give me a headache. I almost had a mental breakdown when Ballyhoo said phrases like \\"pony up\\". The other characters phrases aren't much better (Daisy says \\"neato\\"!!!). The boards also have characters that are a little too childish for me. This game could have easily gotten five stars with Toadsworth returning as the host, less annoying characters, and more classic game boards.Please get Brawl, Mario Cart Wii, or a gamecube game. The long golden days of Nintendo are over."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARO PARTY 8 IS GREAT","review":"MARIO PARTY 8 IS GREAT.

That would be cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, like a board game","review":"First impression: This is my first experience with the Mario Party game series. The board games are fun, but the downside is parts of them can be slow. This game takes a minimum of an hour to play with just one player even with the fastest settings. Most of this time is spent watching the same video animations over and over again. There isn't a way to save the game (unless I missed something) so you can't stop halfway into a stage. The tournament style does start you at the beginning of the stage you were on before, but I wish it would save in the middle of a stage. Each stage is well designed and creative. The minigames are fun, and once you unlock them in the normal board game you can play them by themselves.SUMMARY: I expected something faster paced and I am disappointed. It could be used to relax at the end of a day for those with time, but I don't think I'll play it much and I regret choosing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little lacking","review":"My son and I have enjoyed the Mario Party games but with the Wii Mario Party we feel that the mini games were lacking, they could be a lot better so we were disappointed. It seems that some of the mini games that are in previous games could of been incorporated with the 8 but weren't. There are a couple of mini games that are impossible to beat when playing against computer characters.We also think the game itself doesn't play as well as the others, for instance you get candy pieces that do different things when playing and we find that this feature doesn't really add anything to playing the game. We are just hoping that they will improve the game for when Mario Party 9 comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much of a Party","review":"I have owned the very first Mario Party for Nintendo 64 and now that I have purchased Mario Party 8 and played it, it's a HUGE downgrade! In the first Mario Party you can purchase different trophies to gamble your coins, different blocks to use on the game boards, break records, etc. In Mario Party 8, there isn't much you can do beside play the board games, the mini games aren't much fun, some of the new characters are plain and no matter how good you do in the board games, you still get the same amount of carnival cards! The bottom line is, this game is boring and nothing compared to the first Mario Party!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game for groups game","review":"I bought this game for me 7 years brother and he loves the game.

Instead of getting this, get Super Monkeyball (with it's large collection of mini-games, some good and many lame), or Big Brain Academy (all good), or something else, anything else.This game moves so slow, that my son wanted me to make the game start, while we were towards the end of playing a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, unoriginal and Bland","review":"I had high hopes for this game. Nintendo could have done a lot with the wii's capabilities in a game like this. Nonetheless, all they did was recycle the same old button mashers or \\"guess what bomb will blow up your friend\\" type games.

So far, not so good! It is probably more of a kids game or a parent with kids game, but does not seem like a good party game for adults. I think, to be fair, the hype had me expecting more than what the game actually offers. Unless it is for kids, I would wait and get a used copy for less or at least rent it to see if it is the type of game you would enjoy for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring if not playing with 4 people","review":"My husband and I got this game to play together because a friend of his said it was tons of fun. We played it once and were 100% bored with it. You have to play with 4 people, so if you don't have 4 then you get the computer for the rest of the people...thats not fun to just sit there waiting for the computer to play. We didn't touch it again and ended up giving it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tedious","review":"Purchased this with expectations that the mini-games would be easy to get into and fun. After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious. Every game seems to have 10 or so \\"intro\\" screens that you have to go through. To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens. Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll. Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again. This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multi player good...game bad","review":"We did not like this version as much as some of the older Mario parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Party again...","review":"Wow! The 8th Mario Party is already out. I just got a wii a couple of days ago and this is my first game I bought besides Wii Sports. I have played Wii a lot before buying it so I do have some experiance. I only have the fourth and fifth though.Gameplay: Fun, but even 15 turns is very, very long and gets boringMini Games: Too easy, but fun with the wii remoteOverall: Good, this game could get boring soon but it is fun for now. There are a lot of unlockables which makes the game fun. Where are Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, and Super smash bros. brawl? The wii will rise up in front of all other systems even more when those games come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great when comparing to other kids games","review":"I read some really great reviews about this game. After the initial play, my kids haven't touched it since. When comaring it to other games such as Just Dance 3 or Kirby's Epic Yarn or Disney Universe, it really doesn't stand up to them. My kids are 6 & 8 which maybe why they are not very interested in it. For younger children I can see how it'd be fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for family and friends","review":"This is a game that I have enjoyed playing with friends and family. It is an easy game to understand. I have also enjoyed exploring the game on my own as well. At times the game can get a little repetitive especially if you are playing on your own. But as a game for more than one player I find it great fun. The mini games allow a range of skills to be needed and so therefore allows different people to win each time. You just need to have those 4 remotes to really max out the fun for all which of course is the down side. So for that and it being a little repetitive I have removed a star. But I would recommend as a good game to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same great mario party gameplay, but nothing new.","review":"It's exactly what you would expect from a Mario Party game.

The dialog is inane and bordering on the ridiculous at times. The characters are shallow and one dimensional. They often exhibit juvenile and selfish behavior that makes them extremely unlikeable.The overall plot makes no sense. The author spends the first 100 pages describing the passionate (and borderline obsessive) love between the female lead and her first husband. Then her husband dies in battle, so she shrugs her shoulders and falls madly in love with her husband's best friend in a matter of weeks. I will admit that this is where I stopped reading, so if the story picks up dramatically after page 180, I apologize."},{"rating":"2","title":"dellicate web, slowly built","review":"Mary Balogh's books are all must reads. This one takes a bit longer than her others to get into but the final 85% of the book is a real page turner.The difference here from her other books is that she goes more deeply into the effects of battlefield conflict on the lives of her characters. This isn't done in a gory way, but rather on how the physical and emotional injuries affect the lives of her characters. This is done with tenderness and isn't depressive... it just adds more depth to the lives we're reading about.If this is a harbinger of her future work, she is striving to give a greater depth and interest to her protagonists.

It does take some time to put together, but seems to be staying together just fine. He received this as an early Christmas present and hasn't stopped playing with it since. There is a small square on the top of the loop that you have to make sure is on the right way and not upside down or else the cars will not make it the whole way around the loop because there is only a magnet on one side of the square. When we originally put it together we had it on wrong and the cars kept falling off once they were upside down instead of going around the loop. Now after flipping over the square they haven't fallen off once. The set only comes with one car, but I bought him 4 more (...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hot Wheel quality","review":"We just purchased this toy when the Hot Wheel Cyborg Assault, my 4 yr old's gift from Santa, BROKE after a few minutes of (supervised) play. They were out of the Cyborg's so my son chose this. He is in there now calling it junk. It was confusing to assemble and the car will NOT stay on the track as it shows in the pictures, no matter how much you REV it. My son has a difficult time revving it without making it click, and then getting it on the track correctly is a trick. This one will probably go back to the store as well.

It has taken a while to get it back to the store, but even sitting out he and his 6-year-old brother have shown absolutely no interest. What a dud!

The track does not stay together properly and worst of all is the car that is supposed to make it all the way around the track.

We opened one, and promptly returned the other after the disappointment in the overall performance of the car and track. The one he kept has not been played with since."},{"rating":"1","title":"When good ideas go bad...","review":"I bought the Skyway track for my son's 5th birthday. The track is difficult to assemble for an adult, it doesn't stay together, and the cars can't make it around the track without falling off. This was a real disappointment. A simplied system of the track would be so much more appealing and functional. It's more fun to roll the cars up the refrigerator door. Also, the rev ups cars themselves come apart. They are held together with rubberbands! I'm not sure why the manufacturer can't find a better way to attach the body of the car to the wheels. My son was quickly frustrated and then disinterested. This is a great idea very poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car never seems to go all the way around.","review":"We got this toy yesterday, putting it together was no problem although it's a bit wobbly but it didn't fall appart on us, but my son is having more fun with the car by itself, we tried and tried to rev it up enough to go all the way but it always seems to stop right in the middle before the upside down stunt, we tried to start reving it up in the middle but it still lost energy and stopped in the middle, and it's very slow, it's like looking at a turtle walk.. so my son lost interest in it and is now playing with the car on the fridge and the dishwasher (magnetic)..

Some reviewers had said that this is just a repeat of what is shown on her television show.

As previously stated, there's real jems here that weren't singles, such as \\"Synchronicity I & II,\\" \\"Murder by Numbers,\\" and \\"O My God.\\" The technical production on the album is also fantastic, with a clear, punchy sound, a stark contrast to the bloated deep rumble of late 70's rock and disco.

Of the first 5 songs, \\"Synchronicity I\\" and \\"O My God\\" are a bit better than average, but the other 3 are forgettable filler.This recording is a tale of two halves.

Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 channel SACD? why even bother????","review":"If I had known that this SACD was only a 2 channel SACD, I would not have even bothered.Playing the original CD in all channel mode sounds better than this pile.Man, after listening to (my only other SACDs, so far) Joe Satriani's Strange Beautiful Music, and the 30 year anniversary hybrid SACD of Dark Side of the Moon, (both amazing in 6 channel SACD) this was a huge letdown.I like the album a lot, and am a big fan of The Police, but if you already have the original CD, THERE IS NO REASON to buy this thing, the better sampling rate doesn't help it a bit (get it?... hehehe).Call The Police, I've been ripped-off.!!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful ... nothing else to say.","review":"This one will be short. This is one of the best albums of the entire rock era. A true & total masterpiece.

How sad that this fine band didn't bow out on a higher note. 'Mediocrity' is the key word here (OK, OK, it has one good song on it. And I'm not saying which one it is.) It also ties with 'Zenyatta Mondata' for the title of the Ugliest Police Record Cover. Buy any of the other four Police albums before you buy this one. Woof woof!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a nice coaster!","review":"Although it is the most commercially successful of all the Police albums, it is their worst. None of the dark meanderings or social commentary on modern life as found on earlier albums is here. It is not a concept album like Ghost. What it is, is Pop mixed with forgettable songs that falls flat. Get the first four, avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few songs dissapoint me","review":"There are some really good songs on this album, but some of them, I was just not into. This was a breakthrough album for the police and should be in anyones Police album collection though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album you just gotta hear!","review":"Well i have owned Synchonicity a few times in my life.......RBCD......vinyl.......even remastered RBCD version from a few years ago, but this SACD mix sounds cleaner and has a deeper warmer feeling than all the previous versions. One of the immediate things is that I hear a another layer of percussion on some songs..... like \\"walking in your footsteps\\" and \\"tea in the Sahara\\" that i never heard before or the sax punches on \\"O My God\\" that make this song feel like i really never heard it before.Synchronicity II is still one of finest rock songs of the Police (and arguably of the 80's!) and sounds excellent on this disc with nice deep mid range sounds.The overall mix is well balanced and everything seems to be in the right proportions with drums, bass, guitar, synths and vocals all being well and evenly balanced.If you are a fan of this album then u owe it to yourself to find a copy of this SACD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"I had this when it first came out and thought it was ok then. As I'm older now I am looking back at a lot of the music I used to listen to with a fresh perspective. This is one of those albums, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a classic.","review":"All Police albums are notoriously patchy affairs and this was a golden opportunity to bow out with a truly great album. Afterall what could go wrong: they had a pile of cracking singles, a sprinkling of equally fine album tracks, and some great muscianship.Unfortunately it is the handful of weaker numbers that let it down: 'Mother' is jaw-droppingly awful and makes you grateful that CD players have skip functions; 'Miss Gradenko' sounds like a poor B-side and even Sting manages to contribute the dreary 'O My God'.The rest , however, is excellent and certainly makes this album worth purchasing. In fact it is the overall quality of the rest of the album that makes the aforementioned low points so difficult to bear. Almost (but not quite) a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I was buying enzymes from GNC that almost worked too well. They left me constipated and were extremely expensive. I saw these at the store and they were much cheaper, I tried them and it was like taking nothing at all.

My only complaint is that it is a bit old, stopping at 1995 or 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair look at a great race","review":"I got this book recently, and am not particularly happy with it. In 288 pages the author attempts to cover one of America's most important road races over a span of 45 years. Contrast this to LeMans 1960-69 which devotes 352 pages to only 10 years of that event. Around 100 pages is devoted to tabular material and index with minimal illustration. Most years are covered in 4 pages, and a few only have 2 pages of text and photos devoted to them in the body of the book. The author tried to choose between 2 and 5 photos per race with another in the tables.I was lucky enough to attend this race in 1965, 1966, and 1967, and hoped for more from this book. I'll keep this book, as it is the only book that covers this classic race, but would love to see one written with more detail, and a better selection of photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing Light","review":"When she lived in and wrote of the intensely spiritual Navajo world, Benedek felt herself turn introspective. A horrific brush with loss of vision precipitated what became a search for her place in relationship to the divine. The beginning of this book thrusts the reader with lightspeed into the center of her search, through psychoanalysis and religious education, for the life of devotion and spirituality she ultimately crafts. Benedek's slick, smart writing, her longing to reorient herself after a bad relationship and a life she deemed soulless and her lucky, lucky life ever since are fascinating. (She found her husband through a writing assignment on hackers). Benedek is enviable and inspirational. And she can write!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical USDA information","review":"For those to whom American agricultural history is important, these yearbooks are priceless.

I hope Ms.Martin goes back to her earlier form of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"Like most of the reviews previously written, I am a big fan of Kit Martin, and have enjoyed her older books more; but this book held a soft spot for me. It was not your typical lovers-meet-have-a-misunderstanding-and-make-up story. The characters are well defined and grow with each other, which I found refreshing. The story itself was rather predictible, but I would recommend this book as a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable read; didn't want the book to end!","review":"I have read several other Kat Martin books-- Dangerous Passions, Innocence Undone, and Bold Angel--but felt this was the best yet.

Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish, a definate keeper for any regency enthusiast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story line!","review":"I do believe some authors are suffering from writers' block and hence churning out a lot of gibberish now a days. Kat Martins' Wicked Promise is one of those books probably written when she underwent a writers' block.The story line is so oft repeated that there is nothing much to say about it, but what takes the cake are the lead characters, especially Elizabeth.Both the h&h are irritating to the core and garner no sympathy. It was not a very long book, but it still took 5 days for me to finish it.SKIP THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"20-yr-old ward moves into her rakish guardian's estate in order to be protected by molestation attempts of lecherous & obssessive man. She becomes attracted to him, despite knowing about his reputation & ex-convict past. But Hero is married but estranged from his wife for 9 yrs Hero. Hero tries to fight off his attraction to heroine b/c of his married status & tries to marry her off to a respectable man.Although Martin's writing is good, I did not find hero's sudden change from an uncaring, debauched man to a guilt-ridden, humbled one convincing. Martin didn't develop the romance between Hero & heroine enough to make that kind of major personality switch realistic. Also, the final outcome of Hero's estranged wife was too cliche.Cautiously recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a gift","review":"I never saw it but the person i gave it to really enjoyed this stand up and the shipping was quick the pricing was good, so i gave it 4 stars based off of another opinion other than mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy Koy Lights Out","review":"This is Joy Koy's second stand up video and it is hilarious (as usual).

I repeat my appraisal that if you want to throw away your money, you are welcome to buy one of these useless devices. They do nothing and there is no evidence anywhere to prove that they have any useful effect, other than the promise of unimaginable successful control of every pest under the sun.

There is absolutely no scientific evidence that electromagnetic emissions from this type of device have ANY effect on either rodents or insect pests.Ultrasonics does have a repellent effect on rodents, however, with this kind of placement, all that is achieved is a local repellency. Mice and other rodents are not in the exposed areas, and do just fine behind furniture, inside walls, in ceilings, and where ever they travel.I am a professional in the pest management field, and I can tell you that this is a total waste of money. It is noteworthy that the main Sunbeam corporation does not include these products in its product line.

Yes, this is the same guy who used to write a regular column for Network World for many years and if I am not mistaken for Data Communications prior to that. I used to like his columns so I took a gamble with this book. The book, to my delight, is just like his columns. Provocative, informative, challenging and often peppered with humor, folklore and good suggestions. Though XML isn&#65533;t its main focus it does provide some insight into XML and Web services and its treatment of portals is well worth looking at.

This newer model is bigger, using AA battery instead of AAA. I guess it will yield longer service time.To be fair, the product is an extra production, not a sole defense against mosquito bite. I was bitten when I went out at 7:00 PM with swarm of mosquitos around before the rain, and my sweat invited the bugs, too. When I exercise some common senses in conjunction with this product, I was seldom bitten. Mosquitos get nervous when they are in the same space with this product. They fly around you but not bother to attack.The regions I have applied this product are east coast USA and southern Taiwan. I am happy with it.The only thing I don't like about this product is, the clumsy on-off switch. The other issue to mention is, based on it's low price, the quality is not very persistent. You could easily break it if you are a rough type of person, and of course, it is made in China..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maine woods","review":"It works well! Battery lasts a long time.

And since it is ultrasonic there is no movement or sound to indicate it either. So if you don't twist it fully or the battery runs out, how are you to know?Maybe, no insect repeller is perfect, but I can't say that this thing works at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing ...!!","review":"This repeller (if you can call it that way) doesn't have a led indicator, so you'll never knows if the battery runs out or even if it is working.

Her piece--I fear I forget its title but contained the word \\"Archie\\"--stood far above the rest, with enormous emotional impact. So I opened Mother Grimm expecting, probably, more than any but the best fiction can give. And this novel is not quite up to that wonderful best--but, once again, it stands far above most science fiction novels of its sort, dealing with a young woman's explorations, forced as she seeks to escape the crushing role limitations inside the civilized hunkerings of the safety Dome, out in an unknown and mostly brutal wild, unsheltered area.

He also left out his fundamental of leaving plenty of hardworking people in his wake while he walked away unscathed.

They were both gorgeous, ho-hum, but I didn't feel I knew much else about them.

There are interesting twists to this novel - an intense, important friendship between the main character and a female-ex lover, a complicated relationship between Bobby and the art collector, but, but, but. What I really missed was any sense of real emotional depth between the characters in these supposed love relationships, once again seeing gay men portrayed as having no ability to do anything except have sex.

This was purchased last year and here are my thoughts:1) Will keep coffee hot and fresh for hours. Not luke warm, but almost as hot as when first brewed. (This at the end of 8-9 hours)2) Large push button often sticks and it's difficult to get it to release.3) Hinged-lid is not very stable, mine broke within months. Pot still works, I use mine daily.4) If you can find the one they make that has a lever-type pump, in my opinion, it's the greatest way to go. Not only does it pump better, but lastt longer also. Only replaced mine because I broke the liner and couldn't find a replacement at the time.5) These are awesome for retaining heat, look nice sitting on the counter and you'll never again have to drink burnt coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH... this pot design pinches fingers!","review":"I have uesd many thermal pump pots and found this one really needs improvements on it's \\"open top\\" button and it's \\"pump-action\\" button. These buttons are really unstable and wobbly and thus getting ones fingers pinched in them is common place...OUCH!There is a MUCH better design to look for that we use at work that looks very similiar to this one but has instead lid opener buttons on the sides of spout (MUCH better design) and also has a stainless steel pump bar that lifts up and locks in place for pumping. Look for this design rather than this all plastic one and I guarantee you will be much happier with it. When I purchased this one I was actually thinking it would be similiar to the ones we use at work but I was wrong. I actually hate this one and regret getting it. I didn't read or look at the picture closely enough to realize this one didn't have side buttons or stainless pump bar.

The instruction manual was out of date for the product I received. There were many parts in the box that were not mentioned in the manual.3. When first installed, the pivot points did not move freely. I called customer support and was told that the product was defective and to return it.

I was so happy when in the end they went to live with Bronson, who I think they should of been living with from the start. He is a great man and they will be very happy with him. I think Gavin and Christie's little romance is sweet although it does seem a little like incest. I mean technically Gavin is Christie's step-uncle. I would like to hear more about them but unfortunately this is the last book about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy ending for the Cutler family","review":"I was glad to know about Christie. I believe Dawn had done the right thing to stand up for her. I was glad Christie had a happy 16th birthday. But I was sad when Dawn and Jimmy got burned alive in the Cutler's Cove hotel. It made matters worse when Melanie and Richard caused trouble for Christie and Jefferson. What's more was Bet wouldn't listen to either Christie or Jefferson. Philip horribly betrayed Christie's trust by raping her one night. No wonder Christie ran away taking Jefferson with her. Yet I was glad that Christie found out she could trust Gavin and Bronson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things happen but they always work out.","review":"midnight Wispher is one of many V.C.Andrew books.

The same as Annie in Gates of Paradise","review":"I was very disappointed in this one. This book is almost the same as the ending of the Casteel series. This book is written by the ghost writer, and it seems that all of his books are just a like. It's predictable. It's so similar to Gates of Paradise, it's almost like the names were just changed.Flowers in the Attic is much better, as well as the the first three books in the Heaven series.This book is trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"An appropriate title for a good book...","review":"If you've read the preceding Dawn books, then you're bound to enjoy this, despite some of the sad things in here. The Meadows - previously highlighted in 'Secrets of the Morning', come into play here, this time as a refuge instead of a prison for poor Christie, Dawn's daughter.I have to say though that I was disappointed with something that happened near the beginning of this book. it felt like Neiderman was just repeating himself after writing Gates of Paradise because Christie loses her parents like Annie does, but at least the rest of the story is interesting enough to make up for it. Overall, this series reflects the best of Neiderman's efforts to ghostwrite for VC Andrews, and I enjoyed it a lot, though I didn't feel that this book was quite up to par as the first three in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cookie cookbook for all occasions, moods an diets!","review":"I am a collector of cookbooks and my favorites are cookie cookbooks.

It doesn't repel bugs, frankly, I think it attracts them. While it's supposed to be quiet, I did hear a high-pitched buzzing/humming noise, distractingly reminiscent of an impending migraine. My husband said it sounded like the ringing that they used as an audio effect in \\"The Shining,\\" and he wasn't far off.The only thing it did repel was the dog, who refused to go anywhere near it while it was on, without howling and whimpering.

Each of the 125 entries contains a summary of the film's context, a sketch of the censorship travails, and a brief bibliography -- encompassing on the average, one to three pages for each entry. Considering the subject-matter, the discussion style remains curiously colorless and detached. Despite the suggestive title, there's clearly no exploitation of the contents. And yet, the text could use some pepping up -- well-chosen photographs would have helped. Moreover, there's no apparent logic behind the films chosen for inclusion, no particular point to the \\"sampling\\", and since many of the entries are obscure to the average film-goer, its value as a reference is restricted. Nonetheless, for someone wanting an easily encompassed glimpse of film censorship world-wide, the book may fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Piano","review":"Very interesting for all JLL fans; shows some live footage, but also demonstrates JLL's style of piano playing and gives some insight into his career/family stories, told by JLL/his sister/daughter/and buddies.

The bottom line is, it just is not funny. I was trying to imagine Fallon running drafts or suggestions for the book by Tina Fey and others at SNL, and I can not imagine they would laugh. If they did, it would be for charity like the reaction people give when the retarded uncle is pitching his latest get-rich-quick scheme at a family reunion. These are like Steven Wright rejects. There wasn't anything biting, ironic, or even dark. Oh wait...I am geting an inspiration for another...Don't clean up the spilled milk you are crying over, you will be spilling another soon anyway.If that is funny to you, you will like this book.

In fact, he is a lot like this book. Gets a few laughs at first by mocking some easy targets, but after ten minutes I can call every uninspired line he'll say.If this kind of comedy is your \\"bag\\", hop in your Jetta, put in the I Love the 80s CD (for irony of course! only if people ask though, because this isn't clever irony anyway....) and head down to the bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a pessimist, buy this book.","review":"This book is pretty funny.

I guess I didn't do my research because I really thought that it would be longer or funnier or something. While I found a few pieces of advice funny like going to a laundromat to meet people, the majority of the book was not entertaining. The book got boring and stale very quickly, and it seemed that the majority of it was about the possibility of an untimely death. I truly am a huge Jimmy Fallon fan, and I would have liked to give this book a good review. The idea for the book was good, but they just ran out of ideas for fresh and interesting passages very quickly. I won't disregard any ventures that Jimmy or Gloria may make into writing again, but I will do my research.

Like many other authors of the 19th century, Mr. Caverly has indulged his imagination. That's fine if you're writing fiction but Caverly fancied himself an historian. Any one doing research on Hannah Duston should also consult primary source materials, and not rely solely on Caverly's 'Heroism'.The OCR on the kindle version is extremely poor.

Its strongest is \\"Glow Worm/Waveform\\", and Its weakest is \\"A Warning From The Sun\\"This album has a very odd feel to it, and I am sure that it is intentional. The electronics of all match the time of year exceptionally well. Coil manages to pull it off indescribably well. Spring's electronics feel renewing, starting, and building up. Summers's feel hazy, warm, sharp, and almost bright. Autumn's feel retrospective, aged, mature, aware, ending. Winter's feel cold, seperate, transcendetal, almost like \\"afterlife\\".

It had so many variations on how to install it with different types of seatbelts that it would have taken forever while we were sitting in the taxi to read the instructions for each one and figure out how to install it correctly.

He also explains about the different scroll saws and what to look for in a scroll saw. It also explains the different types of blades, wood, and material that can be used. Then it gives different exercises to do, starting with the beginner and if you make a mistake the different ways to fix it. I will definately buy this book, it will be an excellent reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for new Scroll Saw Users","review":"This book has been very very helpful for this new scroll saw user. The exercises are done in a way to teach the different techniques you will need as your skills progress, starting with the simplest and moving to the more complex. It also lets you start making stuff right from the beginning. The text is clear and friendly.I selfishly knocked off one star because I think books like this should be a looseleaf format, or bound some other way that allows for removal of patterns so they can be scanned without distortion. I took a razor knife and cut all the pages out and put them in a loose-leaf binder myself, but it would be nice if it came with removable pattern pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I am brand new to scrolling, and this book was a great learning tool for learning a variety of skills through different projects.

I thought the projects are useful and interesting. The only issue I had with the book is that I bought a scroll saw that primarily uses pinned blades and have difficulty getting it to work with pinless blades. Some of the designs are difficult or impossible to complete only with pinned blades. However, I think this problem would be the case regardless of the scroll saw book. My recommendation is that you buy a saw that easily uses pinless blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"Good book for the money.

The ability to link your GBA to your Gamecube is extremely helpful when you go unlock secrets, get helpful hints, and play an assortment of minigames. There are many features in a wide variety of games that are otherwise unavailable without this cable. A few notables are: Legend of Zelda (The Windwaker) has tips and clues available through the GBA. Final Fantasy (Crystal Chronicles) allows for multiplayer through the GBA (think personalized menus and item selection) which really makes that game more fun.

The casting is okay but the direction given to Anthony Michael Hall as Walter Paisley and Justine Bateman as love interest Carla leaves alot to be desired. What made Dick Miller's performance in the original work was the quirky charm and naivete he carried even as he descended into murder. Hall's Walter comes off as a dumb, malevolent jerk in grungewear. Turning the character of Carla into an aloof Italian Eurotrash fashion victim was also a bad move. None of the characters capture attention or sympathy except maybe in the pivotal part where a haughty loudmouth model pisses Walter off and sets the stage for his murderous art. At 85 minutes, it is almost twenty minutes longer than the original and it shows.

Be warned it is heavy so if you don't have surface that is large enough to support it, buy the stand that is made for it. As far as being able to do draperies, yes it's possible, but the surface is on the small side for an items like that. Like washing that elephant I mentioned.

I do notice that I don't have to worry as much about \\"catching back up\\" after adding more to the pot--they maintain heat better.I have scorched some things on the pans and you are not supposed to scour them, but so far everything comes off with a hot water soak and some patient scrubbing.As should already be clear, the cast iron is heavy. I don't mind but it is quite noticeable so it may be a downside for others who are considering.The only thing that has bothered me at all is that the stickers don't come off very cleanly.

Sometime, I would have something that I was regret to buy. This is the one.Nothing is wrong for this scale. It may work as design that the scale is so sensitive and when one steps on to it, it starts to change the digital display constantly as you dumped a big file on a computer screen.

An essential, core addition to personal and academic library Judaic Studies reference collections, 3 Jewish Philosophers is very strongly recommended reading, especially for serious students of the history of Jewish as influenced and reflected by three definitive and influential Jewish philosophers represented by some of their greatest surviving works."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Feeble as Miss Marple","review":"Late Christie and a dithery, fluttering Miss Marple who is only peripherally involved do not make a good combination. Although she does some surveying and map-reading to discover the house where the body of the woman seen strangled on board a train has been hidden, she does not apply reason to the problem of two murders caused by a tontine will and the identity of the woman (two fairly standard ploys), but experiences a revelatory flash-not, of course, shared with the reader, who has no chance of spotting the culprit."},{"rating":"2","title":"AwesoME...!!","review":"I am an Agatha Christie fan and i'm working on to read all 80something books written by her, and I'm almost halfway through it. Anyway, I thought this one was a very good one, compared to other a little weaker ones. First, it wasn't as boring in the beginning as some other works tend to do; actually, I thought it was pretty fast-paced, only things that are relevant and crucial were there, not those trivial stuff you sometimes find yourself reading in her other books.Well, the crime pattern is pretty much the same as other books like Appointmetn w/ Death, After the funeral (funerals are fatal), etc. but it was rather a joy reading through it because the answer was so unexpected..I would definitely recommend this along w/ books mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"MMmmmm, Not very good!!!!","review":"I'd heard plenty of the great Agatha Christie,mystery writer supreme, and decided, with anticipation, to try a taste of one of her more celebrated novels. But, alas, disappointment. I was amazed at her stringy sentences and lack of any form of decent prose. Her basic descriptions, substandard inter-person dialogue and her tinpot characters. The plot hinged too much on coincidence, Mrs McThingyMeJig just so happening to see the murder and, simultaneously, just so happening to know the illustrious Miss Marple. And the ending!! Please!! Ms Christie is obviously from a different age and, in my opinion, far too middle/upper class to attempt to attack any form of crime/murder fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"I have read all of Christie's books and I must say I enjoyed this one the most.

I have read Agatha Christie. Here are the ones I read and liked: Appointment with Death, Hercule Poirot's Christmas, Evil under the Sun. The problem with the 4:50 is there are too many characters! I can't keep them straight. There is no plot about the timing of the train which is what I thought it would be. The only reason I finished the book was to make sense of all the time I had wasted so far. No luck there either. Even the Queen of mystery can fail miserably at times.

Too much time moving through sewers and shoot-em-ups. No real character development, so I just didn't become engaged in the story. There are no really interesting motives to the crime -- just money. The characters are all two-dimensional. I didn't really care about any of them. Too much time with the good cop/bad cop thing also. The main character's internal musings aren't engaging either. The detail is not intriguing or enjoyable -- pages and pages about the underground sewer system and the layout of basements, etc. Although some plot implausibity is certainly OK with me -- this one was over the top. This guy was hospitalized for days (weeks?) with a life threatening wound and before you know it he's running around London, leaping hedges and submerging his wound in sewage.

He has given the amnesia story line a new and captivating twist which kept me turning the pages. Though the story is complex the author thinks enough of the reader to provide all the information needed to solve the mystery before he reveals it. The story is highly suspenseful, but the author keeps the reader interested enough in the process of reaching the solution that you are not tempted to skip to the end.For a British author Robotham has a light touch and a fast pace. He is very adept at giving us the feel of London without heavy handed descriptions. He also has a simple and sure touch when filling out the characters in his tale.If cop dramas are your thing, you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and dirty","review":"I never thought I'd enjoy reading so much about the sewer system in London. This book is picturesque in more ways than rats, both human and animal. It's a murder, kidnapping, and travel book describing the underbelly of a great city. The plot is filled with questions and challenges the reader to stay up with the twists. While not knowing if the lost girl survives, the brutality never ceases. A dark atmospheric read worth the time.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains much about the characters in Wreckage","review":"I started by reading Robotham's latest, Wreckage. His protagonist in his earlier books plays a role in Wreckage, but is not the focus. Lost explains a great deal about a flawed by likable and stubborn cop and his adviser and friend, a therapist with Parkinson's. This is tricky, adult fare which rewards the alert reader. You won't be able to see where the story is going. The only implausibility is his hero's high tolerance for pain and rapid recovery from serious injury. I am looking forward to reading his earlier books; perhaps the interested reader would be better off trying them in chronological order. The Wreckage is even better than Lost, but it helps to have the back story, even if Wreckage can stand alone as a superb thriller. This is an exciting series by a first rate writer, and a wonderful discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOST , the best one he's written.","review":"I've only recently become aware of Michael Rowbotham and so far have read three of his books.

While Joe O'Loughlin has a supporting role in 'Lost', I found his character far more likeable in this novel.The race against time as Vincent Ruiz recovers his memory and tries to make sense of a number of different events while solving what appears to be a closed investigation makes for an absorbing page turner.Mr Robotham writes well. His primary characters are well developed, if not always likeable, and the story moves at a rapid pace. I am looking forward to his third novel!Recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing throughout","review":"This well-written thriller keeps its action rolling and the pages turning from start to finish. It's especially fun for those of us who enjoy yarns set in London, as it travels from one end of that city to another -- and under it as well, where the author gives an evocative depiction of the sewer system.

Neri (new to me) is beautiful and charismatic and did ever notice how the always dependable Banderas can make the worst movie tolerable? Here again he does some excellent emoting. Just like one of the other reviewers, the first 25 minutes are quite entertaining, but then it really becomes a violent, disgusting bore. While I was happy that Neri as Anna blew her three rapists to smithereens, her shooting of the two policemen was totally beyond redemption. That's when the film went to hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting...but not for the reasons I expected","review":"I purchased this DVD because I liked Antonio Banderas in \\"The Mask of Zorro\\" and because I heard that his co-star, Francesca Neri, was the \\"Italian Michelle Pfiffer.\\" As far as I could tell, they both are obviously very talented actors. However, the film story was terrible. It is a very graphic rape story with a very unsatisfying ending. I was glad I purchased the DVD though because Francesca Neri is truly an incredibly gorgeous actress - and she has one of the most gigantic Adam's apples I've ever seen on a woman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrage with Banderas","review":"This movie is horrible and brutal with no interesting hooks and really bad dubbing. Antonio Banderas can not even save this movie with all his talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"The best description of this lackluster flick is \\"HO HuM\\" Banderas walks around like a lovesick puppy and goes off to Barcelona while his girlfriend gets raped by three thugs and then goes on a shooting spree all over Spain after having kill the three. Thin plot, bad acting and not great English dubbing. I should have been paid for watching it. At least I did get a good nights sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly one of the best books ever written.","review":"I've been a great admirer of David Leavitt's writing since I first encountered \\"A Place I've Never Been\\" in one of my literature classes in college over five years ago. Since then, I've devoured pretty much everything he's written because they are _that_ good. With \\"While England Sleeps,\\" in addition to his eloquent writing style (in English syntax, no less), he effectively incorporates historical notes, but only insofar as to paint the backdrop for the real subject of the story - the tumultuous love affair between two English boys - which he captures quite beautifully. I should warn, however, that I have had to limit myself to re-reading this book only once a year because it really is heart-wrenching; if you've ever been in love, or realized (and agonized about) it only after the fact, proceed with caution. You may find yourself inconsolable after the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books for years","review":"This book was my introduction to gay fiction...a sub genre I didn't even know existed until I stumbled upon this book in high school. I've reread it 3 times and am consistently drawn in each time. The story is compelling, the characters are believable (if frustrating at times) and the heartache feels genuine and devastating. Though the book does certainly have melancholic tendencies, I never put it down feeling overly negative...if anything, I feel invigorated and more passionate about living life to the fullest. A beautiful work of fiction, this novel also educates on period issues and politics, and certainly highlights the precarious nature of vintage gay romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"A glib and superficial presentation of English culture","review":"As an admirer of some of Leavitt's other books, I was disappointed in this novel's sloppy and inaccurate portrayal of English life in the 30s. Just having people say \\"frightfully\\" a lot, and call each other \\"darling,\\" doesn't convey the real flavor of either the country or the period; the portraits of both the upper-class and the working-class characters, and their milieus, seemed borrowed from other books (second-rate ones at that), and were little more than tired stereotypes. There were also too many American locutions in the mouths of English characters, which finally got me so annoyed that I stopped reading halfway through. Perhaps the book gets better later on, in which case I am doing it a disservice, but I felt I had given it enough of a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun cookie cutter!","review":"I have a miniature poodle and wanted to make cookies that look like him.

Soloist Yoohong Lee, a Korean, has a rich tone and plays with impressive command and intensity. Unlike the more famous Jacqueline Du Pre recordings, Lee plays without idiosyncracies or eccentricity. There is plenty of emotion in the work without the soloist having to bend its lines unmercifully. Menuhin's accompaniment is everything one could ask for, rich and dramatic. This is perhaps the most satisfying recording of the work since the monaural LP by Anthony Pini and Eduard van Beinum. In the Nursery Suite, Menuhin brings out all the whimsy and nostalgia. And his performance of the Chanson is elegance itself. The sound engineering throughout the disc is superb; on a good stereo system you really have a sense of being in the presence of the orchestra, with exquistite balances and lots of air around the sound. The timing of the disc is a little short, but for what you get it is well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woefully forgotten voice in many good performances","review":"Cisco Houston had an extraordinary voice.

But let me tell you, Ardustry usually does a good job releasing their movies on dvd, but this is not one of them. The movie itself is very silly even though there were about two good scares. The picture quality is like viewing a rented vhs tape. Also on the picture quality: the movie looks really dark and grainy most of the time making it hard to watch.So even though this dvd is going pretty cheap right now and you probably would not mind taking a chance wasting your money despite my review, believe me your money would be better spent on another title in the same price range.This movie does not earn a place in my coveted horror collection.

The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching. Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.

I had to keep refering to the manual.Sci Cals these days are easy to use. I was able to use this calculator's fractions feature without even opening the manual.I opened up the calculator and took out the single button cell (battery) and covered up the solar panel and the calculator was out cold. I put it back to bright light and it came back to life. It also kept my entries as if it didn't notice anything.Some calculators for whatever lazy reason don't put the solar cells to work.I also have a TI 30XS and I did the same and the solar cells did not power the calculator. Its a real solar panel. I just don't understand why they put it there and not put it to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the most intuitive","review":"It's really a pretty cool calculator, but I do have a couple of gripes. First, the \\"book\\" that comes with it is pretty crappy, although it does contain all of the information if you take the time to dig through it. I found that your better bet is to go online and find it. At least then I can zoom it so that I can actually read it.Second, the default setting displays all answers as improper fractions, so if you enter 5/4 you get a result of 5/4. Gee thanks, that's helpful. After several minutes of jacking with it and digging through the book, I finally found a section buried way down in the middle that shows how to switch the display to decimal (the S<>D button). I'm sure that this might have been obvious for seasoned scientific calculator users, but not for first time buyers.Now, once you get past some of the quirks, it is a pretty good calculator. I like the textbook display.

Very small print, too. A bound booklet would be much nicer for the amount of information that needs to be covered.2) It does too much for a school calculator.

I was very impressed with the capabilities of this inexpensive calculator - it did everything I would want for the exam, except perhaps being able to store pre-programmed equations, like the HP-33s. I had been using a TI 36X solar, and the added functions and display size of the Casio shaved quite a bit of time off my computations. I use it daily at work now. (Though I have already ordered the new HP 35s - I just couldn't resist! Any engineer who went through school using one knows that an HP RPN calculator is a \\"real\\" calculator!)Warning - this calculator is no longer allowed in the PE exams by NCEES. I have no idea why.

So I needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction, basic vector manipulation, and single variable integration for my engineering class. The matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests, particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my Statics, Dynamics, and Strength of Materials Class. The \\"2-Line Natural Textbook Display\\" prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have. The \\"scrolling\\" ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy, very nice.

The book does get somewhat better towards the end when the key character is in present day, and running for election against a backhanded competitor.

Fans of Junie B. Jones and the Magic Treehouse stories can handle it easily.Knowing Susan Cooper's ties to Revels, it's easy to understand why she chose to use the St. George play as the framework for her story, however, it would have been helpful if she had given an explanation to the many American children who have never heard of St. George or the mummer's play referred to in the book. It isn't vital to have experienced the play in order to enjoy the book, but a little background as a preface or an afterword would have been nice--many of the children I work with enjoy knowing where the stories originate.I enjoyed the illustrations as much as the story.

Ever.","review":"I didn't think this was possible, but the packaging for Season 11 both sucks and blows. Who designed this craptacular failure? Not only does the box not stack neatly on the shelf because of Krusty's big bas relief but the disks aren't even in protective plastic but jammed into narrow sleeves, like LPs only tighter. Earth to packaging genius, this is the 21st century and we have moved beyond sleeves! One word: plastics.The season itself isn't bad, with such gems as Pygmoelian, Bart to the Future and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad Marge. There are a few duds as well but on the whole I give the season a 3 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched","review":"This product was for my friend and I just recently watched the video with me friend and it was scratched.

What should I do because I threw away the package because it was a gift?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging is Incredible","review":"I bought this for my grandson. I had seen people on here slamming the packaging, but when he actually confronted it, it still surprised me. It seems to have been conceived ala PIL's \\"Metal Box\\"; deliberately designed to scratch discs or tear cardboard. I've never seen anything like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed in Season 11","review":"My husband and I are huge Simpsons fans. We eagerly awaited the DVD release of Season 11. What a disappointment! Each episode in this season is feeble in content and story line. The episodes fall extremely short of the usual ironic comedy, but true to life, situations that the Simpson family find themselves in. When Season 12 is released, we have decided to rent it, before buying, to assure ourselves that it is worth having in our Simpsons seasons line-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage after season 7! KOTH rocks!","review":"Why the one star then? The one star is completly FOX's fault. I can not believe they have not released season 7 8 9 10 11 or 12. Why? Are they protecting The Simpsons? No other anmie comedy show is close to The Simpsons other than King of the Hill. I have tried to watch the shows on FOX's streaming broadcost. It stinks! :(Every EXEC @ FOX should be fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP Simpsons","review":"As a life long simpson fan, I agree with those who contend that the show did go downhill around season 11 or so. The most current episodes are nothing short of crap and the movie was awful.It's sad that a show that once possessed humor that was so witty now contains jokes that my little 5yr old nephew could concoct.As dramatic as it may sound, it really is sad and upsetting to witness the gradual destruction of the once greatest and funniest show on tv. I hope that Groening and those poor excuses for writers will let the show die a much needed death soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four star content, one star packaging","review":"I am a huge Simpsons fan, having all the seasons on DVD. This is not the best season of the Simpsons (my opinion), but it's still very good. Anyone who is more then a casual fan will enjoy owning this item.Except for the packaging. I don't know if the \\"normal\\" packaging ( I have the Krusty the Clown head special packaging that's shaped like Krusty) is any better, but it was a very poor idea to put the DVD's in deep cardboard sleeves that guarantee you will scratch them or fingerprint them!As another reviewed mentioned, I have the original packaging to all previous seasons. From season 6 on, the packaging keeps getting more creative. And not in a good way! Please, I buy this series because I love the show, not the box you keep the DVD in. How about going back to normal packaging, like seasons 1-5?Good season, terrible packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible Packaging","review":"The packaging is horrible. The main problem is removing the discs from the pockets. My advice: buy the alternative box set. It will be less of a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Discs Are All Scratched!","review":"Fox made the worst box ever, the dvd's are hard to take out, and they scratch when they finally come out, the show is fine, but fox should give a replacement box soon, or else rent the season and burn it, it is better than spending in a cheap made 30 dollars product. I hate that my new 3 day old dvd is already scratched!!!. REPLACEMENT REPLACEMENT, REPLACEMENT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy packaging!","review":"The packaging of this box set is one of the worst I've purchased. It's difficult to remove the DVD from the sleeves. I almost had to rip one of the sleeves to get the DVD out. It's great that they're trying to cut down on packaging, but there must be a better solution than this terrible box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, the package is that bad","review":"No, this isn't the best Simpson's series, but it's worth it to be able to laugh at the Mel Gibson episode.But that packaging is some of the cheapest **** I have ever seen. You would think that someone with the Simpsons would have realized what a horrible idea it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good season but not the best packaging","review":"Like other people said this was not in good packaging. It still is a good season though. I guess this is my last favorite season. But I am really mad about the packaging they have for this season.For this season I like the cover much better than the head one. This will probably be out of print in a few months like the others that made two different covers. I do wish however that there were more episodes like 25. I also like that it has a lot of Easter eggs and deleted scenes.The show is still funny and I still do like the show. The Simpsons rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Krusty's Head is filled with wonder!","review":"Simpsons Season 11 is a gem! There are some great episodes in there. My only complaint is how difficult it is to remove the discs from the packaging and the overall flimsiness of the packaging. I foresee it all falling apart after a handful of viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krustisious!!!","review":"Well, it's the Simpsons. There was a time in which Homer became SUPER dumb, but apparently for this 11th season, he got back on the road. I gave it a 5/5. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why I stopped watching \\"The Simpsons\\"....","review":"...and only watch the first 8 seasons ( which rock by the way!). The humor takes a downhill turn in this season. Not as funny. Not as witty. Just boring, mundane and trying too hard to be funny. The \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" on this season even sucked which was very disappointing. Oh Well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Box?","review":"I have been a fan of The Simpson's since the Tracy Ulman Show. As with any show, they do have some bad episodes. Of course there are more good episodes than bad. If all you have to complain about is the packaging, then life is still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible DVD case solution/Season 11 Rocks!","review":"Would it be possible to glue a clear,slim jewel case onto the accordion pages to make it look like the season 1-10 boxes?I haven't bought season 11 yet, but I thought this might be a solution if you can still fold the accordion pages back together and fit them in the box.Aside from the packaging issues, Season 11 was the moment before The Simpsons \\"jumped the shark\\" for me. I taped every episode of seasons 1-11 on VHS religiously, but I stopped watching the show after that. Once N'SYNC guest starred in season 12 the magic was gone.I'm looking forward to getting this set now that I know both versions are the same inside and that I may have found a way to protect the DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can someone tell me...","review":"...when this effing season is going to come out on DVD??

Anyone have an idea??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware, must hate Bush to enjoy!","review":"OK, here is the real deal. I lived and breathd Simpson's for 8 years. I had all the DVD's sold from Amazon, bought all the toy's, etc. Matt G. and The SImpson's is now garbage. The shows are not funny and all they care about is pushing their socialist agenda. Do yourself a favor and buy from Amazon the first 7 or 8 season's and enjoy, but the rest of the season's should be ignored. Let Matt G. sit in his fancy home railing on about why war is no good and why we need a socialist agenda but meanwhile, I will be loving every FREEDOM filled day thinking about how good the SImpson's used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Amazon for hiding the regular version","review":"This review has nothing to do with Season 11 and EVERYTHING to do with the goddamn head boxes. If Fox isn't going to discontinue them already, I hope that in the future Amazon will at least not shove them down our throats by making it nearly impossible to find the non-head box on the site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks For The Honest Reviews. I Won't Be Buying This Box!","review":"You have to really appreciate Amazon reviews - the bitter and the better. I love The Simpson's and have bought every boxed set. However, thanks to these reliably frank reviews, I'll save my money or wait until the the cheapskates at Fox wake up and change the box. - \\"It's funny 'cause it's true\\" - Homer Simpson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging stoops to new lows - not buying the next sets","review":"This DVD set was obviously designed by someone who doesn't use it. The poster below summed it up. We've been supporting Fox for 20 years and we get this. No more.Paper is a stupid medium for DVDs. They aren't cheaper. They aren't eco-friendly - laminated cardboard. And they scratch the discs!!Use recycled plastic Amaray cases. Durable, replaceable, common sense. No more digipaks either. The spindles break on those too.Amazon needs to state what type of packaging is provided (Amaray plastic case, digipak, cardboard).They better not screw up Blu-Ray. Their snap case works. Vote with your wallet stop buying poor products."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Four Star Season, with One Star Packaging...","review":"The content of The Simpson's Eleventh year on the air is open to debate. Was this past the show's heyday? Probably. Did this season still manage a ton of brilliant moments? For sure. It's the Simpsons, you know the show and you know you want this set. It's totally worth the price of admission. The only negative is that the makers of these DVD sets can't seem to get the gosh darn diddly correct or uniform. In this release, They've gone to stiff cardboard sleeves to slide your discs into. Lame, crappy, cheap, and scratchy. I assume this is to make the packaging more \\"green.\\", although I suspect that it is also cheaper to manufacture thus making the studio more \\"green\\" as well. What's wrong with the packaging everyone else is using? Four stars for content, but one star for the lame packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, crappy box","review":"I'll say it right out, THIS PACKAGING IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! I bought the actual \\"box\\" box, so I don't know about the krusty head box, but this packaging is terrible! It's like a cardboard foldout thingy and the discs are in these little sleeves. Immediatly after I took out disc one for watching, the sleeve ripped. I think I'll end up buying a zip up CD holder for these and taping the picture on the front or something.But the shows are FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for neophyte UNIX programmers.","review":"Steve Moritsugu and DTR Business Systems' Practical UNIX is recommended for UNIX programmers who seek a reference book of solutions for common UNIX problems.

My kids are now 5 & 3 and there is another on the way. I have read this book cover to cover & keep it handy for quick references when I feel I need a \\"refresher\\".What I like about this book is it is easy to read, easy to follow, easy to understand. My copy is dog earred, highlighted and has pencil marks in the margins.The advice is easy to follow and does not need lots of 'analysis' to get started. It covers basic topics, but once you 'get the gest of what to do' it's easy to apply the theories to just about every situation you may encounter as a parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book, for your family and yourself!","review":"This book is outstanding. I found the sections on Roles especially important for parents to read and understand. As a classroom teacher and parent of young children I cannot think of a book more worthy of a parents precious time. Even better than the \\"How to Talk books\\". Read that too, but read \\"Siblings\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick, useful read","review":"This book provides practical help with sibling rivalry that can be put to immediate use in the home.

Spans many stages and age levels (even into adulthood)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Practical!","review":"This book is so incredibly practical and sensible. It also is an easy read. Of course it is easier to read than apply but parenting is difficult no matter what, but this book gives moments of \\"oh wow, so that's what's going on, now I know what to work on. . .or that's what needs to change.\\" I would recommend this to anyone as it helps build the relationship between the parent and child(ren) and between the siblings - probably changing dynamics that could have negatively affected their relationships for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"not earthshaking but solid suggestions","review":"Nothing earth shaking but some excellent suggestions and \\"mindsets\\" for creating a more peaceful and respectful atmosphere at home.

No, they feel you'll learn best by reading a friggin' comic strip of parents and kids talking.

I think it will be one of their best used gifts in the years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice approach to a common issue facing parents","review":"This book is nicely laid out and has some basic common sense ideas that we as parent wouldn't otherwise think of.

It is designed to lead you through a course in which you come to understand what's beneath sibling rivalry and learn techniques and attitudes that can help defuse it or prevent it from starting in the first place. It's solid information clearly presented and well worth reading by any parent who is concerned with the issue. I disagree with the critical reviewer who claimed the info was outdated--I find it very relevant and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"kind and compassionate advice","review":"This book was recommended by Alfie Kohn (the highly recommended author of Unconditional Parenting) and I have found it to be well-written and kind. The authors emphasize listening to your children, freeing yourself from taking sides and putting an end to creating sibling competition through comparisons, for example. They guide you through these ideas and others in a very readable and clear, concise way. I like the cartoons too, as a quick visual reminder. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book EVER!!!","review":"This book is priceless.

I stumbled across this book accidentally and it has made alll the difference in my life and my kids life. It won't solve all the problems your kids have with each other but it takes you out of the loop so it doesn't bother you so much and they learn to deal with each other in a healthy way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look here for some answers","review":"This book is well written and presented in a manner that provides simple, common sense approaches to the anarchy in your home. Many of the scenarios described in the \\"sessions\\" could be happening in your very own homes, and instead of pulling your hair out in frustration you could be making an effort to learn alternate means of conflict resolution. I read this book and saw myself or my mother (mostly my mother, of course! :)) in most of the situations where an action or phrase would only serve to exacerbate conflict.

Accordingly, it was only natural that Dawnflight would catch my attention. In my opinion, all of the rave reviews are about nothing. Headlee has the fundamentals of Celtic tribal society (still alive and kicking in the time this novel is set) entirely wrong. Yes, I realize this is fiction, but this author is praised for her research skills. Well, then, how the heck does Gyan become chieftainess of a Pictish tribe? She would never have. Let's also look at the tribe of the Brythoni (or whatever they were called). What! A unified tribe! And there was already a name for the peoples united under the fictitious Arthur--the Britons. I think a little more reasearch into Celtic myth and lore would have made this a better book.

I enjoy the emphasis in scripture but at times the book stretches verses using loose translations to fit the mold (but what christian book doesn't ) but overall the idea behind it is sound. It's building blocks of how to develop quick connections with people in short periods of time, how to connect at an advanced pace and open people up that normally aren't open to discussion. It tells you which weapons to pull out and which ones to leave holstered, and that is a good thing too.If you want to take a smarter approach at one to one outreach, I would say use this book has a lot of key concepts. Example: Instead of damnation or \\"where are you going when you die?\\" the question the book asks us to deliver is a little more tangible to a non-believer, \\"Are you struggling to be a better person\\\\ do you want to be a better person?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Words","review":"According to the author, he got the idea to write this book by reading a marketing strategy guide called \\"Permission Marketing\\". If you read \\"Permission Evangelism\\", you will soon find that this book is simply a repackaging of the same basic message with Christian lingo and cliches added.The most valuable thing about this book is that it secondarily serves as a great guide to marketing. This certainly can help evangelical Christians to know how to more sensitively and lovingly portray the Gospel to a post-modern western audience.In the end however, it just made me want to read \\"Permission Marketing\\", the book he copied and put a Christian message into.

Thank goodness it wasn't the only gift I bought, because these were a complete waste of money. They ripped while he was putting them on for the very first time, and it was due to poor quality, not because they were too small. AFTER tearing them, he saw on the packaging where it said not to use the loop on the back of the shoe to help put them on. Boy, they were right, because it tore right off on the very first tug. I ask, why put the loop there if not to help slip on the slipper? Extremely poor quality and poor design. Anyway, since there was a warning on the packaging, we decided not to try to return them. The rip was mostly just a cosmetic flaw, so my hubby was too sweet to make a big fuss over it. They fit fine, but they only lasted 4 months before they fell apart. We put them in the garbage just a few days ago. Don't waste your money on these.

Frost has a way with writing that makes you feel like you are member of the gallery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Entertaining","review":"Mark Frost again shows he has his finger on the pulse of American sports history with his marvelous biography of Bobby Jones. This is the first Jones bio I have encountered that looks beyond the championships and The Slam to look at what Bobby went through to acheive such feats. It was especially interesting to see that the Grand Slam was not a series of dominating peformances, and that on at least one occasion (to paraphrase the Duke of Wellington) it was a damn close run thing.While it is roundly recognized that Jones heyday was occured in the Golden Age of American sports, it does seem on occasion that Mr. Frost is overreaching when he starts to go off the track of Bobby Jones' career and heads off to look at the country (as noted in other reviews). I would think that the fact that he received TWO (!) ticker tape parades in NYC is testimony enough to his impact and personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story of the life of Bobby Jones","review":"Any golfer has heard about Bobby Jones, this book brings his life into focus for all of us. Bobby Jones played this game as an amateur and never was a professional golfer. He won many tournaments both here and in England as was able to afford this by the help of his father.He was married and they lived with his parents as the many travels Bobby had to make playing golf, it made it handy for his family to be cared for. I was surprised that Bobby Jones had quite a temper and his language was not the best either. He tried to control this but he was such a prefectionist that whenever he made an error he let out his frustration this way.This book covers all his winnings from a very young age until he won the Grand Slam with were all the big tournament in one year. A terrific feat that has not been done to this day. Until Tiger Woods did it but his was done covering from one year to the next.If you love history and love golf, this book is worth the read.Letta Meinen"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing effort","review":"I had very high hopes for this book, but was disappointed by a rather flat, mundane effort. There is nothing new here, and even Frost's idol-worship of Bobby Jones fails to make up for the gap in reporting. Having read many books on Jones (including several of his own), I was hopeful that perhaps Frost would turn up something new, an anecdote, or even some insight. I was disappointed.Even the writing, which Frost demonstrated with such flair in The Greatest Game Ever Played, seems to sag at key moments in the second half of the book.Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The playing is fine, but the recorded sound is dreadful.","review":"This is a very good collection of Debussy piano works, and I recently purchased it from Amazon because of this.

This vacuum states that it is best for a house with mostly hard surfaces and some rugs or carpet. But it doesn't do rugs at all! No matter how short the pile, even a no-pile braided cotton rug, the beater stops working as soon as you touch down. A smaller rug, like an area rug, just gets sucked up so hard it lifts it off the ground. If you have 100% hard surfaces or very short pile wall-to-wall carpet, it's fine. If you have any scatter or area rugs, it's a disaster. I disliked it so much, I returned it and am out $60 because of it.

However, that is pretty much where my praise ends. While no book can be comprehensive, this one doesn't even try. There are HUGE gaps in the handguns covered. Some non-military curios are listed, while fairly common handguns are missed entirely.

The tracks are paced very nicely and of course it wouldn't be a Sykes recording session without an instrumental (R.S.Stomp) to really liven things up. There is probably no other blues singer-piano player who seemed to put out so much electricity in everything he recorded,and this is no exception.

I am sure that those glowing literary reviews have been rescinded , now that the truth has come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Validity","review":"I think we should remain non judgemental when we read narratives such as this one. The degree of psychological instability that exists in authors such as these is usually left out of our criticism, but we need to remember what exactly these people went through. Read this book, its good, and keep your judgement to yourself, because for all we know this book is true and it can only be disproven by the author coming out and saying that it is false."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liar, liar, pants on fire","review":"The evidence is compelling that Binjamin Wilkomirski is giving false witness to one of the most horrible events in the history of humanity and that makes Wilkomirski despicable. I would have given it zero stars, but it is quite readable and convincing sounding. Therein lies the true troubling aspect of this story. People are going to believe it's true, then find out they've been suckered and begin to wonder if other stories are true. I've studied the European Holocaust for over 40 years (I've been studying the Asian Holocaust for about 10 years). This is revisionist history at it's worst because it is the most terrible form of deception--deception by someone claiming to be a victim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Needs this little book","review":"Everyone needs sanity.

Amazon told us we have to contact the company, they can't help. I don't like throwing $60 away!Tried the company several times and was not able to get through. Figured it was because of the holdays. Called again today and they have a recorded message: \\"If you are receiving this message, we are in a meeting, call back later\\". Customer Service at its best! But called again only to be told there is nothing they can do for me. Past 90 days - sorry! Went up the chain to supervisor and got nowhere.If you expect your product to worke a few times only, send your payment.

Called the company they said the would send it and I would get it in a week . Still haven't seen it and its been months.Not that it matters to me now since I brought it back but I have to questions their customer service and help you would get from them since they didn't send me the little rubber foot even.I'd recommend looking else where if you are looking for fresh hot popcorn from your popper.Was very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"It makes the BEST kettle popcorn.

The sides are plexi-glass, not real glass.The company claims it pops a cup of popcorn, but the measuring cup is only 1/4 cup. I had to make several batches to feed a family of 4. When I tried to return it ot Dyandirect, it took them almost a month to respond, telling me I would have to pay for shipping and 15% restocking fee. Luckily I found a local store that took it back without a receipt.This is not worth the money and the company has a poor response time and return policy.Since then I purchased the WEST BEND STIR CRAZY POPPER, which is excellent. Nearly all the kernels popped and the volume is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks better than it performs","review":"I was very excited to buy a small hot oil kettle style popcorn popper for my rec room. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The popped kernals push out the unpopped kernals from the kettle, wasting lots of unpopped corn. The remaining corn produces a very small batch. In fact I had to pop three batches to get a large bowl to serve. Clean up was quite a chore. The entire inside of the machine gets splattered with oil. Popping corn in this machine is too much work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEEPLY UNSATISFIED!!!","review":"Item came 14 days late, damaged (not from shipping), and still no word of them shipping another one to me.

I followed the exact instructions including the proper cleaning technique. It lasted about five uses and then the electric motor died.

A waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgia KPM-508 Old-Fashioned Kettle Popcorn Maker","review":"I returned it. The popcorn basin gears did not connect properly with the motor gears.

And my pet monkey too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small, too messy, too many kernels unpopped","review":"Too small, there's hardly any room for your hands to work around it when making popcorn. It makes a big mess and is difficult to clean. It leaves lots of kernels unpopped because they fly all over along with squirts of oil making a big mess. NOT worth the price for such small item. Not worth the mess for the amount of popcorn it makes.Great popcorn though."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ALL THERE, VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"The popcorn maker looks great, and was very excited to get it up and running... only to realize that the crank (shown in the picture as the lever with the red ball at the end of it) was not in the package and no where to be found.

I used the enclosed measuring scoop and got 4 cups of popped corn and several dozen unpopped seeds on the bottom of the holding area. I'd have to cook 3-4 batches to get enough and it's just not worth the time. The last kernels need to be dumped to prevent burning, so it needs to be watched while it works. It's a cute machine, not loud, but it's cheaply built with mostly plastic. It also has a terrible door latch, too hard to get open and too hard to snap shut. I'm returning this and continuing my search for a fun, cute, retro style popper. For those that couldn't get the crank handle on, it's a reverse screw. The crank handle is just for dumping the rest of the popcorn kernels at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Once","review":"Sorry, but this machine had to be returned. We found it to be the cutest thing, however it worked once and then refused to heat up. Needless to say my kids were disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We got this for our carnival-themed wedding. It was great for that, but it's not practical. It takes much too long to get a decent amount of popcorn and it's really hard to clean. Even if you pop the popcorn in the microwave and put in there, it's hard to get the popcorn out. It's good for photographs, but not in real use...We're just going to throw it away. Stick with microwave popcorn or get a modern-day popper."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Use","review":"When my popper arrived yesterday, I unpacked it and popped a batch.

Never again with this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"First off, it looks pretty neat ... but it only gets worse from there. I have noticed a few other people complaining that the crank on the side doesn't screw in correctly and neither does mine.

It's a great introduction to the Lindbergh phenomeon and even buffs who own many a Lindbergh book will find much to appreciate here with the rare photographs. If you want gossip, criticism, or speculation, it's not here. What you get is a straightforward look at the man and particularly his public life and career and with so many of the recent Lindbergh books loaded with conjecture and agendas, that is a most welcome stance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Entertaining","review":"This is the type of book that most people will politely riffle through the pages for its very rich and fascinating historical photographs. Nevertheless time well spent with this book would also be fitting as it is informative and comprehensively covers the life and times of a well known ( and in some aspects not so well known) early aviator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is too difficult to read.","review":"The first chapters jump into flash-forwards of features to be explained later. This may make for a good sci-fi novel, but makes a very confusing technical manual.

It is probally not the best book if you do not have some programming experience. It is also a good read because of Barnes British humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ada 95 2nd Edition (Barnes)","review":"I'll makes this short and sweet. Don't buy this book. It's awful. I wrote Ada back in the late 80's, then transitioned to C and C++ and have been writing C++ and buying related texts since. I recently was assigned a project porting some navigation and guidance control (Ada) software and needed a refresher text. I bought this book. Big mistake. This book is terrible. To any Ada text book writer out there - go get any C or C++ book (say C++ Primer - Lippman)and change all the examples to Ada and likewise the explanations. You'll sell a boatload.) The C and C++ good textbooks are many - not so with Ada. They all pretty much reek. I wound up just printing out the Ada ARM. I use this book as a monitor prop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuitable for an introduction to Ada 95.","review":"This book was used for an introductory course on Ada 95. Big Mistake! It may be more useful for intermediate students studying the language. The author's use of code fragments does not convey how to code complete programs. I got a better understanding about Ada by examining the completed programs provided on the enclosed CD-ROM, which, by the way, came mostly from the Feldman book. Barnes only provides six complete programs of his own. It is like, \\"Here are code fragments with obtuse explanations for why they are right or wrong and here are six lengthy complete programs to show how creative I can be\\".To make the language more relevant, provide real-world examples. Explaining the machinations of the Ada compiler would be also helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Ada95","review":"This is an excellent book. It looks like most of the people who didn't like this book are more biased against the Ada language. I come from a C++ and Java background and this book made me change to Ada95. Also, Ada is NOT a dead language. It is being extensively used in my company and the companies we are in contract with. Also, I have worked on projects in Ada in a couple of different countries..so it is being used worldwide. It is a dead language to people with a bad knowledge of the facts and who have a tendency to blame their tools more often than not. This book is a must have for all Ada95(The only standardized Object Oriented Language) programmers. It is great book for a great language...no questions asked. Also, people destined to get DeadEnd jobs will get them whether they know Ada or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exact fit!","review":"These were heavey and when I used my caliper it as exact.

Fox has combined precision in translation with interpretation and poetry, and the combination makes me run to it very often to see his version, which often makes a challenging and provocative comparison to more traditional translations. The type is large and well-spaced. My only criticism is that the Hebrew is not included; at times I'd like to be able to compare the original words to Fox's renderings, to see how they compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent translation","review":"Never before have I experienced a translation of Old Testament scripture that truly brought me into what the essence of the text was. Fox makes it perfectly clear that these books were written in Hebrew, not English. I would reccommend this translation to anyone who is curious what it is like to peek in on an ancient text and learn from the first five books of Moses in the way it was more likely intended to be learned from."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's a review if it doesn't review the book?","review":"I happen to be a fan of Everett Fox's amazing translation of the Bible. Like all books there are positive things about it and some things I might have done differently. But the review by Ira Moon is what caused me to write. His so called \\"review\\"is a critique of the Bible itself--a critique that he is welcome to have of course; however, he would have that same critique of any edition of any Bible in any translation or the original. This review in no way reflects on Everett Fox's work either positively or negatively.I would hate to see someone not read this wonderful rendition of the Bible because Ira Moon dumped on it his opinions about the Bible in particular and religion in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and elegant","review":"As a gentile who does not read Hebrew, I must rely upon the quality of the translation for my studies of the Pentateuch.

Some of the author's comments made me uncomfortable with his theology. The translation didn't line up with ancient Hebrew, so this would not be a work I would feel secure in quoting. Although it will take more effort, I would rather have the ancient Hebrew text and work through the translation. Ancient-Hebrew.org is working on a translation, and I am excitedly awaiting that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review","review":"This is a disappointment. I did not realize that it is very thick, due to being filled with commentary, much of which consists of scepticism and trashing the Scriptures. It is not something you can read on the train. Just 5 books of the Bible, but heavier than any Bible I own. I did spent the year reading the Torah portions. The translations is faultless, but the introductions, commentary, etc ruin it in my opinion. I would love a paperback with all the nonsense left out.

If you live in an area where you water if highly contaminated then this filter would not be good enough for you.I used to have a waterpick, but it was ridiculously hard to change the filter for me.

I found the vocals to be annoying at times but please take note that I'm not a fan of vocals in general and am perfectly happy skipping those songs without regretting the purchase of the CD. I liked all the instrumentals very much even though they seemed repetitive at times. The santour solo is especially good and I was disappointed to find that there was only one. That solo was the specific reason I bought the CD. The nei solo is haunting and the three tar solos are all very satisfying. For the most part, this music is subtle and serene but I've found that I can't listen to it without inadvertently thinking about it.

We welcomed the arrival of our newborn son and used a MEMOREX dvd-r (which is supposed to be compatible) to record many special moments of his first three days at home. Included were his first home bath, first pediatricians appointment, clips from the first long nights, and other video from a proud papa. We planned on sending a copy of the DVD to his 80 yr. old great-grandma on the west coast. Recording went fine, but once finalized, the handycam cannot read the disk, as it shows a disk error.

But don't buy it in paperback. The publisher skimped and cut corners, and it shows. The font is small and hard to read, with far too many places where broken type makes reading a tiring process. Important people with similar names are not clearly identified in the text, and there's no \\"cast of characters\\" to help the confused reader. Turn to the index and you'll find it of little use, as there is no distinction between an important relationship and a glancing reference. The footnotes are printed in incredibly small print and are hard to follow. The paperback also appears to lack many of the photos that were included in the hardback version.

I don't know who Rene Delange, Jacques Chardonne or Emile Raccaud were, so when they, along with hundreds of other people I had never heard of, were frequently introduced into the book with the expectation that I, the reader, knew who they were and why they were important to the story, I simply yawned and lost interest. I think Saint-Ecupery was probably a fascinating man, but if you want to know him, I would suggest that you read one of the books he wrote himslf, and catch a short bio of him from Wikepedia instead of plowing through this exhaustive biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I thought this book would be fascinating, but I allowed myself to give up after 100 pages or so.

I'm 5'9\\" and I had to put the seat down to one of the lowest notches in order to use it comfortably. The only thing that I didn't like about the bike was that the seat was uncomfortable for the first couple uses. Thankfully, it only took a couple hours of riding to break in the seat.Overall, it is a very smooth and quiet ride. It's also very sturdy. That, along with the preset programs and various resistances, gives you a great workout. Of course, there are better bikes out there, but this bike does a great job and can't be beat for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"I've only had this for a couple of days, but I'm pretty happy with it.

You can easily set the display to show only one stat: just read the manual.Update: I've had the bike for a couple of months now. I use it 4-5 days a week for about 30 mintues a day.

If you are short on time, SKIP Part 1 and go straight to Part 2, beginning with chapter 5. I found Chapter 3 on spanking interesting, but do not agree with all of his conclusions and interpretations. I almost quit reading the book after chapter three, but am glad I stuck with it, because chapters 5 through 16 are great. I also believe this book is meant more for the over 4 ages. If you need a practical book for toddlers and very young pre-schoolers, go for \\"Growing Kids God's Way\\" series. Clarkson's advice applies more to an age when you can begin to explain and reason with their mind and heart. A two year old needs his actions addressesed differently.

He then guide the golfers on how to control distance from 100 yards with all wedges, to picth and chip the ball from around the green,and to play bunker shot. He does not only shows how to play all these shots but also include how the ball will react on the greens in details. This part make this book different from other short game books. Pelz finished this book by showing how to choose wedges and how to practice effectively.However, this book is very large so it take much time to finish.

My short game isn't where I'd like it yet, but I am starting to have positive swing thoughts again, and I'm seeing improved results.

I truly enjoyed Ben Hogan's Fundamentals of Modern Golf with its detailed descriptions of a correct swing. Mr. Pelz spends pages on why the finesse swing is important, but he leaves many gaps in his instructions. For example, Ben Hogan spent a chapter explaining the proper grip, Mr. Pelz spends more time explaining the relative importance of a proper grip, but only gives ambiguous details about the grip needing to be \\"square\\" and \\"queiter...the better.\\"I've only finished the first 5 chapters and hope the book improves the instructions.

Most of the illustrations, except 16 pages in the centre, are in B&W;, and are not of the quality we are used to in the big name golf magazines. On the other hand, the diagrams and sketches are first rate.All in all, I have found the Short Game Bible easy to read and very informative.

Dave Pelz is a true scientist and breaks down golf from an entirely different angle. His practice sessions are a little unreasonable for most people, though.

I am done with these phones, I am sending the replacements back and taking the originals back to Staples for my money back. I also aquired another cordless phone from American Telecom which has extreamly poor audio quality.

These materials include paints, wallpapers, tiles, flooring, and--in the case of curtains, bedding, and other sewn accessories--fabrics. For a small-format book there is a lot of information here, much of it conveyed through color photos, drawings, and charts, all of which are tightly but creatively juxtaposed. This layout works especially well for selecting and using materials to achieve different decorative as well as functional results. Its brief hands-on descriptions of tools (ranging in this case from power saws to sewing machines) and application procedures will need supplementing by more detailed how-to manuals, in some cases.

They are well-researched and provide an overview of the Crusades, along with all the peripheral things going on in the world of the Middle Ages. The text gives a good objective summary of events, which is difficult to find elsewhere in sources on the Crusades. Riley-Smith has chosen his topics well, including aspects of specific cultures of the time. He achieves a vivid picture of the political, economic, and social life of the time in all of the world's hot spots. This perhaps does not give the most comprehensive picture possible, since it does not take into account conflicting primary sources on the Crusades, but Riley-Smith achieves his goal. Readers looking for more information can easily find other sources; the Atlas of the Crusades is an excellent supplement to these and does a good job pulling them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful of this one!

The children discover this the hard way, and learn how to make the most of their find through trial and error.

This is only in the first 30 pages of the book so as not to spoil the fun to come.Of course, if you feel the need to amuse yourself with a historian's weak attempt at reconstructing chemistry (with an obvious ignorance of basic biology) please purchase this book -and a highlighter to colour in all the scientific inaccuracies you will find in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outlandish facts + twisted humor = splendid entertainment","review":"Do baby-renters (people who make a living out of lending out babies to beggars), skeleton-dealers (people who export unclaimed dead bodies to the west for studies in anatomy), ghamelawallas (people who collect gold from city dust), multi-generation executioners (people who inherited their job as an executioner from their parents), acid-drinkers, etc, etc sound intriguing to you? Do you enjoy self-deprecating, and at times self-abusive humor? If (and only if) so this is the book for you. Shah does a splendid job in exploring and writing about his arcane experiences all across India. This was the most entertaining book I read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read all year","review":"I read an average of a book a day and can't remember the last book I thought was \\"5 star\\". Sorcerer's Apprentice is worthy of this designation. Interesting, entertaining, read-aloud, tell-your-friends type worthy. Buy, Read, Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now that's not magic","review":"The jacket blurb describes Tahir Shah as an \\"uproariously funny writer\\". Well, I cracked a smile once or twice, but funny this is not. The dialogue is weak, the clumsy attempts at wit are forced and toe-curling, and Shah comes across as a tetchy,irritable and intolerant foreigner.The book tries to pass itself off as a travelogue but the hokey, conveniently slapstick encounters appear contrived. There is a suspicious lack of photographs of any of the main characters or more sensational events in the book and I ended up believing very little of the narrative. Which is a shame, because buried very deep under the poor writing (see how many verbs Shah can use to avoid the perfectly adequate \\"said\\")is an interesting look at the resourcefulness of India's poor. A decent rainy day read but a missed opportunity by the writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be labeled as fiction","review":"On pages 15 and 16 there is the story of a woman from Chicago who went to a cosmetic surgeon in Karachi and asked for liposuction. When she came out of the anesthetic she found that her lips had been removed. Gimme a break! This is prime urban myth material. After this section how can I believe anything in this book? Although, taken as fiction, it was somewhat amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"How'd they do that?\\"","review":"I happened to glance at the title for Mr. Shah's book as I passed the travel section at the local bookstore, out of curiosity I picked it up. I thought it was in the wrong section. After reading the dust jacket I thought it might be like \\"The Magicians Wife by Brian Moore or The Illusionist by Dinitia Smith.\\" I did like the personal story and the insites into the society and culture of India. But all I really got was as one reviewer said was a \\"guy that runs up and jumps on the stage in front of everyone screaming and shouting I know how its done!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"And I don't mean that in a good way. The acting in this movie is awful. Even the sex. About the only thing actress Wendy Schumacher has going for her is her gravity-defying chest. And the whole plot with the blind music producer and the exhibitionist? Give me a break. This movie is bad, even for a skin flick. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good softcore, but Shannon really should have been casted","review":"This is the last (so far) installment in the \\"Animal Instincts\\" series (again, interested persons are recommended to get the uncut/unrated version). It's also one of the last softcores directed by Gregory Hippolyte (a/k/a pornmeister Greg Dark of the Dark Brothers), and in fact is one of his best. Wendy Schumacher is no Shannon Whirry, who _owns_ the role of Joanna, but she does her best and turns in some quite hot scenes (especially her first sex scene with the male lead; she's aroused beforehand by watching a threesome which is another of the erotic high points).Good softcore can often be more erotically exciting than hardcore, and this movie is a case in point."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop thinking about it!","review":"This movie is hot right from the get-go. Wendy Schumacher has a rockin' body and Gregory Hippolyte is totally cool. Wendy plays an exhibitionist who can't stop showing off her talents. The first scene includes her getting it on on top of a pool table in a bar with about 20 guys watching her. Gregory sees her when she does this and invites her to his house. The cool thing about Gregory is that in the movie, he fakes like he's blind so Wendy takes it upon herself to make it with a lot of guys right in front of him. There are five or six seperate scenes in this movie (the opening credit sequence has Wendy dancing nude) and they're well directed (not many cuts) and a perfect length. This is one of my favorite soft core porns. I wish there was a VHS version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome film!","review":"Animal Instincts 3: The Seductress is an incredible film!

It is in fact an all together different artist that goes by the name of Fiona. This album \\"Forever\\" is a soul recording. I am a fairly big fan of 80's metal/pop Fiona and picked this one up thinking it may be her brand new recording, which by the way STILL isn't out!!!

It stores nicely in the PCMCIA slot of my laptop and stays charged up and ready to use whenever I'm on the go. The only thing I wish it had is a scroll wheel. Although nothing in the description mentioned a wheel, I was hoping the 1/4 inch strip between the buttons would scroll when I slid my finger up and down. Too bad -- I'm addicted to the wheel on my desktop mouse. That would be a cool feature. But overall, I am extremely pleased. No dongle to break. No batteries to replace. No clunky wires to drag out. And my coworkers keep saying, \\"What is that? That is so cool!\\"I did have a bit of trouble installing it, but that was more the fault of my HP Laptop (NC6230). It had an HP proprietary Bluetooth interface that wouldn't install the mouse. Once I got the standard Bluetooth interface installed (with help from the HP Website) installing the mouse was a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Bluetooth Mouse!!","review":"If you are looking for a slim Bluetooth mouse with a maximum portability and affordable price, this wonderful Pc Card Mouse will be your best choice.

Of course you have to watch the surface you're on, I find myself putting it onto a magazine or notepaper or something instead of the glass top of a hotel room desk.I do miss the scroll wheel, I admit.Also, my tablet wants to install it as a pcmcia device all the time, I have to click cancel once for every startup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than the original MoGo mouse","review":"This mouse is the exact same thing as the MoGo mouse that sells for $70. It quickly paired up with my laptop and works great. It doesn't have a middle scroll pad, but I knew that before I bought it. Add a middle scroll pad and this thing gets 5 stars! MoGo says the new PC Express Card model will have a middle scroll pad and will be released this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever, portable design","review":"I have been intrigued by this mouse since I saw the design showcased by Newton Peripherals at the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show (this is basically an HP-branded Newton Peripherals MogoMouse). It seemed such an elegant design.After about a month of use, I have decided I really like it. It's easy to install, easy to use, responsive, and has good battery life. There are only a few drawbacks:(1) the optics don't work well on a shiny or semi-glossy surface. The mouse arrow skips around a lot and is hard to control. A flat finish works best.(2) a scroll wheel is sorely missed. Actually, I understand that this company has a upcoming design that features a scroll pad.(3) If your laptop doesn't have a built-in bluetooth adapator, you have to carry around a separate bluetooth adaptor, which almost defeats the purpose of this self-contained mouse solution.Aside from these reservations, this mouse is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card Mouse","review":"Works great!

Otherwise, there are numerous books on the market that are cheaper and much more informative and intellectual."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview","review":"A solid general survey of the US health care system.

I was able to put into practice the principles of 5 element astrology without refering to other books, and without banging my head against the wall of confusing presentations of similar material. It is simply the best source for the practical application of this ancient, and until now hidden Chinese tradition. If you want to learn and put into practice traditional Chinese 5 element astrology, then this book is a must. It creates a whole new benchmark for books on the subject. I recommend it without reservation. If you are a serious student or just curious you cannot go wrong here. I look forward to other books from this same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get a handle on it","review":"I had a lot of trouble understanding this book.

Just look at the album cover - his raps have no substance whatsoever. The worst part is, after his horrible sugar-coated hip-pop beats, Chingy can't even rap either. It would be in a lot of rap fan's best interests for this album to flop, and Chingy to go away already.

Cliche lyrics that could be written by a forth grader, horrid beats and sampling, and a voice that would make the deaf run for cover, this album gets my vote for worse album of all time. Yes, worse then albums made by Don Johnson and Bruce Willis. Worse then anything from Blink 182 or Fall out Boy, even worse then 50cents latest nightmare. I would even say that Milli Villi would be considered a classic to the mess. If you want bad hip-hop, this is the CD you have been looking for. Shame on you Capital records for wasting studio time and money, along with other artist that would probely dropped to sing you no-talented skinny, a**.

It's horrid, I tell you. With a bunch of guest appearances by other mainstream hacks and horrible vocabulary, no wonder the society has gone corrupt. Hopefully this hack will stop rolling around in the money and get a job at the local gas station.If you want good rap, go for N.W.A., Wu-Tang Clan, Public Enemy, and anything the members in those bands have done.

The beats here are tight, produced by a number of talented producers and old favorites like the Trakstarz. The Trakstarz are awesome and hopefully have a great future ahead of them.

Leaving Disturbing Tha Peace was Chingy's biggest mistake, as Ludacris was the man responsible for making Chingy pop radio's \\"flavour of the month\\".His lyrics are just too generic and played-out already, the same topics of women, clothes, money and cars overrun \\"Powerballin'\\". The production lacks any punch at all - it's all about sugar-coated pop beats with Chingy. He's just another unoriginal rapper that comes along once in a while, and is forgotten about not much later. He even had to bite Nelly's type of slang (Nelly of all people), another sign of Chingy's lack of originality.

The amount of \\"research\\" and \\"fact\\" in the book is on par with that found in most \\"men's action thrillers,\\" minimal or nonexistent, the characters are flat and stereotypical, as is the portrayal of government and our political process.

It's OK to go after bad guys if they're really evil, and would kill you if they got the chance. On the other hand, killing a politician because he won't balance the federal budget? That's totally unacceptable.I also didn't like the author's assumptions about the military, my branch of service especially. No one in the military talks about bumping off politicians and it's a slur to say they do.When you really get down to it, not only is the book's storyline a slur on the military, do we really want domestic policy dictated by assassination? The overall tone from Mr. Flynn is distant approval of the project of killing big-spending congressional porksters. However, down that road lies Timothy McVeigh, the SLA and the Earth Liberation Front.So, despite its interesting plot, the book is too morally compromised for me to be able to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yowzee...what a great book!","review":"This is the fourth Vince Flynn book I've read and I've never been disappointed! This one is particularly interesting and without giving away the plot or the story line, it's something I'm sure angry citizens have thought about from time to time. What a premise!

(Well, hopefully people aren't actually getting murdered, but then again, what do any of us know about how it all works?)Even though this is a novel, there's plenty to ponder here, especially since the political climate and economic conditions described in the book are pretty close to the current situation in reality.

But I've known people on the fringes of these communities and the characters in them and Flynn does a great job of describing their worldview.

As in UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES by John Ross, the protagonists of this novel take creative and daring steps to make the statist government slugs realize just how very vulnerable they are. My only real complaint about this work is the author's decision to have the heroes be members of the Special Forces. The military is the last place you'd look for individual freedom, and career soldiers have actively chosen to live in this culture of control. If Flynn had made his protagonists a handful of fed-up civilians, it would have been much more plausible. If you can set aside this glaring lapse of logic, this book will make you chuckle, and you'll probably finish it in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close your eyes and enjoy the ride!","review":"I think some of the previous reviwers with negative opinions are taking this book waaay too seriously. As political thrillers go, this is one of the best of the genre. It's packed with insider information, from power-mad politicians and the amoral king-makers who advise them, to nerves-of-steel assassins avoiding the meticulous pursuit of the FBI. Granted the premise is implausible: a group of former SEALS assassinate a group of congressmen and senators who the SEALS believe have sold the country down the river (or, in the Southern vernacular, because \\"they needed killin'\\"). While one can argue whether the SEALS have the high moral ground in this setting, it doesn't detract from the page-turning non-stop action.

Three high ranking politicians are assassinated for various reasons, and congressman Michael O'Rourke finds himself in the middle of the mess. It all goes back to an operation that was blown years back thanks to a politician who couldn't keep his mouth shut.Most Vince Flynn fans are very familiar with Mitch Rapp, who does not appear in this book.

Not required reading if you want to read about Mitch, but still worth the time just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read overall","review":"I had no idea that Library Journal and Kirkus Reviews were such Liberal rags. This is a political thriller that isn't afraid to point the finger at the political corruption run rampant in our nation's capitol.DC is not self policing and this book is an interesting take on some patriots taking action. Is the action morally acceptable? Read it and decide for yourself. If you love our country and the Constitution, you will enjoy this book.

As a conservative with tremendous respect for members of our Special Forces (no, I'm not a radical right-winger), I found myself feeling the same frustration the SEALS were dealing with in Term Limits. Oh, yeah, some of the targets were recognizable--and I loved that--and the methods used for imposing their term limits were pretty \\"out there,\\" but gosh they were good at what they did! As soon as I finished the book, I insisted my husband read it (he's big into Clancy, etc.) and he loved it as much as I did. Even missed a baseball game to finish it...and our daughter just finished it and raved about it. She's always been into fantasy novels, but has now asked for more books like Term Limits. Shame to say, there aren't many out there as well done as this one. Hope Flynn will write more about Michael O'Rourk and his friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Flynn book","review":"I enjoyed term limits, and will read more Flynn books, it was not however quite as gripping as some of my other favorite authors (Coban, Child).

I had started this book, got one chapter in, and while doing a major renovation on my house misplaced the book. I found it again and re-read the first chapter and didn't put it down until I finished. A very compelling story. The details regrading various military actions that take place throughout the story are extremely accurate. I imagine I'll be reading this book again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible","review":"This was my first Vince Flynn book. I did not enjoy the book at all. I started this series after recommendations by fans of Lee Child (Reacher series).

With the political cauldron boiling with politicians intent on restoring prestige and prosperity to the American People as well as their nemisees... corrupt politicians with only personal gain and self-interests in mind, action and drama combine to captivate the reader from the start. The moral stature of the characters is well defined yet the predictability that would usually be found in such a plot is nowhere to be seen. This is amongst the best books I've ever read. I find this author to be comprable to David Baldacci and Nelson Deville."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncanny insight by the author","review":"This is a great story.

I found it gripping, and at the same time politically enlightening. I think it is a must read for every productive US citizen. I can't believe this 1997 book was not written in 2009-2010. It is so full of suspense; it's difficult to put down.

To summarize, Flynn argues that the people in a democracy have the right to assasinate their leaders when their political values are being ignored. Is this guy for real? Democracy is about the will of the majority -- if the majority vote in a set of politicians, the rest must accept the outcome and work to elect representatives who share their views. A novel about political killings is fine...but not a book that argues that murder is justified (as this one does).As for the book itself, it is very poorly written. Charachter development is non-exsistant, the dialogue is so bad it's funny and the pacing can't hold a candle to Clancy or Grisham. Avoid this reckless, awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Joke--cut-rate Clancy for morons.","review":"I can't believe anyone actually liked this dreck...True, I can see where Joe America might relate to bumping off the Ted Kennedys in D.C., but let's face it, this should be real life we're dealing with. I cannot in all good conscience recommend this to anyone with an I.Q. over 75. Stick with Jack Ryan--at least Clancy can construct a readable sentence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is almost too terrible to comment on!","review":"To say this book is beneath contempt is kind. If you accept the position that you can kill anyone you don't like then this is your book. To begin with, the FBI wouldn't investigate murder, that's local and state area, and then to present the position that if a politician is crooked you can kill him, no problems with the law, that's just absurd. Save your money, not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book. After reading this book I went on to read 4 Vince Flynn books. This is great stuff if you like politics and ACTION. I had never been a big reader before my son gave me this book. What a page turner.

Mr. Vince Flynn writes a story that any true American Patriot will enjoy. Reading about an honorable man in a job of public service actually serving his nation with care and honor. Michael O'Rourke is an man of true Honor and Valor and has served his Country in Battle. Little did he know that the real battle was yet to come. American's who love their country will enjoy this book as the outcome has twists and turns but in a world where the bad guys win, it is refreshing to see Good Triumph over Evil. Righteousness succeed over self interests. I would rate this book 5 out of 5 stars. Recommended reading for anyone with any Patriotic or Political interests what-so-ever. Wonderful Book. Way to go Mr. Vince Flynn for your masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Term Limits","review":"Excellent book! Parallels the present day corruption in our political system.

He has a way of drawing you into his world of dark politics that makes you think you are living the experience. You love/hate his characters and come to think of them as real. His commentary on politics today is eerily real. Get a Flynn novel, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must read for all Congressman","review":"This was a great read and launch of Vince Flynn's career in writing political thrillers.

The characters are shallow, the prose is simplistic, and the plot is painfully predictable--two groups of domestic political assassins, one good and the other evil--ergo, term limits. The good, who are honorable commando patriots armed with righteous motives, eliminate corrupt career politicians. The evil are motivated by dark selfish ambitions. In the aftermath, the good assassins are allowed to go on with their lives having only loved the country they faithfully serve. The bad are eliminated.I laughed reading reviewers who expressed concern that this book might inspire a revolution. Yeah, gotta keep an eye on those Tea Party folks! There is nothing inspiring in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Righteous Congressman Condones Political Assasination","review":"Righteous Minnesota representative angry at the government knows who killed four sleazy Members of Congress but only tells his girlfriend and his killer grandfather.

WaldropPullman, WA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully this Plot is Totally Unrealistic","review":"If guys like Steve Coleman, Michael O'Rouke (or his grandfather) were truly in charge, this world would be in real trouble. The problem with Vince Flynn and other Gordon Liddy-types is that there is no gray area for them. You are either a military-bred patriot who looks at killing a pleasurable requirement for democracy, or else you are a liberal Frenchy who will doom the world to communal abyss. The simpleton writing Flynn employs here will certainly appeal to the talk radio set. But the plot reminds me of something a overzealous junior ROTC kid would put togetehr. If the Founding Fathers were truly stupid enough to leave our government vulnerable to right wing nut jobs like the O'Rouke's, we'd have found it out a long time ago.Good book club material for the lower reading group. Garbage beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dangerous book","review":"The fact that the hero of Term Limits, a young Minnesota politician, condones and abets the assassination of \\"corrupt\\" politicians is symptomatic of a sick society that spawns violence from Waco to Columbine. Mr Flynn seems to have learned little at his Catholic Liberal Arts College. Instead he preaches a dangerous philosophy that rank him right up there with rap singers calling for the murder of policemen. There are no consequences for the assassins in this book and that, too, should be condemned. I give this book a well-deserved thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasant book - one for facists","review":"A peculiarly American world view where the 'heroes' murder democratically elected US politicians but are also fighting the 'baddies' - who, you guessed it, are murdering democratically elected US politicians. However, within the differing shadings of fascism shown by all the protagonists, we are supposed to sympathise with the heroes!One to throw away"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dangerous Book","review":"Picking up a couple of paperbacks at the library for a trip, I started reading Term Limits on the plane and soon looked carefully to see when it was published. I thought it came out of the tea party movement but was surprised to see it was published in 1997. It is full of the same paranoia and the righteousness of the extreme right. The heroes of this book are assassins who murder politicians they disagree with. That is as unAmerican as you can get, and yet that is what the rhetoric of some on the right (Michael Savage, for example) is leading toward. I don't think that most tea party members want to see Obama and Pelosi assassinated, but feeble-minded readers of extremist trash like this may see the glorification of the assassins as the trigger they need to do their patriotic duty. This is a dangerous book, and I am appalled by how many Amazon reviewers love the story and don't comment on the immorality of the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"An adult plot, written for juveniles","review":"I purchased this book because of the 4-star rating on Amazon. Next time I will need to take the time to actually read the reviews, but I don't know if that would have helped. The most important criteria for me when judging a book is the writing style and level of intelligence of the prose and especially the dialog. This book fails miserably at that so I give it one star in that area. It reads like a novel for teenagers, while having too much violence and a political storyline that has no appeal for that age group. Another star for an interesting premise, or plot, but I don't agree with the author's basic ideology.Granted this is Vince Flynn's first book, and I will give him the benefit of that fact. I hope his subsequent novels are more mature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"This was an easy read, but it was a cheap thrill. None of the characters resonated with me; indeed, they all seemed one-dimensional. Where was the vice president during all this? Did the politicians get the message? We have no idea if they decided to shape up."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Another tale of politicians and commandos'","review":"You would think that I would have enjoyed this book; afterall, the protagonist has the same name as I. By the very truth of it, however, this book bored the devil out of me. If you are reading this book as your first novel of this genre, well, then, you may love it. For me, this book offered nothing new; the characters are typical; the dialogue is weak and paltry; there are too many 'covert-commando' cliches, and the plot is the same old 'political-thriller' rubbish. The book is trendy and fits into the mold of 1990 fiction. If you are looking for something new, something creative and different, I advise reading another tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Much Enjoyed It","review":"This is my first Vince Flynn book. He was recommended to me by a friend as I love the political spy thriller genre. I very much enjoyed Flynn's writing style and was pleased to see he gives enough details to set the scene and elaborate on the characters but, unlike Clancey Flynn does not go on ad nauseum about things. I will be reading more Flynn novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"This book was Flynn's first novel and it is a highly enjoyable read. Full of characters from Special Forces, White House officials, Congress, the press, FBI, and CIA it is a riveting adventure story about a fictional Washington that has seemingly gone mad, but makes the reader wonder how much of what we read is perhaps not so far removed from reality. An entertaining tale, and very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, My first Flynn novel and certainly not my last....","review":"Now I know what all the fuss is about, friends have told me to read Vince Flynn and Now I have.

Usually I'll borrow an audiobook or two and not get that excited. Vince Flynn is the first author since Katherine Neville and Michal Crichton that I couldn't put down and ran out to buy everything I could.This book has a unique plot and really leads you to see the U.S. political arena though some new perspectives without getting bogged down in specifics. I found myself in an almost uncomfortable realization that Flynn has designed one of the only probable ways that true reform might happen in our country. It is either this scenario, or perhaps an economic depression, but in any case, the book is enjoyable, fast-paced, and a great start to a great sereis of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced","review":"This was a heck of a book. Fast action, well written, with a believable plot for the first 3/4 of the book.

There is some good action (hence the 2 star rating), but the thing that destroys this book is the lack of resolution at the end. Maybe there is going to be a sequel (???), but frankly, getting ripped off by a poor ending means I am unlikely to buy another book by this author.What I mean by this is the very reason that the group goes after the government (to make it balance the budget -- yeah even that is a little lame) is not resolved. Yes, there is plenty of neat action and so on, but after all the expenditure of energy and ordnance, does the budget get balanced? No answer to this left me feeling thoroughly ripped off and angry.Readers who are predisposed to enjoy this type of genre should go buy John Ross' \\"Unintended Consequences\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't start this if you're busy...","review":"After completing \\"Transfer of Power\\", I immediately checked-out the author's other book, \\"Term Limits.\\" Both books are roller-coaster rides and impossible to put down.

You'll feel like a fly on the wall at the White House. The plots of both books, \\"Term Limits\\" and \\"Transfer of Power,\\" are quite original.

The concluding poetry has added meaning due to the introduction which frames each poem. Fun, great reading!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eau de Aqua Net?","review":"Clean Ultimate just smells like hairspray to me. Maybe it's just that fragrances smell different on different people, but I kept trying to wash this off my wrists.The original Clean fragrance is wonderful, though. Smells soapy and shower-fresh, not heavy or perfumey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squeaky Bra!","review":"The Bra squeaked loudly until after multiple washings. Now the wire has poked through and I can no longer wear it, after only several months. I would like to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE DESCRIPTION ON COVER! AWFUL DVD!","review":"The front cover says that there are two versions on the DVD. There are not. And, the film has been cut in two places! The key scene (where the mother dies in the bath) is one scene that is not shown! On the back cover, it says 'Digitally Remastered' but, again, it is not! It is a very poor copy from a VHS! All of this is totally dishonest and it is against the law for any company or individual to give such a false description. Those consumers in America who have bought it should complain to the relevant legal body in America about \\"Substance\\", the label who have released this atrocious DVD. I wouldn't be surprised if it was one individual copying the film in a back room! I am in England and so don't know where to complain. Anyone who bought it should, like myself, get your money back! DO NOT BUY THIS TERRIBLE, ILLEGAL DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is a ripoff!","review":"As other reviewers have noted, key scenes are completely missing from this DVD. I wish I had checked the reviews before wasting my money. Don't make the same mistake!This is a fascinating and disturbing movie, and I plan to buy the complete, uncut version when I can find one. But this is definitely not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This was originally a 95 min. film (uncut). At 72 mins - well, what's the point? Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Jack, but not for this SF fan.","review":"Vance's SF is great. I read Vance because it's about men with morals, men with strength, men who have goals and follow precepts of decency and justice. But this story about a sick kid raping children is not for me. I'll stick with reading his SF."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for anyone thinking of starting their own business.","review":"Franchising may be the best starting path for any entrepreneur and this is the ultimate guide. This guide gives you a complete listing of nearly every franchise available as well as such vital information as what level of support the franchisor provides, if the franchisor provides financing, and the approximate costs of starting a particular franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow paced.","review":"This book took me forever to read. I couldn't get into it. Way to slow paced for me. Not one I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lift of the spirit for anyone with a serious illness","review":"The photography of this movie and the story are incredible, can help many individual with serious illnesses that have given up hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Everything Is The Blue Butterfly\\"","review":"'The Blue Butterfly' is based on a true story about a terminally ill ten year old boy who is granted his dying wish to go to the Amazon and try and capture the elusive blue butterfly. Added by a reknowned entomologist and his loving Mother the journey of a lifetime begins and before its conclusion everyone involved discovers there's more to life than any of them could have ever imagined.A film to be enjoyed by the entire family. Moving, Uplifting, Mystical and Inspiring!Starring; William Hurt, Pascale Bussieres and Marc Donato."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Butterfly","review":"It was the same as any other story similar to many others and I thought the insects were computerized.... Nice story BUT has been done many times,in many movies..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"I watched this movie expecting it to be a heartwarming adventure. It ended up being a sentimental load of crap. It was so bad, as my eight-year-old sister said, \\"I wish the boy would have died of cancer!\\" The bugs were cool, but it was boring, and the plot smelled like a stink bug. I would rather have gone to the dentist. The best part was the credits. Save yourself the trouble, and don't watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding.","review":"What a waste of time. This collection is mired in typical Jacobs'School academic-speak. The language throughout is just like I remember it at IU grad school...people using big words to make themselves seem more important. Don't buy it. 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I purchased this book with the hopes of an anthology of the work by Seigfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen and others. While these writers (along with Issac Rosenberg and rupret Brooke) are included, there is very little by way of their poetry.Rather, the book is written for much younger readers (from say, grades 3 - 6) providing an overview of the First World War giving some attention to the lives and work of these poets, but very little by way of complete poems by any of them.I have to give it 2 stars, as the book has some merit; however it is certainly not what I had anticipated. For those interested in a more representative anthology that includes the complete poems of these men, I recommend Candace Ward's _World War One British Poets_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"When I received this book I was completely disappointed. The images were of poor quality and lacked artistic ability. I really thought it would have been a good book to look at. Out of all the images in the book only 2 were decent. The rest were amateur at best. I think the publisher needs to ask him/her self why.I might of well just thrown a $20 into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but almost impossible to cable","review":"Functionally it works fine, but for some brain damaged reasonthe designers made the two video inputs be HD15 male instead ofHD15 female like they should be. This means the standard SVGAmale to male cable you already have with your computer won'twork! You can buy an SVGA extension cable ($40 for a 6ft cable)that is male to female, but remember you will need one for eachinput, so you have already paid more than for the switch! Worse,the extension cables come with the two protruding nuts on thefemale end, but the box has two protruding nuts on the male inputso you will need to 'modify' your extension cable by hack-sawingoff the nuts, which means there is no way to screw the conectorsin. All and all a HORRIBLE design, and I don't recommend anyonebuy it. I sure wish someone else made a competeing product withthe right gender connectors, but I can't seem to find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but it needs to go back....","review":"I purchased this the other day. It works, but for some reason, I'm not getting a nice clear image from my projector. Aten said they will repair it since nothing they've told me to do works. As far as the connections, ya, some moron put male connections on for the inputs, probably so whoever hooks it up doesn't connect the output cable to an input...simple fix, doesn't cost $40 to cure that problem....you don't need to get extra cable adapters, I paid an extra $12 at the local computer shop for female to female adapters and they work just fine...E. Bina, you really need to relax a bit, all that stress will kill ya. And the adapters may add an extra 1/2-3/4 of an inch to how far the cable sticks out at the switch. Hopefully Aten will find the problem and I'll get the switch back in better working condition. All I care is that it does what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"This seems like a copy of a copy","review":"I have an original print from the museum and the colors of this print seemed washed out in comparison. So from now on I'm just going to get museum copies. Truer colors"},{"rating":"2","title":"Streching with Elle was better than I thought","review":"I was sceptical about any fitness video staring a supermodel but this was not too bad. This video mixes basic streching with yoga type moves that help you with balance and posture. I like this because many yoga videos (even beginner ones) seem a little too advanced if you've never done yoga before. For me this was a good transistional tape. It helped me to acheive a better level of flexability and made me more comfortable with yoga. Elle is a little cheesy but if you get past that it's worth giving a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historic songs and Good Words","review":"Forty years later it is too easy to forget or too easy to have missed the courage and passion that fueled the Civil Rights movement. While America is still far from perfect, it is a better nation for all its citizens because some citizens took great risks for high principles in the years from 1954 through 1965. Our pledge speaks of \\"one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all\\" the inspiration provided by these songs and sermons helped make this a truer statement than it ever was before.Everyone who is proud to be an American should own and listen to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good to be Healthy","review":"After trying a number of other chocolate chip cookie mixes, my husband and I were beginning to wonder if any gluten, wheat and dairy free cookies could taste better than sawdust. Pamela's Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix was a revelation! Tastes as good as regular chocolate chip cookies,,,,delicious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Sugar","review":"Although its always nice to find gluten free products available to those who suffer from Celiac Disease, its also troubling to find many of these products also are high in sugar. I found this to be extremely too sweet for my taste. If I purchase something that is chocolate I want to taste chocolate not be overwhelmed by sugar.Rice flour in itself is high glycemic and with the added sugar this product made me feel ill from the sugar content. I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet. Other than that its okay for a rice flour mix cause we all know rice does not compare to whole wheat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and quick to make","review":"I could do without the cocoa in the batter because it makes them look burned when they are not, but very tasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subscribe and Save delivers OLD bags of mix! Two thumbs down","review":"I've subscribed to receive Pamela's GF cookie mix and after the second delivery of OLD mixes I am returning to buying them in the store. All of the last mixes during the last several months (6 bags per order x 2 = 12) have been OLD -- not expired, but the chocolate is dried up, light brown and crumbles to a powder. I discovered it's not possible to return a subscribe 'n save order (for some reason) so I have to throw out the chocolate chips and use Ghiradelli instead. Whenever I have bought Pamela's from Whole Foods the chocolate in the mix has been dark brown, fresh and never has crumbled to powder.AVOID subscribe and save on this item. Buy them in a store."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mat","review":"as helpful as advertised, great product, just a little pricey. the material used could also be better imo.overall i can't live with out it and i am to lazy to make my own :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I bought this mic to record a DVD video with. It was used on my Canon Vixia HF11 camcorder. This camcorder has a mini shoe so I needed to buy a mini to full shoe adapter (found elsewhere on Amazon). It works great. The battery lasts all day. I set it to -10 dB which seemed to be the best setting and that is what a lot of others here recommended also. It does pick up my camera zoom motor noise... the mic is extremely sensitive. Usable signal to noise ratio ended up being about 50 dB which is awesome. This microphone will pick up everything - including echo and reverb. So if you are doing this in an enclosed echoy space you'll need to get up and close with your subject (5 feet or less). It does pick up a lot of wind noise - I recommend getting the dead cat for it (it does not come with one). I would recommend this mic to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged product.","review":"damaged product. not functioning properly. the switch power is misplaced and wrong do not turn off the microphone. capture the two positions are the same, does not change the gain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like the quality of the product","review":"Flimsy construction. I didn't notice any significant improvement in sound quality on the 7D! Too large a size for DLSR use. Returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"We are trying to video hunting and have had nothing but problems with this microphone setup. the mic will fall off the camera repeatedly. I'v had to hold mine on with a rubberband! the hotshoe connection has broken innumerable times to the point where i am unable to use this mic setup. For the cost i feel we were ripped off. very very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible cust service","review":"bought the rode videomic for my sony hdr fx1000.direction say you can set a pad switch down 10db or 20 db cannot move switch in either direction,called rode cust service no call backs,they keep e-mailing me a form that you cannot type comment on.third message to call me and still no call back!RODE CORP SUCKS!!!!M Pirelli."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged","review":"Item is clearly not new. Scratched and worn body. Foam is matted down and won't return to normal. Ironically, it comes with a hand-checked quality control checklist which the operator clearly just tacked off without looking at the product. Make sure your item is not used. Shame on Rodes and Amazon for allowing this to be sold as \\"new\\". How come these boxes never arrive sealed? I am returning this item today."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little too noise capture","review":"I just receive it.I'm a litle desapointed.The sound recorded has a noise when I conect the mic in the T2i camera or in my PC in.It's a sssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh in the silence, and reduction in sensibility or pass high filter, do not change it.Well, next time let's try before buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible horrible waste of money","review":"I bought this mic for at the same time as my Canon T3i and was really pumped about using it for an upcoming video shoot. i got the item and tried it out only to find out it wasnt picking up any audio when recording, and even making the small adjustments possible with audio levels it still didnt work. returned it immediately. JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"Waste of money. there is more noise than i anticipated. It's too big and I rather use the mic that comes on my camera. I recorded with a guy who have the same camera as i do and his volume turned out better than mines, and I used the mic. If i were you i would find another mic but buy it and see for yourself first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met expectations","review":"Arrived promptly, although not packaged very well inside the product box (the shipping box was fine). Made me wonder if I was getting a previously used item. However, it's performing very well in my Canon 5dM2. This seems to be the most popular mic used by many pros. I wish there was a small light indicator telling me that the mic was ON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mic, squeaky rubber stabilizers","review":"The mic picks up really well wherever you're facing it and really helped put the audio more in tune with my videos. The only con to the mic are the horrible rubber stabilizers that ruined the first couple of tapes I used with it. It wasn't until I found a suggestion to soak the rubber stabilizers in some cooking oil that finally got rid of the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I'm pretty picky when it comes to electronics. This fits the bill, nicely. I've worked in TV, radio, and pro audio... not bad for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helps","review":"Greatly improved the audio quality on my Canon T3i. This mic is a little big compared to the Rode VideoMic Pro, but it's also a heck of a lot cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mic fo a DSLR","review":"I got this mic to put on my Canon 60D for shooting video. Compared to the small mic on the camera this one is awesome. It picks up a lot of background noise and I would not recommend it for interviews. However, I shot a few events using only this mic (including interviews) and it was not that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not pro, but it does the job","review":"For $150 bucks, I'm definitely impressed with the sound quality and directionality of this mic. I've been using it in tandem with my Zoom H4n, not only to get better reference sound quality, but to get a shotgun mic that actually might be usable in a final mix.It's nice that it mounts right on top of the hotshoe on my 7D and adds very little weight to the camera.I've tried to run this right into my Zoom with a 1/8\\" to 1/4\\" adapter, but for some reason it won't record at full level. Will have to figure that out. When plugged into the camera however, it really sounds quite nice.Well worth the money for a usable \\"in-camera\\" sound source, as opposed to the mics on most dSLRs which are completely unusable!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mic for many uses","review":"I have two of these now because they hold up to a lot of use and are easy to use. They always give me great sound quality and the price is right. It's especially good for small cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mic","review":"I normally use XLR shotgun (e.g. Audio-Technica AT-835) and mini-shotgun mics with professional video equipment. However, for consumer type camcorders without XLR inputs, your choices are to add a Beachtek XLR interface box (pricey) - or get a nice mini-shotgun mic with mini-phone plug connection for direct connect to most any camcorder with an external mic input. The mic is powered by a 9v battery with a claimed 100 hours of use per 9v battery (I have not tested that claim). The sound quality is very good, the directivity is very good - a great addition for anyone wishing to greatly improve the audio quality of small camcorders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Hate Relationship","review":"Overall, I agree with the previous positive reviews. The mic is directional and picks up the wanted sound very well. It is a bit noisy in the shock mount but there are some suggested cures for that in previous reviews. The microphone wobbles around a bit and feels unsteady at times, but I never experienced it actually causing a problem. My biggest negative with this product is the plastic hot-shoe foot. Mine broke basically rendering the whole microphone useless. The frustrating part is that I (and apparently many others) have found it impossible to find a replacement part for it. However, the overall performance of this product for the price has brought me back to buy a new one. Maybe I'll jury rig the broken one into a pole mount boom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not great","review":"Bought this item to have a higher quality mic to record live music performances and it hasn't worked out very well. Overall the mic is very easy to use and gets decent sound when recording normal video (ie Weddings, parties, ect)but camera mic worked alright for that too. For what I wanted it for it didn't work. Looks like I'll have to use a regular vocal mic to record live music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I just received the Rode VideoMic after putting off buying it for about a year for my 60d and t3i, I finally pulled the trigger and ordered it! And I love it so far! It's quick to use and portable and for under $200 it works wonders!The only thing I do not like is the fact that the cold shoe mount feels cheap, and seems to never tighten all the way, (Will tighten for a few threads, then will Loosen and repeat..)Other than that one issue,I love it! I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a very high quality cheap mic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best mic for this price","review":"big difference between mic recorded sound and camera rec. sound. I would recommend' it as the best variant for really reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"Has helped us to do a number of interviews with pro sound quality without having to wire the subjects up with a lav mic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged product","review":"The mount of the microphone was broken off and never included. I couldn't attach it to my DSLR. I didn't even both to see if the mic worked. I returned it and will try for round two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot shoe mount is not universal...","review":"The sound quality of this microphone is a vast improvement from the stock mic in my Sony HDR-CX560, but the hot shoe mount did not fit the groove on my Handycam's hot shoe. I had to literally grind it down and it broke my camera's microphone input. I don't recommend this microphone to Handycam users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to send it back","review":"Never got to use it. When I opened the box, I expected optional ways to mount the mic to be included in the box. There weren't, so I was unable to mount it to the camera. I was in a jam and unable to have it for the project I bought it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mic, Great Price","review":"Length:: 3:30 MinsJoin me for an on the scene test of the Rode Videomic. As part of my video review you'll hear this mic used for an on-location taping in Aruba, where the wind and water noise would have made it difficult to use internal camera mics. You'll also hear it inside my bunker where I record some reviews. The Rode Videomic performs like an all-around champ. It captures voices head-on while excluding much of the surrounding noise, performing at or above my expectations. The price point makes this unit impossible to resist and every small video rig should have one. Unless you're doing network level productions, this mic is all you need for interviews and other location work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the firepower of a real shotgun microphone","review":"It does sound better than the regular mic on the camera, but it doesn't have nearly the same kind of quality and crispness that a real shotgun mic would sound like. Also, keep in mind you won't get to hear while you're recording, so it's a total crap shoot when you're making your videos. Until DSLR's start making cameras that allow you to hear while recording, I'd stay away from these and record with an external device. Good quality is something you should never compromise in. No one forgives mediocre audio.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy \\"Squeaky\\" Design Ruins the Good Audio","review":"My mic lasted about a month before the rubber bands started squeaking audibly, completely destroying the audio, rendering mine uselss. The rubber bands for the shockmount become brittle quickly and the whole thing starts knocking around. The mic is super sensitive and picks up everything in the room, not unidirectional... could be good or bad depending on what you need.What also sucks about the design is that it's so long that it hangs backwards over the back of your DSLR, hitting you in the eye, getting in the way of your viewfinder.It's just really cumbersome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mic I've ever used","review":"This is the only attached mic I've ever used that completely gets rid of the white noise. Very sturdily built as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodes mic","review":"I have been searching for a deal on this mic for awhile now and this was the best price ever. Thanks, great mic.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best solution for video audio my Nikon","review":"This is so worth it. Compared to using the built in microphone on my Nikon this microphone gives so much better sound and audio quality. This was one of the best accessories you could ever buy for your camera. I see lots of people out their shooting videos now with this attached to their cameras. It's just that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty decent audio quality but cheap plastic build","review":"I ordered this mic about three weeks ago and I used it for one shoot and was happy with the quality. It's much better than the mic on my DSLR. However on my second shoot, the mount for the mic (which is plastic, everything is plastic) snapped when the DSLR camera fell over in my car. So I am very unhappy with the fact that the mount is made out of plastic. I now have to either re-order the broke piece or contact rode. I wouldn't suggest this mic if your on a bit of a professional level."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY LOW RECORDING","review":"This product was supposed to be THE BEST. But it simply quit after a few months. The sound quality when it worked was great. Now when i try to use it you literally have to put your mouth on the mic for it to even pick anything up. I have it set to 0 DB and 20 DB gain on my camera (T2i). Please don't just skip over this review thinking that it is just a lie or something. I had a true problem with this. I also took it to a dealer and they couldn't find out what it was. I was hoping for more...... Just buy a ZOOM, they seem a lot better. Since i spent my money on other things, i now have to save to get a new mic before i can even film again. BIG RIP-OFF"},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate purchase","review":"The item I happened to purchase did not work.There may always be a bad luck to buy a defective one.It did scarcely catch any sound for my canon HV30.I tried it with my old JVC DV-3000 but it did not fit into the shoe.The design looks awkward and big although it has had a good reputation but at least not for me. So I returned it. Maybe I should find other brand or item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much better than the onboard mic","review":"I bought a canon HV30 & the Rode videomic. I recorded a couple songs frommy stereo, putting the cam about 5 feet in front of my stereo. Used Sony Vegas Platinum to transfer to pc, then dvd. The Rode is only marginally better than the built in mic. I will return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product","review":"I purchased this for my Canon VIXIA HF S100. In order to use this product I had to purchase a mini shoe adapter, which only added a slight increase in height. I tested the sound quality of the Rode VideoMic as opposed to the camera's and was very pleased with the Rode VideoMic. A great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"If you're shooting with a DSLR (or any camera with a input and piece to put it the mic on) then this is a must have. I put this on my canon T3i, and with this, the camera, and some kind of steady cam rig you pretty much have professional grade material (kinda). So if you're looking for a well priced shotgun mic this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice for recreational use","review":"I purchased this for use with my home camcorder, and have not been disappointed. Very simple to use, delivering nice, clean sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"I bought this product recently and have very few complaints about it. It makes a huge difference in sound from the on board T3i camera sound. The product is a little flimsy sitting on the hotshoe. Excellent product for the price. It helps my filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"rode videomic","review":"i have only used it once, but it made a huge difference in the audio. i use the nikon d7000 and just shot a short film with kids. all the voices were picked up very well. not much noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Possible Mic For the $$","review":"I bought this mic around late February and have been using it for my Canon Rebel T2i ever since. It was well worth the money. The audio picks up great without a lot of extraneous noise. I'm still using the same 9V battery that I got for it in March. It has the on position switch and a high pass filter mode. It also has an internal pad switch in case you need a 10dB or 20dB reduction in sensitivity. It also does really well in breezy conditions, without a lot of buffeting noise. I would highly recommend this mic to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mic","review":"I use it for filming video outdoors. I put a wind jammer over it and it still picks up sound very well. Very nice mic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sold on the construction","review":"After opening this package, I didn't even bother testing out the sound quality on the mic. While others may be more gentle with their equipment, I knew that this would be destroyed in a matter of weeks with me. It seems extremely flimsy and overly bulky. Additionally, if you plan on taking still images with this attached you'll have to use the large lcd viewfinder as the small viewfinder is obstructed by the mic housing. This thing is enormous. Sent it back immediately and purchased the videomicpro. The return process was fantastic by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"United States Marshals","review":"For anyone interested in the history of Arizona and New Mexico Territories from 1846 to 1912, I think this is a good book with a lot of information regarding the men who held the office of US Marshal and were part of a complex time in keeping the peace. There were those who were corrupt, heroes, some just filling out their time, but nobody got rich off this job. With my interest in how the legal system was working during those years and who had what responsibility, this book was a big help. Going beyond the fantasy, we all like to believe about the Wild West, this author reveals the problems and solutions, the good and bad. It was not only informative, well researched, but an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously biased","review":"I strongly believe that this book is ridiculously biased towards nonsense. I am sorry to have bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush Adminstration Betrayal of America","review":"I guess now Timmerman is going to have to write a sequel: The Spanish Betrayal of America. Those uppity European countries just won't do what the Bush admistration tell them. Outrageous!!!The reality is that if the United States had listened to France and given the U.N. inspectors more time, they would have been able to establish the same thing that we have belatedly discoverd: that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. Without this pretext the Bush administration would not have been able to conn the American people into supporting this War. Therefore we would not be stuck in this quagmire with our troops being killed and injured.The French were right all along. It is the Bush adminstration that betrayed America by luring us into the stupid, counterproductive war."},{"rating":"1","title":"another piece of propaganda","review":"Did Chirac or Villepin lie to Bush?Did Saddam and Chirac have a close relationship?If you waste your time reading this book, you will havethe pleasure of knowing the fabricated answers.Did Bush, Powell, Rice lie about WDM?Did Bush lie about the link between Al qeada and Iraq?Did Bush decide that torture was needed to extract useless information from innocents when the US pretends to be in high moral grounds?Spend you money on Woodward, Clark and wilson books...An advise from another french traitor :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ill researched and filled with LIES","review":"Ken Timmerman, leader in the Log Cabin Republicans, uses his 15 minutes of fame to spout bush administration lies that he purports to be his very OWN lies.This book is only for the choir."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is soooo sad","review":"Here is yet another example of rapid fire accusation and brain-dead nationalism that have deprived most American conservatives of the ability to think sensibly about international affairs. Cheap opportunism in action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flipside of the coin","review":"I find this kind of propaganda rather obnoxious. Even though the theme of the book clearly is of France and its late opposition of US in certain matters of foreign affairs, it is quite hypocritical to point a finger on Chirac when at the same time (or more accurately, in the 80's) US themselves supported Saddam Hussein and his warriors with money and equipment against Russia.For a healthy balance, please read for example Noam Chomsky's Rogue States after you've read Timmerman's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, It's All The French's Fault","review":"That's what should be the tile of this latest Rightwing tract.

This book is pure and unadulterated Jewish pro-Israel propaganda, the same type that Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz used to sell hatred against Iraq.

While he notes that the French traded and had diplomatic relations with Iraq, he fails to examine America's relations with Saddam during the 1980s. In fact, during the Reagan administration, the US supported Iraq with weapons and turned a blind eye when Saddam was killing his people.With this in mind, I would theorize the Mr. Timmerman wrote this book merely to make a buck from current conservative America's hostile feelings over France.

Mike Seeger's voice now sounds like the old timers he revered and learned from 40+ years ago. The cajun tunes are a welcome mix from the traditional early blugrass and old-time styles that NLCR are known for. Seeger, Cohen, and Schwarz have an inner sense of each others playing styles and a respect for their individual musical preferences that can be heard on this recording. A great collection from one of(if not THE) best old-time music bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Lost City Ramblers","review":"The Ramblers are a true American treasure for all of what they have done to bring old-timey music into our culture after being somewhat lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mention of Saddam's deadly Anfal Campaign","review":"The one he committed against the Iraqi Kurds (killing 182,000 Kurds in just one year). The author talks of hundreds of Kurds getting killed by insurection forces in Iraq more recently with no mention of the much larger deadly campaign.On other matters the author refers to 1951 as the year of The Ten Commandments film starring Charlton Heston. Actually the Ten Commandments was released in 1956 and was made only after 1951.Back to Saddam she does mention him going to big war with Iran but tries to possibly blame the USA for the war. Ms. Rossi, Carter, the weakest president the uSA ever had (and one of the most pacifistic) was in office when Saddam started his war with Iran. Doubtful Carter could've stopped any war between the Middle East countries. Even more doubtful Carter's government caused it either. Saddam creepily mostly started that war on his own business (the rest of the blame fell to Khomeini of iran)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Every American Should Know About Who's Really Running The World","review":"Melissa Rossi's book \\"What Every American Should Know about Who's Really Running the World\\" is exactly the kind of book I've been looking for.

I decided to write the review, because this is the first book I have ever purchased that I cannot finish. If you took the facts from the book, you could only fill up a pamphlet at best. If you want to read one big editorial about the author's political views, then this book is for you. The author would like you to believe that everyone in the book is pure evil. Maybe the book got better after page 125, but I will never know.

Unfortunately she argues that all the bad guys are right wingers as she never accuses the left in any of her expose. Therefore her credibility is questionable in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased","review":"I purchased this book and the first thing I noticed was how conspicuously absent it is of anything pertaining to the radical left. The first chapter, in fact, is a dead give away. I admit, right now the conservatives and the \\"neo-cons\\" are in power but there is nothing said about the counter-culture revolution and all it has spawned (radical eco movement, radical feminist movement, gay rights movement, pro abortion movement, multi cultural movement) and how all this affects not only America but everywhere America extends it reach. Political correctness, unfortunately, is a force to be reckoned with in today's society.That said, I did find a lot of the information useful and did enjoy reading most of the book albeit it was one-sided. If the author is going to attack one side she needs to approach from the common sense center and give both ends of the spectrum their due treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate from 2 masters!","review":"This CD makes you wish that Doc & Big Mon had done so much more together.

We bought this salt brand from Ace Hardware. After the first use our brine tank had a disgusting layer of gunk on top of the water. I called Hague (who soldus our softener) to ask if I used the wrong kind of salt, and they said it shouldn't matter. But they were wrong. We cleaned out the tank and started over (this is the only brand of potassium salt that Ace carries right now) and it happened again. I found a Water Softener Q/A site that says crystal salt is the lowest quality and contains the most impurities. We will not use this salt ever again. Previously we used pellet-style potassium salts and had no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"Read very carefully, you are purchasing only one bag not four. The way they write this up it sounds like you are receiving four not one bag. Shipping was out of sight and made you believe you would be receiving four bags instead of one. I will not purchase anything from this company again. So I tell you be careful of this company and how they sell their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"nature's own potassium crystals","review":"Ace switched over to this brand over a year ago from another brand that worked great. Since then we have had all types of problems with our water softner system. We finally figured out after virtually replacing every part in the tanks and water softner tub that these crystals were the problem. They not only contain many impurities but they tend to \\"cake\\" over and clog up the area where the water is filtrated in the tub. THis then prevents the water from filling or sometimes results in overfilling the tub. In order to use these tablets we can't have more than one bag in the tub at any time and generally end up scooping it out in order to get the granuals that have \\"caked up\\" out of the tub. Unfortunately it took a year to trace the root cause back to these crystals."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing drop in quality","review":"For years, Armetale has been a key dimension of our cooking and serving equipment. This and two other Armetale items we got recently are much lower quality - much lighter and feel cheap. Very disappointing. When I tried to find out why, I discover these are no longer American-made. That's too bad, but wouldn't be a show-stopper if the quality had been maintained. Quite a disappointing turn for this formerly standard-setting company."},{"rating":"1","title":"suffragette diary","review":"The book is okay,but near the end Dollie is force fed (tube in the nose). The book is pretty informative about what suffragettes did. There is a good deal of protesting and breaking things. Unfortunately, there is quite a description of Dollie and other marchers being assaulted, both verbally and physically (and raped), by policemen. While it may be historically accurate, I do not consider this content appropriate for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Certain Miss","review":"Good concept to discuss different types of leadership with good and bad examples. However, most of the work seems to be on the positive examples with the anti-types being included as an afterthought. Nearly all chapters are weak developments of leadership style with the notable exception being the one on Harriet Tubman. Additionally, both the types of leadership styles discussed and the people chosen to represent them appear to fit the author's preferences rather than true representations of leadership styles and leaders. This book was an easy read and parts were even enjoyable but the content was not as substantive as I had hoped.The best recommendation that I can make is to check this one out of a library instead of purchasing it.(review written by a life-long student of leadership with a library full of leadership texts.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good book","review":"Leadership is an interesting topic, but Wills somehow manages to drain all the life out of it. I did learn a little, though, so that's why I gave it two stars instead of one.I also thought that the author let his political bias get in the way of his writing.Not a book that was worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, worst on the subject","review":"This book is a mess. The thesis presented in the introduction is a rambling essay on the importance of followers and historical forces in leadership, which might leave the reader less informed about leadership than before he/she read it. What's worse is that the intro has nothing at all to do with the rest of the book (which is marginal in it's own right). The case studies are way too short and are made even less informative by Wills habit of not even mentioning the leader until five or six pages of nonsense. My overall feeling of this book is that it was poorly researched and badly written. I wonder (in all seriousness) whether Wills knows anything at all about some of the people he writes about. Skip this one. I suggest Lincoln on Leadership instead: it provides the rudiments of leadership with clear, well researched examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership Handbook","review":"I purchased this book for an online class. The book provides a general overview of several leadership styles. The author covers a broad spectrum of leaders from Socrates to Martin Luther King, Jr. I am not an avid reader, however I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in historical leadership styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title does not accurately portray the content","review":"Author Gary Wills proposes a thesis that there is no one best leader and that those great leaders have been so as a function of personal characteristics meeting the circumstances of the times. This is a worthy and admirable approach on the surface but the author fails to adequately cite what elements or factors were key to this leadership. Rather he settles for recounting history. This recounting is complicated with the author's political biases tending to overshadow the points the author intends to make. There are many more effectively communicated and thoughtful books available on the subject that are devoid of left-leaning political bias. This book is not worth the money spent on it and fortunately my book retailer took mine back for a credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wade In The Water","review":"This compilation is an educational and inspirational program which chronicles a little known segment of AMERICAN music!!!

The story jumps from a drunken Mary leaving the pub directly to people talking about her murder. The Tod Slaughter movies are usually delightful, full of good old-fashioned melodrama; the actors--especially the wonderful Slaughter--obviously relish their hamming it up. And the sets are usually interesting, and surprisingly well produced. BUT NOT IN THIS ONE. This one has perfunctory acting, dark lighting in dreary sets you can barely make out. It's all talk (and boring talk at that) and no action. If you are a Tod Slaughter completist, you may want to hunt down this flick manufactured by a different company."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time.","review":"I am a big fan of Ms. O'Day-Flannery but this was one of her worst books.

Ian claims she is warm and giving and that is why he loves her but I didn't see any proof or action on her part to make me believe it. I love time travel and more \\"steam\\".

Lets just say there was baffling pity nookie. not even nookie, i dont know what that was. this book is going in the trash, i cant inflict it on anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Feelings..","review":"First of all, I liked the premise of the book. The conjuring up of a perfect man who happend to be from another century could have been more entertaining than it was. It was hard to keep interest in the story because there was too much thrown in the mix. For example, the character Rahmin served reading their astrological charts was unnecessary and did not add to the mystery of reincarnation.The second problem I had was that Suzanne could be such an irritating, unlikeable character. Towards the end I wanted to strangle her. The romance in the book was poorly written and the character of Ian seemed to disappear for awhile towards the end.Like another poster, I would like to re-write the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author but I'm going to give her another chance.

Micky really shows you what it was like for him growing up in show-biz. He takes you through his whole life, from Circus Boy, to his first band, to the Monkees, and throughout the rest of his life up until 1993 when he wrote this book. It really gives you an indepth look at the phenomenon that is the Monkees. By the way, there are some VERY cute pictures of Micky when he was younger in this book! I recommend this book to all Monkees fans!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial to the max!","review":"Mickey Dolenz must have been pressed for time in churning out this quickie. It is the most superficial of books. An inordinate amount of time is spent on descibing his child star career, I felt. Then the years with the Monkees, making records, etc. are just sort of - well, it's all there, but in a very superficial way. \\"I did this, we did that, boy we had some good times, then we did this, boy I had a bad time\\". Near the end he mentions he gets married again and has 3 daughters, and we never even learn the wife's name!!! For Monkee Fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, hey, he's a Monkee!","review":"This 1993 autobiography nicely captures the spirit of author and ex-Monkee Micky Dolenz. While it is intended to cover his entire performing career, Dolenz concentrates mostly on his stint as drummer in the pre-fab pop group The Monkees, and he does so with refreshing self-deprecation. He never fails to give credit to the many people who backed up the Monkees talent, particularly his three cohorts in the band. Dolenz is the first to admit that \\"It's only a band\\" and takes it far less seriously than do many pop theorists. A breezy and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book touched my heart","review":"At first, I checked out this book from the library. Because I've always wanted a copy of this book since I saw it at a Monkee concert last summer. Eversince Easter, I've had my own copy(thanks to a friend). I loved the way he talked about the differences between George and Janelle(his parents). Eventhough, they were fifteen years apart...they had the oposite ways to raise children. His childhood was very interesting as well. I espically cried when he told about when his father passed away. His Monkee stages are very funny/sad and touched me. His \\"after Monkee\\" stages, espically touched me about the problems he had to deal with. Espically his first marriage fell apart. I even followed his advice in the preface. I even cried and cried at the end. This book is told by Micky in a great way(happiness, sadness, etc...). I recomend it to anyone who likes Micky Dolenz, and The Monkees. So, I trully liked this book...it's my most favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled With Fun and Info","review":"As a Monkees' fan from way back in the hey-day, my nostalgia has been getting the better of me lately. And that is why I purchased Micky Dolenz' \\"I'm A Believer.\\" This is the kind of book about the Monkees, their show and their recordings that I wanted to read. Micky writes a fast-paced, information-filled journal that doesn't stint on fun. Micky's sense of humor is present throughout as are fascinating facts about the whole Monkees era. Micky has happily chosen not to dish nasty dirt, and that is a welcome relief these days. I found the book to be a good read and highly recommend it to any Monkees' fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up and enjoy it","review":"In addition to being funny, Dolenz proves to be an intelligent, educated, talented man who has written a light, entertaining book about his experiences in life and show business. If you're one of those people who are still, decades later, ranting that the Monkees weren't authentic, maybe you should skip this autobiography (better yet, read it and pay attention--you'll learn you were mistaken). However, if you're able to take a lighter perspective on pop culture, you'll find the book quite enjoyable. After all, it's only rock and roll, not exactly the core of Western culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grooviest Book Ever","review":"Great book!! If you haven't read it you must. You're missing out on a lot if not. I checked it of the library and never wanted to give it back. You'll love this book. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a view of the behind the scenes Micky, read this book.","review":"I own this book, but it wasn't easy. I had to special order it through a book store but it was well worth it. There were times when I laughed outloud and times when I cried. He was honest about everything he's done, good and not so good, and told his story in a down to earth manner. It was almost like he was sitting next to you. If you get a chance read this book. It will hold your attention for hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Rocked!","review":"I really loved the book. I don't own it, but my friend does. She and I are both really devoted fans. I loved how Micky wrote the book. It was serious and funny at the same time. It gave some advice, and I liked that. I also enjoyed learning about his history, seeing the pictures of him and his family and friends. It was the best book I've ever read, and it shall remain that way forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Believer: MY life of Monkees, Music and Madness","review":"I found Micky's book to be very entertaining, and it cleared up many old rumours about the Monkees from way back when.

It is a must have for any Monkee fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Micky's bio is a great read!!","review":"Micky writes his bio so wonderfully, with the great humour he's known for! :-) His flashbacks, written in screenplay format, are hilarious!

A great book!","review":"I read this book twice, checking it out of the library both times. I love it (mainly cuz Micky wrote it, I just LOVE him)!

I've also heard most of the Monkees songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for literal minded or those who do not LOVE playing","review":"My son was looking for a book as a baby present and this is the first one that came to mind for him. Sadly you can only get it used now.He and his brother loved this book and it is one his father and I still refer to with smiles on our face. After this book we were often requested to make a story silly even if it wasn't. Eggs jump out of the frying pan when it gets too hot; a car gets put in Elp's tail when it is too big and heavy to carry; multiple tales of fun and silly weave together into one delightful story.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???????!!!!!!","review":"Okay, yes, we laughed - but not in the way the author might have intended.

I do not know why he does this, as he is bound to reduce his readership over time as he alienates potential fans. His efforts to control the reader's mind in this regard are offensive, but in all fairness, some of his previous works have been much worse. Mr. Brown is very good with the technical stuff, and in this case, I thought his story was creative and original. But it's convoluted and implausible, too, which must be why Clive Cussler admires it so. Mr. Brown has done worse, but he's done somewhat better, too. Overall, this is a fast read and the book does deliver suspense by the bushel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing: full of sound and fury...","review":"This is one of the most disappointing books I have ever read. The plot is interesting, but Brown's tedious, techno-windbaggy, self-satisfied writing is sure to infuriate anyone who likes Tom Clancy. Is anyone old enough to remember the Tom Swift books for boys? This book is just as corny, but with adult themes. Obviously, you cannot be too gee-whiz for some readers. A heavily armored stealthy B-52 as the ultimate weapon is kind of a nutty idea, but Brown apparently thinks he is the Billy Mitchell of the next century...I could go on and on about how much I hated this book. But, hey, plugmeister extraordinaire Clive Cussler thinks it's hot stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed, if too technical at times.","review":"This is your basic Dale Brown novel, the huge acronyms which are impossible to remember.

Lookng forward to Dales & Mikes next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For cryin' out loud, Dale, TELL THE STORY ALREADY!","review":"I really didn't like this book and had to force myself to pick it up and continue it. WAY too many acronyms and too many difficult names (Chinese names, yes, I understand it was necessary). The reality is, all the acronyms could have been said once and then it just doesn't matter. I've gone back to reading Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"IMHO, the author mixed an overload of various small pieces of technical information with his rather bizarre interpretation of current world politics. He forgot to add a plot and a characterization of his main characters/heros (are there any ?). Contrary to my expectation, this book is not at all equal to authors like Tom Clany."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"About the most ridiculous book I have ever read. Would have been better as a science fiction book in an imaginary setting rather than the cartoon versions of US and China that he offers. Young readers will get a highly distorted impression of the world from this book, not to mention a overly cavalier and glorified description of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stronger than a Bear & Twice as Smart","review":"If you want a techno-thriller where planes and weapons fly about like a war game, this is your book. Dale Brown's books have been compared to Tom Clancy's, who got his inspiration from a naval game. This reminds me of saying someone is strong as a bear and twice as smart. If you want literature where important struggles are in the hearts, minds and souls of the characters, forget it. I'd be cautious if it were twice as good as Tom Clancy's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put the book down","review":"This is the first time I read a novel and I couldn't put the book down. The story line and the scenario kept my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to say","review":"The scenario is possible, but isn't totaly realistic. An EB-52 can be made, but that would result in massive overhauling of the regular B-52. Also, I don't know how it is possible that for a little dinky company of John masters to build a multi-million dollar warplane without other people having knowledge it. How did he get the funds? Finally, a pregnant woman on a bomber destroying a bunch of nuclear is just way out of the world...Dale Brown has good ideas to write about, but this book was borderline propaganda/imagination for the B-52."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read.","review":"This book is the first book to ever get me started on Dale Brown's books. I would recommend ANYONE to read this book. It contains suspense, technology, action; everything you could possibly want in a book. Dale Brown is a bookwriting genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical manual with sporadic weak story line","review":"I used to enjoy Dale Brown but I didn't enjoy this one at all. I found myself skipping large sections of boring technical specifications of virtually everything. (No I do not like romance novels). I entertained the possiblity that I was just getting lazy but after reading most of the reviews here I find I remain with the majority. I'll read the reviews first next time. I have an idea for Dale... we can all go out and buy Jane's book of ships, missles, planes, and jock-straps and he can simply provide page references. This should cut the book size in half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious.","review":"A 100 page novel, 'compressed' into nearly 500 pages. Long, slow, repetitive, boring, tedious. Those are the good points. Brown's alter-ego, the unlikely hero-navigator of the novel, is like Ian Fleming's Bond, only much less entertaining. My last Brown book. A complete sell-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Dale Brown's Worst...","review":"I have been a huge fan of Dale Brown's and have read almost all of his novels. He helped satisfy my craving for Clancy novels when their introductions slowed. But Fatal Terrain is by far his worst effort to date and definitely not worth reading by those that are trying to decide. I agree with another reader, his constant referrals to his other books get very tiring. In addition, I love the technical nature of these types of books, but he goes way overboard. I found myself skipping sentences because he appeared to be filling space. There have to be better alternatives out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dale Brown Writs a good Fantasy!","review":"Like many of his readers, I let realiry go and get into the sotry.

When Sun-Tzu wrote his \\"The Art of War\\", he never wrote anything about Yangtze & Yellow Rivers.(P.208) And based upon the whole stupid story and/or scenario(if there is any), there is nothing actually to do with \\"The Art of War\\" but a day-dreaming writer made up a total 448 pages' mumble-jumble without even checking the maps! My God, what a shameless and irresponsible writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time.","review":"'Fatal Terrain' is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly plotted. The characters are wooden. And the author exhibits practically no feel for the plain meanings of the English language: for example, in one passage, character 1 states that character 2 is OBLIGED to do so-and-so, and MAY do so-and-so, but that character 2 has no OBLIGATION to do either. This is a contradiction, and should certainly have been caught by an alert editor. 'Fatal Terrain' is simply not even a good beach read, and is about 20 cuts below 'Flight of the Old Dog'.

The problem with the book is not that he doesn't understand his subject, he just cheats too often. I don't want to give much of the plot away to someone who might read it, but the characters are two dimensional, the plot is too predictable and there is way too much deus ex machina. He has tried to be politically correct by including females in his combat crews, but he makes sure that only minor male characters are at any risk. This was one book that while I was reading, I was hoping it would get better---it didn't. If you are a hard core military/tech fan, you will enjoy it, but it is standard fare with no significant surprises or insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just fiction","review":"I read the entire book. You can enjoy the story only if you remind yourself that it is just fiction. Don't let the author's lack of knowledge about: a) politics; b) foreign affairs; c) the legal system; d) business or a host of other areas interfere with your reading. The characters are cartoon characters- no depth. The plot is predictable (the good guys win). That being said, Brown tells a good tale. I did finish it. It was entertaining if not great literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Fantasy","review":"Two retired US Generals, the President of the US, the entire Chinese Communist leadership, and dozens if not hundreds of career military officers go bonkers, break discipline, disobey orders and international law to start a nuclear war over minor perturbations in a 50 year old standoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Dreadful","review":"The first and last Dale Brown novel I will ever struggle through. The characters and dialog are idiotic; the story line is inane and unevenly developed (especially as you get closer to the ending); and the technical details are only mildly interesting. I am convinced that Brown himself was heartily sick of it by the time he got to the ending.If you're a fan of the genre and not Dale Brown skip right on by this stinker. I can only hope that Brown's early efforts were better than this one, but I will not spend any more money to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poorest Dale Brown Yet","review":"I hope that this is not the first Dale Brown book someone reads - it will probably be their last. The pace is uneven and erratic. The worst aspect of the book is the total lack of realism conveyed by the \\"Brad Elliot\\" character. Hopefully, for all our sakes, the US military (and it's semi-autonomous agencies) would have some qualms about letting this man anywhere near a weapon system of this import."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed background and plot setup is ruined by bad editting","review":"I really like Dale Brown books. As ex-military, I enjoy many of the potential scenarios that he describes. However, this is my last Dale Brown book. The first three-quarters of the book is classic Brown: detailed, exciting, with a complex plot. However, the ending of the book is rushed. Problems are solved magically. Few details are provided, some of the carefully developed sub-plots are just dismissed, without explanation. My initial reaction is that these items have fallen victim to poor editting, while technical errors are left in. (The grenade launcher attached to an M-16 is the M-203 not M-206). It just seems such a shame that the climax of the book is contained in 1 chapter, with many unresolved questions hanging out: What happened to Balboa, Finegold, What was in the message to Sampson, How was it planned, final disposition of Guam, etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Chinese speaking like what Brown written","review":"You could make the OLD DOG fly anywhere you like to carry out any kind of fictitious mission you like, but you cannot and should not ridicule the people you really didn't know.

Heard in this light, the song to me is no longer the light-hearted children's song we learned in grade school--it is a frightening message delivered via Guthrie's razor-sharp wit. The song sounds stark, forbidden, stifled.This album is the beginning of it all. The recording quality is dubious at times, and Guthrie's plaintative singing and guitar playing only add to the ambience. These songs aren't easy to listen to, but this CD is an essential component of any collection, ranking with the Sun recordings in historical importance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true legend","review":"What can be said about Woody Guthrie that has not already been said, and probably better than I possibly could.All I can hope to do is add my voice to others in praising a wonderful singer / songwriter / activist / human being, who was very much a concience for his day and for ours.I was so pleased to learn that his series of Asch Recodings are available today on CD. His music is collected in the Smithsonian Institute,Washington - and deservedly so. I love his easy style, it's like he is sitting with you round the fire just strumming and singing out his wonderful mesages. The messages are truly timeless.He, Pete Seeger, The Weavers, Leadbelly, and others influenced a whole generation of folk - Dylan, Baez, and many others. Please keep them available Amazon.

His guitar playing is great on those early recordings. \\"Tommorow Night\\" is a good jazz song that I still here played occationally today. But by the time he recorded this Folkway album, he was a older man. All of these songs sound kind of the same, and they are all boring background music sounding.

I'm apprehensive about trying the other recipes I've already bought the ingredients for. It's getting expensive throwing things out and making another dinner for my family and it sure isn't make my life any easier.Another thing that irritates me about this book is that many of the recipes cannot be frozen.

The recipes that are in the book are not even close to being as good as the ones in the store either. The directions are not all that clear, there are no pictures, and as for reheating, I am not sure if the authors even tried to reheat the items as they all seem wrong when I do them.

The only one that we have made so far that was inedible was the cider braised pork chops. We loved the ravioli with chicken and pesto sauce and the chicken cordon bleu. We are starting our second month and it seems even better than the first. I am finding that the casserole dishes are often best when it comes to frozen meals.

The recipes contained within are stereotypical of any junior league cookbook most of us have lying around the house. The directions are vague. I would return it but it is not worth the return shipping cost to do so, so I will probably donate it to one of my college bounds kids.

It was a waste of ingredients and of time. In addition, many of the recipes were not up to our standards, with very high salt content and bland flavor. I am very disappointed. I still love the concept, but this book is not the one to get if you want to save time and plan ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait 'til it's reprinted","review":"This book has a few good recipes, but is not best of the books out there. Most of the recipes are not \\"freezer to table\\", if what you're looking for is something to just pull out of the freezer when you get home, as you would a TV dinner. No, these you have to let thaw completely before you cook them, which means you have to remember to pull them out of the freezer several hours ahead of time (something that doesn't always happen when you're busy). You're much better off cooking the entire batch, and then dividing them up into freezer portions so you can microwave them later for a quick dinner.Also, out of about 100 recipes, 20+ have errors. It's one thing to write in cookbooks with your own adjustments, but you shouldn't have to make corrections.

The three books in this series are horrid, and I don't just mean in relation to the originals. Like many other writers, his energy was spent after the first few series and books, and he has degenerated into rehashing formaulaic bad prose over and over. Where he used to \\"show\\" what was happening, he now spends endless pages \\"tell\\"ing in justification of the poor choices his characters make in far fetched plot. The outcome was thoroghly predictable. The plot was the most forced plot I can ever remember reading. The lectures at the end were insufferable. Please avoid.

A spoiled and lurid slacker-who spends most of his time getting wasted-must repeat grades K-12 in order to become heir to his family's hotel business before his scheming opponent does. Weak, moronic calamity shows off Sandler's infantile behavior while keeping the drunk/stoned and flatulence jokes alive, which mostly lose fuel over a single, on-running situation that is elementary school funny. Sandler's comic buddies from the SNL skits, Steve Buscemi and Chris Farley are unbilled. Running Time: 89 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language and brief violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's that penguin again","review":"Adam Sandler is a comic genius. From lighting poo on his neighbors porch, to chasing an invisible penguin, this movie is hilarious. It is the story of a spoiled rich kid who goes back to school to win a bet and take over his father's hotel chain. Comedic mayhem ensues, and Adam gets by with a little help from his friends: Chris Farley, Steve Buscemi, and Norm MacDonald to name a few. This movie has a couple of jokes that kind of cross the line (minus a star), but is funny from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Everyone in this theatre just got dumber from seeing this.\\"","review":"This film gets a lot of harsh review due to its immature, slap-stick humor and lack of plot. This is well understood. But why dwell on THIS Sandler film for being stupid? They all are, and this is the best!Adam Sandler's humor isn't for everybody, but if you liked Big Daddy you will love this. I feel it puts Waterboy and Happy Gilmore to shame. Packed with unforgettable one-liners and all sorts of random humor, this is a classic comedy that is just as good with each viewing. There are times when something so strange happens, that I find myself laughing out loud but asking myself \\"..What the hell? \\" Perhaps Sandler's unique style of stupidity only enhances his films.Confused? Sorry, my fault. All in all, I recommend the purchase of this before/over all other Adam Sandler films - it is extremely hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!! :D","review":"This movie is stupid, silly and weird but in the best possible way!!!

I'm not a huge Adam Sandler fan, but he's pretty freakin funny in this. Great story, great soundtrack, and just an all around fun, party flick. I decided to upgrade to blu ray, since my standard DVD version was worn out & scratched due to playing it so much. I'm pretty satisfied with the upgrade. The picture looks sharp & the sound is great. This version includes deleted scenes, outtakes, & a director commentary with Tamra Davis. I would have LOVED to hear a cast commentary (or just Sandler), but considering that the my old, standard DVD edition doesn't include ANY special features (save for the basic cast & crew bios & production notes), I'll take these."},{"rating":"2","title":"hahaha funny","review":"Adam sandler is so funny! especialy in this movie.

Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Sandler Mania","review":"In the first 3 minutes of Billy Madison I'd already had pains in stomach from laughing so hard.

Anyone who rates this movie as being poor is beyond help! If you've ever been in college, drank a beer, had a girlfriend, or even just had one fun memory of being in school... this movie WILL make you laugh. People are bashing this movie for reasons like it didn't have a script that would win literary awards.

That's the best way I know how to describe it. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Sandler at his best!","review":"Great movie. As always, the concept is poor but Adam, with his jokes, faces, and special approach to the part, makes it so great (and the guest appearance by Steve Buchemi helps too).

But we came for Adam, and he gave me what I wanted: laughs!You can find other reviews by me to other releases by Adam Sandler."},{"rating":"2","title":"An acquired taste.","review":"Ok, so his humor is not for everyone. Most people like to think they are above toilet humor, but I dare anyone to sit through this movie without cracking a smile.

He is hilarious as a grown man who has to go through grades 1-12 all over again because his father paid his teachers to give him good grades. SNL stars Norm McDonald and Chris Farley add to this funny movie. My son loved it as, well. But some of the language used is not for very small children. \\"Billy Madison\\" really delivers some great laughs that I still laugh think about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SANDLER AND HIS FRIENDS ARE FUNNY IN THIS GOOFY COMEDY!","review":"What can I say?.....I like this film. It is juvenile, but Sandler and friends are very funny in this goofy movie. Sandler plays a rich 30 something kid who will lose control of the family business and his inheritance if he doesn't go back to school and complete kindergarten through 12th grade in a short amount of time. The plot is pretty thin, but it rolls along with many familiar faces from SNL trading punches through out. The DVD transfer looks good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic funny movie","review":"This is a funny albiet innappropriate movie. Good for a cheap laugh, and some memoriable one liners. Hard to go wrong with early Adam Sandler stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"This movie is for any person that considers themselves an Adam Sandler fan. For some of those people, it is his worst, for some, his best. It all depends on if you like a completely random movie that involves: burning dog poo and the human response, people on fire, three drunken losers, pickle racing, peeing your pants, sloppy joes, dodgeball, an invisible penguin, and jibberish. In a nutshell, if you do not think that a scene involving Billy talking about how cool it is to pee your pants and an old lady replies, \\"If peein' your pants is cool, then consider me, Miles Davis,\\" and Billy replying, \\"That was the grossest thing I've ever heard, LETS GO!!!\\" funny, then you will not like the movie. Basically it's a classic that any Adam Sandler fan should own, whether it's too stupid for your taste or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes us laugh like a comedy should","review":"This comedy does exactly what it should-a charismatic funnyman is presented with an amusing plot device (rich boy has to repeat all his schooling at an accelerated rate), and all of the expected gags are mixed in with a few unexpected gags (such as a hallucinated giant penguin). Sandler's shtick gets old after awhile, and the movie misses the mark of truly great comedies by failing to come up with any real warmth or drama, but the jokes keep coming and keep us chuckling."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best movie i've seen in a while","review":"Adam Sandler is his usual hilarious self in Billy Madison and the funny plot makes it even better.

The cast was a nightmare. I can't believe that Adam Sandler would ruin his reputation by being involved in this movie. This movie made me sick, and should be erased from the market all together.

I have never been so disappointed in anything I have ordered online before. Really over-priced and cheaply made.

These songs are memorable, funny, melancholy, weird and delightful, among other things - here is simplicity without schmaltz or stupidity. Guthrie's performances are generally adequate, often inspired, and some tracks offer rare opportunities to hear Woody play the fiddle!

Because of the design (with the band that facilitates a non-slip fit), and it's ability to attenuate ambient noise, some of my clients have opted to wear these headphones to help them stay calm and organized within a range of environments. Knowing that these headphones are available for under $40.00, I was able purchase a set for clients to borrow while in-house, and have recommended them to families for personal use. Another positive is that they can be used with an MP-3. One potential draw-back, depending on the users sensitivity, is that the ear cups do not necessarily completely surround the ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised!","review":"I bought these headphones so I could listen to music while mowing my yard. The day they arrived, I plugged them into my MP4 player and hopped on the 20-year-old John Deere lawn tractor.

Too much bass and little treble. Little boxy and with no open sound stage...in SUMMARY: It is OK for the price, where if used on airplanes, you won't loose sleep if it gets damaged or lost. If this happens, my bet is that you would probable purchase this same unit again. Airplanes do not have the best sound quality, so this headphone would be OK...in RECOMMENDATION: So this is best as a traveling headphone. But if used mainly at home, you will want to try something else. I understand that the higher Creative headphones sound much better (at a much higher price). My best bang for the buck is the Grado SR-60 headphone at $60. No noise cancellation and not sound isolated (open aire style), but one of the most confortable and best sounding headphones around..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"I just bought these the other day and they are going straight back to the store. The sound quality is good. Noise canceling works somewhat and I can hear better when I turn it on. However, turning on noise canceling seems mostly to just increase the volume. As a test, I turned my TV on in the background at a very low volume. So low that I couldn't distinguish any words but could still hear voices. I could hear those voices even with noise canceling turned on.I could put up with that, though, since they more than serve my purpose and not too expensive. The reason I am returning these is because they HURT! I am a woman with an average sized head. After only ten to fifteen minutes my ears begin to ache from being squeezed so tightly. I am constantly nudging the headphones to different positions in an attempt to ease the discomfort. But it's just too persistent.

If you want to read a book this long to come away with very little insight into what caused the accident, you've come to the right place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senatorial Privilege","review":"You can breeze through this book in under an hour -- I just did. While it makes for a suspenseful, albeit entertaining, account of what happened that infamous night, Damore relies too heavily on witnesses' accounts and police remarks (often little more than Kennedy bashing). By now, most of us can accept the facts: that EMK drank way too much and drove off a bridge, subsequently leading to tragedy. DUI accidents happen every day, chillingly often to average people. The fact that this happened to one of the greatest Senators in the history of the United States only reaffirms this. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly craft projects, not furniture","review":"Unfortunately, this is not a book of plans for building solid, simple 2x4 furniture.

The Cruiserweight title match between Silver King & Juventud Guerrera was not very good but at least they were trying. The Raven's Rules match between Raven & Perry Saturn was not great but still a pretty good hardcore brawl. The Curt Henning-Dean Malenko match was a one-sided nightmare.

It's not like women haven't fallen in love with someone who has taken advantage of them before. Give me a break. Besides, the character in question was also a known thief and murderer; I don't hear any complaints about that!You couldn't help but root for Lydia and Ross, even though Ross wasn't always likeable. Ross's character was flawed, but always desirable and I looked forward to his appearances.It's one of the better Sandra Brown novels for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated reading","review":"The book is well written, it's an engaging story but the writer made the \\"hero\\" too nasty, the rape, \\"yes it is a rape\\" made him just as cruel as Russel, the real vilan in the story, and the reader is not expecting that from a \\"hero\\". That part in the book was a desapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUNSET EMBRACE","review":"This book is great in that it describes heaving bosoms in so many different ways. It wasn't what I expected from such a writer. And what was this? He prized her knees apart? I think he pried. The descriptions of Ross and Lydia were so repetitious.And phony. The history wasn't right either. Divorces were not the common thing they are today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Escape","review":"A romantic trip through the covered wagon days when life was hard and sex was inspired by love - not porn. Missed it so much when I finished, had to order the next in the series. Amazon was kind enough to get the next-\\"Another Dawn\\" here within days so I didn't have to wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most probably her best book!","review":"After having read almost all of Sandra Brown's full length novels, I have come to the conclusion that this is probably her best book. The hero, Ross Coleman is surely the best male character that she has ever created.The love story between Ross and Lydia is suely one of the most sensual and romantic one I have read in a long time.I have read the sequel to this novel, Another Dawn, which centres on Ross and Lydia's daughter Banner and Bubba Langston, one of the characters from Sunset Embrace. That too is a great novel, but nowhere as sensual and emotional as this one.That's why I was shocked about what happens to Ross at the end of Another Dawn!!...read Sunset Embrace if you are looking for a true hero you are not likely to forget anytime soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have read!","review":"I loved this book. My family and I were on vacation in Destin, Fl and I wanted a good book to read. I first bought Another Dawn which is the sequel to Sunset Embrace. So I went back to the store and bought Sunset Embrace and read both books that week while lying on the beach. I can't wait to read them both again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Embrace This Book!!","review":"Lydia came to the wagon train with a secret past. Found in the woods by two boys, she was near death from a miscarriage and very alone. After she's healed and somewhat recovered, she's thrown together with Ross Coleman, who just lost his wife in child birth and has no one to care for his new-born son. They are hiding from secret pasts, but soon find that they can't deny the sparks that surround them when they're alone. The past is hot on their heels, and each worry about the newfound love being destroyed by their separate pasts.SUNSET EMBRACE is a story set in the 1800's and is followed by ANOTHER DAWN. This type of writing is not the Sandra Brown norm, but is a very nice diversion. She brings this era alive, and makes the reader see and feel the story. You can taste the dust from the wagons, feel the tiredness, and hope that dreams can be fulfilled in Texas. SUNSET EMBRACE is a strong story with powerful characters, which makes this a hit for Sandra Brown!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God this was recorded","review":"Intimate, relaxed and informal, this is a 60-year old Leadbelly running through his vast repertoire and having a real ball in the process. True, not all the performances are complete songs, the first disc is unaccompanied singing, and there's plenty of the between-song chat that formed part of Leadbelly's act. But when he gets going on the guitar, with that voice, time just stands still.

An Irishman Gareth works in the factory. Meg and Gareth seek to solve the mystery, since the guilty person is trying to frame Gareth. Meg has no plans to marry and wants to run the factory after her father dies.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: four. Setting: 1892 London. Copyright: 2006.

This is the second book in her Ladies Amateur Sleuth Society series. DeHart's breezy style sucks you effortlessly into Meg and Gareth's story. However, her characters have enough depth and subtlety to make for an emotionally satisfying read. I particularly loved Meg. I'm peace-maker in my family, so I could completely sympathize with Meg's emotional journey.If you're looking for a fun and easy reader, this book is sure to please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringly Wicked","review":"The plot was uninteresting.

I will probably be throwing these away as soon as I find better ones.

The majority of the recipes were something I could have come up with after not having gone grocery shopping for three weeks! If you're looking for BASIC-BASIC, I guess this is okay--kinda like \\"How to Make a Sandwich-101. But not for someone who thoroughly enjoys the art of cooking and entertaining.

Check the individual recipes yourself on Epicurious on-line reviews. There are some real dogs in this volume--Prosciutto, Mozzarella & Basil Pizza--one should not cook basil; it looses its taste(p 93). Scallop Stir Fry (p 31) was average, although Noodle Pancake that goes with it was excellent. Also average--Broccoli & Cauliflower Cheese Soup w/ Sausage soup (p 63).

A must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"What ever","review":"I have read most of the reviews for this movies and I must say I am not all that impressed with them. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie and I am a huge X-Men fan, but we have to realize that Rouge did not get that white streak in her hair from Magneto's machine she got that when she took Ms Marvels powers and that is also when she got the ability to fly. Not to mentioned that they kill Sabretooth he is like one of the best villians that they have as for Toad I don't remember him ever being in the comic books. I was heartbroken when they did no include Gambit, Beast and Juggernaut on the movie. I think that if they make a second part they need to include more of the original comic book characters. As for the cast I think everyone did a great job if they would have picked a different crew I might not have liked the movie as much. The movie all in all was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xcelent Movie","review":"X-Men is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

I put it on my wish list after I watched it! I'm really not into action movies, but solid preformances by everyone in this ensemble sucked me into this movie immediatly. The extras on the disc, including a feature that lets you watch the deleted scenes INSIDE THE MOVIE, are excellent. Only one bad thing...I think it could have used a few more action scenes for the mutants to show off their powers.

Dark (yet not depressing), witty (yet not dopey), sit back and enjoy this ride. To those who think there is too much character development in the beginning, I say \\"Pshaw, it was durn interesting.\\" Think there was not enough fighting? Geez, just watch the news if that is what you are looking for. And to those who thought that Anna Paquin wasn't so hot, i challenge you to do better.

They do not try to mask anything and did an excellent job of telling the back-story. They picked the right actors for the parts and the actors did not over shadow the characters they played. You have to stretch your imagination a bit but it is worth it. The only drawback was the morals of you get what you ask for in spades.Bottom line is it is worth watching once to say you saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"A wonderful movie that translated the comic book well to the big screen. Doing what no other comic book themed movie has been able to do, these characters actually came across as \\"real\\". With the exception of Halle Berry as Storm (Angela Bassett would have been much better), each actor played their character perfect. Hugh Jackman will make you believe there is a Wolverine. Halle Berry, as usual, is good for looking at but not acting. Capt. Picard, I mean Patrick Stewart, is great as always. Don't let the fact that it's a comic book adaptation turn you off from seeing this movie. It'll definitely be your loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"The comics are better","review":"A totally mindless film adaptation of Stan Lee's X-Men Comic book series. This film had me pndering for hours why a director would destroy a perfectly good comic series into an hour and a half of endless idiocy. The acting was fairly good to start, and the beggining looked almost promising, but then, it dropped off considerably once you hit the first action scene. This movie may be based on a comic book series, true, but to make a feature length film out of people flying in the air and smashing each other is pointless. The director did do a good job with the casting I must say though, Ian Mcklellan, and Patrick Stewart save this film from hitting rock bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-MEN","review":"I never thought it could be done. X-men is better than blade, spawn, batman, and the crow, put together. Bryan Singer wasn't my first choice for directing this movie (I probably would have gone with richard donner), but after seeing it I am glad he was put in charge. This movie is the best since the original superman. You won't find as much action (or comedy) in any of the other comic based movies. I give credit to the big M, Marvel comics and stan lee, for giving us a great film. The acting is very good, not cheesy at all. Hugh Jackman is the new hero of the day, as he is the one and only WOLVERINE. I give credit to everyone involved in this movie.

The special effects were excellent but that's all. The acting with the exception of Patrick Stewart was average. The plot was true to the comic book genre, in that it was simple and predictable.

As both an X-men fan and an actor, I can understand complaints from both sides.The critic in me sees how characters were introduced in the wrong order (Beast and Angel came way before Wolverine or Storm). Some were even missing, such as Gambit. And then Toad and Sabretooth were killed, leaving Magneto with just Mystique.The actor in me understands how expensive it can get to travel all over, hosting auditions and gathering so many people together for a film, including big names that bring star-power to it: Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Barry, etc.In the end, I feel the story of the X-men has been around far too long to be done in an incomplete manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"I went into this movie with an open mind, and left feeling like I wasted my $8. This movie lack the great story and special effects of movies like: Batman and Robin, Supergirl, Battlefield Earth, Happiness and Enemy Mine. Patrick Steward as Prof. X? AWFULL. They should have casted Wayne Newton (he has more acting chops). As for the rest of the cast, I thought their acting left alot to be desired. Personally, besides Newton as Prof. X, I would have had as Wolferine, Steven Segal; Storm, Sally Field; Cyclops, Robert Downey Jr.; Jean Grey, Rupaul; and Magnito, Nipsey Russel.Note to Brian Singer.

So I saw it on HBO shortly after its theater run was done. And I must say that this film is bad! While the acting is not what it should be and the tone just wasn't there, the film seemed to lag at every turn. Hugh Jackman was a good choice for Wolverine, but just about everyone else didn't fit their roles.The SFX were good and some of the fight scenes, while entertaining, were ridiculous. The film also seems to try and mimic the mood of Batman during the final battle of the film.X-men, though, did try to portray the comics the way they were supposed to be, but comes up tremendously short!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What the Batman franchise should have been.","review":"X-Men, the first REAL attempt at bringing a Marvel Comic to life on the silver screen, succeeds on several levels. First, it is well written, leaving just enough cheese and in-jokes for fans of the comics--but it doesn't ignore the newbie, either. Each important plot point is explained, and we are saved from watching the \\"origin\\" of every character.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Patrick Stewart as Professor X, and Ian McKellan as Magneto really steal the show. They've embodied their characters, and work well together. The message of discrimination is never played heavy-handed, but it comes across. All in all, a solid performance.Michael Kamen's music is wonderful and fitting. Just the right amount of adrenaline and somberness. (I recommend you by the CD as well as the DVD!)In short, X-Men is a rewarding superhero flick. People with children however, should be warned that there is an amount of violence, but it is not gory. All in all, and excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Movie...Hate the Widescreen","review":"As the title says, I really loved the movie...as a long time fan of X-Men comics I feel they actually stayed pretty much true to the comic which is rare in theatre now-a-days.

Anyhow, I went with my wife to see this movie. I really like Wolverine - a very funny, sarcastic wit that steals the movie. Everyone else is O.K. The bad guys in the movie are more appealing then the good guys, but there should have been more bad guys. The picture and the sound on the DVD are excellent!

In the case of X-Men, yes.Had this movie not already been so thoroughly reviewed, I would have provided a synopsis. That not being the case, I will simply add my two cents (and rating) to the average.Short and sweet - if you like the comic (or cartoon), you'll love the movie. Don't expect a deep plot or award winning performaces. If that's what you're after - look elsewhere. If you're looking for pure and simple entertainment, without the cerebral factor, you've found it.

I only wanted the movie to have more characters from the actual cartoon. This movie is worth seeing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"This DVD is very well done. The art direction, etc is very good, adds to the atmosphere of the movie. I expected a bit more on the extras field. Maybe they're saving this for a future \\"Special Edition\\". Anyway, the box is amazing, the menus very well done and the movie entertaining by itself. The fight sequence on the Statue of Liberty is electrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Introduction That Lays the Groundwork for Bigger Things","review":"Energetic, surprisingly loyal action / adventure with some brilliant casting choices and a tight, cohesive visual style. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are brilliant choices as Xavier and Magneto, dueling civil rights figureheads on opposite sides of the moral spectrum, but don't get nearly enough scenes together. Of course, Hugh Jackman absolutely defines the role of Wolverine, playing a very clearly defined, potentially cheesy character and pulling it off with vigor. The film's not entirely confident in itself, evidenced by a few hokey plot devices and a handful of godawful lines of comic relief (basically anything that comes out of Halle Berry's mouth), but considering its age and status as the make-or-break point for comic book properties (spoiler: it made) I can overlook a few missteps. Light fun with the kernel of a deeper message nestled beneath several layers of black leather, titanium veneer and bright, colorful effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I felt that this X-Men was the best of the bunch.

The speacial effects were great. Must Have on DVD for your home theater. 2. The worst movie ever, from cheezy lines to a plot with more holes than swiss cheeze!

The funny thing is, I used to like X-Men comics when I was a kid myself and halfway expected a good yarn. And I do enjoy sci fi movies like the Matrix, Terminator, 12 Monkeys, etc. But oh, my! What a mistake going to this turkey! There is absolutely no story to this at all, the characters are ridiculous, the acting (what acting?) is preposterous. This was the closest thing to sheer torture since they dragged me to the Pokemon movie.But don't take my word for it: even my kids had to admit it was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This movie is very simplistic and predictable, yet too violet for a young child to view. Some of the special effects are interesting, but not enough to make you forget how boring this movie is. I watched this movie with my husband and 2 sons, age 12 and 15. None of us liked it. I admit it is not my type of movie, but it could have been and SHOULD HAVE BEEN my sons type. They enjoyed the X-Men cartoon when they were younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"$-Men","review":"Plotless flick made only to promote thousands of various merchandise items, especially the non-action figures. Probably the first movie that genuinely *is* merchandise itself... Will obviously be loved by two-digit-IQ people, who consider comic books high art and must syllabize their captions aloud in order to comprehend them. No wonder it gets so many positive reviews (though I doubt if most of their authors actually know the definition of the word)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie in a good set of movies","review":"My son is a superhero fan and had seen X-Men 2 and 3.

If you like superheros, you will really like all the movies of the X-Men"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad -- really.","review":"Even for a movie based on a comic book, this one is pretty unwatchable, partly because it tries to take itself way too seriously. I saw \\"X-Men\\" shortly after seeing \\"Fantastic Four,\\" and it suffers greatly by comparison. The only non-cardboard characters are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), and even then Wolverine was too much the nice guy instead of an antihero. This also may be Patrick Stewart's worst movie yet, and Ian McKellen doesn't come out much better. The other actors simply chew the scenery. And -- again, even for a comic book -- the plot holes are enormous. E.g., where did the billions of dollars come from to construct the underground complex at Xavier's private school? (I hate to think what the tuition bills are like. . . .) The original Superman and Batman flicks are proof that a good film of this type is possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilling movie","review":"when i first saw this movie, i thought i would hate it. i never liked x-men before, and i am skeptical about superhero movies. from the first scene, however, was hooked. it has plenty of action, and it is a classic villian movie. like gandalf and saruman of LOTR, the leaders on both sides are good friends.

Then she finds out he is not normal like her.Then the two of them aciedentily run into a mutant school. There they find they're mutants.

I have X-Men #1 comic. So to say that the movie was some what of a dissapointment is an understatment. But, if a person knew nothing about the topic, it was a brief intro to the theory and storyline. Oh yeah, and the casting could have been much better....especially for Wolverine....but after all it was a movie, and if it raises interest in X-Men then it did its job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra DVD features are pale in comparison to the Matrix","review":"Although the movie was good, it's clearly evident that this was a hastily put together DVD. The DVD features are pathetic and pale in comparison to what was done on the Matrix. It's a pity they didn't spend more time adding interactive content to take advantage of the DVD format, instead they relied on clips from the Charlie Rose show and artistic drawings. I also disliked the way they selected to show the extra 10 minutes of footage they spliced out. The DVD would display the original uncut scene and then it would display the cut scene directly afterwards. Wait for the enhanced version (if one ever does come out)."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 out of 3 ain't bad","review":"I bought this collection because it really wasn't much more than buying just 2 of the movies. The first one is great. THe second not so much, but somehow, you need them all. Besides the have Hugh Jackman. If only we got to see more of James Marsden's eyes. If you like these, get the prequel--Hugh all the way.X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Two-Disc Edition + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"A liitle too much but not enough...","review":"While adult fans who rememebr the comic book will like the updated trip down memory lane, Most adults will find it a little inane. My 10 year old thought is was soso and I would not let my 8 year old watch it. Some cool effects but really disapointing overall. I think it played a little better on the big screen but not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, fun, and great eye-candy","review":"After hearing harsh reviews of X-Men and never having read the comic, I wasn't expecting to be dazzled by this film. However, I had a lot of fun with this DVD. It combined an interesting premise with realistic human personalities, and some really smashing combat scenes and visual effects. (Of course at the end there's rather an obvious amount of space for a sequel left...)My partner assures me that the X-Men themselves are very well characterised (although some of their histories are changed for the sake of the storyline). X-Men works very well as a movie, even if you well versed in the comic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Mindless Summer Action","review":"Having been one of the rare humans in America that really has never read comic books, I watched this DVD with very low expectations. Also, having been fairly immune to the 'hype' surrounding the flim, I simply took the movie in for what it was -- a good summer action movie.The plot is fairly straightforward with some minor twists to keep it very interesting. It seemed to me to be very comic book like -- in a good way. The action, the emotions, and even the set design were all a little over the top.The only minor nit-pick I had was that it was so painfully obvious that things were left open eneded for sequels in the near-future.The movies literally just flies by. It is very enjoyable, funny, and action-packed. The special effects are top-notch and the characters are well cast. Simply a well done action flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best comic movies","review":"The fact that Wolverine spoke what every non-comic book fan was thinking makes the movies heads above all other comic movies. For example, when Professor X was introducing the team, Wolverine made fun of them. This is what the person that thinks all these silly comic names are ridiculous. Wolverine turned the movie into a worhthwhile experience. Thank goodness ... Hugh Jackman was able to take the role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but dissappointing special features","review":"I thought that this DVD is top-quality, but I felt that the way the deleted scenes are accessed was distracting. I would prefer that they either substitute the deleted scenes into the movie, or make them available at the end (which they are). However, to watch them as part of the movie, the movie pauses, then the deleted or modified scene is shown, and then it pauses again to return to where it left off. Not the best system in my opinion.Otherwise, the disc looks and sounds great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Movie","review":"A great movie for people that love action movies! Has a enough of the comic book action to keep the X-Men fans watching, and a good enough plot and characters to keep the new to X-men watchers watching. The DVD is great becuase of the deletd scenes and interviews. After it you'll be hoping for sequels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT- WASN'T!","review":"Bryan Singer proved he was a good director with the usual suspects and what is here looks good and is stylishly done. Infact it would have made a great first half of a film. Unfortunately it is the whole thing!The film sets up the sequels really well and they might well be good films, but when i pay to see a movie i want to see a movie, not an extended trailor for a soon-to-be movie franchise.This is like the pilot of a T.V. series.Sets up the characters, ends with a short action sequence to show what they can do and that's it.VERY DISAPPOINTING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick, great fun","review":"Full of great special effects, and just plain fun, this is a great movie to have for a night at home with friends. See how many of the X-Men you can spot, and count the number of X's as they go by. See if you can catch a glimpse of Stan Lee, the original creator of the X-Men."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous film of a legendary Marvel property","review":"Marvel comics does not have the best track record when it comes to translating their popular comic book characters from the page to screen. I am happy to say that that trend has finally been broken with the release of 'X-Men' on DVD. While not entirely true to the mythos of the comic books, 'X-Men' presents the characters as realisticly as possible while keeping the message of tolerance and acceptance at the core. The cast embodies each character with their core qualities from the vicious savagary of Sabertooth to the exotic beauty and grace of Storm. As a film it is entertaining, as a DVD it is a treat! A wonderful array of extras awaits you to explore within the colorfully graphic menu found within Cerebro. I personally enjoyed Hugh Jackman's screentest and the extra scenes that did not appear in the original release (which can be viewed during playback of the movie or as separate scenes). I love this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"X-cellent","review":"I saw this movie for the fourth time last night, it gets better everytime you see it! The acting is magnificent despite all the newcomers. The storyline is magnificent and appeals to a wide variety of people, even those who aren't big fans of the comicbook (but how could you not be? :P)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly entertaining","review":"This isn't 'just another superheromovie'. Not at all, this movie is very well done. A good cast, amazing special effects and a good storyline makes this a classic in its genre. Sometimes it's even touching, for example Rogue: she can't ever touch or be touched by a human being. That's so sad! This movie is definitely much more than I expected!"},{"rating":"1","title":"15 years too late!","review":"It's really too bad the timing of this movie didn't coincide with the mid-80's when the X-Men were red hot.Hugh Jackman was a little better than I expected, but I expected so much more.The DVD's screen test with Jackman in it left you with little doubt that he is a true actor.But the acting he performed in his screen test was better than anything he did in the movie.It's ok at best...even if you are a die-hard X-Men fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great film in a great box, but....","review":"I'd lve to give the film 5 stars, it was a great movie. But the DVD is only getting 2 stars. Why? The package looks great. There a bucketful of extra features. The sound is great.But the picture quality is lousy. Somewhere along the line, DVD makers have to be told that the actual film is what people pay money to see.Take my advice and wait 'til the X-Men turn up in your local multiplex to see them in action again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"i am a huge fan of X-Men and i know alot this movie had faws all over it. They do not even have the original five. Ice man does nothing, where is angel, where is beast, and tell me how Wolverine and Sabretooth not remember each other after all they were on the same special force squad and went through weapon X. This movie is a disgrace to the comics. Where is wolverine slicing and dicing his opponets. i mean come on mystique giving wolverine a hard time fighting lets get real he is a master of practically every fighting style in the world. In the comics mystique would have been dead in 10 seconds. Her body would be in hundreds of pieces. This is a total remake of the original characters. I just don't understand why Marvel would let this movie be made without exact specifications of the characters and the comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Action Flick","review":"X Men is a good movie, a lot of action and great special effects. I had never read an X Men comic before watching this and still could easily follow the plot. Hugh Jackman is ready to explode as a MAJOR film star and he does a fantasic job playing Wolverine here. The mutant battles are easily the best scenes, with some of the dialogue straining. I wish they just could have battled each other all movie. Still there was ample action and fantastic FX. This is a great looking film on DVD and has some really cool extras like Hugh Jackman's screen test and some cool stills. The best thing about this movie is that it lays the groundwork for many sequels to come. The next proves to be even better with Wolverine seeking out vengence on the people who mutated him. Definitely buy this if you're into good action films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"I didn't expect much from this movie, but I read the X-Men comic books as a kid and thought I'd give it a try. I was very impresed by the movie, the director and producers took on the movie to be a real movie and not just for kids. All of the popular X-Men mutants are represented and they all show their unique abilities with some of the best special effects ever seen in a movie. Highly entertaining for all people of any age, A+!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This was an absolutely incredible movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan make a magnificent pair as the friends who are on opposing sides of a conflict. Hugh Jackman breaks through amazingly as the gruff Wolverine. Famke Janssen, James Marsden, and Halle Berry round out the X-Men as Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Storm respectively. Anna Paquin plays a young Rogue; which is one of my few beefs with the movie. Having Rogue as a teen works with the movie, but is totally out of sync with the comics.Other characters who surfaced as teens included: Shadowcat, Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, Cannonball and Colossus. I also believe that Nightcrawler and Beast made an appearance, although both looked basically normal, so I could be wrong.The villians were Toad (played by Ray Park Jr.), Sabretooth, and Mystique (played by supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). Senator Kelly also played a large part in the film.The plot worked well, the actors were incredible, and I am so looking forward to a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie","review":"Brian Singer did a fantastic job with bringing the X-Men to the silver screen. He definitely followed in the footsteps of tim Burton, Batman & Batman Returns. Whenever comic books are made into movies, they always fail when they try to be a comic book, i.e. - Batman & Robin. Singer kept the characters real and human. As silly as Wolverine's haircut is, I owuld never have it, one can't help but believe it and accept it as real. This movie has excellent, but far inbetween,action sequences. Less is definitely more here. The character development of Magnetto, Wolverine, and Rogue was fantastic. The special effects were fabulous. Anyone who likes an action movie with a story and real plot, i reccomend buying purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Comic Book Movie Made","review":"Finally, a decent movie made about a great comic book! A rarity for anyone who's seen The Punisher, Superman, or the multiple Spiderman flicks!Excellent storyline and characterization. Would have loved to see more back story, hopefully there will be that in the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the Characters, but not the Comic Timeline","review":"Comic fans beware-it's not a perfect adaptation of the comic books. But the setup for the school is the way I'd always dreamed of the Xavier Institute as being; filled with kids, human and mutant, who are all learning and growing up together. The camios of Kitty Pride, Pyro and Jubilee are there to be watched for, and Iceman, though too young, is a great character. Patrick Stuart is the perfect Xavier, and Hugh Jackman is the only person to play Wolverine. It was a wonderful story to behold, and I look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Men DVD","review":"Excellent DVD!

Good dialog for an action flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie even if you're not X-Men fan!","review":"Very good movie, very good story development, introduction of some of the classic X-men characters; excellent visual effects.The Cons I find in this movie are that I don't buy the idea of Magneto's machine, this movie is developed in a more \\"real\\" environmet\\"; and the fact that not all x-men appear here (where are Gambit and Jubilee?)Overall is a very good movie. If you like action and sci-fi, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant acting from Jackman, Stewart, and Paquin!","review":"There are three wonderful performances in this movie. Hugh Jackman is awesome as Wolverine. Patrick Stewart is calm and commanding as Xavier. But the heart of the film is Anna Paquin's Rogue. The filmmakers decided to make Rogue a real person rather than the fake cartoon version. Some fans still don't get the fact that making Rogue real gives the movie depth. Ignore them. Paquin's Rogue makes this movie a film worth watching AND thinking about. Rogue is terribly tragic because she is a real teenage girl with a tragic affliction. She is forever alone. And Paquin is brilliant as Rogue. See this film. The scenes between Paquin and Jackman are truly touching. Trust me, this is a very well acted film. See it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"This movie did no justice to the wonderful characters of the X-Men. They took the characters and their well known storylines and basically changed and butchered it to their liking to make a very <bad> movie. The X-Men themselves are not a big part of the movie. Most of the movie is all about Wolverine. The characters of the X-Men are the title role but obviously not the main roles in this movie. They also left out so many great characters like Morph, Beast, and Gambit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"If you are 12 years old you may like this movie but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone much older. The story is vague to nonexistant and the acting is very simple. If not for the visual effects the movie would probably have never made an impression at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse picture of year!","review":"Plot confusing, stale,can't see where they spent the money. Cast of unknowns, no excitement, just a lot of bally-hoo by the producers. Didn't even deserve to be released. Lighting is so terrible that alone will give you a headache if the plot doesn't.Terrible casting. James Marsden simply dreadful. Don't waste your time on this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Chris Claremont","review":"I can't beleive this was at all based on the comic. Where do I even begin? This movie has taken all of the good elements out of the comic and replaced it with utter crap.As far as the casting goes Wolverine probably got the best treatment. Jean and Cyclops were also good though they did not get the screen time they deserved. Who in the world came up with Halle Berry as Storm? She can't act her way out of a paper bag. Not to mention the bad accent. If she could not keep it all the way through she should not have done it. Anna Paquin was also a horrible idea. What happened to the southern accent that Rouge was famous for?A lot of this can be blamed on the writing. Rouge has no history with Mystique and Wolverine has no history with Sabertooth. Even worse than that is the relationship with Rouge and Iceman. Iceman and Rouge were not even at the mansion at the same time. But all of these gripes aside this movie still sucked. I have to wonder if Chris Claremont had any say."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE THE MOVIE","review":"I was so excited that it finally came in the mail but it was broken. it didnt even play the full movie.

The effects and acting in it was good but the characters and plot is bad. The thing I didn't like about this movie is the so called \\"X-MEN\\" act there the first \\"X-MEN\\", what I mean about this is that they are missing some of the X-men, where's Gambit, Beast, etc. Gambit was the coolest but evendentally the studio or the screenwriter didn't think he was cool. The other thing they should have did to make this film better is they should have stayed true to the comic book. Long Live GAMBIT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the cartoon","review":"I grew up watching the X-Men cartoons, so I was disappointed to realize that they were going to try and make it real (so to speak). I really didn't enjoy this movie very much; they left off most of the better mutants (think Gambit and Beast) and the ones that were present weren't the same as in the cartoon. Trust me, pass this one up (unless you aren't familiar with the cartoon--my husband never saw it, and he enjoyed this movie)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable movie","review":"I must say this first: I have never in my life read an X-Men comic book. Having said that, I had a great time watching this movie. It was deeper than I expected; instead of being merely a series of special effects-laden mutant-versus-mutant battles (though, needless to say, there are plenty of those), the storyline is really quite involving and thoughtful, the acting is superb (Jackman rocks the house), and when it gets down to the electrifying action, you won't be dissapointed.

Ben Stiller is hilarious as the \\"orderly guy\\", with some great lines. (check out the nametag Grandma-you're in my world now) Bob Barker shows up in a hilarious cameo, and Chubbs is a hysterical supporting character. From his hand, to his alligator story, his antics are great-I was thoroughly surprised when he passed away. HG is such a great comedy though, because it doesn't strive to be overly funny or serious. And in a way, it teaches a lesson, I guess, if a bit vaguely. All I know is, I'll never think of Lynyrd Skynyrd the same way, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every time I see it, the laughter is always the same...high","review":"This is a spectacular comedy movie. The movie is about a young hockey player who needs to make some money to get his Grandmother's house back from the IRS, and he ends up joining the pro golf tour and playing against arch nemesis Shooter McGavin. The standards match the same standards for ever Adam Sandler movie...rolling on the ground funny. The first time I saw this movie, I was laughing so hard that I got a sore throat. Some incredibly cool scenes are parts like when Happy Gilmore gets in a fight with Bob Barker! A definete watch, and make sure you have cough drops with you, because you'll need them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillient","review":"THis is Adam Sandler at his best it is a really good movie and I would recemend it to everybody"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy Sandler is funny","review":"Most of us remember Sandler from his Saturday Night Live days....so when he jumped to movies there was great expectation that he would be terrific. Well, thats just what happened. Happy Gilmore is an aspiring hockey player who happens to stumble into Golf. Sandler with his outrageous style keeps you in stitches all throughout the movie....I damn near fell out of my chair laughing.So if youre a fan of great comedy...check it out...its a gas!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandler's Best","review":"The only good golfing movie ever. \\"Caddyshack\\" was average. Adam Sandler is Happy Gilmore, a struggling hockey player who needs to come up with money to pay for Granny's taxes. Chubbs (Carl Weathers) notices his golf swing and senses some potential. \\"Just tap it in.\\" Shooter McGavin eats stink piles for breakfast, but he thinks he's the best. Gilmore climbs the ladder and is almost ranked number one by the PGA. His popularity grows more and more and all kinds of people come to watch him play. He cusses at the ball and breaks a machine clown's face. Gilmore does it all: beats Shooter, gets the girl, saves his granny's house. The best Adam Sandler movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES","review":"ADAM SANDLER IS HILLARIOUS. YOU WILL WATCH IT OVER AND OVER.IT'S WORTH MORE THAN BUYING.

It makes me laugh. I will however give you a relevant review of the DVD itself. Its horrible. Its Full Frame. It has no extras. This is clearly one of Sandlers best works, but its a shame it gets such bad DVD treatment. I hope they are working on a criterion edition of this film (yeah right!) or at least one with widescreen and some great extras to round out what could be a great DVD if done correctly.

But many of the gags are pretty funny, and there is some real humor in a blue collar hockey player forced to deal with the elite golfing world. The comeuppance for the cartoonish bad guy is cringe-inducing, looking like it came right out of the early eighties. But there are enough funnies to keep my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain dumb","review":"I think I laughed once during the whole movie. It really surprises me how many people thought this movie was hilarious. I've only recently watched a couple Adam Sandler movies because I told a friend I didn't like Adam Sandler(I couldn't stand his routine on Saturday Night Live), so he challenged me to watch some.He raved, and others of my friends raved, about Happy Gilmore. Well I watched it and I just thought it was so dumb. That idiotic voice he uses sometimes and beating everyone up...it was just so stupid to me. I would've stopped after the first 10 minutes, but I thought I owed it to my friend to finish the whole thing. Yuck! This was the typical Adam Sandler that I expected and do not like. Click was pretty good. I was surprised to like that one. But Happy Gilmore gets a big thumbs down from me. I guess I'm the odd ball since everyone else seems to love it. Ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boresome Plot, Unremarkable Acting, and Humorless Comedy","review":"I'm not quite certain why everyone seems to enjoy this movie so much. In the movie, Adam Sandler plays the title character, an unsuccessful hockey player who plays professional golf in order to prevent the IRS from repossessing his grandmother's house. Unfortunately, the character comes off as being as asinine as he is mercurial. While I would not go so far as to call the humor crude or tasteless, I didn't find it very amusing either. If your idea of comedy is seeing people getting hit by golf balls or watching Adam Sandler get beaten up by Bob Barker, then this is the movie for you. Overall, I found the acting unremarkable and the plot boresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD keeps sticking while playing ...will need to return","review":"DVD sticks at time during playing. we played it once and couldnot get thru the movie,,,,need to return. i think that i have 30 days and yes time is ticking and will do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are 2 great movies by Sandler, Happy Gilmore is one","review":"There are two great movies by Adam Sandler. One is Billy Madison, and the other great movie is the classic golf movie Happy Gilmore. Happy Gilmore falls inline with the great comedy classics about golf in the past like caddyshack and is a definite must buy for your collection. Happy Gilmore originally planned to play hockey for his career. However there is one proplem, Happy can't play hockey because he is bad at the sport. He does have a strong swing when he is hitting the puck around and is noticed one day on a bet that he can hit the golf ball pretty long as well. Like a hockey player, Happe Gilmore does have an anger problem and ruins the peaceful environment of the golf course. This is a very entertaining movie, and if you love golf or Adam Sandler this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

If you have ever in your life played golf and enjoyed it, I can't imagine you finding this movie anything but loathsome. But I don't think you have to be a golfer to hate this movie. It doesn't just abuse golf and smear it with as much dirt as possible. It pretty much hammers everything into the ground with Adam Sandler's trademark childish petulance and nastiness. This is certainly the most truly unpleasant golf movie that I have seen (and I've seen pretty much all of them), and it is probably the worst Adam Sandler movie that I have seen (although I hear rumours that there are even worse examples out there). To be avoided unless you think golf is a stupid game for losers and you really, really enjoy humor based upon vindictiveness and hilarity at bodily functions and other people's pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I bought the Happy Gilmore DVD for my kids at Christmas.

It was ridiculously boring the second time. Adam Sandler couldn't be funny in this film if his life depended on it. Yet he has a knack for attracting the best comedy costars ever. Take for instance Christopher McDonnel in this movie. He's hilarious as the villain. And Bob Barker's role is funny, if not small. But Sandler is bothersome at the center of this movie. The plot is chock full of cliches and the humor is obnoxious and pestering. Sandler has had better movies, but he has not done better. If you're looking for humor from Adam Sandler, you're better off watching an Oliver Stone film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hole in one for happy.","review":"Why do a lot of critics bash Adam Sandler so much?The guy is not a bad actor.Happy Gilmore is a pretty good comedy and Adam was great.Just the plot was a little cheesey[not Adam's fault].

In recent years the insane sandler has improved in terms of box office results but nothing, NOTHING has come close to this the greatest golf movie of all time. That does include the brilliant murry in Caddy shack.My favourite moments include the boy in the practice nets at the golf course. The woman on the wind screen at the old peoples home and any of sandlers outbursts. This is a film that has to be seen by everyone!The DVD is in full screen which is cool because the fil doesn't need to be complex and the sound doesn't need to be wonderful.

If you want to laugh your ass off, buy this movie right now! This is Adam Sandler's best movie. His new movies really suck.(Little Nicky, Big Daddy)The story is simple. Happy wants to become a hockey player, but he really blows at it. While he is at the batting cages(not practicing baseball)an ex-golf pro with a wooden hand named Chubbs, helps Happy gain money for his grandma because she is evicted from her house. That is the plot. In the movie, there is a cameo from Chris Farley, and even Bob Barker.

My whole family loved it, and all of my friends and I are constantly talking about it.But one thing about this movie is that it's almost like a trend-setter. Want to have a funny new saying? This movie is like an unflushed toilet full of them, and the great thing is, these can never be flushed. Instant classic lines such as \\"Jackass!\\", \\"You're gonna die clown!\\", \\"Now you will go to sleep, or I will put you to sleep.\\", and \\"Mista!

I loved Lee Hardy's honesty and matter-of-fact stance.The following sentences from p. 117 sum it all up, in my opinion:\\"When the virtue of hard work becomes the vice of workaholism, it is likely that an underlying spiritual problem needs to be addressed. The addiction to work as a source of affirmation and self-esteem needs to be broken by an encounter with a God of grace who can provide all that we need apart from our own efforts, thereby freeing us for a life in pursuit of the righteousness of his kingdom.\\"Excellent book!

Instead of admiration for the heroine, I felt aggravation. An abusive alcoholic for a husband, no way to make ends meet except the occasional contest win, for items that had no use to the family--Arthur Murray Dancing Shoes, for example. Barely able to feed the kids she already has, she eventually has 10. I know women lived differently in the 50's, still, most learned to drive a car! With so many little ones, it seems to me irresponsible to not be able to drive, esp. with all the emergencies in this very dysfuntional family.

Throughout those decades, America was apparently a proliferation of companies, getting people to buy their products by offering prizes for whoever could come up with the next line in a new jingle, or most accurately name a new product line.Over the course of several decades, Evelyn Ryan sent hundreds of entries to hundreds of contests -- and actually won huge prizes, including cars, European vacations, etc. -- which she traded for cash to support her huge family, since her husband was an unreliable alcoholic.It sounds kind of depressing, and really, it was...but Terry Ryan, who is the sixth of the 10 kids, has a really humorous writing style that lets readers focus on all the positive things about her growing-up years.

Suction seems to be better on our glass coffee table, but of course that's NOT where we need it!

Who was the Primary here: Morgan and Quinn or Storm and Wolfe?And if I have to wait to next summer for the book to end, will I even care?

There was not enough story for one couple, much less two. Even with that, none of the characters worked together-they just argued, and then made out, of course.2-inconsistencies-for supposedly modern, intelligent characters, the author has them doing implausible, immature actions. The biggest wrong move-the heroine-whose the exhibit curator, who says she'll do anything to protect the exhibit, but she immediately falls for the thief who plainly states he's going to ransack the exhibit?

Not only did it contain characters that were never developed (there is great potential), but a story line that was left dangling as well. I am a bit resentful about having purchased a book with no conclusion. The fact that it was a two part story should have been made obvious so that I could determine whether it was a reasonable purchase at the time. Better yet, why not just wait until the characters are developed and there is an ending and put it all in one book?At the end of the book I sat in the airport feeling unsatified and tricked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best read.","review":"Kay Hooper creates many good stories but this is not one of them.

Very different character for Andy Griffith, but very well played. Johnny Cash did an excellent job portraying the \\"Good\\" sheriff. He didn't miss a beat & also had a sense of humor. June Carter Cash played a very colorful character, didn't even recognize her at the beginning, but she did a remarkable job playing that role.

I loved it...it's a terrific movie for the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Any movie lover who is a fan of Andy Griffith or Johnny Cash should buy this movie for their library. Both actors are wonderful in these roles. Johnny is the good guy and Andy is the really, really, really bad guy. In our opinion this is one of the best TV movies ever made.

Rating is not to be trusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected pleasure","review":"This is a well done made-for-tv movie from the early 80's. The movie is faithful to the source material, namely a book of the same name. The story is a true tale of a man who was the king of a county in rural Georgia in the latee 1940's. The trial aspect of the film raises the question of whether a man can be tried for capital murder without a body. True, this is not bizarre in today's world but it was 50 years ago.The performances of both Andy Griffith and Johnny Cash are fun to watch. Andy Griffith plays against form as the amoral and ruthless John Wallace. No Andy Taylor and Opie here. Johnny Cash puts in a fine performance as Sheriff Lamar Potts, the hero of the story. Look for Earl Hindman, Wilson of \\"Home Improvement\\", to step out from behind the fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classy Look","review":"This sweater will dress up anything you wear it with.

Not for lack of trying, it's just all so predictable and stupid. Considering that this is not a B movie such as Evil Dead the actors suck, they don't fit the part. And could they have gotten an uglier person for the leading lady/main character? The whole premise as to why she would be cursed is just beyond moronic. \\"I beg you and you have shamed me\\"? WTF! So some creepy lady starts to make a scene and grabs your ankle... yeah I could see how calling for security would be an outrageous insult! And the fact that they even thought the whole loan extension thing was viable and understandable during our economic crisis is just stupid! Banks are now more that ever tightening thier belts.

I'm betting on the pigs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the Preview","review":"This movie was a waste of money. It is not scary at all, which from the preview was expected.

But after actually seeing the movie for myself, it is quite a let down. The humor you read about just isn't here, I did not laugh once during this movie. There are no memorable lines worth quoting as there are in Sam's other horror classics. And oh, the horror, of a goat and an old lady with no teeth! Are you kidding me. Also, if you are like me, you will see the twist at the end coming a mile away. The acting was ok but nothing memorable there either. Save your money and rent this one and then go out a buy Trick r Treat, it is everything this movie tries to be. Sorry Sam Raimi but you are no longer the king."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting crap","review":"This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. And I LOVE horror movies. It started out great...and i had high expectations. But very shortly, the main character showed herself to be unlikeable, stupid and two dimensional.

The leads are bland and the rest are forgettable. The villian is 1D at best. The ending is phoned in a mile away.

The CGI animation was terrible, and looked like a cheap video game. The acting was bad, and the slapstick material came off as forced and didn't even crack a smile out of me. The storyline was really weak too - I knew right from the beginning what was going to happen to her.

The first scene is so badly done I was very close to walking out of the theatre. Like many of sam raimi's movies they are ruined by his bad sense of humor. The girl in the movie gets cursed by this rediculous character (old witch lady) and then tries to get the curse lifted by a fortune teller. The old woman then goes on to puke on here and gum her to death. Sadly I'm not exagerrating.The plot line is boring. None of the characters you care about. Not just because the acting is bad its more because the characters motives are so genuinely lame that you can't understand where they are coming from or where they got their common sense. And the ending was just painful. Overrall I would say if you like sam raimi's movie like quick in the dead or evil dead then you might like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky Gross-Out Movie","review":"After reading all the rave reviews, I bought a copy of this DVD. It was a major disappointment. It's nothing but a sadistic (torture and animal murder) gross-out movie aimed at teenage boys.

I urge everyone to watch a classic Hammer film or something with genuine style - not this potboiler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 0 stars.....","review":"My husband and I both love Horror flicks. We've seen everything from the obscure (Freaks & The Audition) to the tried and true (Halloween, Black Christmas, etc) to a good gore fest (The Evil Dead, Hostel and most of the Saw movies). I could go on and on but alas I'm just here to talk about DMTH. About thirty minutes into the movie we realized that it was going to be bad. Really bad. It had alot of potential. Girl gets cursed by a Gypsy and now is tormented by a demon for three days until it will finally drag her into hell. However, I'm not sure where Raimi was trying to go. Comedy with gore perhaps? Maybe he should watch \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" so he knows how it's done. Look, I love gore when it meshes with the story but this was ridiculous. I felt like I was watching a movie made by a teenager. Wait, a teenager could have done alot better. And to top it off the acting was mediocre. Not a movie I would recommend if you want a good, scary, gory movie. Try \\"The Decent\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag Me to Hell Before I Have to See this Again!","review":"I'm probably being a bit harsh as I had high expectations, but this was very formulaic and consequently predictable movie. I don't think there was a single surprise in the whole movie.Worse, I can only guess at what the \\"horror\\" actually was. People miraculously turning up in a location doesn't qualify nor does extensive corpse play. On corpse play it is obvious that only one of the protagonists can actually do any acting and with the very fake \\"dummy\\" it was a little like the Brady Movie when the middle sister walks in with a blow up doll.The acting was quite good and the séance scene was the reminiscent of the old Raimi, but even here there was nothing to add to the genre.There are a lot of comments about the humor in the movie, but the only thing I was laughing at was how stupid I was to shell out for this movie.In short, spend your time on watching something else... Almost anything else...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Rent, Do Not Own","review":"As a fan of Raimi films and the horror genre, I was rather disappointed by this predictable film. The ending was easily seen when the 2nd sealed envelope was created. The gypsy woman was not set up properly as a sympathetic character. In fact, the main character was more victim than the gypsy witch, and the 'romance' seemed tacked on and lacked believable chemistry between the 2 actors. There were many spots where FFWD is needed just to skip to some action. The graphics (in the action/attack scenes) were decent, and the diner scene at least had a true 'moral' element.But this is best as a rental, not a full purchase. Or at least wait until a bargain bin sale. Especially given the paltry bonus features. I regret gambling the full DVD purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of Spit","review":"As a fanatic with so many versions of Evil Dead films that my family threatenedintervention, I looked forward to Drag Me to Hell.

It is paved with mucus.That's right. I won't say it again, though the movie did, ad nauseum. Yes, I said it. (I watched the unrated cut. The theatrical might have less. I didn't check.)The surprise trick ending was right out of those Victorian fireside tales. In other words, so fresh.It doesn't seem like I wanted to like this film, but I really, really did.Especially as I had bought it.Why 2 stars? Well, Alison Lohman did a good job, and looked like she was really put through it. The rest of the cast was good, too, in the minutes they wereonscreen. And I liked the seance."},{"rating":"1","title":"only good 30 minutes","review":"In the first thirty minutes the director really scares the viewers with a strange gypsy woman tormentinh a bank employee who denied her a loan. The viewers sense a kind of frightful atmosphere, the horror is based mainly in sounds in order to make you jump ou of your feet, and...that is all...After a scary scene in the garage parking, it looks like another person took the direction and the films becomes awkwardly ridiculous.If you want to scare, give credibility and seriousness to the plot.It worked this way with The Exorcist, The others, The Sixth Sense. Sam Raimi (or the producers) just spoiled a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever","review":"this movie started off good but then as the movie went on it got terrible and lame and you could tell it was fake i mean come on guys yall cant possibly think this movie was any good but hey i guess if you like it then you like but anyway i thought this movie was very terrible and not worth your time or money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave old ladies alone!","review":"If you are an actor/actress and are offered a role in such a movie, then it's a sign that your career is going down!In short, an old lady cast a spell on a bank employee who refuses to extend her another chance to keep her house. Yeah, there is surprising scenes of the old lady throwing up on different occasions and sucking on her chin after losing her dentures, so in short it's kind of disgusting not suspenseful.I suggest that you don't bug us old ladies, and most importantly don't use us in stupid movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Sam Raimi","review":"Now this is a good horror movie. Good story, great special effects, killer ending, plot twists, just good all around. You don't want to miss this this one. Why it got any 1 or 2 star ratings is beyond me. I loved it and felt uneasy several times, which is why I watch horror movies. The ending was a great set up for a second movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Raimi Style","review":"This is a fun movie to watch around Halloween time, it's not really very scary... it's kind of humorous like Evil Dead etc. The main trouble I had with this Blu-ray version was the fact that it came with a digital download disc that was only compatible with older Power PC Macs etc, so the code was not valid any longer.

The heroin in this movie doesn't really make you care about what happens to her if the movie was 30 min or 3 hours you wouldn't care if she got dragged to a chain gang let alone hell, in fact you wish she got dragged there sooner so you could leave this crapfest of a movie....

Very upset. Had to buy the movie off iTunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Stupid","review":"I love to be scared, I really do.But this movie was just silly, and stupid. The main character is so dumb that she is dumb beyone the normal stereotype of the female lead in a horror movie. If her acting wasn't bad enough, the stupid gags are even worse. For me the worst part was when we basically got a Looney Tunes gag thrown into the movie in the form of an anvil being suspended with a rope and pulley system and then dropped on the old gypsy lady's head. If that wasn't bad enough, then her eyes pop out of her head in the same cartoony effect that Wiley Coyote's do whenever a boulder/anvil drops on him in a Road Runner cartoon.This movie was not scary, and the writer relied too much on jump scares, which by the way I was able to call out every single one of them before they happened, and he also relied too much on vomit humor. Frankly he seemed to be more determined to gross his audience out rather than scare them.It was just stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Being a horror movie fan, just the fact that a producer took a chance with a new horror flick I give them some props. That's where the 1 star comes from. This movie was full of boring scenes, bad acting, and way over the top drama (even for a horror flick). You probably could have added some good nudity with Alison Lohman and gotten away with having at least a small reason to endure this picture. I made the awful mistake of buying this movie on Blu-Ray before I even saw it. I should've taken note from what my friends who are into the horror genre said. I was a sucker and thought the trailer was convincing enough that it couldn't have been that bad of a movie. Boy was I wrong. At least I got a good deal off Amazon, considering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Terrible Terrible","review":"This movie is not the least bit scary. The plot is ridiculous, relies on the same lame attempts at horror, and drags on and on. A talking goat? Not scary. A handkerchief that attacks a girl? Not scary. Maybe Sam Raimi was going for a kitchy horror movie that was meant to be funny- a cult classic? If he was, he only succeeded on the first part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of cliches including dead kitten","review":"After the \\"heroine\\" kills her kitten, I quit watching. At that point, I wanted the evil spirit to drag her to hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend. It was cheap so I figured I'd go ahead and throw it in my cart since she had it on her wishlist. A good excuse to cuddle up on the bed under the covers. The beginning of the movie was awesome. Scary. Really good. It had a great story, and the old gypsy lady was very well done. I was glued to the TV. But I must say, as the movie went on, it got worse. About half way, it took a turn for the worse and started a downward spiral. It started to get ridiculously stupid. By the end of the movie, I had lost all interest. I found myself getting up, wandering around, getting sodas and talking, mostly about how stupid the movie had gotten. It was really bad. Great beginning, not so great middle, and a crappy stupid ending. It was almost as if the original directors, producers and writers just got up and went on strike, leaving amateurs to just throw something together to get the movie finished. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite horror movies","review":"Be warned that if you are looking for an over the top scary experience or slash and gore horror file this is not that movie.

The first scene with the kid was pretty cool but after that it was just tedious and poorly done from top to bottom. Bad special effects, bad acting, not scary, and just a little bit funny from time to time.One scene that stands out as being particularly bad was when she gets attacked by the old lady in her car. Okay I understand that her manager asked her to take a file home to review it. It was A FILE. Why did she have the entire contents of her desk with her. OH thats right to try to make the scene funny by having her fight the lady off with her stapler.And anyone who didn't see how this was going to end the moment the car stopped short and all the envelopes hit the floor. send me your address so I can come to your home and hit you on the head with a tack hammer and put you out of your misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"stoopid s-t-oo-p-i-d","review":"seiously, why in the world is this junk so highly rated? i even LOVE cheesy horror and bad movies but this \\"movie\\" was overly predictable right down to the twist at the end...it doesnt even have a \\"great moment\\" in it.

It is true, u will jump off the seat twice or maybe more, but I garantee u will also laugh as loud as the very goat demon appears further in the movie...If u want to spent that kind of moment, jump and laugh, u most definitly watch this SamR\`s masterpiece. Enjoy it in company...ou and almost forgot, never loose any buttons from ur clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell.....","review":"I had high hopes for this movie from the very start. The retro shot back to 1968 to start the mood and the \\"myth\\" that surrounds the entire story (which has real potential if it wasn't so poorly acted). The acting is the major problem with this movie. I will admit, the ending was no shocker. I loved Justin Long in JEEPER'S CREEPERS, but in this he was as weak as he could be...nothing. The real problem lies with the lead...Alison Lohman, she is dreadful. You have absolutely no connection with her character. She is just going through the motions. No development, no empathy, no sympathy, no hatred, no nothing. She is one-dimensional and that is the real disaster of this movie. As I stated, I felt the story line had potential, with perhaps a bit more polishing of the script, but definitely with another lead actress in the role."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like horror mixed with slap stick comedy then this is for you.","review":"The bottom line is if you like horror mixed with slap stick comedy then you will probably really enjoy this film. If you like your horror movies to be more serious, then you may not like this one. I found it to be both scary and funny and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I hope this review helps you decide if this is the right movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Spoiler Alert*","review":"Raimi, you had me right up to the point she sacrificed the kitten. Until then, it was a fun little throw-back gem, and I was having a blast. But that little bit of nastiness blew the whole thing for me. Sorry. I may be a seasoned die-hard horror junkie, but even I have a soft spot for little kitties. Completely unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag me to Hell...or Anywhere to Stop Watching This...","review":"The comedy wasn't funny; the horror wasn't horrific. I'm stumped by those reviewers calling this \\"hard-boiled\\" horror. There is nothing remotely scary here. Over-the-top silly, yes (the gypsy in the parking garage scene), but frightening, no. I loved \\"The Evil Dead,\\" but found the two sequels insulting to the original. I know there are multitudes that love \\"Army of Darkness,\\" but it just never worked for me. As for \\"Hell,\\" there is one clever plot twist, but that's about it. I was gravely disappointed after reading good reviews. I'll stick with \\"American Werewolf...\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware !","review":"This review is short and not sweet,,**Spoiler** The lead character is a loser.She kills her kitten ...to appease a demonic spirit that later spits the kittens corpse out at her feet and laughs at her stupidity...I wanted her to die and thought this movie was perhaps an attempt to anger me personally..and although i knew this was not the case i was glad when the movie was over.. Instead of buying this movie buy Evil Dead ."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a retarded movie","review":"All I can say is thank god I didn't pay to see this movie. The movie was completely obvious from beginning to the end. i laughed through this entire movie. If this was supposed to be a horror they missed that genre completely. There were only a couple a parts that were actually fun to watch like when the dead Gypsy vomited in the main characters mouth.

And \\"gag\\" is an apt word of choice, as that's exactly what I did in at least a couple of particularly stomach wrenching scenes. @_@ The chances of me actually sitting through the entire movie are slim to none.Perhaps if I had the option to actually skip without seeing disgusting things, perhaps I'd be more charitable with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag me back in time right b4 I put this in the dvd player...","review":"...so I can stop myself from watching this junk! I have been waiting for some awesome new horror to come out. With Raimi in the mix I thought this was gonna be AWESOME! Well..........it was awesome....awesomely horrible!What a waste of time. These actors are pretty good ones but there acting in this movie was so wooden and 1 dimensional! The only cool thing about this movie was the LOOK of the old hag woman.

She said that someone she knew had to leave the theater because they couldn't handle how scary it was!Well,I didn't end up watching it until it premiered on television and I could not believe how horrible it was! It was so silly and cartoonish I was utterly shocked. The writer of this script,did they mean for it to be a horror-comedy? Probably not. I think it's just bad film-making.Quite a few of the scenes in the movie focused on these wild special effects that made me think of looney tunes cartoons. It needed way more intelligence to do it for me. The movie ended up being several times worse than I would have ever thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag Me to Hell","review":"I love Sam Raimi from the very first Evil Dead I saw when I was a teenager but this movie had not one scare in it at all....it was over the top gore and special effects that weren't the least bit scary or funny.

Unfortunately, it was a terrible blind rent. The movie itself had an interesting premise, but the execution came off as cheesy and forgettable. Most of the scare tactics involve some type of vomiting, or bugs. While the ending comes as unexpected, it does not make up for the rest of the 2 hours of my life that was wasted watching it. Please, look elsewhere if you're looking to be scared, and reserve this movie for a laugh with some drunk friends. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because I felt pity for the main actress, who wasn't entirely terrible. Justin Long came across as a Mac AD, with an iPhone and iMac on his desk, and a forgettable backstory.Boo"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hundred and Thirty Minutes of Hell","review":"I'm trying to think of something that was good about this movie. Nothing comes to mind. It wasn't scary...wasn't funny...and the acting was terrible. Neither lead character had any personality. The psychic had a fake accent and dressed like he just came from The Gap.The story line was unoriginal and silly. The director is even too lazy to bother figuring out the different between a Lamia and Moloch.How somebody can screw something up this bad with a 30 million dollar budget it beyond me. The numerous four and five star reviews are even more puzzling.So boring. I'd recommend just re-watching one of the Evil Dead movies and skip this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor movie choice","review":"A waste of time and money.

Sometimes a great ending is enough to cause me to revisit a movie, and in this case, I'm glad I did! A added this to the cart just so I could get my total to twenty-five bucks and receive free shipping. The second viewing of this film really did it for me though, and now I can't remember why I didn't enjoy this movie in the first place. Perhaps I hadn't seen any of the Evil Dead films at that point (a shame I know). I probably didn't understand the mix of fear and humor as I sat in that theater with my friend (who also didn't like it).

Sam Raimi directed that one and he returns to his horror roots with Drag me to hell. Alison Lohman is an assistant manager at a bank. She is forced to repossess the house of a woman who happens to be a gypsy. The gypsy goes and puts a curse on her.One of my favorite genre is horror and I can say I have seen hundreds of horror films. This movie will satisfy most horror film buffs as well as film lovers. The action is fast, the scary scenes are heart stopping and there is ample comedy. Four stars 10/10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"CURSES","review":"Horror fans will not be disappointed. Especially if you view the \\"unrated\\" version. This is a very effective horror film. A female loan officer ( Christine Brown ) at a bank is cursed by a disposessed old gypsy woman when the loan officer refuses an extention on her mortgage. What ensues is a desperate race against time as Christine tries to stop the course of the gypsy's curse. She has three days to try to stop it, before she is \\"dragged to hell\\" for eternity. She is attacked viciously by a shadowy demonic figure, and suffers some very nasty afflictions, including facing horrible ghostly transfigurations of the gypsy woman. The acting is surprisingly excellent and you are drawn into the nightmare by the believable terror created by the actors. This will keep you on the edge of your seat. It also has an appropriately horrific ending..., though some people may wish the ending was different..., it fits well with the overall theme of the movie.- Mike Silverman"},{"rating":"1","title":"As Expected - Very Bad","review":"This movie is too long for a simple story plot about two rival triad groups trying to take revenage of each other. Basically, each move and each plot is so predictable and too much fighting action that was not even needed for the scene.Also the part about HK prison, it is not even anything close to the HK prison condition. The movie is giving people wrong impression that HK prison condition is so brutal and inhuman, esp, the part when Jet was hung by his leg and the prison guards were to hit him to punish him for fighting with the guards. The prison environment in this film would give viewers misconception that HK prison is dirty, not hygenic, or crowded. But, these are not true at all.All in all, this is one of the worst on DVD i have seen so far, and not really recommend you to watch at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"romeo must die","review":"I purchased this movie only because I'm an admirer of Jet Li's ability to incorporate his martial arts skills into any genre of movie.

When I started to watch this film, i was going to watching it as if i've never seen a Jet Li film before. But my opinion eneded up the same. It was a bad movie, with bad acting and average action sequences. It was just a macho movie, with no point. If you want a martial arts film with all the stunts done without wires and where it's fun and exciting, get a Jackie Chan flick (although his recent couple of films have had obvious wire stunts in them, he is 50 yoou know).

Some martial arts action with a semi-decent story. Instead I was so bored, especially with the ridiculous fight scenes (defying the laws of physics and common sense) and awful dialogue and story.This movie should be listed as fantasy.

The fight scenes lack excitement, and the wirework doesn't help, either. Then there's the so-called romance, which probably should have been excised completely because no heat is generated between Jet Li and Aaliyah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of this World !!!!!!","review":"\\" Romeo must die \\" is a fabulous movie , it's direction and the story line up is just great !!!!!!. i would recommend all action movie fan to definitely watch it, it's not worth missing.

Martial arts star Li's English-language starring debut has toned down the brutality to fashion a movie of slightly broader appeal. OK but overelaborate and overlong. Directorial debut for renowned cinematographer Bartkowiak. Panavision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung Fu!","review":"Thats all i have to say.

Its in the hands of viewers to refuse being entertaiend by a low quality script and direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Overrated","review":"This Movie does Jet Li no justice. Romeo Must Die tries so hard to dazzle the viewer with special effects that it forgets who its core audience is...Martial Arts Fans! The plot and screenplay are so predictable that you know who the traitor is from the very beginning. But the worst crime is the lack of serious Martial artistry from Jet Li. This movie needed less elements from the Matrix and more from Fist of Legend. Jet Li is all about Kung Fu mastery, Romeo Must Die is all about Matrix mockery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romeo has died...........","review":"I just dont know what they was thinking in this one, I mean who is Romeo? what was his involvement with this movie? If I could rated this film for the fight scenes, it would be higher maybe. Jet Li is not the same Jet Li of Black Mask in this movie, now when co-star Aaliyah comes in the scenes a glow of lights lite up, then dim when absence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaliyah","review":"I brought this DVD because i'm an Aaliyah fan. And it's actually a very good movie. As noted by other reviewers Aaliyah & Jet Li chemistry was great. They both played there roles perfectly. It's action packed and funny. You won't get bored watching this movie, especially if you're a fan of Aaliyah or Jet Li. This DVD also has special features. I'll name a few: Two Aaliyah music videos (Which is awesome for Aaliyah fans), Behind the scene footage of Aaliyah filming \\"Try Again\\" music videos, & Behind the scene documentaries of the cast. If your an Aaliyah or Jet Li fan you should buy this DVD. If Aaliyah were still alive today i would of loved for her and Jet Li to have worked on more movies like this together, there own screen chemistry is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Version Of Romeo And Juliet","review":"A great Romeo and Juliet story, but I don't know why there's no kissing scene between Aaliyah and Jet. It doesn't make sense. Shouldn't you kiss your love interest? Anyway, I loved the father-daughter theme 'cause it reminded me of the relationship I have with my dad, but he wasn't shady. Romeo Must Die is a great film...except the snakes made me very uncomfortable and scared. So I looked away in some scenes. I still can't understand Aaliyah's fascination with them, but different strokes for different folks. One more thing, the landscape was very beautiful and the soundtrack was great. Overall, great actors and great acting so I recommend it. Without a kiss, I will not give this movie 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fulfilment not complete","review":"This was a good movie, however it does not show Jet Li's fuill capabilities. Jet Li's stlye is given a twist which is a great new turn and he is even funny in this movie. Many actors act as comic relief which is a new turn in the Jet Li legacy. One thing this movie has that most of his movies do not have is a true, down to earth, plot. I recommend seeing this movie once. If you like it as much as I did you should buy it. Note: Vermont is a terrible substitute for Oakland."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different martial arts movie","review":"Han Sing is a former Hong Kong cop now living in Oakland. He shares an attraction to Trish, a mob bosses daughter. Even though they are from rival families, Han and Trish, become very close and try to uncover the truth behind the blood feud.This is a pretty good martial arts movie. As usual, Jet Li kicks everybody's butt. He's the only decent actor in this movie, and he's not that great. The intensity and compelling story keep you interested. Romeo Must Die is pretty good, but maybe not worth owning. I do think it's worth seeing once. So I recommend that you rent it. You may really enjoy it and decide to buy it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's on wires!","review":"Wow! Jet Li!

The war between these family's is mainly due to the control of the dockyard which is owened half by the blacks and half by the chinese . We can also see a emotional backing to it where Jet Li proves his love to his brother by finding his kileer's. So very much worth seeing movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Americanized Jet Li","review":"Jet Li is as charismatic as ever, but the only other actor with any presence at all is Delroy Lindo. The story tries to mix in a football ownership angle which comes off as simply silly. Very innovative shots of the interior of a person's body as a devastating blow hits are neat, but serve no real purpose. Without Jet Li, this film wouldn't be worth anyone's time. ... ."},{"rating":"2","title":"JET LI's BEST MOVIE!","review":"This movie was great!

That's the way the book starts. I assume there must have been some difficulty finding enough information because while that's the way the book starts, there seems to be a lot of \\"filler\\" material elsewhere.The middle section of the book provides a teaching on angels in the Bible, which is appropriate. This is common on other books I've read on this subject. The weakest part is the final section, which takes about good deeds people have done, equating them with \\"angels\\" in a very loose translation of the word, i.e., that they are messengers of God.In terms of content, only the first section really gives instances of mysterious, possible angel sightings in modern times.

However, the first half is far more brilliant than the second. The prose is very challenging (non veterans will need to bring out the collegiate dictionary for this one) but at the critical gain of early 20th Century elegance...A downfall however is that the novel somehow seems to end incredibly hastly.

One of the previous reviewers said it tastes \\"grainy\\" and that is the perfect word to use. Not even my 3 year old chocoholic would touch these after one bite!

I got them on a whim, suspecting one of my children may have a problem with gluten. Even if he tests ok, I will buy these again, I actually prefer in some ways to the Duncan Hines brand I normally use. My son has eaten them up!

It's a shame this book didn't appear years ago to save people a lot of wasted effort. Of course, nothing in here is rocket science. But there is so much confusion in the weight-loss world and people seem to only be able to focus on one thing at a time (low-carb is only the latest fad sweeping the country -- which, by the way, this book proves is bound to fail, just as low-fat failed before it) This book shows you the right thing to focus on, why, and how to do it.

If you're a fan of the teenage thrillers he's so famous for, this book doesn't even come close to that genre. If you're a fan of The Shack, than this book may enlighten you. That is not to say that this is a \\"Christian\\" story but more of a philisophical fable that weaves a little mysticism, a little religion and a whole lot of spirituality all into one.This book always picks me up and I honestly love it more each time I read it.

That's probably because this book is written in the first person narrative.Loads of people, however, seemed to have enjoyed it - if the Amazon rating is anything to go by.

The characters are well drawn (although they are typical of the genre - Pre-WWI, English upper class, and \\"foreign\\" royalty), the pace is swift, and the plot is both simple and ingenious. Although I consider myself savvy when it comes to \\"thrillers\\", Oppenheim kept me in great suspense until the very last page. In subsequent years, I have read as many of Oppenheim's books and stories as I can get my hands on - about a dozen, obtained from used book stores - (he wrote hundreds - practically all of which are out of print), and these certainly vary in quality, but I can state, unequivocally, that The Great Impersonation is his best, and, in fact, one of the best stories of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for a Jolly Good Read?","review":"This is storytelling at its peak. Although a rather just-state-the-facts author, Oppenheim created a delightful story by doing just that: weaving facts into a web that cannot be deciphered until the final chapter.

This is a great read for anyone who likes their classics served with a twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a twist!","review":"This story kept me enthralled from beginning to end. The first chapters with their ruthless tale of chance meetings in the African wild, to the final chapters of British decadence, the plot moved along at a good clip. Though a seemingly endless number of characters were introduced, the story was never unclear. There were at least 3 love stories, agents and double agents and triple agents, ghost stories, madness, mysterious disappearances, and the big bad backdrop of World War I - all of this happening at once, leading me to ask, \\"How on EARTH will he finish this?\\" I couldn't wait to find out how all of the many moving pieces would eventually come together, and I was not disappointed. Easily one of the most unexpected last-second twists ever. Each strand of the story was polished off in grand style.

I do not mind reading for light entertainment, but there were too many highly improbable threads, not enough plot, nor full fledged characters facing real moral conflicts. It is worse than modern pulp fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"This book has a lot of nice patterns and designs. It gives examples of a variety of woods and finishes.

I'm a sucker for Duets, and for Duets set in Nowhere Texas specifically. Nowhere, Texas, you see, is the setting for both this volume and \\"Designer Genes/Two for One!\\" by the same authors.This volume gives me everything I'm looking for in a Duets volume. The relationships are developed well, but the impediments to \\"true love\\" don't involve really painful issues that would detract from the general \\"romantic comedy\\" flavor. Both the main characters and the secondary characters are appealing and just quirky enough to provide a number of hilarious situations.This particular volume doesn't provide a lot of real emotional depth to off-set all the silliness. But that kind of depth is a rare thing indeed in a romantic comedy, and probably not what you're looking for in a Duets volume anyway.

You might as well take a work of DaVinci or Rembrandt and apply some magic markers to it to bring it more up to date and acceptable for today's audiences.The redeeming songs which earned this CD two stars from me instead of one included the ever-melodic \\"Sweet Little Jesus Boy\\" by Chris Willis and the breath of fresh air by Sandi Patty, \\"Child of Peace,\\" which features Bach's \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring.\\"Although I've always been a huge fan of contemporary Christian music, I will be staying away from most CCM Christmas albums in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had better!!","review":"I bought this cd because there were a few songs on there that i liked.

This book was a great achievement in that it was really the first work of American nature writing, and Bartram made a lot of great botanical discoveries during his journeys through the American Southeast. But his language is excruciatingly tedious. He uses ten pages to express what probably could be said in a single paragraph, and he often will offer two choices or options, when one would suffice: \\"We encamped on a high cliff or bluff...\\" And although he makes some interesting observations about the Cherokees, Creeks, and Seminoles, his views are often distressingly unenlightened or idealized.

Meanwhile, Granny begins to question her sanity and to feel her own mortality. Without giving too much away, the novel builds suspense to a level not yet seen in the Discworld series. To further complicate matters, Granny also finds herself face to face with a person from her past...a name which will be very familiar to avid Pratchett readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the Dark Side of Faerie","review":"Methinks Pratchett was one of the first fantasy authors of this decade to explode the stereotype of the friendly elf (the only other treatment I've seen on this theme is Greg Bear's \\"Songs of Earth and Power\\", and that much darker and more serious in tone.) This novel is the beginning of Pratchett's turn into dark humor, which seems to get darker all the time. If you've been bothered by his later novels, I slightly recommend this one-but keep in mind this is the beginning of the crossover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never quite what you expected","review":"Pratchett's Discworld continues in fine style. It combines his signature combination of incredible characters, groanable puns, wild adventure and maybe, just maybe a little serious reflection. I'm not sure that Pratchett would admit to that last, though.And no, no one is quite what you expected. There's the king, elevated from his former role as jester (or was he?). The queen is shy, uncertain, and naive (or is she?). The witches' contest of power ends when one looks away (or does it?). The elves are wondrous and glamorous - or are they?The serious side flirts with the many-worlds ideas from physics, serious science sure to warm the soul of any comedic writer. It also raises some symbols of a long-gone warrior queen, and leaves with some pointed observations on symbols being what you let them. Mostly, though, it's just more of Pratchett's laugh-out-loud history of a world that's even more ridiculous than our own - or is it?//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elves by any other name","review":"Nanny, Granny, and Magrat deal with an infestation of elves, and a wedding, in great style.

(And Nanny Ogg--the Hedgehog's Song is one of those underrated literary classics of all time.) Wonderful meeting them again in Lords and Ladies--do yourself a favour, pick this one up even though it's considerably darker, and angrier, than Pratchett's usual stuff. I read Lords and Ladies around the same time I browsed through a short story by David Brin. Brin's story speculated, like Pratchett, that fairies were actually nasty, inhuman creatures--pushing the thesis to its logical conclusion, he postulated that fairies were actually the original aliens. Brin's almost certainly the more rigorous thinker; but Pratchett has a helluva lot more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern Satyr Play","review":"Terry Pratchett's books seem to function like a satyr play at the end of a day of tragedies - they poke not too subtle fun at the themes and concerns which lie deep in the psyche.This may seem a bold claim, but there has to be some reason for popularity of the discworld books.In this one, \\"Lords and Ladies\\", Shakespeare's fairies from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' are combined with Tolkein's elves to create a sort of negative beautiful people - not too unlike some of the interpretations given to the darker side of the Shakespeare original.This has a logic behind it which, when you throw in the stable discworld characters, give it a harsh flavouring of socialism (or perhaps peasantism?) and let loose Mr Pratchett's wicked play on words, produces an energetic romp guaranteed to tickle not only the intellect but also the funny bone.You can enjoy the book without knowing the Shakespeare, but you'd miss a lot if you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this Discworld book!","review":"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. Lords and Ladies is #14.]Unlike some of the Discworld books to this point, Lords and Ladies really gripped me from the beginning. I liked the fairly unique take on elves and inter-species relations on Discworld. As always, I loved the character interactions and dialogue, especially when any witch was involved. I found Lords and Ladies to be highly engaging and very difficult to put down, and the deep development of Granny Weatherwax's character cements her as one of my favorite fantasy characters. Definitely one of my favorites so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of his best","review":"I found this Discworld adventure a little disjointed.Many of Pratchett's others -- in particular, WYRD SISTERS and MEN AT ARMS -- grew, sentence by sentence, chuckle by chuckle, into a delightful read.

If George Gilder's thesis, that \\"most welfare programs only serve to keep the poor in poverty as victims of welfare dependency,\\" is correct, then why aren't American corporations wallowing in poverty? Major business corporations receive literally billions in subsidies from American taxpayers; i.e., corporate welfare, yet they only get wealthier. If Gilder's thesis is correct, \\"dependent\\" companies that live off government contracts and subsidies should be filling for bankruptcy at this very moment. They aren't of course, and the reason is because they are wallowing in corporate welfare subsidies that keep their inefficient businesses afloat.George Gilder claims to be in favor of supply side, \\"trickle down\\" economics, but in truth that's a misnomer. What he really argues for is \\"trickle up\\" economics; that is, take money from the poor and give it to the rich.Take my word for it, this is a bad book with a flawed thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it.","review":"This book isn't too bad overall, but don't go getting any silly ideas like you are going to be able to build this thing for anything like a hundred pounds (about a hundred and fifty US dollars), because it isn't going to happen.

The amount of money you would end up spending on it, you would be better off buying a second hand one, as I doubt you will learn much from this book that you didn't already know. So overall, I'm not sure if it's worth bothering with, especially when the author's other book : \\"Build you own sports car for as little as 250 and race it\\" is available.

This is a small meat grinder, but I am not butchering a side of beef, I just want to grind 2 or 3 pounds of meat at a time. I ground two pounds of tough pork shoulder in about 5 minutes. The first time you use it, throw away the first pound of meat you grind, regardless of how well you think you've cleaned the parts.

They give birth to live young (the fry), who then fall to the bottom. The divider is in case you have two pregnant fish. There are slats on the sides for water flow, and there's even a lid so fish won't jump in or out.

The handle is small and very difficult to get ahold off. The V shape insert gets wedged in and I could not remove it. Instead of being able to lift the V with the mom out, I had to dump the female out then use a knife to get the insert out, defeating the whole purpose.

I found her book frequently offensive and vulgar. Her \\"open\\" discussion of sexual perversion and other delights is right up-to-the moment, but trendiness is no indicator of literary value. Her witty ramblings are as appealing, and about as nutritional, as cotton candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medicine for your hair","review":"I use this two times a week and can't complain at how wonderful my hair is looking.

His in-depth review of the linkages between Pan-Arabism and the rise of the Ba'ath party provide an excellent context for the rise of the Saddam Regime. His descriptions of the horrors of Saddam's world are gripping. The only limitation of this book is that it was written years before the fall of Baghdad-it would be fascinating to see what his view of Iraqi society in 2011 is."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay...but","review":"I am a backyard DIY mechanic. Also, like many, I am frugal and budget conscious. So I discovered that I required an oil pressure gauge. Searching thru Amazon I came up with this one and purchased it. The assortment of fittings is fine. The hose is also very good. The actual gauge bodies appear chintzy. They are lightweight stamped steel and by holding them and looking at them, I really wonder how accurate they will prove to be. I suppose that for \\"ballpark\\" pressure readings these will be satisfactory. I would not consider this set to be \\"professional\\" quality by any means. (Not that I expected a high class precision thing.) If I were to do it all over again, knowing what I know now, I woulda, shoulda, coulda, for a few dollars more, purchased something more substantial with respect to the confidence in the tester's accuracy. I have no way of testing or calibrating these gauges.

I'm not even sure it IS music! These short, unoriginal tracks of nonsensical lyrics do not \\"honor\\" the cool '60s style as its liner notes would have you believe...they make a mockery of them! I'd been interested in hearing the CD after running across the cute video of \\"Pull Shapes\\" on European MTV. The video was well done, the girls are cute and the song was catchy. Unfortunately, that particular number is the only moderately good one on the entire album. The childish rhymes and overall lyric inanity particularly enfuriated me. There's talent lying in there somewhere underneath all the gimmicks, but you can hardly tell from this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 60's style pop from the UK","review":"Well, the title of this review pretty much says it all: Perfect pop songs from a UK band who started out with a string of singles, culiminating in this full length release. My favorite song right now is \\"Your Kisses Are Wasted On Me,\\" but \\"We Are The Pipettes,\\" \\"Dirty Mind\\" and \\"Pull Shapes\\" are pretty great, too. In fact, this whole album is pretty solid.

This cd is so addictive, once it ends I play it again... and again!As for the music, there's a definite Spector influence, but also the Shangri-Las as well, especially with songs like \\"Why Did You Stay\\", \\"Your Kisses Are Wasted On Me\\" and \\"It Hurts to See You Dance so Well\\".

The intiates in the various houses of worship are secretive about thier specific rituals. Because the \\"Seven Powers of Africa,\\" are well known in Cuba outside of the Lukumi devotees, the music is offered as a type of ethnomusicology recording for outsiders.If you are working with a specific Orisha in front of your Altar put this CD on and chant with the sacred drummers.

It is like a Gospel record for a Baptist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for an \\"Idiots\\" book","review":"\\"Idiots Spanish\\" is disappointing on the scale of \\"Idiots\\" books. I've purchased and read several of their series for research at work and all have proven very helpful, but this one falls short of being fun, interactive, or relevant information. The teaching methodology used in this book is useless. It's more of a reference-type book than a book you could use to learn the language.My recommendation: skip this \\"Idiots\\" book and go with a combination of Pimsleur's Spanish tapes/cds to learn the spoken and \\"Practical Spanish Grammar\\" to learn the written.Buenas suerte!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs an editor!","review":"I am trying to learn Spanish and this book is helping to familiarize me with all aspect of the language, however I am finding so many mis- prints and wrong answers in the answer key that it is making me doubt everything else I am trying to learn.

I bought this book thinking it would be a good introductory primer to the language - it is, only if you know some sentence structure already and are familiar with the language to some extent.It is also focused on the traveller, going in depth into phrases for hotels, airplanes and transportation. When I tried to look up the word \\"dog\\", it wasn't there. Not even \\"animal\\" or \\"pet\\" is listed in the index.I'm going to set this book aside for when I'm more familiar with the language and want a quick primer for travelling--and get something else to really teach me spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed-down text","review":"I bought this book to supplement a set of CD's for learning Spanish. I was dissapointed in the way the book was layed out--not quite a dictionary, not quite a learning text. It has been very difficult for me to find references to particular parts of laguage, especially specific words and phrases--it was difficult to find different ways to say 'please' and 'thank you'! It looks like I made a bad choice in a supplemental book. The Idiot's guide, I suppose, is meant to be used starting at the front cover and moving to the back. It may be a good teaching tool when used this way, but has been a very dissapointing reference for me in my efforts to learn a little Spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with mistakes","review":"I don't know how this book made it to the printer's with so many mistakes. I'm currently in Chapter 20 and estimate that there's been at least 25 errors including the text and answer guide!Every time there's an error, I spend 10 minutes trying to understand where I'm off-track. The errors aren't typos, but just plain wrong. It's very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful only for TRUE idiots","review":"As a sometimes Spanish teacher, I was stunned when a student brought me this book and then couldn't figure out why they hadn't learned Spanish. Most of the information in the title is so basic it could be found anywhere, the meat of grammar and other important concepts is concealed in outright silliness, and the book strikes me as being incomplete, even in what it covers. If you want to learn Spanish, spend the money on a REAL textbook. It may not have the cutesy cartoons and the inane humor, but it will certainly have more substantial information for the serious learner of the Spanish language."},{"rating":"1","title":"But I want to learn to speak spanish!","review":"This book lacks any method for learning spanish. If you want a book of words for certain situations in spanish it is fine. If you have a photographic memory this is the book for you. If you read it once and remember it forever here you go.This reminds me of the typical style that you get in public schools. The author of the book is a below average teacher that lacks any real structure or method, just shows up and writes lists of words on the black board. She seems like a nice person and means well but should study how people learn a foriegn language. No one could ever learn spanish from scratch from this methodless aproach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appropriately titled","review":"I considered buying this book, but was apalled when I glanced at the section which claims that each syllable in a Spanish word has equal stress, unless there is an accent. Everyone who has ever studied Spanish for more than two days knows that this is incorrect. In fact, the rules are simple: if the word ends in a vowel or in an \\"n\\" or an \\"s\\", the accent is on the next to the last syllable. Otherwise, it's on the last syllable. If these rules are not followed, then an accent is required over the accented syllable. Or am I studying some other language..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had this when I was in Spanish Class","review":"I took Spanish all 4 years of high school, and although I could read and write certain topics in spanish, I really couldn't converse in spanish at a good speed.

It's very disorganized and confusing. One of the major failings is that, instead of following a step-by-step progression, the author has come up with what can only be described as a hodge-podge. Material that should be covered in later chapters appears in the early ones.Also, it would be very helpful if vocabulary words included examples of the words (especially verb conjugations) as used in complete sentences, with both English and Spanish translations. Unfortunately, this is not the case.In short, if one is a beginner to Spanish language study, this book is probably only going to discourage the reader. It's certainly had that effect on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little book is a must-have!","review":"Whether you're a seasoned pro or a fledgling writer, this little book is a must-have! It steps the reader though the writing process, start to finish, in a concise, straightforward manner. It offers suggestions for identifying and solving many writing challenges including the \\"dreaded blank page.\\" It even warns the reader of some pitfalls to be avoided.

It holds a limit of larger sized, hold-over trout very well without becoming crowded or too full. The ONLY thing I have aproblem with is that the stay-open hinges are made of plastic and can break. That happened on my last over-sized creel (don't remember who the manufacturer was on that one) so that's why I bought this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"May contain lead","review":"So I wanted a cheap creel in case I decide to not release something I catch (a rarity). Well careful what you wish for, because for less than $15.00 I got this decently constructed creel which was of higher quality than I expected, but there is a caveat on the tag that says it may contain lead. This is somewhat troubling because, now I'm not sure if this is something I should keep, due to issues of lead in trout streams. I'm sure the minor amount of lead in this very light creel is negligible, but I would have appreciated a little blurb on the product description about its leaden construction. I'll probably hang on to it until I find something better (and lead-free)."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy, and I will tell!","review":"The models on the cover are so NOT the characters I picture in the book! arg!

That is my huge complaint with this story and I don't think that part was needed for the story AT ALL.Now that my rant on those two details is over I can tell you what I really think: Kiss and tell is a flat sexy fabulous book. Jake is so pure raw essence of man... I could swoon just thinking about it. Marnie (our heroine) is strong but very female. It's a pure fantasy- sexy stranger, danger, trapped in the remote wilderness.

The overly macho, tortured soul of a hero is surly and mean. But somehow, the worst cuss word Big, Bad Jake can come up with is \\"Judas\\" - and he says it ALL the time. He sees the heroine as a dumb blond - which she is. Marnie is more yappy than her dog, Duchess. Even Duchess is over written. \\"Duchess, Go find the stick of dynamite and bury it!\\" \\"Woof.\\" Okay, that didn't really happen, but it might as well have. The dog should have had reading glasses and a metal of honor it was so smart and brave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gruff hero","review":"This is my first book to try from Cherry Adair and I really enjoyed it. Right from the beginning, the sexual chemistry and tension between Jake and Marnie is tangible, hot and to the point, as they banter back and forth.Jake is the type of hero I love most: tall, dark and handsome, gruff, abrasive, even a little rude. It's always this gruff hero-type who turns into a total Teddy bear for the heroine. That is exactly Jake's transformation.He tries to resist Marnie, who is his total opposite; she's quick to show emotion, whether laughter or desire, easy-going, and exuberant. Jake tries to maintain his hard, heartless demeanor, but Marnie steadily chips away at it.This tug and pull was sexy and so easy to read. Loved it! Also loved the sweet HEA at the end.I definitely plan to check out the rest of the series. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy adventure and alpha male lead","review":"Although she has a fragile heart condition, the female lead Marnie is adorably feisty, adventurous, and modern. Not only does she have to convince the distrusting Jake to trust her, she has to seduce him into bed. He fights the attraction but she's determined and disarming in her approach. The man (a veteran warrior and killer) never stands a chance. The resulting sexual tension is hot and titillating. The deadly situations with lots of bad boys on the prowl, super sleek technology, relentless rain and storms, a hidden lair with a king size bed--everything a reader needs to cozy up and close out the world. Romantic, exciting escapism at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT GREAT!!","review":"I was greatly disappointed in this book. I thought it was BORING!!

You don't get the feeling that a professional wrote the book. Phrases like \\"Now they were rolling on the ground\\" don't impress me.Secondly, the heroine seemed extremely helpless and useless. She did absolutely nothing but watch the camera screens and shout at Jake. I found that it was extremely ennoying and also childish.The action wasn't fast paced, like many reviews claim it to be and the story kind of sucked!If you are familiar with romantic suspense by authors like Linda Howard, Elizabeth Lowell and Sandra Brown (to name a few), I don't think you'll like this book.All in all, one of the worst books I've read so far.But hey!

The writing was stilted and the characterizations were shallow. Many pivotal actions taken by the characters seem to occur for no reason other than the writer needing them to happen in order to advance the plot. I don't know much about this author, but I'm guessing that she's inexperienced. Maybe when she gets a few more books under her belt she'll be worth reading. Until then, I'll stick to Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Sandra Brown, Iris Johansen, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"More! More! More!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Cherry Adair has made it to the top of my list of favourite authors. I read and loved The Mercenary a few years ago but lost track of Ms. Adair. So when I picked up Kiss and Tell by chance and fell in love with the hero. I recognized her style immediately. While, Marnie is a strong, determined and sensual woman; Jake is a tough guy with a soft spot buried under years of isolation and lonliness. I love all that restraint and sexual tension.HOT!

But if you like Linda Howard, you will like Cherry Adair. The writing is crisp, the dialog is fun and other than a happy ending, you can't tell what will happen next. Jake's a stud, I wouldn't mind meeting a on lonely mountain and Marnie is just plain fun.

While I usually find Le Carre's character development to be compelling, and his books hard to put down, I had great difficulty getting through the middle of this one.

I was unable to relate or have any feeling for any of these characters except for one of distaste, and struggled to make it through this book.

Le Carre plays the emotions of his characters and his readers like a Stradivarius, he attacked social taboos, and gave me much food for thought.I've gone on and enjoyed thousands of books; and every other Le Carre I've read.

For some reason, I decided to watch all three in order again (these were the first DVD's I ever Had!) to pass the time.The first two were light, funny, and silly movies, which I enjoyed very much. Then I got to the third one, which was actually my former favorite movie, and I really saw what people had been dissapointed in in this film! The whole mood of the story was very dramatic and depressing! This is NOTHING like the usual Tenchi Fun and Laugther! Although I did laugh a couple times during this movie, it was sad to see Tenchi this way, ending on such a sour note! I'd really wish they'd make a fourth one, OLD-Tenchi style to end it RIGHT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tenchi Movie :-P","review":"This was the worst Tenchi Movie and the worst part of all of the tenchi series!!!!!!

This weak plot could of course be saved if it came with Tenchi's standard fight scenes and jokes but these are replaced with a love story that does not entertain. Overall this is even more disapointing then Tenchi in Tokyo, hopefully the new Galaxy Police TV show and 3rd Tenchi OAV will be more entertaining. (This is a poor close for the original Tenchi TV show)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touches the heart","review":"Though what I'm about to say is pretty much a cliche, I feel I must say it. Tenchi Muyo in Love 2 is the best of the lot. Needless to say this movie lacks the comedic and action styles that we have come to know about Tenchi. I think we're better off in this case. After watching this movie for the first time, I was overcome with a feeling of emotion that no other anime movie (or live-action for that matter) has been able to instill in me.To reinforce the emotional and dramatic tones, the music is a great accompanyment to the movie. In fact I enjoyed it very much to the point that I bought a copy of the soundtrack (e-mail me if you wish to know the site). The piano in concordance with traditional Japanese style music is a great combonation. It has the ability to stir thought into the viewers.In short, I highly recommend this movie to all fans of anime. I know I will treasure it forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great animated vision...a must for every anime collection","review":"When Pioneer releases this again, you should get it. It's great! This was my second Tenchi DVD purchase; the first was the Tenchi Muyo OAV DVD boxed set. I'm a true fan of anime and tape every Toonami episode of Tenchi and Gundam Wing. With the bar already set by the OAVs, the Tenchi movie didn't disappoint. The quality of the animation is better than I'd hoped, and the 5.1 digital sound isn't bad either. From an objective standpoint, the DVD has 5.1 audio in both English and Japanese. I prefer the Japanese, as this is the format I grew up with. The colors and contrast really make the scenes pleasing to the eye and a joy to watch. I recommend a 24\\" or larger screen size, as the DVD is in widescreen format."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not the Tenchi Everyone Knows and Loves","review":"It was the reviews of this movie that made me want to see it. So my husband bought me the DVD for Christmas. I won't mention any spoilers, just that I really liked this movie. I found the story sweet yet sad. I think I remember tears coming to my eyes. The music fit the story well and was beautiful in it's own right. I think I'd love to have the soundtrack. The animation was slightly different from the series and the first Tenchi in Love movie that I had seen, but I will admit I liked the way Tenchi was drawn. If you're used to the voices from the dubs, I suggest watching the subtitled version, the voices are less annoying. All together it was a good movie. I'm definitely glad my husband bought it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Tenchi, sorta","review":"The same old charaters we all love, but none of the action.

I found this a complete dissapointment and the majority of my friends agreed. I don't care about the fact that it's serious, it just isn't Tenchi at all. It's the Haruna story with the Tenchi cast making a few appearences and someone named Tenchi around who's really a paper bag.

This was not a Tenchi movie, it only had the charactors from Tenchi in it. The plot was so slow, and the whole movie was very depressing, I will probaly never watch this movie again, even though I paid almost thirty dollars for it. It was so depressing that I had to immediatly watch another Tenchi episode just to get the bad taste of this movie out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"Oh Tenchi, poor poor Tenchi. What to say about Tenchi Forever? First off, I am absoloutely positive that the same people who brought the OVA series to life keeled over and were replaced by high animators who had no idea what the cast of Tenchi was supposed to look like! Second, even though the plot was semi-original many elements from the original Tenchi movie were reused. (Aka Tenchi disappearing with everyone there to help/look for him.) Haruna was okay, but I definetly could have done without the sex scenes. C'mon! Tenchi is supposed to be this wholesome guy whose stuck with all of these alien women and has the manners to accept them all for who they are and not to lay a finger on them! So...in conclusion, I advise anyone considering buying this movie to purchase the first two Tenchi movies before watching this one, so you can cleanse your mind of the memory of this shotty end to a great series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tenchi at the finest","review":"This movie was made to be the last installment of the Tenchi Muyo saga (not true, OVA 3 is in the works!!). Its beautifully done and Tenchi fans must have it. This movie goes with the Tenchi Universe TV show. I cant say enough on how good of a movie this is. At the conclusion we find out which lucky lady Tenchi loves. If you seen the hints from the TV show you should already know who she is. Its wonderful how they finally come together. The ending didn't show how and where this relationship was going to end up of course, but with a good clean imagination you can continue were they left off. So buy the movie it will leave you with a few tears in your eyes.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something not to be missed..","review":"Despite it's faults with the score, I think it really wrapped up everything. It's nice that everything was treated subtly. The reference to the first movie at the end was nice too (hint, hint) followed up by the nostalgic treatment of clips from the TV series.

It lacked the action seen in the first and second movies. This movie was like another bad soap opera which is not at all enjoyable.

This movie is a beautiful love story between an older Tenchi and a girl named Haruna. Tenchi has no knowledge of Ryoko and Aeka. At all.Well, except......no.....not giving things away.

They surely would not have stood for removing the Ten Commandments from the Courthouse in Alabama, and they would not have permitted the stifling of the teaching of religion in the class room that the liberal activists courts have shoved down our throats today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and inaccurate political propaganda","review":"This video is an attempt to spread a particular religious and political ideology, Christian Americanism--the idea that America was founded as and should remain a distinctively Christian nation. Its arguments consist of various quotations from the Founding Fathers, mostly taken out of context, and arguments and claims that don't hold up to logic, scrutiny, or further research. The video ignores any evidence contrary to its viewpoint. (Jefferson Bible, anyone? How about the writings of James Madison?) David Barton is neither a historian nor an educator; he is a political activist who runs a company dedicated to opposing the separation of church and state. There is no shortage of good, readable scholarship on the very important topic of religion and the founding of America--read the books and skip this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Foundations of American Government","review":"I bought this to show in my Civics class. It is very misleading. Instead of being about the more historical aspects of the Constitution and foundations of govt, it is about the seperation of church and state with a very slanted view toward religion. It is something I would never show to a class in a public school for fear of parental anger and being fired for potential lawsuit. I was very disappointed.

That will probably be remedied when the Wings box set comes out for Christmas. But even then someone will point out a missing song or two. I might as well mention 2 songs that i wish were on this-- Back On My Feet, a great rocker never released in the US, and On the Wings Of a Nightingale, a fabulous song given to the Everly Brothers and never even recorded by Paul. His demo of it is terrific. As with most of Paul's albums there is plenty here for everyone, he is at home in all styles of music. He has been my musical hero for the whole ride and this cd helps explain why."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCartneyspan","review":"This album has been promoted as the definitive Wings anthology/tribute set. If so, then why does nearly half the album consist of Paul McCartney solo work? (Here's a clue for you all, the Wings were Paul.) This would not be a bad thing if all the Wings hits were here. Many top 40 hits, B-sides (Great B-sides), and favorites are absent, including Getting Closer (top 20), Arrow Thru Me, Give Ireland Back To The Irish, Mary Had a Little Lamb, The Mess, and Sally G. Paul's most beautiful and carefully crafted song ever, Little Lamb Dragonfly, from the superb Meet the Beatles/Abbey Road hybrid album Red Rose Speedway, is also missing. This album is neither a very good Wings anthology nor an adequate substitute for the earlier hits album, All The Best, since some big hits like Ebony and Ivory are missing. Having said all that, most of these selections are among Paul's very best work and purchasing this album is almost like getting a Box Set's worth for the price of one CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MCCARTNEY BRINGS BACK SOME GOOD TIMES","review":"Paul McCartney brings back some good times with \\"Jet\\", \\"Silly Love Songs\\", \\"Let 'Em In\\", \\"Take It Away\\" and the list goes on.A man of full distinction with a career that definitely goes full circle.A very good compilation that gets (4) stars instead of (5) because he is missing other hits as \\"Ebony & Ivory\\", \\"Say Say Say\\", \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\", and others.Still a great collection for the Beatle-esque/Wing afficianado. Paul McCartney ranks up there as one of the best pop writer/singers of all time, and to succeed after the Beatles with his band Wings with hits like \\"My Love\\", \\"Jet\\", \\"Band On the Run\\", etc. is a feat all its own.A very good collection that brings back very good music of what pop music once was and should still be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still waiting for a true best of..","review":"Paul,Paul,Paul....Why is it so hard for you to make a perfect greatest hits package?

There are some bad selections (not to say they are bad songs) on the History side (ie: Man We Was Lonely, Heart of the Country, Girlfriend, Waterfalls, Bip Bop medley, No More Lonely Nights again, and Too Many People in my opinion). I think many of these were included because they were probably Linda's favorites, and summed up the period of that time for them. Also, the Hits CD is basically All the Best with the exception of some welcome new songs (Hi Hi Hi, Pipes of Peace, and Mull of Kintyre). I would have liked to see Getting Closer, Old Siam Sir, Arrow Through Me, Beware My Love, Somebody Who Cares, The Mess, Spies Like Us, Monkberry Moon Delight, Eat at Home, On the Way, Big Barn Bed, Love in Song, and Morse Moose and the Grey Goose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good But Not Great!","review":"I read the reviews and agree with many of them; Wingspan is a fine 2CD collection, but is nowhere near comprehensive. Is it asking too much for a 5 or 6 CD box set containing ALL the hits plus live and rare releases along with previously unreleased material. Paul McCartney deserves box set treatment. The other point I want to make is \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" should of been the familair live version instead of the studio version. The live version is so much better!You won't go wrong if you buy this, but you will still miss out on a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"\\"Wingspan\\" is a great collection. Even though I'm a McCartney fan I never could get my hands on \\"Daytime, Nightime Suffering\\" which made this even more essential.

In any event, Wings churned out some great songs and seemed to benefit from the changing lineup.Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete in it's entirety","review":"Man, this is even better, much better, than Wing's Greatest Hits! This is a complete retrospective record of Paul's post-Beatle years, which , depending on when you were born, you may even prefer. Whichever the case, Wings gave us some high quality music in the '70's that covered all ends of the musical spectrum. The band, while retaining the core of Paul, Linda, & Denny Laine, went through numerous lineups thru the years, yet retained the same unique sound that WAS Wings. When you listen to this title, you'll notice that no two songs sound alike!

The \\"Hits\\" CD offers tracks available on \\"Wings Greatest\\" or \\"All The Best\\" with the exclusion of \\"Ebony And Ivory\\" and \\"Say Say Say\\" (I guess Paul still feels a chill towards former pal Michael Jackson) and the inclusion of the pleasant \\"Pipes Of Peace\\". The \\"History\\" CD is a collection of Paul's personal favorites such as the little heard \\"Daytime Nightime Suffering\\", \\"The Lovely Linda\\" and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", which finally made it onto a compilation. I enjoy the tracks on the \\"History\\" CD and although some might dispute the selections they are, as I said, Paul's favorites. Nonetheless, with over two hours of music (40 tracks) for the price of one CD this is a great bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wingspan and not a Beatlespan","review":"This is a revised collection of Paul McCartney's post-Beatles hit songs. With Wingspan,it is not necessary to continue production of his previous compilation,ALL THE BEST,released in 1987. Two tracks on ALL THE BEST,but not WINGSPAN are SAY,SAY,SAY and EBONY AND IVORY,Paul's respective duets with Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. SAY,SAY,SAY is from \\"Pipes Of Peace\\" and EBONY AND IVORY is from \\"Tug Of War\\". Both those albums are still in production. The 15 other ALL THE BEST tracks are on WINGSPAN. There are none of McCartney's post-1984 songs on this album(songs from Press To Play,Flowers In the Dirt,Off The Ground,Flaming Pie,etc.). If only there were a collection of John Lennon's compositions and recordings like this one,it would become a megahit also. I dedicate this to the memory of Paul's first wife,the former Linda Eastman. I guess this collection could use McCartney's and Jackson's other duet,THE GIRL IS MINE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Greatest, Hit-Wise, but Man! that second cd...","review":"We all know that McCartney, at times, got excesively soft in the 1970s, yet a good deal of his material of the period greatly deserves reevaluation. I personally still think that \\"Silly Love Songs\\" is a brilliant philosophy (akin, dare I say it, to \\"All You Need is Love\\"), that \\"Hi Hi Hi\\" is a groovy shuffle, \\"No More Lonely Nights\\" is eloquent and sincerely felt pop at its finest (with killer guitar work from David Gilmour), while \\"Listen to What the Man Said,\\" with its gloriously dippy lyric and mid-tempo bounce, states McCartney's purpose perfectly. Yet, it's the second disc which is a revelation, as it contains all of McCartney's faves over the years. too many to adequately cite, yet \\"Take It Away,\\" \\"Let Me Roll It,\\" \\"Every Night,\\" \\"Rockestra Theme,\\" and \\"Too Many People\\" all send me into spontaneous fits of pop euphoria.Added bonus: No Michael Jackson (although \\"Say Say Say\\" is better than its reputation)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is great, but the presentation isn't","review":"Can someone tell me why \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is on the \\"History\\" disc while \\"Mull of Kintyre\\" is on the \\"Hits\\" disc? Does this make any sense at all? Why not just present a simple chronological order for the music? In fact, my advice is to reorder the music chronologically and burn it back onto two CDs. That's what I did, and it makes for a much more rewarding listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"missing two good songs","review":"the cd is very good but what about the early 70,s hits \\" give ireland back to the irish ' & \\" mary had a little lamb \\" ?

I can live with these, definitely. But where are \\"Children Children\\"? \\"Time to Hide\\"? \\"Again and Again and Again\\"? Unjustly shelved, that's where they are. Making a Wings best of without Denny is akin to making a Beatles best of without John. You just don't do it. As a result, Wings will now continue to be seen mainly as a vehicle for Paul McCartney, when that simply isn't true. Wings was a band. A team. A unit.Now if you'll forgive me, I'm going to go listen to my own self-made version of Wingspan - the DENNY-FIED version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wingspan: The Paul McCartney Odessey","review":"This is a pretty bad album save five or six VERY good songs.

Some of the material on the second disc is a little slight and there are many better songs that could have been selected.The main issue is that these songs are not all technically Paul McCartney and Wings, alot of them are Paul and Linda, Paul on his own, is its not a true representation of strictly Wings, currently Wings Greatest is just that.Having said that You can't go wrong with the great catchy pop rock on this album.

It is a great sing along song with bagpipes and displays Paul's masterful but soft singing voice that drips with emotion.

But although it's supposed to be limited to work done in sessions with Wings-related musicians, it's hard to ignore Paul's 28 (yes, 28!) US and UK chart hits that are not in this collection. This includes 16 US Top 40 hits, many from the Wings era. That in itself is another double CD! I'm not as ready as Paul is to distinguish his solo work from his Wings work, so I can't help feeling like a lot is missing on Wingspan.

He starts by telling the reader about his own experiences of what he calls \\"speech punishment\\" for being outspoken and speaking the truth. He continues with examples from sports, entertainment, news, and education giving not just the little bits of the story that our local \\"news\\" services have given us, but also the other side of the issue that no one bothered to look into or report. He illustrates how our society has let \\"political correctness\\" evolve into the ridiculous notion that some people in society can speak their minds, while others will be censored, fined, etc. This book will undoubtedly anger some people--and it should. No American can afford to take free speech for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative and startling look at our fragmented national dialogue","review":"John Ziegler brilliantly opens the eyes of his readers to the realities of our fragmented national dialogue by exploring, with expert analyses and commentary, various examples of \\"speech crimes\\", political correctness, public ignorance, and an increasingly sensationalistic and ratings driven media that seems to perpetuate it all by forgoing truth for the sake of entertainment. A fantastic read. Highly recommneded. A perfect reminder to us all of how truely special and unique are the liberties we enjoy, and yet how we do so very little to preserve them."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXACTLY what I needed!","review":"I have had such a difficult time finding the small peanut butter cup molds.

The novel seems to be a bit rusty in contrast to his other works. It is also more mainstream than his other works.A good starting point for those who a just exploring this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God, was Delaney on drugs when he wrote this?!","review":"I cannot understand how anyone could understand this book, let alone claim to love it. It has the unfortunate distinction of being the first book I ever hated so much to give up on it, and before I was even halfway through it too! Allegedly there's a plot in there somewhere, but because it is buried underneath constantly shifting narrative, dialogue so unclear you can't tell who's saying what to whom, the unclear point of view, the shattered grammar and tense and made-up vocabulary, the book is so screwy that I literally had NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. It was like reading a transcription of someone's fever delirium. If I could give this book ZERO STARS, I would! This book is not a classic, it's a gross mistake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As thought-provoking today as it was when first published","review":"Samuel R. Delany is a novelist and critic, currently teaching English and creative writing at Temple University. A renowned author of science fiction, he has won both Hugo and Nebula awards. Now the Wesleyan University Press has published a 20th anniversary edition of one of Delany's very best science fiction epics, Stars In My Pocket Like Grains Of Sand. The central issues Delany addresses in a fictional format (technology, globalization, gender, sexuality, multiculturalism) have become even more center stage with the passage of time. This anniversary edition will serve to introduce a whole new generation of readers to Delany's imaginative and superbly skilled storytelling abilities with a science fiction novel that is as entertaining and thought-provoking today as it was when first published in 1984."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawed work of genius","review":"Yes indeed, after reading this I do not doubt Delany's genius. His literary skill and ability to create highly individualistic turns of phrase never fails to impress me. The tale of Rat Korga comes alive in a galaxy of fascinating peoples and places. However, this is by no means an easy read. Delany's overly-stylized writing can grate at times. Sentence fragments. He uses them a lot. I recall reading the same chapter two, three times then having to put the book down in utter frustration, not understanding a word of what I had just read. As a result, it took me a good deal longer to read this than many books much longer than it (it's under 400 pages). But it was worth the difficulty, and is certainly a book that lends itself to rereading. Intelligent and intensely rewarding prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am on my second one and WILL not return it for another.","review":"This toilet seat is NOT worth the money.

Well, after 5 months, the lower part of the seat completely split open near one of the feet that makes contact with the toilet. I'm a 175 lb male and my spouse is petite. We certainly didn't overload it. I read another review here that mentioned the seat splitting. Think twice before buying this toilet seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep-seated issues","review":"Horrible - no bolts included, been to 4 hardware/plumbing stores to find bolts, looked at Kohler drawing which does not include part number or way to order bolts, absolutely cannot tighten enough to keep seat from moving, and already the seat is cracked from it slipping underneath someone. This, BTW, is the third replacement seat on two kohler toilets - you can likely think of the word I'd use to describe kohler products at this point. It's befitting their products and terrible quality. Buy any other brand..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CRAPPY toilet seat!!","review":"I thought this was the best thing since perforated toilet paper, like many other reviewers, but after a few weeks of use the seat starts to get very loose and the cheap thin plastic \\"hinge holder\\" eventually breaks. I called their customer service who promptly sent a new seat(without even verifying any info, which tells me this is a very common problem) When it arrived the snap cover for the \\"hinge holder\\" was already broken in the box!!

What more could you want from a toilet seat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy design - expected more from Kohler","review":"The hinge design on this seat it terrible. It's not good out of the box and it only gets worse as time goes on until the seat just slides around every time you sit. I just replaced it with the Mayfair wood quiet-close, it's got a much better hinge design and the seat feels much more substantial than the thin plastic of the Kohler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design/manufacturing","review":"I'm an engineer. This toilet seat is poorly manufactured. The tolerances on the hinge mechanism are such that the slow close will not always work. I took the seat apart to see why and the cam that fits into the seat cover will not fully engage because of the sloppy manufacturing. When the cam does not engage you get the big slam. I have replaced two, and will return all and buy a different seat. Interesting that the floor samples in the store have very tight hinges (well made) with no sloppiness and work great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fine","review":"Overall satisfied with this product, went on easy and looks fine.The only thing that bugs me slightly is that the opening is a bittoo small."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was too small for the Kohler toilet is was designed for!","review":"The Kohler toilet set is about 1/4 inch too narrow .The ceramic bowl can touch you legs when you sit on it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Removable Toilet Seat","review":"The description indicated that one size fit all. Not even close if you have an elongated toilet seat. It was a terrible fit and the seat arrived with a broken henge. I should have send it back for a refund but waited almost a month before opening the box. The product, at almost $40.00, was a disappointment and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design!","review":"I had bought this same seat for another bathroom toilet 2 years ago and was very happy with it. That same seat came with normal plastic wingnuts for installation and the seat was and is very secure. On the new seat, the securing nuts are attached via conical black nuts that are IMPOSSIBLE to secure properly and tightly. I called and asked Kohler to send me the old style nuts but they no longer make them. They sent me new conical nuts which were no better than the first. As another commentator said, you can get them to attach if you push them all the way up, but they remain looser than they should be. I am amazed they didn't leave the old style in production since they work great!."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to install securely, broke after one month","review":"As others have reported, it's apparently impossible to install the seat securely with the hardware provided. I needed to replace the plastic nuts with standard metal ones and apply a lot of torque to keep the seat from slipping. OK, job done ... except that the seat broke after one month of use. No abuse; the heaviest person to use it was 160 pounds, but the seat part developed a crack that eventually separated and made the entire thing unusable. This is inexcusable for a name-brand full-price product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I'm am very happy with the quiet close on this seat. No more slamming lids in this house! The product was very easy to install all you need is a screwdriver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Last April, we moved into our home and installed new Kohler Cachet quiet-close seats in our 4 bathrooms. The three elongated seats are fine so far. However, the round-front seat cracked yesterday under the weight of our guest (not a heavy person), much to her surprise. The crack is not a surface crack--the seat separates at the crack. So--it cannot be used without experiencing quite a pinch! Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first...","review":"So I got this seat in May and installed it. It did have a piece that came broken off in the package but it was just a cover piece to the screws so I didn't mind much. The seat was really nice and comfy and had a neat slow close feature which I loved. All was great until about 10 days ago when it broke. I am a 300lb male and was never rough when taking the seated position on it. It cracked apart on the seat between the support tabs on the bottom of the seat. It is barely holding together now. I have owned the product for 4 months and it was used a couple times a day. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reinstalling Becomes a Daily Chore","review":"Do not buy this toilet seat unless you want reinstalling it to become a daily chore. I had trouble with the picture instructions, as the seat was still very loose and slid off frequently. I read another user's review about holding the black plastic \\"nut\\" tight to the hole in the toilet before trying to screw in the screw and I was able to install the seat. However, it loosens pretty much daily. I now keep a screwdriver in my bathroom. After two weeks, I'm giving up and will try to return it. Very disappointed. I bought Kohler because it was a brand name I knew and thought it would be better than other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning one now","review":"I ordered two of these for two toilets. One is fine, the other has the same hinge, wobble problems as other people have reported. It's like the space between the hinges is too short so they are stretched out too wide. One of the hinges just snapped up and off, hitting someone today in the back.I have to return it now which is fairly unpleasant. No one wants to remove a toilet seat and then handle it to repackage.I love the one that does work - great quality - but the other has been a pain in the rump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy","review":"Excellent buy, good price, item received on time, works great.

It is uncomfortable for my plus size butt and my husband and his skinny little man butt also found it uncomfortable too. It also almost looks too small for the comode. I bought another seat within a week!! Stay away!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product","review":"I purchased this toilet seat 2 months ago and everything was great. And then, just the other day, the seat cracked in half on the left side. Thankfully I avoided getting my leg pinched in this, but I did get my wallet pinched.

This book might be a great book if you're 13! There was so much superfluous and tedious dialog that, finally, at page 182, I began skimming through the book. I was bored to tears. I became a loyal Barbara Michaels fan after reading \\"Sons of the Wolf\\" which is one of the best suspenseful books I have ever read. But this is the last of hers I will read. The book does not live up to the title and plot premise of a spooky story. There is no suspense. Even the main character, Meg, often states that she is not frightened. Michaels does a good job with descriptions of the house, atmosphere, environment, etc. Her character development and dialogue need work. I will not be wasting any more of my reading time with this author. If I had written these books, I would have hidden behind a pseudonym too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor condition","review":"I purchased the paperback book in almost new condition however I was shocked to find the poor state when it arrived.

Sex, Lies and Online Dating, See Jane Score, and Truly Madly Yours are my favorites.I was the first on the list of my library to read this book. Read it in about 3 hours and have to say it did not hold my interest. Played very much to formula. The author worked very hard to throw in references to characters from previous books and lead-ins for future books. Started to remind me why I've soured on Stephanie Laurens and, to a lesser extent, Julia Quinn. With the \\"continuing characters\\" approach, you can fill at least 15% of the pages of the new book by reintroducing characters and basic story lines from previous books to bring a new reader up to speed.

Clare has no idea how to had the feeling in her heart and the lust in his eyes.I admit that when I first got this book, I was just being nosy.

I just didn't believe it. People who are new to Gibson should buy Truly Madly Yours instead because this book is a pale imitation of that one. Some of the lines were straight out of that book, as was the idea for Clare's gift.

The main characters, Sebastian and Clare, never seemed to interact with each other except at parties thrown at the Wingate estate.

I also recognized some wording that is identical to her other books. There just doesn't seem to be any love lost between her main characters, it's all about sex.

He'll reject her on that ground, but miraculously discover that he loves her in the end.These should not be called \\"romance.\\" They are in fact anti-romance. The guy is all talk about sex so soon in the relationship that real women would run screaming from the guy thinking he's a pervert.And what's with the green eyes?

Of course it's critical not to bog down the average consumer in minutiae, but choices like these are simple ones that everyone can make.Anyway, I'm thrilled to read about Brower's focus on energy consumption, and agriculture, and really recommend this book; good for a gift, good for your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, practical resource for sound environmental choices.","review":"This is a book about choices.

They can shimmy and shake their latex bodysuits and miniskirts, and stretch out on cheap rugs, but they can't act.You can forgive a lot in a movie made on a severely limited budget. Professional actors and expensive props are beyond their reach. However, coherent storytelling and interesting characters are within reach, but there's none of that here. And as for the \`girls of Latexploita,' save for about 1-1/2 seconds of wardrobe malfunction there's no nudity - and if a film ever needed a hearty infusion of nudity, it's this one.Even people who love bad movies will probably want to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clarence Carson and A Basic History of the United States,","review":"As with all the volumes of Carson's history of the nation, this volume is usually based on some facts with a heavy dose of his own interpretations. Carson views history, as he does economics, from an ultra-conservative frame of reference. That does not make his interpretations de facto wrong, although this writer considers his views reactionary. My point is to alert readers that there is no attempt a balance; the book is a polemic as it written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carson is less an historian and more a propagandist in this work.","review":"Where to start? The author ignores the emerging science of his day, both historical and archeological, to insult and debase the original inhabitants of the new world. The text reverts to biblical quotes and conservative economic theory often enough that despite the wealth of historical minutia it is impossible not to sense an agenda. To use the language of the author, I would recomend this book to religious home schoolers and libertarians who don't mind being percieved as 'backward' and 'inferior' to the rest of society as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY PLEASED","review":"It was so encouraging to see a black female author supporting men who are getting cought up in the illegal goings on in the \\"family courts.\\" This is good book made great by the very nature of the writer's demographic.

As it turns out, the \\"flex\\" arm is really just a piece of metal surrounded by a plastic sheath. This may work for you, but once you bend the arm into position, I recommend not ever bending it again, is this will weaken the metal, causing it to break (like mine).For the price I expected much better. Just check ebay, these things sell for a fraction of the price there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flimsy but does the job","review":"I'm currently using it to isolate an aggressive fish. It works. The construction is very basic -- 2 plastic rectangles connected by 4 plastic sticks, with a net stretched over it. The construction doesn't appear durable and I expect something to fail after several rounds of assembly/disassembly.The \\"hooks\\" to attach the net to the tank are flexible metal plates that you bend around the edge of the tank. It's ugly, not sturdy, can easily break, and don't appear replaceable. They don't hold the net evenly in place -- the front edge hangs 1/2\\" lower than the back. I had to lower the water level in the tank to ensure that the front of the net is above the water line.Overall, it's fine for occasional use and the price is right. But I'd get something better for prolonged use, especially if it's going into a display tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly inspiring!","review":"Glenn W.

What really went down with Koscot and Dare to Be Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. PMA in action!","review":"I heard of Glenn Turner back in the 70's with his 'Koscot' and 'Dare to Be Great' programs.My personal testimony is that by folowing his personal development system, I was able to go from an entry level position to the top managment position with my company.Turner taught me how to sell, become a leader and motivate other people. His personal development program was the best I ever used. At that time, I also had programs from SMI, Earl Nightingale, Napolean Hill, Norman Vincent Peale and a few others.Coming across this book brought back many fond memories and the realization that this man and his seminars and tapes helped me get to where I am today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best personal development program","review":"My father was in Dare to Be Great in the 70's and he shared with me the great insights from Glenn Turner as well as letting me listen to his tapes from the old Dare to Be Great program.What impressed me is that these principles are timeless and based on the bible.The book Turner, Turner, Turner is a great read about a great man who was basically railroaded.If Mr. Turner would ever start his Dare to Be Great program up again, I would be the first to enroll.Great program...great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend that you read this book","review":"Inspiring story of the life of Glenn Wesley Turner, an 8th grade dropout who lost a fortune three times in ten years, then went on to turn $5,000 into over a quarter of a billion, was a victim of government abuse and still came back..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in a fabulous series","review":"I read this title in both English and Spanish, and in both versious it was spectacular.Asterix must compete in the Olympic Games against Romans and Greeks and is prohibited from using his precious Magic Potion!His chief Rival, Legionaire Gluteus Maximus and Centurion Asparagus Veriambitious provide amazing comic relief in a story that adults and children can truly enjoy.Any of the Asterix titles are great, I'd recomend all of thim, but this is a particular gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"I like this book.I like the olympic games and how the Greek language is printed.This is great by Toutatis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The fun doesn't get translated","review":"French version is great, one of my favorite comics.

It is written by a prospective medicial student in Australia, and is therefore biased towards the Australian system, but the general themes would be universally worth exploring if you are thinking about medicine.It goes through many of the reasons that medical students themselves have said that they chose medicine and explores how valid they are. It also looks at what it is like to study and then prcatice medicine as well.It was written in 1996, and so some of the specific information is a little out of date, but overall it was a great help and very thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Melody's","review":"As an avid Beatles fan I usually couldn't wait for Paul's solo albums, but as the years go by and I listen to this music I have come to realize that it wasn't as good as it once sounded. The lyrics today sound silly (chilly Willy and his big band?) and dated. Linda's voice on the backgrounds proved that she should have stayed away from the recodring studio and the muscians are average at best. My guess, judging from the price decreases, is that most fans are staying away from this collection as well. Our tastes change and if you, I think, will find this collection very old, dated and poor"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a rest","review":"Paul is pretty smart! No telling how mauch he made off The Beatles \\"#1\\" album, and now he releases \\"Wingspan\\" AFTER Linda has died! Well, I guess that's good for him, so he can get all the money and spend it on his 20 something girlfriend! PATHETIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Besides the track listing being incorrect..","review":"I like this 2 CD set. Sure, it's missing some rarities (like \\"Give Ireland Back to The Irish\\", \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\"). I bought this because [it was] advertised this with \\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\" on it. Luckily, I still have my vinyl version of it!! Otherwise, it contains nearly every one of my favorites..\\"Juniors Farm\\", \\"Band on the Run\\", \\"My Love\\", and \\"Uncle Albert\\". The cover art is 3-d, but otherwise the same as the \\"non-collector\\" version. The package does not contain a Wings pin as an earlier review stated. I think to have every Wings song on it, you probably need to have a box set. Otherwise, unless you don't care for Paul McCartney in the first place, you won't be unhappy with this compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Overview But Incomplete","review":"Paul McCartney has always spent his post Beatles career dodging the critics, always comparing his solo work with that of the Beatles; they never judged it on its' own merits. This fine collection shows what a an extaordinary solo career he has had. The title is misleading because not all tracks are Wings. There are some essential cuts missing. The huge hit So Bad is not included and neither is his work with Stevie wonder or Michael Jackson. That may be because it is advertised as a Wings compilation. A box set is way overdue, one that would include all the hits but also rarities and outakes as well. The rarities idea has worked well with the Beatles and Lennon anthology collections. It's hard to believe McCartney has had a 30 year plus solo career. Lets hope he keeps going and never loses that creative fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clipped Wings","review":"Firstly, I want to say I am disappointed with this because I AS A FAN already have all these songs and was hoping for something a bit more, perhaps some of the Wings songs from the Cold Cuts LP I have remastered and but on a digital format?Secondly, a lot of these songs aren't even Wings songs! How much more disappointing can you get?I enjoyed the Special on TV but found it more a movie on Paul and Linda than anything really about Wings. Perhaps at some point something more akin to Beatles Anthology can be worked out in which we can get different cuts and takes from these songs, I have all these songs already here on these discs and didn't really need duplicates.Lastly, who arranged the order that these songs would go in? It seems to me to be a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"CCIE Lab recommended reading; Good Frame Ralay reference!!","review":"OSPF running in NBMA and in Hub-and-Spoke network topology (partially meshed networks) used to be a never land for me.

A variety of Frame Relay interface types such as p2p, p2m, p2m non-broadcast, and multipoint just did not make sense. Do they come solely to mess up with us? Why can't people make things simple and straight? Why is the correct configuration this way, not that way? Chapter 4 in this book answers all my questions about Frame Relay.Besides different verdor's Lab Workbooks, it is really hard to find a good material like this book which explains Frame Relay and presents scenarios so well. I feel well worth the $40."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little honesty here","review":"I hate to say it but it is pretty clear that the \\"Our Customers' Advice\\" for this CD are fakes. So are most of the reviews. On one hand you might have sympathy for a no-name artist trying to get some attention. On the other hand spamming Amazon with fake recommendations is not way to practice your art. Honestly the reviews I can live with, but I'm tired of seeing \\"Shimmer\\" listed on half the CDs on Amazon. Let's be honest, nobody has heard of it.You will have to decide for yourself whether this matters to you. For me it turns me off when they take it this far, and this guy has over-spammed his welcome with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME...","review":"I was intrigued after seeing the numerous recommendations throughout Amazon... especially the ones trashing John Prine and Bruce Springsteen....I downloaded the samples and listened intently...wanting to like this guy and really trying to find the justification for such rave reviews...but after two days of listening to the 5 or so samples, all I can say is that his music is as transparent and full of fluff as the clearly 'fake' reviews which led me here.I'm very dissapointed.But I'll give him more respect than his crew gave other real and more deserving artists-- 2 stars, one for being able to sing and play guitar at the same time, and the other for almost nailing a poor attempt at shameless self promotion.And for the record, I advise the rest of you to stick to those artists who's sincerity is utmost, with their music, lyrics, and promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for, but close to what I feared","review":"I was amused by the funny coincidence that this CD was \\"suddenly\\" recommended all over Amazon I decided to give the songs a listen. After all, feverish self-promotion could be a sign of overflowing artistic genius.Unfortunately this was not the case.The sample songs at least are not very good at all. This CD is an amateur effort with painfully abused melodies and lyrics that made me cringe. Perhaps some of the other songs are better, but based on the samples I could never imagine purchasing this CD. If I were you I would be certain to listen to the music samples before I bid farewell to my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't beleive anyone would buy this cd","review":"For those who like this attempt at making music all I can say is JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS!

This is not yogurt powder! This is yogurt creamer, BIG DIFFERENCE! Tastes nothing like the drink I'm use to. The powder itself barely tastes sweet. Imagine buying creamer and adding it to black tea that is what you will get, gross. This creamer is not sweet nor does it taste like yogurt or at least the fake boba yogurt flavor that most Asians are familiar with. If you want to make real yogurt black tea or green tea boba drink then buy the syrup and not the powder. Trust me you will thank me!I think this powder is used for making yogurt milk tea or the yogurt ice blended drink but you have to add the yogurt syrup, sold separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good historical read","review":"I discovered nothing from this read.

Lot to learn from such a great historian and author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most exciting account of the attack on Pearl Harbor","review":"Walter Lord's vivid, compelling description of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor stands alone among World War Two non-fiction. The student of Pearl Harbor will gain a sense of what being there during the attack was like; the casual reader will be gripped by the true-to-life drama that Lord describes. The third chapter, \\"I can't keep throwing things at them\\", is possibly the most exciting combat narrative ever written. Although Prange presents the scholarly approach to the study of Pearl Harbor, \\"Day of Infamy\\" is possibly the best way to understand the fog of battle that surrounded that first day of America at War. This book, which reads easily and quickly, is a page-turner, plain and simple. One can never forget \\"Day of Infamy\\", and one never should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history","review":"Well researched and written work on the attack on Pearl Harbor. The minute details describing the events before, during and after paint a vivid picture of one of American histories most recognizable and important events. While bias is present, it does not diminish from the points made or the argument presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always will we remember","review":"Why is \\"Day of Infamy\\" a superb retelling of the Pearl Harbor story? Because it tells the story of the real emotions that the people involved actually felt at the time, not the feelings that they wished they had felt later. Walter Lord is trained as a lawyer, and he interviewed his subjects so that they were persuaded and maybe even almost compelled to admit how shocked and disorganized they were on this fateful day.Pearl Harbor was, in strictly military terms, a terrible defeat for America's armed forces. It was also a day that we will always remember because in it we see a deeply flawed but great, peaceful people hurled into war. They had to fight back, and they did. Symbolically, all of us are there. Would we do any better? We should read and enjoy this book, and remember the lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book by this author.","review":"I like this book because of the historical facts in it.

The indoor pictures were almost as bad, having inaccurate coloring.The mp3 player does not have enough volume. Also, if you have more than one song by the same artist on your list, you have to guess at which song you are selecting since only the artist name shows, not the song title.

The battle between good and evil constantly rages, and rumors spread panic among land and water inhabitants alike. The plot was unlike anything that I've ever read before, and the golden compass seemed so real, that I found myself longing to be one of the few who could read it. Phillip Pullman is truly a genious.

It's like the author threw a net over me and dragged me into a whole new universe. Everything in the book was so real, so discriptive. I recieved this book as a present a few years back, and I thought it would turn out to be a dull read. Now I read this book at least twice a year- sometimes more if I get bored with a current read. I can almost guarantee that any fiction reader will fall in love with this book, and therefore, this trilogy.

This book fallows the adventures of Lyra, who for all of her toughness does not know exactly what she is getting herself into. Great characters and without a second thought the most creative world and magic to come along in a long time.The Golden Compass is a world like and unlike our own. The differences and similarities are intriguing. I highly suggest this great book and it's sequels.

The His Dark Materials Trilogy is one trilogy you should read over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting fantasy for all ages.","review":"I've read this book at least five times, I've also read the second book in the series and am anxiously awaiting the third book. I enjoyed this book, because the characters were so likable. The idea of another world so much like ours is also fascinating. Lyra is a wonderful character. She and her daemon go through so much and still seem to come out on top. Lyra is so compelling, that no matter where she goes, she makes new friends who are willing to lay down their lives for her. All in all, the book was a most fascinating diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book Rules!","review":"I'm usually the sort-of type that just reads cause I fell obligated to and the sort that has a diffrent sort of prepective for books but When I see this book I grab it and start reading for hours.

But I think one more cautionary comment regarding the grim atmosphere is warrented. I grabbed it from the children's section of the book store. This story is heart breaking in its treatment of children. Not what I expected!Once I got past the slow start, I couldn't put it down. I also compared it to \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\", sort of a dark, cynical response to C.S. Lewis' view of the Church. Also, there's a scene in Lewis' \\"Great Divorce\\" (I think) where the angels slice off *demons* that have attached themselves to the newly deceased arrivals in heaven. An interesting connection, I think.Pullman is an excellent writer. One grammatical error I noticed through out, though! He says so-and-so will \\"try and do\\" such-and-such, which implies two different actions. The correct phrasing is \\"try TO do\\". Nit picking, I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"Philip Pullman can write very well. This is a book that takes you into a different world than we are living in today.

Rumor has it that the missing children are being taken north to Bolvangar and subjected to hideous experiments. Lyra and her irrepressible daemon, Pantamalion, vow to rescue Roger and the other children with the help of an eclectic group of mercenaries. Fraught with mystical references to a mysterious substance called \\"dust\\", and allusions to an alternate universe, Philip Pullman has woven a tale of terror, triumph, and a young girl's quest for the truth about her past. I was slowly drawn into this book one page at a time, until I became thoroughly captured by its unusual setting, uncommon characters, and unexpected plot twists. An excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for ALL ages","review":"The Golden Compass as well as the other books in His Dark Materials are amazing and incredibly well written. They can be read by children and enjoyed but adults when reading will better understand the hidden meanings and the deep and mind provoking story. Wonderful and amazing, hopefully the movies will be a success as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful trilogy debut","review":"The Golden Compass is a rich and darkly written book suitable for children and adults. The author deftly reveals the setting as part of the action and builds the tension and threats to Lyra to the end of the novel. This is book one of a trilogy called His Dark Materials (a nod to Milton's Paradise Lost). The beginning and the ending are the most fast-paced and interesting, and the story does slow down in the middle as Lyra travels with the gyptians northward. I found the story entertaining, thought-provoking, and unpredictable. By the time I reached the climax, Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon were real people to me, and the world seemed as genuine as our own."},{"rating":"1","title":"The parallels didn't work","review":"The book was a bit shocking in that Pullman used the word \\"demons\\" to describe a cute and loyal friend. Once I got past that, though, I was able to enjoy a well written story. Well, it was well written until about chapter 20, when he tried to make parallels to our actual universe. It was a bit sad to see how he sees the church, man, and God. His world view is weak when compared with those stemming from Jesus.Oh, well. They can't all be Harry Potter and Narnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"bbboooorrrrrrrriiiiinnnngggggg","review":"this book is really boring. it's about some weirdo's who kidnap kids in england, and about a girl and a polar bear in the north pole, where somehow, aurora borealis (i didn't spell that right) just transformed in to an alter dimension thingy. This book has about 30 pages of action, and is really to long. This was such a let down, because after reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS, which i strongly suggest buying, this book was a joke. Poor writting, combined with a boring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally, utterly awful","review":"I have never read a more poorly written book in my life. I'm an adult, but I like reading books for young adults. This book is very poorly plotted, is very uninvolving, and is generally written very sloppily. I had to give up 75 pages from the end, because it was so bogus. This author could not write a credible action sequence to save his life. The hero of the story does very little on her own behalf, takes very little initiative, very few risks. She just rides along like a good little princess. This book is also full of happy little patronising expository comments and lectures. It's like an episode of The Magic Schoolbus from PBS. This book is a drag anyway you slice it. If you want a good children's story adventure, read Robin Jarvis. You can order Jarvis's books from amazon.co.uk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Compass","review":"The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman is one of very few books that I have read that is actually difficult to put down. It is thrilling and suspicious and enchanting. The book tells the story of a young girl named Lyra living in a semi-fantasy version of Oxford. She is eventually sent on a great journey to the north for the rescue of kidnapped children who are being cruelly used for an incredible experiment. It is full of surprises and jokes and all sorts of events that will continually push you off the edge of your seat. Many say that this book is anti-Christian, which I suppose is true. However, I honestly think that no parent should worry about their children reading the book because of this. I didn't even notice it until after I had read it. It really doesn't have any effect toward the reader simply because it is just a fiction book.I would certainly recommend this book for readers in junior high school and above.- Kevin Connery, 14"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Books I have ever read!","review":"This book is #1 in the \\"His Dark Materials Trilogy\\". I am 15 and these are the best books that I have ever read. If you like Harry Potter, you'll love these, and vice versa. I even preferred thes 3 magnificent books to Harry potter. They are beautifully written, and they end beautifully... A huge reccomendation that you read them!!! Philip Pullman has an amazing imagination!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE book not appropriate for children","review":"The Golden Compass is a thinly veiled attack on God and Christianity. Anyone who doesn't see that after reading the first few pages is dense. To the author, Satan is clearly the hero and God is clearly the villian. I would never in a million years let my child or any child I know read this book. PARENTS: BEWARE! Please take the time to research this author and his books. He admits that he writes His Dark Materials (there's a clue) in the hopes of killing God. The author claims to be an athiest, but how can you kill someone you don't believe exists? His intentions are sinister and I hope and pray parents everywhere will see the truth and not give this seriously misguided man their hard-earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm baffled that people enjoy this series","review":"It's surprising that readers compare this series to Harry Potter. I reached the end out of sheer determination to ignore the horrendous, blunt writing style of Philip Pullman, his ridiculous characters, and contrived story. Before you buy this, open the book and read a page ... that is all I need to say. It doesn't get any better -- every page is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mindless ranting of a lunatic!","review":"After reading all the 5-star reviews, I felt I had to give this book a try. What a disappointment! The writer seems utterly uninspired and untalented. The story drags on and on, getting nowhere. It is full of totally irelevant gimmicks like the 'daemons'. The central character is an utter twit, like all the other shallow characters. This is such mindless drivel, that I think I'm going to burn the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this book!!!!!!!! (EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT I HATE IT...) ^_^","review":"1. I do not like it, at all.2. I don't like it because it has unessesary grammar.3. It bored be so much, I could not continue.4.

I usually love big fantasy books like this, but this one isn't like that. ^_^)"},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad","review":"How sad it is that this man is so driven to deny God and intentionally trying to negatively impact Christianity.2001 quote from Washington Post:\\"I'm trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief,\\" says Pullman. \\"Mr. Lewis would think I was doing the Devil's work.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great!","review":"As a person who is not a huge fan of fiction, I found myself quite intrigue with this novel. The imaginary world in which the author creates is very convincing. The main character is written like any other, think Harry Potter as a girl. The thing that intrigued me the most about the world are the commonalities they have in which we would see as supernatural. My favorite is the armored bear Iorek, who can talk, and people wave it off as normal. I would really love to see how the movie takes it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The real problem is the plot.","review":"A good hero gets into some trouble, then takes action to get out of trouble, solve the mystery, win the day. The \\"hero\\" of this book has all her problems solved by others. She overhears a conversation about \\"Dust\\" and is dragged off to live with a mysterious woman, where she overhears a conversation about missing children. She's rescued by others who tell her more information, and so on, ad nauseum.If you don't mind a passive hero who has all the \\"twist and turns\\" handed to her on a silver platter, and you don't mind suffering through dialect that substitutes for character development (all the lower class people say \\"en't\\" instead of \\"ain't\\" -- en't that clever), then you'll love this book. For truly captivating storytelling, re-read Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Down Sides of This Book","review":"As everyone says that this book is wonderful, a work of art or more, I say that this book was alright. It was, I must say, better than Harry Potter and very well written. I happened to have bought this on a whim, dragged it along with me on a ... and found it so hard to read, I gave up on it half way through the plane ride and then during the bus ride. Point being, even in my room I couldn't sit down and read through what I was .... It was alright and unless you are an avid reader and very loyal to either the series or reading something until it is done, steer away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I tend to be skeptical when it comes to anything that is surrounded by a lot of hype and critical acclaim so as not to form expectations that may easily be disappointed. But how could I not give this book a chance when it has been so highly recognized and awarded, called a classic and compared to Tolkein and Lewis? These comparisons could not be further from the truth. This book is nowhere near the level of writing of these two celebrated authors. Give credit where credit is due.The Golden Compass is an interesting story, though the writing is a little childish for adult readers and the content a little mature for children. But let's compare apples to apples here. This is not a classic, and there is little reason Pullman should be mentioned in the same sentence as Tolkein or Lewis.I pity those reviewers who claim this is the best book they've ever read. It makes me wonder what they have been reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Compass is a book for retelling","review":"The Golden Compass is well-written, imaginative and dark. Mr. Pullman's writing draws you in and he creates a believable universe within the story. I found myself thinking about Lyra's alternate world during the week I read the book. It is also a story that makes for good oral retelling. Other reviewers have comparedf the book with the Harry Potter but I found myself comparing it to the Star Wars trilogy -- there's good and evil, fantastic creatures, improbable allies and a child with a destiny unknown to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unquestionably the best book I've ever read!","review":"This book is brilliant! The way Pullman develops the cheracters in a way that makes you think their your best friend is so imaginaive that that makes the book amazing! A Million times better than the Harry Potter series! A Brilliant amazingly written non stop masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved reading this book to my children","review":"This is the best and most interesting children's book I've read in the last two years, and, after 3 children, I've read them all. It gripped my emotions and imagination and the imagination of my 9 and 12 year old sons. Although I often get tired of books that have a magical explanation of the world, this one was truly wonderful, not trite, not sentimental, but moving. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"First of all, I have to say that even though at a glance this book looks like a kid's book, it is wonderful for all ages. I read The Golden Compass last year when I was in the sixth grade and I couldn't put it down, and then I made my mom read it, too. She didn't love it as much as I did, but she did like it a lot. This book is a beautiful adventure story, but it isn't just the regular good-vs.-evil-and-good-always-wins kind of adventure story. The plot is deep and the characters, though so well defined they're real to the reader, continuosly present surprises and things don't turn out the way out think they will. Maybe when you first pick up this book you won't see what all the fuss is about. Keep reading!! This book, along with The Subtle Knife, has made me laugh, cry, and just about burst with anger in the same chapter. I'm almost positive you will love this book, no matter how old you are, and the sequel, unlike some other sequels, is just as good as the first. So read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was up till 12:30 finishing this book - I couldn't stop","review":"I couldn't put this book down. From the minute that I learned the nature of the hideous experiments that were being performed on the children taken to Bolvangar I didn't stop reading for a second. But the entire book is engaging. Lyra's life in Jordan to her accidental-on-purpose discovery of Dust and the city in the \\"Roarer\\", through her time with Mrs. Coulter and her escape, and all the way up north, the book and the world in which it takes place were entirely believable. To me, the most fascinating and wonderful thing about Lyra's world is the dmons. Ever since I read this book, I have longed for my own personal animal soul. I can't wait to read the sequel. The Golden Compass is a wonderful book which will remain on my bookshelf and in my heart for all time. I would also add that I have never been the world's biggest fan of fantasy novels, but this book drew me in anyway. Anyone who reads should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books in existence","review":"Philip Pullman weaves this exciting and in-depth story with amazing characters that will catch your heart. i could not put the book down! the spunky Lyra and her \\"sidekick\\" Pan's adventures are very very real, as is the world they exist in: a parallel dimension of our own. i keep wishing that i could exist in her place,and brave the artic and solve the mysterys of Dust! i dont know one person who did not enjoy this book. happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for children and adults","review":"I have read dozens of audio books, and the production with this cast far outshines them all. The personalities and passion put into all of the characters are simply astounding--if anything, it could ruin the movie production as I don't see how they could do as good a job! All three books are excellent, thoughtful, and well worth discussing with friends and family when you're finished. As for Pullman's religious/philosophical slants, I think there is nothing more important than allowing your children to learn to think for themselves. This might be a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"He did a wonderful job. Gave him 4 stars cuz at the end he kinda rushed so it didn't make whole lotta sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Compass","review":"The Golden Compass is a mythology made up of mystical creatures and many parallel worlds. This whole story is how Lyra, a twelve-year-old orphan,is living at Jordan College whenshe stumbles on the theory of Dust. Dust is a microscopic magical particle that can only be found in the Artic of the North.The theory is that this so called Dust could have the power to unite whole universes. So, Lyra begins the long cold journey to the Northwith the help of some friends that she meets along the way. But it is just not that simple, for when they want to find something, someone else wants to keep them from finding it.The Golden Compass is a wonderfully written with lots of detail and non-stop action. With most other books you have to read to the fourth chapter before you get any kind of action. Not with this book. That is why I hvae read The Golden Compass and that is why you should too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read for a loonnnnng time!","review":"This book was so wonderful and exciting! I started the book a while ago, but I kept on getting stuck in the beginning. It took me a month to get over the beginnning.... It was sooo boring. But then it got sooo exciting I couldn't stop!

So I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who knows how to read English!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great!!!","review":"I think this was one of the best books that I ever read. I really don't see why some people didn't like it namely the EFAAL or whatever the heck they call themselves. The characters were well developed, as well as the scenes and actions. I liked the ideas that Philip Pullman portrayed. I can understand people disagreeing with them...but that doesn't make the writing of any less quality. It's a great book - bound to become a classic. I can't wait for the third one to come out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired writing and strong ideas","review":"It is truly unfortunate when an adult returns to one of his favorite books from childhood and finds it utterly unreadable. Far better to read a fresh children's book, as an adult, and find it mature, complex and interesting. I looked into the books following the release of the excellent trailer for the movie which comes out this November. It is encouraging to see that young readers are being exposed to critical thought, theology and quantum physics at such a young age. I would have truly loved this book had I read it upon its publication, but even now I find the book captivating. The characterizations of Asriel and Coulter will need to be developed a little more fully in the subsequent two-thirds of the trilogy but I'm very excited to see where it takes me. Also, good for the youngsters to have some Greek to think about (the alethiometer, as well as daemons). I've already started the second book, which takes place in our universe, at least at the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The Golden Compass was an excellent book.

I wish that I had a daemon, the closness that \\"Pan\\" and Lyra share is amazing. I cried when Lyra and Pan were nearly tore apart by the gobblers. This book plays on your emotions very well, you can't put it down..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved this book so much.

I mean truly great. The imagery and writing are incredible and enthralling. I enjoyed it BUT...I also made the mistake of ordering all the books based on the reviews I read on the first book. If you are wanting a Harry Potter kind of read to get excited about book one delivers, But I urge you to read the reviews for all the books in the trilogy especially \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" (which has 800 plus reviews under the Audio CD entry,but only 3under the book itself). I was disappointed. But you may not be. Pullman is an excellent writer. But I bought the books based on rave reviews of \\"Compass\\" and the trilogy turned out to diverge into heavier topics than I had been expecting.I give \\"The Golden Compass\\" 5 stars, \\"The Subtle Knife\\" 3 stars, and \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" 1 star if that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A promising beginning","review":"While waiting for the latest of each successive Harry Potters, I struggle to find something engrossing the keep me occupied in the meantime. I stumbled upon this series and felt I had discovered something special. This book starts the series off with a bang. My heart raced and I *needed* to keep reading. The first books is very strong but has some seriously disturbing elements that make it seem less than appropriate for young children. However, the characters are extremely believable and it does an excellent job of showing how the world exists in shades of gray rather than the black and white good versus evil struggles of the Potter books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best series i've ever read","review":"Harry Potter is fairly bland in comparisan.The oft-sung Harry Potter genre,is fairly common,but this is defintely new.The daemons are a intresting additon. The ending was,in my opinon,not only a fairly intellgint marketing scheme-though it might not be intended that way-but lets you wonder what does happen to Lyra. I like the strong female charetcer Lyra,displaying a group that is usally being rescued,not doing the rescuing. A good,fast paced read.It has appeal to all age groups,being simple enough for younger children,but in no way a ''kiddie'' book.This series deserves Harry Potter's publicity in full."},{"rating":"2","title":"next to the lord of the rings","review":"The Golden Compass is about a girl in another universe.

The story is good and the writing style certainly captivates you. However, I give this book 4 stars as I see it is targeted for young adults. This is NOT a book for young adults. Maybe 16 years and up, sure. But anyone younger than that, no way. This book is super dark and although I haven't read the entire trilogy, I hear it gets even darker. I would not recommend this for children. There are some graphic moments in the book and the issues it deals with are much too complicated and twisted for younger readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price","review":"This was a very good price for a book on CD.

There were seemignly endless pages waiting for the story to begin, and rapid fire introduction of new characters that my sleep deprived brain couldn't handle. I didn't like the main charecter, I couln't relate to her, and a lot of the time I wanted to smack her around. Nothing happened in the first three chapters of the book the get things rolling in a coherent fashion. You don't spend enough time with alot of the charecters to get to like them. The only reason that I read the book at all is because a friend pestered me into it. Now of course the other two are sitting on her shelf waiting for me.

The intricate plot, constantly thickening, kept me on the edge of my seat at all times--except for the beginning, which I thought was rather slow. The only major weakness in the story was lack of explaination. For example, the idea of daemons was hard to grasp when first introduced to it.

Reading this book made me feel left out, for I do not have a daemon. This book gave me such a feeling of total and utter awe. This was THE best book I have ever read and I can't wait to get thhe second book, which I believe is called The Subtle Knife. The Golden Compass (Northern Lights) deserved the awards that it received, The Carnegie Medal and The Gardiann Children's Fiction Award.

My entire family is reading it avidly, and fighting over the copies. It is at times a challenging book, and will offend religious bigots, who need to be offended anyway.The first book, offering an amazing parallel universe, has tremendous plot velocity, a cornicopia of amazing notions and really intruiging ideas. The second and third books are a little less compelling, as the number of plot lines grows too large to be managed. None-the-less, if you like philosophically motivated fantasy, YOU WILL LOVE THIS!
