Anyone who grew up in Maryland knows how integral the Chesapeake Bay is to the state. This book not only gives a vivid account of the many and various peoples who settled the shores of the Bay, but perhaps more importantly, it helps you to understand the precious and fragile ecosystem of this unique body of water.

I've also loved these other books by him, but each one took me a different number of pages to really get hooked, but hooked indeed I did get: \\"The Source\\": 90+ pages (read twice, took 90 pages both times); \\"Centennial\\" 100+ pages; \\"Hawaii\\" about 200 pages and 2 attempts but became one of my all time favorites in the end (it's a must read again for sure); Haven't gotten gripped enough on \\"Space' yet, and tried twice; \\"Alaska\\" was a very hard book to get into, but have achieved nearly 900 pages with few regrets.

Michener seems to have begun this book with a list of (worthy) Chesapeake-related things to highlight, such as crab cakes, skipjacks, Labrador Retrievers, and the natural beauty of estuarine wetlands, and created generations of one-dimensional characters (e.g., inbred swamp-dwelling white trash and pure-hearted Quakers) and an overbearingly moralistic plot to tell how they came to be. Also, the editing of this book is pathetic -- poor grammar and misuse of \\"big\\" words are rampant. I much prefer the historical writing of Madison Smartt Bell (All Soul's Rising) and T.C. Boyle (World's End - only semi-historical). If this book had been about something I wasn't interested in, like... New Jersey, I never could have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chesapeake - Use it as kindling for your next fire!","review":"Chesapeake is one of the worst books I have ever read! If I could, I would give this book negative stars. The characters are not developed in the least. The plot is contrived. The storyline flops around like a man with epilepsy.

For example the Steed family, they are a group of wealthy educated Americans who have succeded greatly in the \\"new world\\" fleeing religious persecution from England.

Quite absurd, since Kennewick man was the only evidence favoring such a claim.Today, anthropologists will refer to the Bering Strait theory, as if it were already proven.

This is pretty evident by the titles he uses for all his books, especially this one however.Like the title of this book suggests it is an attack on modern science and its widely accepted beliefs. Deloria believes that scholars (the white ones at least) are all racist and won't change their views on Native American heritage, but why should they, he doesn't have any substantial evidence besides Indian myths, folklore, and his own diluted theories.Until he digs up or finds something of relevance I'm still not changed in my beliefs, it's just not enough to go on-- maybe if he un-earthed some lost Indian hall of records with the history of the world on it I might re-consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intellectual approach to the modern day indian experience","review":"the book marks the struggles of modern indians facing the millenium when science is considered diety.

Maybe not - asthma might be merely a symptom of the underlying problem that comes from GERD, and treating the asthma symptoms instead of the problem may actually make the underlying GERD worse. Read on and see. Many medical professionals are unfamiliar with the current research and extensive information about reflux that is contained in this book, and the information here is essential in learning to navigate your way into effective medical help for GERD problems, advocating for proper treatment, and discerning when you've found a doctor that has the background and knowledge to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell Me What to Eat If I Have Acid Reflux: Nutrition You Can Live With (Tell Me What to Eat)","review":"Very informative, especially for someone that has no knowledge about \\"Gerd\\".

The recipes in the book contain some of these foods which will eventually worsen the symptoms of acid reflux. Also not mentioned, avoid all cookies, nuts, and chips because they contain a lot of fats and tiny crumbs which will irritate the lining of your throat. For greater depth and understanding of all digestive problems read GASTROINTESTINAL HEALTH by Steven R. Peikin.

Could become a cult classic....","review":"We originally saw part of this on the local Sci-Fi tv channel earlier this year, and acknowledging that some sci fi is just outright cheesy we set our expectations accordingly. Still, we were stunned. This was SO very bad we ended up laughing hysterically through most of it. Then we gave 2 copies away as Christmas stocking stuffer gag gifts! Let's see, there was the scene where there was a California license plate on the vehicle supposedly at a military base in Venezuala. Then there was the undersea coral scenes when they were supposedly diving the Orochno River in inland Venezuala, then there was the fish that ate a house, then there was the special forces hero fighting off the piranha with his feet, and then of course the love story. We laughed just as loud and long the second time through, and voted as a group on favorite worst scenes! For the cheap price of a used DVD, you get a great couple of hours of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great slice of cheesy heaven","review":"Okay, this film WILL NOT appeal to everyone. The acting is horrid, the SFX are nothing special and the basic plot will cause the head of any viewer looking for some trace of common sense to explode.But, if you're in the right mood, this film is a treasure trove of laughs and \\"What the hell\\" moments. Piranha munching on helicopters, leaping down a river like a school of salmon, and even hurling themselves into seafront highrises. And don't even get started about the hero kicking the nasty fishes as he's attacked on the beach! I still laugh at that moment.It's a crappy movie, and I won't try to convince you otherwise. But it will likely appeal to fans of low grade cinema. If you enjoy the old Roger Corman stuff (like Attack of the Giant Leeches), you might give this one a try. Anyone looking for something more serious, I suggest you stay far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever!!!!!!","review":"Don't get me wrong this movie is crap but it's that reason alone that makes it outrageously funny. As far as bad movies go Alien Vs. Ninja is at the top of my list for most pant-wettingly funny but Mega Piranha is a solid second. I watched this movie with my friend and we both agree that the scene where the piranha leap out of the water, crash into buildings and explode is priceless, as well as the scene where the guy is kicking the fish, that's great too. Anyway this movie is packed with bad acting, crappy CG and over the top scenes that will leave you teary eyed.

Raisins and Almonds and Texas Oil is well written and very well researched. It is easy to understand. You don't have to know of or be involved with the Jewish culture to enjoy this book. The people and events come to life in your imagination just like the stories your grandparents told you. You can relate to the people this book is about because they came to East Texas from all over the United States. During the depression \\"you went where the hope of a job was\\".

The best I can do is to forcefully push the cap onto the tail of the pen. Even so, if I write for a long time, the cap will become loose and try to fall off.

This book is unique in the way it seeks to offer an unbiased, innocent & yet - thought provoking view of the social world. With amazing grace, the author highlights the subtle as well as the explicit racial divides that manifest themselves in daily life. What makes the book particularly delightful is the fact that the author relates incidents as seen by the eyes of a young girl - whose thoughts are yet original & as yet untarnished by the divides of the adult world around her. The reader cannot help but be moved by this piece of work. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book that I have ever read!","review":"I found this book boring at first, but the minute I got a good understanding of it, I realized what a masterpiece it really was.

And why? because no matter when you read it, whatever age, whether in the 70's, 80s or 90's it offers something to everybody. It is a book that is at once rooted in reality and filled with magic. It offers all a chance to see the seeming arbitrariness of human existence and the foibles of mankind - our loves, our hate, greed, prejudices, suspicions, our virtues and vices through the eyes of the child that we were once were. It is a book filled with warmth and pain, tragedy and humour and one of the most moving characters of all time - Atticus Finch - a man who has the strength to stand up for all of his beliefs, a man who will fight even though he knows he has already lost because it is the right thing to do.

Harper Lee has a masterpiece here, and by no means is it an 'old people book.' This is a classic story about a brother and sister growing up together and what they go through.

The chairs are comfortable. I keep the cushions inside so they have not deteriorated. But the finish on the arms of the chairs which I kept outside has peeled. The chairs still work, but I suspect that my arms would be scratched, if I rested them on the peeled surfaces. I would not recommend buying these chairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"In May I purchased the Strthwood Falkner Lounge Chairs, the Three Seater sofa, and two tables. I had based my product purhcase on previous reviews. The furniture is great and the price even with shipping is equivalent to what I would have paid alone for a three seater sofa. I still don't understand why outdoor patio furniture is so expensive but atleast with this set I feel I got a lot of value for my money. The cushions though will need to be recovered as the botton is sewn through the fabric so they are not removable unless you take scissors to the button threads. Still we have received many compliments even with the few muddy jack russell dog prints on the fabric.Also too shipping was fantastic! the delivery driver even wheeled the furniture boxes back around to my patio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"We bought a set of this furniture a year ago. A weld on the couch broke the first day but Amazon was excellent about replacing it promptly.

Wasn't sure what I was getting into. But I have to say that I am completely surprised and satisfied with the quality! I've ended up buying these chairs as well as the loveseat, the dining table and 6 chairs. I have a whole new outdoor 'room' for a fraction of the price of buying from Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn or C&B. I looked at the furniture for all of those and feel that the quality of this is just as good. Yes I agree that the cushions are not really that great fabric wise, but you can buy new cushions with the savings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strathwood lounges","review":"These chairs and two-seaters look nice, but the fabric is not waterproof and gets dirty very easily.

GREAT DEAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, sits good, but weak construction, returned item","review":"Initially very happy with our purchase. Chairs looked good and were very comfortable. However.... after a few weeks both chairs developed cracks in the frame (joints), one of which quickly developed causing one of the legs become unstable and ready to break off. Fortunately this fell within the first 30 days and Amazon arranged for a return. When trying to move chairs down from the roofdeck black liquid seeped out of the cracks of the chair causing significant stains on the carpet only adding to the frustration and disappointment.In short, my advice: don't buy this product, it's construction is inferior. And if you already own it, look carefully for cracks within the first few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sitting pretty","review":"Very happy with our new chairs. They came quickly, well packed, in perfect condition and are great chairs at a very reasonable price. They are heavy enough not to blow away, but not too heavy to be difficult to move around. My one complaint comes from a review that i read about cleaning the cushion covers. When a bird decided to leave his mark on my brand new chair, I remembered reading that someone said they were easy to zip off and wash. Well...mine are tufted with a button, which made it impossible to zip off without ripping off the button. Bad design in my opinion. Either way, I'm loving sitting around the firepit on my new chairs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"stylish chairs","review":"We recently purchased these chairs for our front porch.

We trusted the previous reviews, ordered 4 chairs and 2 ottomans, and we were not dissappointed! They are lovely and well worth the money. The chairs are low and deep, (need a supporting back pillow) but really look high end. The cushions initially looked really peachy colored but outside just look fresh. Added 3 coats of fabric protector... The ottomans w/o the cushions can double as side tables or put together as a bench.

It functions very well and is a nice ergonomical design. The only thing bad I can say is that it doesn't automatically stop when you reach the end of your tape. You have to check it occasionally. I made this mistake only once. That is kind of a pain but after a while you just remember to do it. That is the only thing I don't like about it, but I am keeping it because everything else is great. The speaker is crisp and clear and the microphone picks up your voice and almost filters out any background noise. I use this a lot in my soft-top Jeep Wrangler and when I play it back you can hear my voice clearly and only a mild buzzing noise from the slapping of my Jeep soft-top. Hopefully when I have to replace my recorder again (I had another for nearly 10 years) that they still make this one. I can deal with the not-stopping-at-end-of-tape issue.

Also note that extra material, such as Matlab implementations of all discussed methods, is available via the homepage of the book. Playing with this code provides a great help for the understanding of the discussed methods and theory; probably more so than what would be gained from numerical examples, the lack of which some reviewers criticize the book for.Note that this is an extended version of the book \\"Introduction to Spectral Analysis\\" by the same authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"good math, but no simulations","review":"The mathematical core of the book is impressively well-established, though hard to be fully understood.

My son played with the shapes themselves a little since each made noise; but other toys do that too. Also, although the patterns are pretty for adults, they are not consistent around the shape and just cause confusion for the older baby who is actually trying to match the shape. Overall, this is an overpriced but nice to look at toy whose goals (shape sorting) are better met by the harder plastic (and much cheaper) sorters.

She occasionally shakes the shapes that make noise, but that's really the only time she plays with it at all. I was disappointed in this toy, and I think it would have been much better if the shapes had been smaller. I also think it would be better if all the shapes fit inside all the holes more easily.

I was expecting something much thicker and more robust. overall fit and finish was poor on both the original unit they sent as well as the replacement - the paint on the backboard itself and on the frame were both poorly applied.The rim seems to be much better quality than the backboard and frame.To add insult to injury, after being up for about four months, (in our relatively mild California climate) the backboard Plexiglass came unglued from the frame. Fixable, but a big pain.Net is poor quality, twice over..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good but not perfect","review":"I only gave it four stars for one reason. It is hard to find a good mounting bracket for it. I purchased a huffy bracket and it took some washers and a hacksaw to make it fit. (different review all together).

It is lively but not super rigid, I haven't dunked on it yet (and probably never will, after all I'm 35 and white ((sometimes its true we really can't jump, sometimes!!)).

Most of the older b & w examples seem dangerously overexposed, again making each 'technique' undistinguishable. Some of the newer colour examples are quite out-of-focus which really doesn't help matters. I see this book more of a 'what not to do' guide.

It all techniques and equipment, not any of the ideals of portrait photography such as capturing the \\"feeling\\" or \\"essence\\" of the subject.

The book was not relavant to todays portrait styles, I would have given this book a high rating if it would have been published 25 years ago, but today I would give it only a single star, I also was surprised at the authors lack of skill in the 3 or 4 photos that he tried to unsuccessfuly use flash, the photographs were overexposed, also there were shadows directly behind the subjects heads that no customer of mine would except. nor would I even show my customers such photos. shame on you John Hart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifty Portrait Lighting Techiques for Pictures That Sell","review":"I found the book to be a wealth of information.

Since their market is in the alternative/nasty-chemical-free space it's hard to see a difference between this and other products, but I do know that in terms of lasting power it keeps up with pretty much any other brand. However, I have only used these products together (Anchor, color, and Armor) so I don't know how they would perform separately.

The delivery is dry and the examples are old. It would have helped if at least one of the authors had either some business experience or provided some academic insights. As it lies, it's obvious that the authors have little or none of the former and lack academic rigor as well: for example, several of the concepts appear poorly defined. It's clear from amazon.com's popularity/sales index that the book is used at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (where the second author serves as director of the MBA program); it's equally obvious that this book is unknown and unheralded any where else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for marketers","review":"I was introduced to this book in a marketing class and really enjoyed it.

In it, the author asserts that Rosa Luxemburg was a blatant feminist. This, as anyone who has studied Luxemburg's life would know, is an absolute overstatement. It is clear that this claim was only made for the author's own end. Rosa Luxemburg cannot simply be called a feminist: She actually rejected the women's movement! Luxemburg indeed holds a place in the larger scope of feminist history, but Dunayevskaya's work is over-simplified and should not ever be used as a reputable piece of history as regards that admirable socialist leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tough read but still beautiful poetry","review":"End of Torment can be viewed as an indepth clarification of Hermione. The book (or journal) was written at the time of Pound's hospitalization, and Hilda has a lot to say about her ex.

However, as one would expect with such bredth, it suffers greatly in depth. In many cases routes are mentioned but not described, multiple descriptions are incorrect or contain factual innacuracies rendering the description potentially dangerous (for example The Book on Finger of Fate -- no mention is made of the several 5.8 pitches that form the body of the climb in the dihedral, the only reference to 5.8 refers to the summit block, and the majority of the climb is described as a scramble!). It appears as though the author may not have climbed many of the routes described. Save your money unless you want an inventory of the names of peaks in Idaho and various thin and potentially misleading descriptions of locations and routes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing !","review":"This book promised a lot but did not deliver.The story is complicated, the motivation of the characters is unclear.

The radio scripts are an essential, and clarify (At least for me they did) many things that were not co clear. Not everyone is drawn to the scripts of the favorite shows/broadcasts, but as I have all the scripts for the Monty Python shows, it works for me.

I only mention this because the pictures don't show this. I don't mind the silver screws, but some people desiring a uniform color may object.Overall, I'm happy with the appearance of the chest - it actually holds more than I thought it would. Our 2-year old can open it with ease and it stays open while she rummages for her toys. We are very pleased overall with this product.As to assembly, this is very Ikea-like - it comes in a flat box and you have to put everything together. The screws are a little temperamental and take some adjustments to get in. This is mostly a one person job, with a second person assisting. It took almost an hour to assemble."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied","review":"I was very unsatisfied with the color of this chest.

The pump is heavy to hold. My little hands get so tired after a few minutes with the pump. Milk flow takes forever!!! And the milk comes out slowly. I don't get nearly as much milk with this as I did with other pumps. I ususally can't get out even a full 4 oz. You have to be very particular about where you place your breast in the shield too. If it is not lined up exactly so you will lose suction. I hate this product, hate it, hate it, hate it. I hope I can get my money back. I am sure going to try. Get the Medela harmony pump.

On top of it, for a mother with DD cup this thing required me to do some poking and prodding to get the cup to lay against the breast properly. the friend i passed it onto who was smaller said it wouldn't grab her breast either. So unless you wear a full size c or a small d cup , this pump cant realy be used. Save your money and spring for a different model.

I am a working mom, and feel that this certainly could not be depended upon as an effective way to express enough milk for a baby.

In the meantime, listen to this CD plus the others available on their website. Their music is unpretentious and unlike SO many bands today, the BB's are not chasing any trends.Here comes the obligatory Toadies/Rev. Horton Heat reference - yes if you liked the force Todd Lewis exerted on Rubberneck or Hell Below, and if you liked the powerful drumming by Taz Bentley on the Rev's early stuff (not to mention songs like \\"400 Bucks\\" which the BB's have mastered) then definitely check the Burden Brothers out."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIP OF THE ICEBERG!!!","review":"It just keeps getting better, and better!!!

Well, they do! Just make sure you charge it COMPLETELY before you use it. It only takes a few hours. After that I would recommend you get it down to where it beeps and then charge it fully again, so it has a memory. For me, this took almost a week! After that, you can go ahead and charge whenever you want but you can go for hours and hours without worrying about it. I don't understand some of the people on Amazon and what they consider an honest review. Giving a product 1 Star because you bought the wrong battery, is like blaming your parents for your stupidity.

I like the fact that all of the world is combined compared to the previous incarnations. Before, everyone had issues with everyone else. Now, each character has more to worry about his own world than to worry about than another character type. vampires and werewolves are spending more time on their own issues than worrying about each other. It also feels like all of the games were written to compliment each other. Mainly meaning that not one book oversteps another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reviews by bias","review":"I notice one similarity to all the people writing reviews for this book: They all disliked Masquerade.This is primarily because once the people who enjoyed the original series heard some of the concepts of the new book, they immediately realized that the series was \\"pop-cultured\\" and never even acknowleged it's existance.From what I've read out of the new book, they simply made the idea of being a vampire almost spiritual, a search for salvation or damnation. Which, in it's concept is cool, but how it is introduced really makes it seem like White Wolf changed it's ideas too be more inclined to pop-culture's love of romanticism and religion.In all, it's not a bad book...for new readers...for veterans, stick with masquerade. Oh, and obey your elders...they lived longer for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered Down","review":"Although both games share similarities, in my opinion Vampire: The Masquerade was a better role-playig game. What do we get in Requiem? A little bit changed rules, and setting. Did that made the game better? I don't think so, just made a different feeling to it. Obviously, WW needed new products to hit the market so they could make some more $$$. Since it all depends on limits of your imagination, you can still enjoy this game, it may just need some more effort on your part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold. Hard. Rage...","review":"I. Feel. Nothing. But. Rage...I have read this book and the new Vampire books, since that point I have felt a cold rage enter my heart. I find the new game mechanic's too simple, and the met plots ridiculous...I feel betrayed by WW because THEY HAD MY BUISNESS, I gave up playing D&D; to experience a superior gaming system, and genuine robust storyline's of morality and choices of falling into darkness.Now it's White-Wolf, The Sell-Out. Nothing that made WtA and VtM the magnificent and inspiring table tops RPG's that the where is in these new products. I think WW looked at what Wizards is doing (D&D;) and tried to copy it, but D&D; has had 30 yrs to perfect and make it's system. WW had an original system, but have fallen onto mediocrity, and that makes a bad game...Don't ever buy this if you are a fan of the old system. You will most likely hate it. If you are a new player I recommend playing D&D;, it's a whole lot better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I have been a World of Darkness gamer for the past 5 years or so, and while the new system alters many aspects of the world (including some aspects that people found endearing), the majority of changes are for the best, and make the game more clear, concise, and fun. Ultimately, Vampire: The Requiem is more accessible and equally as engaging as its celebrated predecessor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is a great that gives tons of information about this new version of an old game.

The white man was a perfect father and husband2. ONLY reason a white mother could ever be single is because her husband died.3. White mom is a good mother b/c she runs herself ragged trying to please her spoiled teenager4. Black couple is divorced (at least they were married in this one)5. Black female is angry/bitter at her ex-man6. Black man is a jerk and poor excuse for a father.7. There were more gay male hairdressers than female hairdressers working in that salon.How many of these movies are out there? Let's start with Imitation of Life and count forward...Gave it 2 stars only b/c the girls were athletic, the team was pretty diverse, and the original soccer coach was funny.

It had way too many sexual references to be even shown to teenagers. It's as though it's so common and acceptable that when two men or two women or two of anyone kiss and grope, we just laugh. Why do most films these days have to have a gay theme, also? The language was also shotty. It would have been a great movie with a great theme of the mother wanting to see her daughter happy. That's about all I saw good about it. Don't buy or rent it. There are other movies worth your time. Your kids may thank you for your values when they get older."},{"rating":"1","title":"For U10s","review":"Bought this DVD for my 12 yr old soccer-playing daughter.

Well after doing this for a year the seal finally broke.The but in my title is because you cannot buy new seals or lids. You would have to buy a new keg and I won't do that. Without the seal the keg is useless. I am very much into recycling and keeping as much out of the landfill as possible. The keg is like new and I can't see throwing them away after using it for a year. Not sure what they are made of (besides plastic and steel band) or if they can be recycled.

It articules the mysterious relationship between the most precise language, poetry, and silent films, pure image. It makes thrilling original and provoking connections between them which lie in the mechanisms of bodies, the poets', the films' and our own, their lost control, hysteria, automationism, and sexuality. We see Chaplin and Stein, Williams and the Surrealist films of Bunel and others, H.D. and her film Borderline as well as Marianne Moore and the documentary films in a new light. The poet's body and the film's body inform each in both techniquie and the cutting/editing upon the body.

He's brilliant, the only funny part of the movie, and the only character I cared about.Our main character, Danny, is self-serving and pathetic and I couldn't relate to him at all. The entire movie revolves around him searching for a date to the prom when he could go with his best friend but doesn't want to since he wants to get laid and figures she will not be a willing partner to that for him. He's a creep. At the beginning of the movie we see him pleasing himself to a yearbook picture of a girl he wants to ask out. It's disgusting, and from here on out I saw him as despicable and he waltzed himself into every one of his failures and I was glad for it because he's such a creep.Plus, the \\"message\\" at the end was completely contrived.

The characters are multi-dimensional and the environment the movie takes place in is so rich with detail. The big band music soundtrack along with the story line of the parents make this movie very unique. I really had a fun time watching this movie. Bill Macy and Cheryl Hines are hilarious and the main actor, Steven Kaplan, is terrific. The payoff, when we finally meet Bart, was truly delivered. I highly recommend this movie. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bart was Boring","review":"Bart Got a Room was billed as \\"gut bustingly funny\\" by a \\"professional\\" reviewer.

None of us felt it was really worth buying and certainly not worth again.You basically have your typical Prom/Date movie on a low budget. The general acting wasn't too bad, but there just wasn't much going on during the movie. We found it had just enough going on to keep you watching through the end, but that's about it. It had it's funny moments, but what teen/date movie doesn't?If you wanted to find something to add to a Netflix queue and ran out of movies to watch, I'd say go for it.

My bigger problem with it is that it's hard, and not soft like most other pacifiers, so his face can get red while sucking on this.

We do love them, but they do require more work to clean, so we don't use them as often. True, they don't fall open on the floor, but they still need to be washed. You have to wash them in warm soap water, so it takes more time than the dishwasher. Not a lot more time, but with babies, it's hard to find time to do this sometimes. Only other issue, they don't always close when they hit the floor. Usually they do, but it's about a 5% chance it doesn't close, espcially if it's on carpet. Otherwise, good product. I wouldn't pay the $7 I did for the baseball one again, but the $4 ones are okay on price.PS: You also can't have the baby sleep with this pacifier because it closes and they can't open it on their own until about 11/12 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"we like it","review":"i got it from pavilions(vons)and i love it,yeah it does touch the floor but not the silicone nipple and sometimes when u r at the mall and they drop it ...its better than the regular one that i never give it back after a drop.im gonna get another one from amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"RaZbaby Keep-it-Kleen Pacifier","review":"Very cute and a very practical idea for pacifiers.

Finally watched it on YouTube and it was just okay. There was a total and complete lack of character development. All of the actresses were interchangeable. And though it's usually par for the course, I found this film disturbingly misogynistic. Rape fantasies? Really? And two visits to the casting couch; one with a guy they never even identified. The ice skating scene was cool and the killer was appropriately creepy, but what was with the creepy dolls? It's never explained. Honestly, the ending felt like they ran out of film, mostly because of an endless and boring chase scene. And the mansion? More like a farmhouse, in my opinion. I do believe it deserves its due in a restored version with the original artwork intact. Maybe I will give it another look then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth in Advertising","review":"After researching and reading the multitude of reviews extolling the virtues of risers for subwoofers I decided to take the plunge and buy 2 of these units for my newly acquired SVS PB10-NSD's. And as many of the other reviewers state, there is a marked improvement in the tightness and depth of sound once the risers are in place. The Auralex Grammas almost match the dimensions of my subs exactly. The fit and finish of the risers are first rate (if a little rugged looking). I do however think they may be a bit overpriced considering the materials used in the construction. Overall I believe these are a must have for anyone owning a subwoofer. Your neighbors will appreciate that you got them (almost as much as you will)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bass Player - The GRAMMA is GREAT","review":"It's amazing that such a simple thing can have such a major, and positive, impact on your sound.

It's the same thing as a Subdude, only it's larger and not as nice looking.This device has made a noticeable difference in the sound of my BIC America F12. Before I had this, the sub was noticeably boomier and rattled the pictures on the walls in our living room. It shook the floor. While that's kind of a neat feeling, the sub could be heard and felt throughout our house, meaning it had to be turned way down after bedtime.Once this was added and the sound was re-calibrated, the pictures stopped rattling and you felt the bass more in in your chest. Also, it can be played at much closer to normal levels late at night without waking anyone up. The sound is more focused in the the living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auralex Gramma","review":"Absolutely incredible!

The author's background as a TV news reporter is evident throughout this book, as it seems like something that was thrown together on a tight deadline, using a mixture of uncited sources and editorialization. The book is full of typos, misspelled words, and grammatical errors. The complete absence of even the most basic copy-editing made this book nearly unreadable for me.Add to that a large quantity of grainy photographs and newspaper clippings, as well as the author's lack of research, and you have a book that amounts to little more than a tease.When I have the time, I'll write my own book on the history of organized crime in St. Louis. Someone needs to take the time to carefully research the people and places involved and tell their stories in an appropriate manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Songs","review":"I admit to being a fan of the Ramones. They are one of the most underrated and complex bands ever. They have a ton of 3 minute songs, featuring a handful of chords and fast-paced guitar work. Yet, their music is so much more and that is very evident on this album.A few of these songs are silly in concept (The KKK Took My Baby Away), but the music and delivery is fantastic. A few of these songs are almost like bubblegum pop (It's Not My Place...), but again, they are delivered so tightly and energetically, that they succeed.In some ways, this is not the traditional product by the Ramones. Yet, it is typical Ramones in that it is what they want. There is some growth in maturity and there is some silly fun. Best of all, it all works.This is one CD that should not be overanalyzed. It should just be enjoyed and savored.--Johngy Ramone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked Classic","review":"I've heard alot of Ramones records and often I feel often all the songs just blend together. This album has a fine mix of ballads and fast rockers. You can easily identify most of the songs from each other (a welcome surprise from a Ramones album.)

Still, she has ways of still showing her voice, and what she has to say about doubters. That really goes the same with Whatchulookinat, the first song released from Whitney Houston's 2002 record, Just Whitney. The song is a letter the tabloids for stalking and assault from the victim's point of view, Whitney. The song is a lot tougher than any of Whitney's other songs. Still, she also expanded a bit more within her family on this song, with thanks from her husband, Bobby Brown. I think it is a good quality song, and just listening to two sides of the story, not one. I still think that a lot of fans abandoned her because of the National Examiner, but her voice is still as exciting as it was years ago. Still, if you haven't heard the song, get Just Whitney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puhleeze!!","review":"I have no idea what Houston was thinking when she decided to release this junk as a single. Just the song title alone is enough to make my stomach going in a 180 spin. The beats are generic, predictable, and lifeless and the song overall is just a miserable failure at trying to aim at the TRL audience and it isn't helping Houston's floundering career especially with all the bad press surrounding her career. The song aims at trying to lash out at the media but the lyrics though, are simply immature and amateurish for someone who's had a career spanning over 15 years and it's saddening to see Whitney fall this low. I could think up of better lyrics from scratch in three hours. This single is just a pitiful waste of a comeback opportunity. >:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitney Goes Bust.","review":"What are WE looking at? The better question to ask is, \\"what are we listening to?\\" Whitney's kickoff single from her first album in four years finds our heroine biting back at reporters who hound the troubled diva. The single, co-produced by Bobby Brown, is so joyless and lyrically defensive, it makes Michael Jackson look emotionally secure. The last thing Houston needs to do is to portray herself as a victim. This single would stand a chance of redeeming itself if it were actually danceable, but even the groove in \\"Whatchulookinat\\" is bland and uninspired. If she continues releasing duds like this, her fans won't be \\"lookin'\\" or even listening to her anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song!","review":"This song has a very good beat and I like the fact that Whitney is speaking out on what she thinks about the media. I think it's a great comeback song and it's a great uptempo track. I also love the Thunderpuss remix, it's great. The puff daddy remix I like it less, but it's still okay.

You, Whitney.","review":"\\"Whatchalookinat\\", is the first single from Whitney Houston's latest release and her first studio album in 4 years, Just Whitney.The song is another attempt by Whitney to bash her critics (for a better song see \\"In My Business\\" from 1998's My Love Is Your Love). She is in good voice, but the song has very boring lyrics. That is the main reason I am giving it four stars.The P. Diddy mix is interesting. He complements Whitney nicely.The dance mixes by Thunderpuss and Full Intension are probably the worst ones done for a Whitney song in years, however, they have toped the Billboard Dance charts after just a few weeks in release, so maybe I am too critical.This is a nice addition to anyone's Whitney collection, but it did disappoint me somewhat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could of been","review":"Whitney's always been good at making r and b ballads and dance tracks but this has got to be one of her poorest efforts to date. \\"Whatcha lookinat\\" is nothing more than a predictable, middle of the range track which sounds very similar to most of Destiny's Child's work on \\"The Writing's On The Wall\\".Sadly, Whitney also sounds a bit weary and she definitely looks worn down but she is almost 40 (or is she 40?).There's not much more I can say about this song because it's so average and I'm ashamed to say it's nothing more than a bland, tiresome beat.

Only the Hebrew language prevents Israeli artists from finding wider success, and these talented lads from a village outside Jerusalem have decided to embrace both English and straight American rock. The result is a slickly professional, easily accessible CD of completely undistinguished rock wallpaper whose best track is a pale version of a Tom Waits song.

I was so frustrated that I sat down at the computer and wrote my own ending. You may want to do so too; or you could stop after reading \\"Aurian\\" and move on to some more productive activity, such as rereading Tolkien. Furey's problems as a writer have been accurately described by other reviewers of this book: for one thing, she needs to reduce her vast number of adjectives, and she'd be wise to stop telling us what the bad guys are thinking. And then there are the cliches. And people's inexplicable motivations and compulsions (Aurian's mother is a whole catalog of these).

This book is an example of the latter. The sentences make no sense, there is no clear plot, and there are many arrogant words used to take up space for what obviously is lacking, which is real writing. There is an attempt of this write to sound as he is \\"Avant-Garde\\" when he is anything but \\"Avant-Garde.\\" This book is dry, annoying, unclear, and a waste of time. Anything that the masses CANNOT connect with, cannot grasp onto, is not genius. It has to hit the mass subconsciousness, and this does not. No wonder it is OUT OF PRINT.

The sizing chart is not at all a decent guide; if it were accurate this costume should have been too large for me. I went up 2 sizes so I could layer clothes underneath and it turns out this just barely fit me without the layers. The arm holes are very small in diameter and if you have any sort of muscle tone it will be too tight. The bodice is not true to size, more like 1 1/2 to 2 sizes smaller than the listed garment size. This will not fit tall women unless you are rail thin and have a small bustline. Length is great, material and design is great too. It would be a great costume too bad the sizing is inaccurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Costume!","review":"Glad I listened about getting a size bigger, I usually wear a small and ordered a medium and it fits perfect.

But this is my favorite album. By this time, the Ramones had honed their considerable rock skills and came out fighting with a big, loud, ugly, jaded, crushing rock record--maybe a bit too metal for many fans.

After the second spin I realised what a great album this is. Eel's comic study of life's painful and joyous moments are again evident on their third record. They've ditched the morose mood of their previous LP 'Electro-Shock Blues' though. Regardless of whether you hum along to these songs or not, the sad and introspective nature of Eels music is still here. My favourites are 'I Like Birds,' 'Wooden Nickels' and 'Something Is Sacred.' All the songs are quite good, with the exception of 'Real Estate'. Despite this not being a 5 star review I highly recommend 'Daisies of the Galaxy.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"the sound of coming down","review":"after the claustrophobia that was Electro-Shock Blues, E and Company have made the logical progression to a sense of relief.

God-damn right, its beautiful day.Bonus: The band's alter ego, MC Honky (http://www.eelstheband.com/honkycontent.html), put out the retro tune \\"Sonnet no. 3 (Like A Duck).\\" The video is way beyond amusing. http://www.eelstheband.com/likeaduck.mpeg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Ain't So Bad!","review":"eels' 'Electro-Shock Blues' was dark and gloomy. DotG starts with a fanfare, horns that set the stage for a happy song. And Grace Kelly blues is a happy song, though the content is a little sad.

Additionally, the stem for the stand is not balanced on the head. This means that they are very unwieldy and hard to tip up and down. You can get strobes for much less money and they will give you much more versatility. I really wanted to like these lights and am very disappointed in their performance.

This CD marks the first ever oficial Live recording of the band's music, and it delivers. Even though this CD has only six tracks, it's a normal-time running CD (Neurosis' songs tend to be very long) and even though some very good songs from the \\"Times of Grace\\" era are missing (especially \\"Under the Surface\\"), it includes two of the band's best songs: \\"Times of Grace\\" and Through Silver in Blood's \\"Locust Star\\" (arguably Neurosis best song ever), so you can't go wrong with this CD. The sound quality is not the best but it is pretty decent considering this is a \\"bootleg\\" recording.

This book is probably intended for tourists on a bus-tour, but not for serious photographers.If you have money to waste on this book, buy two copies of \\"The Photographer's Guide to Yosemite\\" by Michael Frye.

When I got home I immediately started putting it together and found out that the hull was in two pieces which surprisingly wasn't a big deal. I completed the hull, then put the deck on and applied the details on it. Basically, it was a piece of cake build. However, I bought bronze paint and not the normal rust red so my hull wasn't totally realistic, but it still looked good. There weren't many issues on this kit other than for a few seams that can be filled. It's a basic kit that takes almost no time at all so if you want something complex, fancy, or big this isn't for you, but it's perfect for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made by cheap plastic","review":"I bought this toy for a Christmas gift.

The climb is especially interesting in that host JV climbs with Peter Hillary, son of famed climber Ed Hillary, and John Harlin III, whose father was one of the greatest American climbers, but tragically killed on the Eiger. This tape shows brief moments of that fateful climb, and John III's thoughts on his father. The climbing is also interesting, Harlin shows great leadership in teaching JV some basic ice climbing, and the scenery is superb.

Who pays this money to be warned about piracy every time you put the CD in when you paid for it.Simply put if this release is the EU version of the 2 disc without the ridiculous FBI warnings I would go personally for this one over the US pressingBut amazon seems to have their info all mixed up. So...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter Was Never This Hot","review":"Johnny Winter deserves his place in the pantheon occupied by Hendrix, Clapton, McLaughlin, Reinhardt and now I'm running out. This is Texas electric blues at its best.The original LP was an instant classic, and this compilation actually improves on it with studio cuts and live tracks. Studio: Early In The Morning and Tell The Truth, both outstanding. Live cuts: 1-6 are all excellent, especially Mean Town Blues which is nothing short of dazzling.After that, tragedy strikes as brother Edgar steps forward to sour the milk. His singing resembles nothing more closely than a horrifying Ella Fitzgerald impression. However, by then it is too late for these missteps to spoil what is definitely a house-burning, rip-it-up rock/blues masterpiece. Check out Memory Pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lose the FBI Warning!","review":"Great package but be warned there are ugly FBI warning medalions printed on both CDs and on the art work on the back cover that absolutly ruin the great effort at artwork.

Please listen to the solo that Johnny launches into in the middle of \\"Miss Ann\\" and you will agree. Guitar playing does not get any better than this.Having been around long enough to remember when Second Winter first came out on vinyl (yes, the famous 3-sided LP), and then buying it again and again in various \\"new\\" music formats as they came along - cassette, 8-track, CD, and finally, this two-disc set, I can without question say that Second Winter is a rock blues masterpiece that deserves a place right alongside B.B. King's \\"Live at the Regal\\" in the Best Blues Albums of All-Time Hall of Fame. This is the master at his very best. Buy this CD and then buy it again and give the second Second Winter to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Johnny Winter Album, Now Even Better","review":"SECOND WINTER, Johnny Winter's second album (excluding THE PROGRESSIVE BLUES EXPERIMENT), is even better than his incendiary debut, as such great tracks as \\"I'm Not Sure\\" move him towards a form of psychedelia, and he, bassist Tommy Shannon, and drummer Uncle John Turner continue to be an American version of Cream. Every professional person or caring friend who, in trying to help me, cited Winter, who's visually impaired, as proof that people with disabilities can achieve great things was absolutely right, as the songs on this remastered double-disc set prove. The remastering is warm and thick, so you feel that you're actually in the room with Winter, Shannon, and Turner as they're playing. Winter would make even better records with Rick Derringer, but this was him at his rawest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Winter","review":"I enjoyed listening to the album since I lost the original years ago due to high water in the home.

He does well with just a drummer and bassist. I liked his early lps such as this, but I never did get to hear much of his later recordings. This is some of his best hard rocking stuff, and the first of it's kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Johnny's best","review":"Johnny Winter unfortunately has only recorded two *great* albums in his career, this and the previous Columbia release 'Johnny Winter'. His first, on Mercury and called 'Progressive Blues Experiment' was badly produced and his playing hadn't reached its peak yet. Everything that came after Second Winter pales by comparison to his two first Columbia albums.I'd give it 5 stars but as someone else has mentioned, some of the songs themselves are weak compositions. Four stars for incredible blues rock playing that has influenced practically every guitarist who has followed Winter.I originally bought this on vinyl when it was first released and it was notorous for being a double LP with only three sides (the 4th side was blank)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Pains Me","review":"It pains me to give this book a two star.

She created a deep bluesy world in which to explore themes of love, geneology, black matriarchy, memory, forgiveness, loyalty...One wishes she could have told more stories, had a career trajectory like Morrison's but her personal life did not accomodate her gift. Ursa Corregidora is a beautiful blues singer in 1930's middle America. A tragic accident (or is it?) leaves her unable to bear children and tormented by the twisted lineage of a line of women that will end with her. I would recommend the book for anyone interested in women's fiction, black historical fiction, American fiction. Similar theme to Beloved but much more spare prose style, much is left for the reader to infer, improvise.

I read it when I was very young and its effect still resonates. Gayl Jones is a master of the surreal and Corregidora as well as Eva's Man are must read classics.

Son of a Gun (From Incesticide) 6. Even in His Youth (You can get it on the teen spirit single)The Nirvana box set (not singles collection) will probably be out in 3 or 4 months, and will probably include all these songs. Wait for that. If you don't own Incesticide yet, buy that. It's a way better b-sides collection. It's less than half the price of this and there are 15 songs instead of 6.And why am I the only one who puts my name in my reviews?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete...","review":"Initially I thought the appeal of this EP lay solely with D-7, the remaining tracks being collected on the readily available Incesticide album or the Teen Spirit CD single. Yet from reading some earlier reviews i'm now aware that D-7 also officially appears elsewhere, further diminishing this EP's ranking as a 'necessary purchase'. Therefore, this EP is really only for the Nirvana completest. Yet the tracks are nonetheless solid. The Peel tracks (1,3,4) aren't original Cobain songs but nevertheless are upbeat and great fun. The Aneurysm included here is different to the version included on Incesticide (and arguably better). An Australian version was also released to coincided with Nirvana's one and only tour of Australia. Although featuring exactly the same track-listing, the OZ release has a much prettier picture of the band on the cover.2 stars, because of the complete overlap with other official Nirvana releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"NERVE","review":"The songs on this are worth 5 stars obviously. but i;d just likree to point out that EVERY song on this ep is available elsewhere. Either on the singles as B sides (Even in his youth-SLTS, D7 is on lithium (the version i got anyway), and the rest are pretty much all off of Incesticide.

The author uses the first 130 pages explaining how he came up with his technique and trying to convince you that his technique is the best. Then spends only 10 confusing pages to explain how to actually use the pose technique to run. After that its pages and pages of drills and stretches to condition you to use the pose technique. I didn't find it useful at all. I don't doubt that the pose technique would be an improvement to my running. I just coldn't learn it from this book. Instead I went to Danny Dreyer's Chi Running.

I must say I was very pleasantly surprised. I kept having to remind myself that this book was written in the 50's, it seems like something out of Mad Men today. It must have been very risque for the time period. I enjoyed each girl's story. The only part of this book I didn't like was the ending for Caroline, the main character. We are just kind of left hanging, and she gets no resolution to her story and no happy ending.I was thrilled to learn that they made a movie about this book in the late 50's.

Times have changed, but the struggles that these richly drawn characters face are all too common for any woman who has ever tried to have it all, all at once. I only wish I would have read this book when I was a bit younger! There are only so many types of personalities in the world.

Nice picture and great sound. The TouchFocus set the conversion just right. It has plenty of inputs of different types. I was a little surprised that it had no digital audio inputs however. I would have expected to find an optical audio or coaxial audio input. However since I was running my audio though a surround sound system as well as the TV, it was no big deal. There is HDMI input instead of the more standard DVI interface. You have to buy a $129 converter cable to use it. The DVI cable is close to the same price.The menu driven interface is easy to use and setup was a breeze. I got it the same day I received the new Star Wars box set from Amazon. I really love it.

Loved all of that and wanted to hear more.That being said, realize this anthology is the \\"real deal,\\" so to speak. It's an excellent anthology with helpful notes, but you're not getting too much that's dreamy or melodic.

I asked the techs if you could just replace the out-of-life CO sensor and they said no. What a waste of a perfectly good product to have to throw it out. Returning all 7 of mine. Looks like the technology isn't quite there yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the box and it's defective","review":"What a inferior product it even feels cheap. I initially liked it because of the wireless interconnect and the co2 and smoke all rolled out into one. I purchased 3 of them and the first one was ok a little hard to set up. Then I opened up another and the speaker was faint and made a crackling sound as it was announcing. This is the most important part of a detector and I don't feel safe with this defect. I returned them and bought the kidde smoke and co2 without interconnect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, programming instructions are confusing","review":"Easy to mount, and the wireless communication between multiple units is a nice feature. We especially like the voice alert that tells you which CO monitor has detected a problem. But the programming instructions are somewhat confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This smoke and carbon monoxide alarm CONSTANTLY has false alarms. I mean ALL THE TIME. This is why even careful people can die from CO poisoning or in home fires. Too many false alarms lead them to take the batteries out of these horrible things. These are relatively expensive items so you think you're doing something good to protect your family, but in fact these are just terrible. First Alert should be ASHAMED."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"I installed two of these. In less than a year, both had failed. Amazon replaced the first one and it continues to function for now. The second failed too late to be returned.

I use the supplied Apple Remote to adjust the volume. Unfortunately adjusting the volume can also send the smoke detector into a \\"test mode\\" whereby it signals all manner of disasters loudly and unstoppably. It is also near my kitchen and goes off in response to various cooking odors.Hate these, would rather have nothing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't communicate between floors!","review":"These alerts were placed on the three floors of my home. They would not communicate with each other unless they were in line of sight- not much help if you want them on separate floors. Calling the \\"help\\" line got you on hold, listening to the same inane message every 12 seconds. The tech support person said if they worked in the same room, the problem was interference in the house! Interference apparently means the floor between the devices, since they were practically on top of one another.I did get them to work by putting all three next to the staircase in my home. By then I had already drilled into the drywall to attach them.If you need communication between floors, keep looking. These don't work.Don't expect any help from their tech support either."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONSTANT false alarms - and always in the middle of the night!","review":"I bought 10 of these for my home, thinking I was \\"doing the right thing\\" and buying a complete, interconnected system.The first comment is that the instructions are incorrect on how to \\"program\\" them to announce which room has a problem. I figured it out on my own but the instructions are inaccurate.Second, and far more important, is that they randomly start beeping (not low battery beeps - but full, ear-piercing alarm beeps). Last nigth was the third time this has happened since recently buying and installing them. In this case, like others, a group of them went off for about 10 seconds. It's extremely disconcerting and I now have a very low level of confidence in this system. More than $600 later, I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE WILL ALWAYS KNOW...","review":"NO MATTER WERE THE FIRE IN THE HOUSE WE WILL ALWAYS KNOW INSTANLY!!!

For a non hardwired smoke/carbon mon. detector they save a lot of money by being wireless.Programing was easy and the unit will tell you when the batterys need to be changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could get just CO easier","review":"I know these folks make a One-Link that is just CO, but they're not readily available and more expensive than this unit, It fundamentally bothers me to have a combo unit, as best placing for CO is like 3-4 feet above floor and best placing for smoke is at ceiling level. Still, though, this is a good unit at a good price, and the One-Link system works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with test mode linking","review":"The batteries seem to be lasting about a year. But, most of the time, when I press the test button, only 2 out of the 3 units alarm.I called the maker and was told that during test mode, the OneLink signal is only sent once.But, during an actual CO or Smoke event, the RF OneLink signal will be sent repeatedly, ensuring all other units in the house pick up & repeat the voice message.Any alarm in the basement can't be heard upstairs in the bedrooms.So I HOPE the OneLink near my bed picks up the RF signal from the basement, if something ever goes wrong with the oil burner etc.Maybe the First Alert people will reprogram the Test mode to makethe communications link more robust during testing.Might instill more confidence in alarm reliability.Edit 12/14/2010:Changed to one star today, after finding basement detector insensitive to wood smoke. See comment added today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Units communicate poorly with each other","review":"After some difficulty in programming three of these they worked properly placed several feet from each other. However, they failed to talk to one another even in direct line of sight when they were more than 30' apart. And so they were useless when one unit was put in the basement and the other two located in upstairs second floor bedrooms. So a cautionary note to the buyer; try them out at once and be prepared to return them promptly if they don't communicate properly in your installation. I waited nearly three months to install them and now I may not be able to return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until it won't accept new batteries","review":"These networked alarms are cool, and a great concept, but one of my three units recently began to beep for a battery replacement, and no batteries that I put in (brand new Duracells included) will satisfy it; it keeps on beeping.I will try to contact the company for support (one year old), and see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!!!

I have one in each bedroom at the top of the stairs in the living room at the bottom of the basement stairs in the basement AND the utility room as instructed in the manual (paper). I got the combo CO2 and smoke because the price difference just did not seem worth it not too. Expensive maybe but then so is my life and the life of my family and if it gets us out of the house in one piece and we watch the house burn down then that's good money spent in my book. Amazingly loud especially when they all go off and knowing where the fire is \\"Smoke in Basement location\\" is awesome. They have a suggested life of 5 years and guess what... it even tells you when its time to replace them! If you are looking for a fire alarm look no further!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement CO detector","review":"I purchased this to replace a unit that had reached the end of it's useful life.

I am rating it 4 stars but that is only a first impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant false alarms","review":"I bought six of these and installed them throughout the entire house.These things go off spontaneously, usually at around 5am.

Since then 2 have failed and required warranty replacement. Thankfully, First Alert's replacement service was fair and fast. My other complaint is that the wireless performance of these units is poor in my house. Two of the units are separated by about 25 feet, and they constantly have problems \\"talking\\" to each other.

I got all 6 films for a very good price. There are no real extras but you do get all 6 films! The image quality is very good and although they did use some DNR(digital noise reduction) it is not overboard like some films(Predator Ultimate Hunter edition....)Animeigo in my opinion does some of the best sub-titles in the business and this is no exception.Overall I am very pleased and would only buy a newer set if it was totally remastered and had some extras.

This can be a good to very good cd depending on which version you get, i was lucky enough to stumble on the 13 track version with \\"skinwalker\\" but without \\"breath\\" quite by accident. It is (for me) a much better version than the 10 track version i previously owned. also the bonus track \\"one tribe\\" is as good as many of the cds standard tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not awful, but my least favorite from WASP","review":"This is one of the only WASP albums that I don't really like. The bonus tracks are pretty cool--it's nice to hear WASP do a little something different. Then again, how many bands have already covered \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\"??? They couldn't come up with anything more original?This album was the follow-up to Crimson Idol and reportedly contains a lot of leftover material from those sessions. Take one listen to the first track on Still Not Black Enough and you'll see this is true. It has the SAME drum pattern that is on practically EVERY song on Crimson Idol.The problem with this record is that it has no real spark. It sounds like Blackie just threw together a handful of songs that don't really go together and made an album out of it. I'm sure there are some who dig it, but not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its black enough Trust me!","review":"W.A.S.P.'s Still Not Black Enough i believe was going to be a Blackie Lawless solo Album but they decided to Release it as a W.A.S.P. album.I have no complaints as i never really do with any W.A.S.P. the cd roars and the title track and \\"Black Forever\\" will guarantee a kick in your ass!

It's missing the great extra tracks on the 1996 release. Also, this ballad \\"Breathe\\" replaces the kicking song \\"Skinwalker.\\" If you are able to at all, WASP fans, don't buy this issue--try to find the original.

This album picks up where \\"The Crimson Idol\\" left off...the mood is pretty dark but I think thats when Blackie writes his best material. One of their best records of the 90's...I prefer this much more to the \\"KFD\\" album.Some great solo's and guitar work by Bob Kulick and pounding drumming from Stet Howland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book gave me alot of perspective. It's a quick easy read, and was very helpful for me, my husband and my two and a half year old daughter. I reccomend this book to everyone I know who has children, and I highly reccommend this book to you if you're looking to further educate yourself on a more positive way of raising your children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unrealistic","review":"I bought this book because other customer reviews raved about how wonderful it was. Well, I was very disappointed. It was so awful, I couldn't even read the book all the way through. The book is almost entirely made up of sample conversations that show you how you should be talking with your children. Unfortunately, the children in these conversations are unlike any child I know. In the book, the three-year-olds talk more like ten-year-olds. It is very unrealistic. I would give it zero stars if I could. I sent the book back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very passive approach...","review":"I was looking for a book about discipline that helps increase self-confidence rather than undermine it. I picked up this book, which turned out to be not at all practical for parenting my high-spirited and generally well-behaved daughter. The suggested responses to situations are very passive and assume the child gives up very easily. Samalin suggests replacing obviously abusive language (\\"Pick up that coat this minute! Why are you so sloppy? Didn't you ever hear of a coat hanger?\\") with oddly passive-aggressive language (\\"Coats belong in the closet, not on the floor.\\") (p. 16). Other conversatons in the book presume that as soon as a child's feelings are acknowledged, all battles will be over. But in my experience, pretending behavior problems don't exist doesn't make them go away, so I found this book to be impractical. If you want to take a direct rather than passive approach to parenting your kids, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This book is for parents who want permission to let the children be in charge. If you are a firm believer that the parent calls the shots, this book is not for you. I found it to be almost identical to 'How to talk so kids can learn' by Adele Faber, which I also thought was a waste of time. One of the suggestions in Loving your child...is to leave notes for the child, instead of confronting disciplinary issues head on. Part of our job, as parents, is to prepare children for the real world. If the child learns to write notes instead of dealing with issues face to face, she will be perceived as devious and spineless once she gets into the real world. Grow up! Parents are in charge, or at least they should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"loving your child is not enough","review":"as a practicing pediatrician for 37 years, i found this book very helpful , especially with advice on avoiding daily battles and on why punishment doesn't work. i have been recommending it to parents on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Vault","review":"Great product.

Hiney's biography contains a significant number of very basic errors in describing the plots of Raymond Chandler's novels and short stories. These are elementary details, and a serious biographer has no excuse for making obvious factual mistakes.I don't think this is a bad book either, but I do question conclusions of anyone who cannot check source material thoroughly.Frank MacShane wrote a biography of Raymond Chandler which I believe is far better than Mr Hiney's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biography worthy of the writer.","review":"a brutally, honest but well-written biography of one of America's greatest writers. Hiney explores the dark, destructive side of Raymond Chandler which fueled his pioneering novels. A tortured soul, Chandler wasn't afraid to gaze into the seedier side of human nature and bring it into the popular literature of his time. Many people have forgotten his contribution to American literature, but Hiney delivers a biography that does justice to the writer by exploring the motivations behind his insightful and disturbing books. If you don't see the appeal of Chandler's work, read this, then try again. I think things will be clearer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiney's Detective Work Yields All The Clues","review":"While other reviewers apparently fault the author for daring to depict the rather ordinary demise of the \\"great man\\", Chandler's life was more devoted to his isolation and misogyny than it was to his novels. Hiney's triumph is showing what an interesting life it was, nonetheless. Chandler was just a writer who loved words more than he loved people, who loaded up his cynicism in neat little rounds and fired at humanity with some precision. That same cynicism drove him to view life through the bottom of a shot glass, at no little cost to his art (or I suppose as some might argue to enhance his art). Mostly he wanted to get it right - mostly he did, especially in \\"The Long Goodbye\\". I like that Hiney doesn't let the extraordinary Mr. Marlowe overshadow the strains of ordinariness in Chandler's character. I certainly enjoy Chandler's fiction the greater for this very good life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printing Errors","review":"I purchased one copy of this book and it had printing errors on multiple pages.

I thought to myself that this is a once in a life time chance, so i bought a copy. Although many people trash this album, i myself love this album. From the beginning two tracks (my favorites) to the more popular known track \\"Shot in the dark\\", this is a metal masterpiece. Some songs may sound filler, but this is a real underrated gem. Get it if you can. Imo, Bark at the moon was a bit better, but this is close to the top. my 3rd favorite Ozzy album. If you liked this album get Iron Maiden's \\"Piece of mind\\", Judas priest's \\"Painkiller\\" and \\"Live 98 metaldown\\", and Metallica's \\"and justice for all\\".

He's better than Randy Rhoads, although not by much, and he's much better than Zakk Wylde (who is also good). Jake E Lee's playing is at its best on this album. All of the songs are really good. The best tracks on this album are Ultimate Sin, Lightning Strikes, and Shot In The Dark, but \\"Killer of Giants\\", \\"Secret Loser\\", \\"Thank God For The Bomb\\" and \\"Never Know Why\\" are also good. The weakest track on the album is \\"Never\\", but it isn't bad. This is still Ozzy's best album. It ties with Blizzard of Ozz."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I agree with all of the other reviewers in this category, The Ultimate Sin sucked!!! The production, music, lyrics, everything just was way below what Ozzy was capable of. However, at the time, this was a very popular album. Also, the tour was huge. This was Ozzy's glam moment. Gotta remember that this is the type of music folks wanted to hear at the time, including me (sad, I know).Unfortunately, with the exception of No More Tears, all of Ozzy's stuff since Bark at the Moon has sucked!!! Whats up with that? He is still good live, but the new material really lacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"Even Ozzy hates this one, which is saying something considering some of the albums he has released in the last couple decades. \\"Shot in the Dark\\" is always the sole recognized tune from here. it's a shame that Jake E. Lee was a part of this one, you really only get a glimpse of how skilled this guy was. He always gets forgotten being in-between Randy and Zakk, but it's not all his fault. Ozzy was destined to make this record regardless of who was on it, Jake was just a hired gun. If your an Ozzy fan check out \\"Bark at the Moon\\" also with Lee, you'll get a better idea of what this guy can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"2,5 stars","review":"This is (according to my opinion of course) the worst album of Ozzy. Besides Shot in The Dark (which is a really good track) and Killer Of Giants the rest songs are really boring and there are no catchy melodies so you can enjoy singing.I can say that the rest songs are just fillers to this unfortunately bad Album. If you have his best of cd which includes Shot In The Dark there is no point in buying this album. The sound and production of this album is like Bark At the Moon production. Its a little bit old but it sounds good. Personally i like the sound of 80s. The problem is in the compositions. Trust me you probably would not like this album.

My kids wouldn't give it up. It continues to be read all year. I'm not sure exactly what it is about this book. It's kind of a silly little story about a little bunny, the youngest in his family, the one who is overlooked, who discovers an unnoticed present under the Christmas tree -- a bag that can make anyone who crawls into it disappear. But there's just something delightful and fun about it. We especially like the fact that only what's completely in the bag disappears, and Morris doesn't ever quite manage to get his whole body in the bag, so in each picture a little piece of him (tips of ears, or cottony tail) are sticking out. It's fun to find Morris in each picture. In fact, overall, this is probably the most fun Christmas book I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morris doesn't mind sharing this present!","review":"It's Christmas morning and Morris gets a teddy bear while his brother and sisters get great gifts that Morris isn't allowed to play with. While Morris mopes he finds a disappearing bag. Suddenly no one can find him. But when he's finally discovered, he gladly shares it with his siblings, who stuff themselves into it all at the same time. While they use the bag he has a fabulous time playing with their toys.This is a great book. It's one of my all time favorite Rosemary Wells books that isn't related to her famous Max and Ruby. My children really enjoy it and wish they had a bag just like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific new author","review":"After loving Virginia Foley's first book, \\"Righteous Indignation\\" I couldn't wait to get the notice that her second book was out.

Sounds just like typical teenagers playing their first tune together in a garage! Recording quality was poor, no defined bass lines, mindless chord plunking and the drumming appeared to lack precision. One could almost feel it was recorded on a cassette recorder.All in all a forgettable CD - As i said previously, time does funny things to memories and have no idea why i wrote the details of this album in the first place!I'll stick to Steele Dan.Cheers,Nifty"},{"rating":"1","title":"covers up stickers","review":"I'm not sure if this goes for all states, but the license plate frame covers up the sticker in the lower right-hand corner.

It integrates seamlessly into Yahoo Messenger. It also works alongside AOL IM and MSN Messenger but takes separate software (included). The only catch is the other side has to download special Logitech software to see it with AOL and MSN (I don't know if Yahoo requires an add-in or whether the webcam feature is already included). Still, when I used it with a friend they could see me in less than 5 minutes including the download. As you'd expect, the quality of the feed depends on the connection on both sides.

If you are looking for a webcam to use with an IM client it should be fine - the image isn't great, but the compression used on video IM is aggressive enough you'll never notice the difference.If, on the other hand, you want to use it as a web cam, keep looking. The image quality is terrible - beyond terrible - with tons of jpeg artifacts and poor color balance. It's also not clear to me that the marketing guy who wrote 640x480 resolution on the box ever spoke to the person in engineering who actually built a camera capable of only 352x288 images. That disconnect is indicative of the overall attention to detail on this webcam - good enough for IM, but absolutely nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better from logitech","review":"Not what I was expecting at all. The Picture is noisy no matter what you do. The microphone is next to useless. Cannot set gain and exposure to automatic independant of each other, which might help with the noise. The drivers are a heafty download of 38 MB WITHOUT software and take up 100 MB on your Hard Drive. There is no way to use this cam on linux eitehr since it doesn't use regular logitech drivers.

Unlike many other posters here, I had little trouble with the software. I had it installed in 10 minutes. The video is good. Picture gets grainier under artificial light or low lit conditions, but it it is still decent. The one BIG drawback I found with this webcam is how sensitive the microphone is. When talking to someone over AOL IM, we both have to wear headphones. This gets rid of the feedback which creates a horrible background noise. Another solution I have tried is to put a piece of scotch tape over the mike! This eliminates the background noise, at the expense of somewhat dampening the overall audio. Anyway, I would give this camera 4 stars if it weren't for the awful microphone/audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I actually thought this was a defective product because I just couldn't adjust the grainy, unbalanced colors or jumpy movements caused by low frame rates.

I haven't used all of the needles but I've noticed that the ones I use often get dented.

Otherwise, these needles are very poorly finished, they catch on yarns and split them, also the points are too large to be easily slipped into yarn loops.

I think they're actually pretty comparable to some hiya hiya DPNs I have, but at a fraction of the cost. They're clearly sized and sizes are accurate, pretty durable (yes, it would be fairly easy to break the size 1--duh), smooth, and can get the job done.

I have eaten with disposable chop sticks from chinese take out that were more sturdy. Secondly, the manufacturer did not bother to taper the points so forget about sliding them through delicate stitches. The effort it takes to use these needles made me want to give up. Lastly and most importantly this product is DANGEROUS! There was no sanding done at the points and I actually got cut two times from the wooden shards sticking out that you cannot see at first.

Now, you either like CV or you don't -- musically, I'd say they are to music what Jackson Pollock was to painting: abstract, conceptual and free-form. If you like experimental music, then your CD collection would be unfashionably incomplete without at least one CV record.

The monitors now sound a little clearer, or more focused as others have said. I'm not sure how much of this is due to the fact that the cabinets are now isolated from the desk and how much has to do with the fact that they're now angled up toward my ears. In either case, it is not a huge night-and-day difference, but a subtle, worthwhile improvement that just makes it a lot easier to work through my mixes and hear what's going on with each of the tracks.

To be more specific, the drumming on this CD is retardedly boring. Only a few times throughout the entire CD do you ever hear anything other than machine gun thirty second notes on the kick. Secondly, the guitar solos sound really out of place in the mix. And finally, the bonus CD is just a waste of disc space. I have never heard of a band releasing a track of just a guitar solo from another song. They are technically sound solos, but pointlessly out of place without the rest of the music.

Unless you're a die hard MA that will listen to anything thay put out, no matter how crappy it is, then save your money.

Morbid could do so much better and be way more brutal. I wish they would pick up the pace and go back to being more of a speed Death Metal act.

Although it is an issue which receives considerable press these days, Lasser's characters offer a refreshing and lively new vehicle to present this conflict. Lasser's main man, Barry Schwartz, contemplates the question what are we willing to do--what are we willing to risk, to go beyond paying the bills to lift our families up into that top 1% of society that no longer has any concern about money? Although Barry stumbles to a conclusion, after putting the book down I was unsure of what the proper balance should be. That's what I liked the best.

So I started with the companies orange/vanilla...I loved it and bought other scents(LOL I keep wanting to type flavors). I was always one to laugh at natural products like this. However I won't laugh at this one. It is such a difference to feel clean without being over moisturized or have a residue on you. You can tell the oils are taking care of your skin but it rinses away clean.My only qualm is the price. I think it could be a little cheaper for what you get. However this will be my new organic milk. I pay five dollars for a 1/2 gallon of that because it tastes a whole lot better. I guess I will accept paying more for a higher quality of soap that doesn't strip my skin off. A new indulgence I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"V e r y REFRESHING!!","review":"With other soaps it leaves red marks on my skin or I get very itchy, however with this herbal soap it does not!

However, I was disappointed when this arrived as the perfume appeared much darker than I have ever seen it and the fregrance (while still smelling good) was not as sweet and floral as it is supposed to sell. I looked but did not see a date on this product. It was almost as if this perfume had been stored in heat over a long period of time. I was quite disappointed.

No major medical organization recommends routine circumcision and here he is capitalizing on questionable studies.One only needs to do a video search for \\"Dr. Dean Edell Circumcision Fallacy \\" to see that Dr. Oren Fuerst knows nothing about ethics.Don't buy this book unless, of course you want to invent and sell faulty medical products to people in impoverished countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Superficial and \\"Pop Psychology\\"","review":"The book comes across as more of a game than anything truly useful. Finding out your \\"type\\" is fun, but beyond that the book provides little benefit in the way of sorting out career options. Using this book to determine your type assumes that you come from a near perfect family environment that allowed you to be the person you naturally wanted to be all your life. How many of us didn't have parents who pushed us to one degree or another to be something we are not? Even when we grow older and process through this reality, the effects linger. This book devotes less than a page to acknowledging this reality and doesn't have any advice or guidance on how the \\"are\\" in \\"doing what you are\\" is likely a complex process for most people and requires more than a cookie-cutter approach.

The author spends about as much time on how to write OOP code as he does the AI concepts. If I wanted lessons in OOP, I'd buy a book about OOP. This book was supposed to be about AI! Also, he spends very little time explaining the theory of ai. Statements like \\"It does not make sense to use crossover operations to evolve the population for recurrent neural networks\\" are never qualified with an explanation. The reader never gets a sense of why he should be doing what the author describes. Rather than explain anything, the author just sites his other publications. Very poor. This is the real kicker: practically half of the book is dedicated to code dumps or space wasting Booch diagrams. The code dumps aren't even accompanied by anything meaningful, just things like, the constructor initializes the data.

When the heroine \\"thought\\" (for the sake of getting back at the hero), she often thought about such things as \\"skinning him alive,\\" or \\"turning him into dog food\\" or other such physical funnies.

I can't figure out how to temper chocolate to save my life so I just melt my chocolate in this little contraption and it works well for all my needs. It melts quickly. It cleans up nicely. But when I'm dipping a couple dozen shortbread cookies or some cakeballs, I have to continually put more chocolate in but like I said, it melts quickly so it's not too bad. It would make a great gift. I've melted milk, dark & white chocolate in this as well as Wilton Candy Melts. The nicest thing about this is that the chocolate stays melted & warm as you work.

This is definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"While this is a cute little chocolate melting pot - I was disappointed it was so small.

This gimmicky program essentially states: Eat less fat and exercise.The information on smoking cessation programs is also very dated; Zyban/Wellbutrin are not mentioned, and the nicotine patch seems to have been almost an experimental technique when this book was written.

Without any soft padding, that means they will 1) wake themselves up, and/or 2) hurt themselves. Also, the rail is at least 6 inches too short and 3 inches too low to be of real value.

Oscar takes you from physical and mental conditioning to all of the skills necessary to play the game. Shooting, passing, rebounding, offensive and defensive tactics even a section on what to do when you are mismatched in a game. The book is excellent for coaches to use as a teaching manual and to recommend to their team as a guide for practicing on their own. Oscar mentions in the book that the best way to improve is to work on the fundamentals and he shows you how even if you have never touched a basketball.

It is fantastic, the player who averaged triple double statistics over multiple NBA seasons, has documented his fundamentals for others to learn.

My major concern is that there's absolutely no research in the book beyond just watching the damned show: apparently they missed the movie, because they think elves aren't a character race. And dwarves obviously exist, despite that they don't allow THOSE as a character race either.It's nice to have stats for all the Slayers characters, but these stats are BS. Look: The Slayers characters are epic. Instead of trying to restructure the system so Amelia's 17th level and Lina's only 19th, they should have just worked with the epic system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do they even know what they're doing?","review":"I picked this up at a local bookstore, since I'm a fan of the entire Slayers franchise. However, as I looked through, half of the book was very basic character summaries, and only a fraction of the rest had anything to do with game mechanics. Also, what they 'did' have looked like the author barely watched the show, and went with cliffnotes.The spellcasting method shows some promise, but needs to be severly altered to work as well as it should. Magical items are severely underpowered (the Sword of Light is a Major Artifact that generates a blade made of pure Force, not a Brilliant Energy Weapon)My suggestion, if you want to use Slayers in a D20 environment, watch the show, and write the thing yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This has been a very well made slingshot so far.

Within a week it broke on the lengthened side. This sort or stuff happens so I prepared to send it back by reading the return rules from Datavision Computer Video (yes, I thought it was a strange item for a computer/video company to handle when I bought it, but they had good reviews). Datavision's return policy is geared toward high dollar items and is absurd for low cost items (all items are returned at the buyer's expense and must be insured). This would cost more than the item.

When he is convicted of murder, on very little evidence, most people see it as no more than could be expected out of \\"his kind\\". But Rachel Grant, who always does the proper thing, never believed in his guilt. As his ex-teacher she saw a side of Johnny that others never did.When Johnny comes home he's belligerent and angry. He's also as hooked on Rachel as he has been for half of his life but feels she could never be happy with a guy like him. It's both heartbreaking and heartwarming to watch these two try to overcome the differences in their personalities and life styles to be together.Granted there wasn't much murder mystery involved but it wasn't needed with the rest of this encouraging love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winning combination: sexy,bad-boy hero and the good girl","review":"My copy of this book is dog-eared.

After serving 10 years in prison, Rachel is Johnny's only ally. The story revolves around the relationship between these two characters and the mystery surrounding Johnny Harris's innocence. I felt both the romance & suspense aspects of this story were far-fetched.I enjoy Robard's historical books much more than her contemporaries. With that being said, this novel held my interest, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is looking for a knockout."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh......","review":"After hearing many times that this is Karen Robards' best contemporary, I had to read it... and was pretty disappointed.

It's only a few years and that just makes it better for the characters involved. Very sweet love story! Definitely read it and you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than average, but that's all","review":"I tried this shampoo because my hair was dry and damaged after straightening. It was better than a regular, everyday shampoo, but not as good as the Garnier Fructis line, which costs much less.The problem with all so-called \\"conditioning\\" shampoos (and almost all shampoos, period) is that they contain sulfates. Sulfates strip your hair, to some degree or another. Even most of the shampoos out now claiming to be \\"sulfate-free\\" will in fact have a sulfate ingredient when you read the label.By far the best product I've found to clean hair without stripping is called Shea Moisture. They have 3 types of shampoo & conditioner, and a few other products. I believe they are currently only available at select Targets. Maybe that will change.

Most of the tracks are familiar with only one or two obscure tracks: Schools are Prisons; Watcha Gonna Do About It. For you karaoke fans, track eight is the backing track (no vocals) for Pretty Vacant. The packaging is low budget as well, with scant liner notes. To sum it up, the warning on the back says it all: Caveat Emptor - Let the Buyer Beware! Recording quality is suspect.Castle Communications could have done a much better job with this one.

It's just a burger, but it's a burger you've never had before and may never have again. I grew up in the 80s and all I had back then was a turntable and a cassette player, so you had to get up and change sides, lift the needle, or rewind and fast-forward. The thing I love about mp3s is that now I can repeat Light of My Love or Angels Calling infinitely, and I can play the whole album for two straight days on a single AA battery. If I have to wait another 17 years for a Zebra album, at least I can rest assured that it will be fantastic, so take your time guys, and thank you for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best","review":"Zebra has been around a while, though I didn't discover them until recently. This album contains some gems like Amazon, Angels Calling and Free. All tracks are great, though. As usual, Jackson hits the stratosphere with voice and guitar playing. Zebra is a versatile band, so don't expect any particular style to dominate. The trio sounds like a much larger band. IV also presents a more mature Zebra, though. While you're at it, check out the Zebra Live album, one of the best live albums I've ever heard (it's up there with Framptom Comes Alive). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job Zebra","review":"This is a great cd. Zebra is a very talented band and still knows how to keep rocking after all these years.

Now to be honest: At first listen, i was a little disappointed. Can't explain. I enjoyed the mellower songs; they seemed more genuine-who am i, so i dance, a world that is learning. The favorite rockers aren't tracks one and two. They are my life has changed and free. I wouldn't mind hearing more guitar, maybe it was the jambox? I also noticed a certain blandness in sound on kk and light of my love; the mix, the feel. Man, those bootleg tapes kick. I wouldn't overproduce the rockers, but 3.V and the mellow tunes on this cd are great. I'm not religious, and I don't mind the questioning of faith, but there are too many angel references for me.

The authors focus on the core element that is clearly absent from many new internet ventures, namely \\"Deep Branding\\".

If the blade was sharp & hardened It would be a great tool to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insul knife","review":"After years of cutting insulation with a utility knife I have to say this product is wonderful. This knife is a great time saver. Try it and you will see.HOWEVER---I was not satisfied with how sharp the blade was.I sent it to a sharpening shop to put a proper edge on it.That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS TOOL-Save Your Money!!!","review":"If you are considering this tool for use on Ultra Touch insulation dont bother. The tool is absolutely useless for that application, maybe it works well on other \\"conventional\\" isulations but it does not work at all on the ultra touch material, you are better off using the standard utility knife (carefully) and straight edge. If you are using Ultra Touch insulaion the best way to cut it is with a small Band Saw (maybe even an electric carving knife), anything else is just a compromise. I write this as I am finishing the insulation on a 20'x20' room, BTW the Ultra touch insulation is Excellent, very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CEPCO Tool IK-10 Insul-Knife is Junk","review":"I was Very dissatisfied with the CEPCO Tool IK-10 Insul-Knife I purchased. I returned it for a refund immediately. It was very poor quality. The blade was bowed (curved) so no way could you cut straight. The blade looked like it was made from a cheap flimsy piece of sheet metal. The blade was also very dull - I'm sure it wouldn't cut through butter let alone insulation. - I ended up buying a heavy duty box cutter with the 4\\" blade that is segmented so you just break off the blade tip as it gets dull. I extended the blade all the way and this gave me a nice sharp almost 4\\" blade for cutting through insulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME for FIBERGLASS; GOOD for ULTRA TOUCH","review":"I bought the CEPCO Tool IK-10 Insul-Knife and the AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener. Unlike some other reviewers, mine came sharp out of the box. This thing cuts like a hot knife through butter on R30 (yes, R30) fiberglass insulation. Perfect for trimming expanding foam too! This knife is amazing!! I'd rank it up there along with a Sawzall, Visegrips and duct tape!I originally bought it to cut through Ultra Touch Cotton Insulation. I wasn't as impressed cutting R13 Ultra Touch. I had to saw back and forth 4-5 times to make it through. It was much better than a utility knife (25-30 slashes and still not a clean cut), but I'll be trying my table saw next time. The blade also dulls quickly on the Ultra Touch, but the sharpener works quick and easy to make the blade sharp again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Waiting For","review":"I recently purchased some Ultra Touch Cotton Fiber Insulation, and Bonded Logic recommended this knife to cut it with. So I ordered it. I also tried using a utility knife, one of those extend-a-blade things with the break-off blades(using all of them at once), and a pair of utility scissors.I am part-way through insulating an attic up to R40.This works the best by far. You have to sharpen the blade with a blade sharpener first. For cutting across the batt, it makes nice straight cuts(used against a plywood sheet). You can also cut nicely just holding the insulation and sawing it to make it fit around something or to make cuts for wires. The utility knife takes forever to cut with. You can also tear the insulation easily, which I also did in some places (easier than utility knife).It doesn't cut like butter, but this stuff isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent after a little tweaking","review":"As the knife comes from the factory it is extremely difficult to use. It is not sharp enough to cut foam thicker than 1\\", and it is extremely hard to push the blade through thicker foam without crushing, rather than cutting the foam. I purchased a good ceramic rod knife sharpener and sharpened the blade. This was much better but it was still very difficult to cut thick foam because of the friction of the huge blade sliding against the foam being cut. I sprayed the entire surface of the blade with silicone lubricant and this made an almost magical difference. It was trivial to make very smooth cuts in foam 3\\" to 4\\" thick.For some reason the Amazon web page is not letting me set my star rating but I would give it a 5 (if Amazon would let me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Memory for High Preformance Gamers","review":"This is great memory for high preformance gamers!

To be honest I bought this book expecting more, and found it disappointing. What I found was a columnist making her living. We learnt about her network building, her \\"names\\" and could see how she developed those into an income stream of words covering the last 10 years of the Internet.On the other hand I thought her discussion of \\"communities\\" was thoughtful. It made me stop and think about relationships and contributing.In my opinion there's little in this book for thoughtful people who are already in the IT industry. But perhaps for people who are looking for a \\"humanist\\" view of the Internet and don't know where to start, this book would be quite useful. I was thinking here of an Adult Education class or night class.

And, no, I didn't like this book at all.Dyson's choice of subject matter is a difficult one. Usually by the time a book in this genre gets published it's contents are outdated or stale. Most authors use try to counteract this is by rehashing all the known universal truths on a subject in the hope of shedding some new light for the reader. No matter how hard I worked I just couldn't seem to find that here. Dyson's contents are just more of the same.I take full responsibility for not liking this book on myself. I want to live in this new world by engaging it, to the best of my abilities, head on.

As someone who is a user of the net and familar with the issues but is not a net expert, I did not find anything new in Release 2.0. Its a regurgitation of old ideas using worn out and obvious examples. In some ways, it presents a simplistic view of the Digital Age.

The Uniden line seems always to offer the same features as other more-name brands (Sony, Panasonic), for about 25% less. Yet, they also always seem truly inferior. After putting up with one of these two-line phones for 8 months (don't even think about getting service!!), I went out and bought a Panasonic two-line cordless this week. Using the phones side-by-side every caller could hear a major improvement when I switched to the Panasonic (which is much lighter and sounds much better to me as well).

(Why is the picture of the dog on the cover so unlike the one described in the book?) The plot was absurd and uninteresting.

They only added to the story rather than distracting from it. The hero was a nice guy who knew how to do his job (Police Chief). The Jillian was just as realistic to me... learning to stand on her own after a divorce, learning how to stand up to her ex, and learning how to be herself.This is not a book that requires deep thinking nor does it have a life changing lesson.

Despite conventional wisdom, we find there is a supportive relationship to be found. Barr does not adopt a dogmatic stance, but clearly (and refreshingly) allows the chips to fall where they may. He concedes points where concessions are due and grants the possibility of competing theories where deserved. Though evidently a theist, Barr's impartiality sets this book apart.Modern physics, to include quantum theory, in no way eliminates the possibility of a first cause. While materialists rule academia and enjoy mainstream acceptance, there is a burgeoning group of scientists and philosophers willing to call attention to the fact that the emperor may, in fact, require a towel.

Sadly, that was not what I found.On the whole, I found this volume to be highly unbalanced. Of five authors contributing to the study, four were pro-Messianic and one was anti-Messianic. Such an unbalanced number of proponents and detractors is not in the best interest of serious theological study. Secondly, for me the book was a further disappointment in that it considered only the Messianic synagogue movement, rather than the entire notion of where, how, and to what extent should Jews who convert to Christianity retain Jewish practices, regardless of the question of synagogue legitimacy. There is so much more that could have been and should have been done with this topic, but sadly was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"David vs Goliath","review":"Bought the book knowing this was going to be a slaughter fest on the one anti-Messianic position.

What we get here is, the lives of all the people in the plot - how they came to be at this university, working on or in the cast or staff of a modern opera. The life's travels of the people are the Canterbury part, of course. We also get the opera itself, in bits and pieces. Since some of the stories of the individuals are told in unusual formats - cartoon balloons, for instance - I only wish we could get a bit of the sheet music for the opera also.The characters are all complex and deep, every one an individual.

I don't know why I waited so long but I am glad I finally did. The album totally blew me away. I knew it was going to be good but I didn't know just how good. The music is corrosive. I can hear the rage in Erica's distorted vocals, and it particularly shows in songs like \\"Martyr\\", \\"Your Nightmare\\", and \\"Sick F***k\\". Despite the harsh, distorted vocals, the music is drenched in pop friendly hooks which is a great contrast with Erica's seething lyrics and vocals. The rage that Erica writes and sings in her music truly can be felt. I loved every single track on THE FAILURE EPIPHANY. It is raw and abrasive yet melodic. For me, THE FAILURE EPIPHANY is a true industrial classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Would Be More!","review":"The plot is simple: through a series of events, 13 year Briony jumps to the erroneous conclusion that her sister's soon-to-be-boyfriend is the rapist of their young cousin. Even when she begins to doubt what she saw, she doesn't back down from her story and the young man spends several years in prison before he wins an appeal.The plot is simple but McEwan's style of writing throws so much verbiage at the reader that you are bombarded with far more information than you need. You find yourself silently screaming \\"Get to the story!\\" Instead of empathizing with any of the characters, the reader ends up feeling like he (or she) is on the outside looking in at the lives of people that you really don't care about at all.This is one of those rare books that will probably be far more enjoyable as a made-for- television movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Cup Of Tea","review":"I attempted reading this book twice and just could not get into it.

On reading, I found these to be more twists of plot, a plot which is credible though not at all complex. McEwan unwraps events slowly with layers of detail and suspense. His characterisations are powerful, challenging the reader to relate to the characters in unexpected ways - I was particularly taken with a character's experience of \`astral travelling', flying above the ground in moments before waking. This meticulous story development makes a reasonably straightforward novel powerfully engaging.McEwan is a gifted writer with a lucid and compelling style.

The book was only .94, so it appears to be a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books.","review":"I cannot recommend Atonement highly enough. It ranks up there as one of my all-time favorite books. I actually read this book several years ago, but felt compelled to write a review when I saw some of the (bad) reviews on this site. Atonement is a compelling historical novel set during WWII. The setting provided an amazing feel for the book, and allowed the characters to be fully developed as the book follows each of their involvement in the war. This book's ending definitely made the book what it was - totally amazing and breathtaking. This is one of the very few books that made me cry while I was on the bus, headed in to work. I also recommend this book to my Mom, who is a tough critic, and she also loved it. That's a good sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a second read","review":"I read it once and had some time to reflect. I'm now reading it for the second time and getting even more from it. For my money, it's a masterpiece.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped up, knocked out","review":"Wow, some people really like this book. I am sorry not to be one of them. I wanted to finish it and had the best of intentions to do so, but I just kept falling asleep. I wasn't all that interested in any of the characters, honestly, and didn't really care what happened to them.I have to say I thought Amsterdam was much more engaging.I regret spending all that money and buying the hardcover version of this book. Hopefully other people will get more enjoyment out of it than I did after I donate it to my local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit and Miss","review":"I fell for the tantalizing literati buzz on this book hook, line and sinker. While the author is certainly talented in his ability to craft prose that engage your tongue and mind at times, I felt the story lacked depth. I did not \\"connect\\" with the plotline - in fact, I nearly gave up mid-stream. The number of run-on sentences employed in the first section seemed cloying. An English teacher would have slashed and burned an 8th grade essay with the same content.I wasn't committed until about 75% of the way through and I did feel the story picked-up at that point. It became more engaging as the writing was much more crisp and compact. However, by the time the pace picked-up, I felt the remainder was merely hurtling toward a quick conclusion.So far, other readers I know (ranging in age from 16 - 60)share my sense of disatisfaction; can't wait for my book club discussion at the end of the month.Bottom-line: fulfilled my book club obligation; would have spent my $$$ on something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"\\"Atonement\\" is not just one story, but three wonderfully threaded parts that combine into a powerfully moving whole. The story is so rich and epic in it's mere 350 pages, I wanted it to just keep going. I knew nothing about the plot before I started and I think the less you know the better.McEwan has created a wonderful collection of characters whose actions will shock and provoke as you witness their folley. Brilliant as well is his descriptive prowess of not just the English countryside, but of the horrors of war.This is the best book I've read so far this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simmering","review":"There's no doubt that Ian McEwan is a terrific writer. His prose...the interplay between the intricate thoughts of the characters and the descriptions of the settings are beautiful..I loved that line about Cecilia's dress worshiping the curves of her body. Those war scenes..like a piece of a Heironymous Bosch painting. So many other great bits too, but to me, I find it part of the English writing tradition to have a stew of simmering passion, often detached over-wrought and intellectualized, just below the surface which carefully never spills over. Words never said. Somber looks exchanged. Clipped cryptic meanings. Me, I happen to like things a bit more messy and expansive. Still, I enjoy Ian McEwan's measured pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters but too many words","review":"This is my second reading of this book having read it when it first came out. It was not one that stuck with me so when searching the bookshelf for something to read, I tried it again. This second time around, it had more of an impact.The characters of Briony and Cecilia are well developed. The setting of pre-war England and England during the war comes alive. However, there are times that I just had to reread because I wasn't sure I really understood the sentence. Some sentences are really really long -- needlessly so, I think.The plot is interesting; lives are drastically changed because of a young girls vivid imagination. However, life goes on. This is a good read, but not a fast one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Read","review":"I had waited for this book and thought based on reviews that it would be worth it. Our book club read it and we were overwhelmingly disappointed. It was over written in the beginning and although the ending was thought provoking, it was not worth the time it took to dredge through the first half of the book to get to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmm.....","review":"So this is one of those books that you pick up only coz it has tons of reviews and everyone you know is reading it and there's a movie on it, so it must be good right?Welll it is an interesting theme but at the end of it the only image of Briony that I had was of a silly brat and not the complicated child prodigy that the author beings to paint her as. I did enjoy reading the book but only because the author does a good job of eloquently beating around the bush and making you believe the story is about to get fiercely dramatic...that never happens. The story wraps up much too quickly in a few pages for all the time you've spent tracking these people's lives. Overall the book's an easy, fast read so go ahead but do not set high expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story...","review":"Great book, fast read, wonderful story from everyone's point of view. Can't wait to see the movie now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture, pure torture.","review":"Atonement is full of lovely phrases, but lacks the ability to carry you through the story. So many words, so little tiime.After struggling through the first one third of the book I finally just gave up and put it down. This novel is not for the reader who wants to be entertained, caught up in a good story, or likes an emotional presence in their reading. Thinking I had been too harsh in my analysis, I picked it up again a few weeks later. Same result. No heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts slowly.......and quickly slows down","review":"Terrible book because it create expectations of \\"atonement\\" and then gets caught up in its own underware. Asking if the following sentence is \\"true\\" -- \\"This sentence is not true.\\" is comprable to the theme you are to discover and contemplate in this book. Worse, the slow development is painful.The only positive is that the book is an accurate depiction of the mean spirited nature of a dying British class system."},{"rating":"2","title":"read all the hype-looking forward to too much","review":"I read all the reviews about the book and I think I was expecting too much. Don't get me wrong, this is a great book that it well worth the read. I think it would have been even better if I had not gone into reading as many reviews as I did read. All that said, it is still way worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever tried reading","review":"The first three chapters in thousands of unnecessary words describe this mundane activity that doesn't go anywhere. By the 5th chapter, I couldn't take it any longer and put the book down for good; and I really like the closure of finishing a book. This was just a chore to try to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Beyond Belief","review":"Don't get me wrong, I've plugged through War and Peace, the Brothers Karamazov and countless other novels requiring dedication and persistence.This book does not deserve the time, effort, or money to try to figure out what the point of this whole novel is. It is painfully slow, overly descriptive and incredibly naive in the writing.I made the mistake of buying a \\"best seller\\". I usually stay away from them for the simple reason that most people are rather lethargic in reading - opting for simplicity over compexity and the mundane over the exciting.If you value your time, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"The beginning of the book had me hoping that it would actually live up to the hype, but no. It was simply irritating to read such a silly story. I will certainly not trust the online reviews any more when choosing a book. Bad book. Do not read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels False","review":"He should have ended the book without the silly musings at the end by Brony who is the author of the story within the story. We the readers know we are reading a book thats fictional, that is not true, so its lovely after having dedicated our time and energy to read your book and get lost in your world, you the writer pick an ending and stick to it rather than jolting us back to reality with , maybe I could have ended it this they live or maybe this way they died."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious and boring","review":"If you suffer from insomnia, this is a great drug-free way to go into snooze mode. I just cannot fathom the great reviews, the lofty place on the best-seller lists, and the swooning praise of readers. Everyone in my book club just hated it, we all gave up at at various points in the book and chose something else to read. The lies and imaginings of a spoiled brat are described as some sort of grand \\"crime.\\" Give me a break. This was truly one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a mystery!","review":"McEwan is obviously a capable writer and constructs some fine sentences in this book. However, I found the characterisation bland and the story too drawn-out. He could have shaved off at least 50 pages....I haven't been less engaged since reading 'A Farewell to Arms'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully better as a movie!","review":"Wow, I only finished this book because I kept hoping at some point it would get better, it didn't. I am in a book club and most everyone in the club did not even get 100 pages into it before they tossed it aside. One girl even returned the book to Borders where she had bought it. So, borrow it from the library if you must read it. Amazing how some things become popular, like sagging your pants, I just don't get it. If you want to read a real drama that will pull at every place of your heart, I suggest Kite Runner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If I feel like I gained something, anything, from a book after I finish it, I usually say I liked the book. I gained NOTHING from reading this book. No character development, poor historical context and descriptions, boring predictable story. Sentences were structured well and the book had the potential for a decent story, that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star.Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point already, Ian!","review":"If there was a zero star rating, I would've chosen that.I have no problem with long, descriptive books, being a Michener fan. (I've read Hawaii and several of his superlong books.) But this book takes FOREVER to get the supposedly pivotal event. (It doesn't happen until at least halfway through the book.)This book is an exercise in self-indulgence by the author. It's the written equivalent of someone who likes to talk just to hear himself talk.One of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great works of contemporary fiction","review":"An example of the book being sooooo much better than the movie. I loved the film \\"Atonement\\", but boy am I glad I read the book first!One of my alltime favorite fiction books. Absolutely mindblowing, and for those not familiar with the plot, I will not spoil it. Just read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, great descriptions but a bit labored, no?","review":"I'm not sorrry I plowed through this book, but I sure wouldn't give it a great review. \\"Atonement\\" is so crammed with (yes, beautiful) details that I found it claustrophobic and too dense. I wasn't crazy about the way McEwen leapt through time either, didn't register with me as true, not even true, certainly far from the best fiction. I don't recommend buying this. If you must see what all the fuss is about, go to a library.What the fuss is about is his natural talent, obvious hard work and character development. I know that sounds like more than enough but for me it was decidedly less than enough. 2 stars only"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizing","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to end. I had heard that it started off slowly but eventually picked up. That never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Form of Torture!","review":"This is the first book I've read by Ian McEwan, and I absolutely hated it. Surprisingly, I did venture later to read another of his books, Amsterdam, which I enjoyed. In Atonement, the circumstances of the plot are not revealed until the middle of the book by which time the reader is totally frustrated by, for example, two-paragraph descriptions of the way the sunlight appeared on the garden lawn. I finished the book with increasing irritation only because I felt I deserved to know the ending. However, I was very disappointed. Evidently, whatever McEwan was trying to convey does not mesh with my concept of atonement."},{"rating":"2","title":"See This One Through","review":"Part One of this novel is slow going. Had I not trusted the author from reading a previous book (Saturday), I might not have continued. This would have been a travesty. Part Two picked up the action and intensity in the war scenes, and Part Three tied it all together with one of the most elegant, haunting and surprising endings I've experienced.After experiencing the ending, you will realize that Part One had to be written the way it was for the book to have resonated so powerfully. It laid the necessary groundwork for development of the novel's themes: reality versus perception, honesty versus artistic creativity, and real life versus fictional creation.I watched the movie after reading the novel and was also impressed with the film adaptation. Beautiful cinematography, great acting, and a good sense of time and place. The movie did, however, feel choppier than the novel, as it was harder to blend the three parts into one seamless narrative as well as Mcewan did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best book I've ever read.","review":"And I read a LOT of books.At turns I found myself audibly gasping, laughing, and crying.This is an amazing read full of deeply realized characters whose internal dialogue captures what it is to be a human being.Yep. I've just decided: \\"Atonement\\" is definately the best book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated- too wordy","review":"I chose this book because it had won so many awards and was disappointed. Although cleverly written (in the different voices/writing style of characters), I had to force myself to focus to get through the first 150 pages. It was like Briony was trying so hard to show that she was intelligent, she used unbelievably big words and took forever to describe something that could have been said in a few words. Once the story started to move, I enjoyed it and have decided it was worth the effort to finish it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overworked and Overlong","review":"I expected much more from this book based on the glowing recommendations. Character development is a hopscotch of scenes with no logical connection, growth, or explanation when characters do an about face in perspective and feelings. Emotional shifts are unexplained. The first section of the book was removed and distant. The story finally captured my attention in the middle section. If it had not been the book selected by my book club, I would have abandoned it within the first 100 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"First part is the best","review":"I was completely captivated by the first part of the book. Theimagery, the inner thoughts were some of the best writting Ihave experienced in quite a while. Even though I could maybe seewhere the story was going, it was not predictable. There weremany surprises.The Second part was also very good, but I wasn't sure how it relatedto the main plot at first.The third part started the downhill trend.I thought the epilog was going to be bad, but after some reflectionit made a few good points that I thought about for the next fewdays. I really did feel a longing for the way things weere back in the early part of the story.There is a lot of food for thought here. A simple read is not sufficient.Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Progression of Narration","review":"Atonement begins as a sublime, exquisite piece of fiction depicting a time long gone, then transitions into a quite a different story altogether, making the reader wonder if the same author wrote both parts. The third section then brings a resolution of sorts which, if not as powerfully affecting as I would have liked, shows us much about the power of stories, and of why writers write. To go into any specific detail would be to ruin the effect of this original and poignant novel. Not the perfect book it is touted as being, but not one to be passed by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Innovative","review":"This book is divided into three parts, the first of which has quite a different style--much slower with more stream of consciousness (but not too much). However, the book as a whole is cohesive. As the main character suggests about her own writing, the first part of the book (which some describe as plodding) owes much to Virginia Woolf's style, but not so much that the reader has a difficult time figuring out what is going on. I think the first part of the book is the manuscript that Briony submits to a publisher around the time she begins nursing. Thus, while the style is somewhat confusing, it helps us to understand the characters more--Briony herself, and also those around her who form the tragic events of the novel. Perhaps I am mistaken! The \\"twist\\" at the end was truly beautiful and tragic, without being \\"cute\\" (like the ending of Amsterdam). I highly recommend this book for plot, style, and innovation on the form of the novel itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why pay more for e-book?","review":"Of all formats offered, the Kindle version is (by several dollars) the most expensive. Why is that? There are no costs for printing, binding, transporting, storing, shipping, etc. I really prefer buying Kindle books to paper books, but can not justify the higher cost for this novel. I really hope Amazon figures out how to price Kindle books more fairly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly wordy and utterly annoying.","review":"Reading this book made me feel like I was reading it for a book report for school. It is so utterly wordy that getting through it feels like you're being sucked back by each phrase like a swamp. Swampy. This book is swampy. I couldn't get through it. It is so over the top in explaining the minute details of things that you forget what the hell the point of it all is. Many times I had to re-read passages to understand what was going on. It's a muddy mess of a book, and I threw it out. \\"National Bestseller\\" my left cheek!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I loved this book. I thought it was complex and rich and satisfying. I have already recommended it to several of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atonement: Could have been a good book but","review":"The first 20% of the book (Kindle reader) was enjoyable: then the author decided that sex needed to be the focus of the story. It ruined it. Too bad. The story line was interesting. I liked the characters, but after sex became the story line it was ruined - sent it to kindle's storage room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful beyond belief","review":"This book has so much potential. It was an interesting idea, the characters were excellent, and McEwan is an excellent writer. Why, you may ask then, did I give it only two stars? The Answer is the detail. There is WAY to much of it. The paragraphs go on and on like some kind of infernal device designed to destory my love of reading and my sanity. This book could have been about 1/3 the length without changing the plot. It's like trying to read a bad combination of \\"The Scarlet letter\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". You get the amazingly long and boring descriptions of TSL and the pointless descriptions of upper class characters that are impossible to relate to. I don't know what McEwan was trying to prove when he wrote this book, but all he proved to me is that this book is filled with pretentious [***] that only arrogent snobs with too much time on their hands can enjoy. Those of us who deal in reality will not enjoy this novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull To The Point Of Being Insipid","review":"This book fails to live up to expectations. The novel is so dull and dreary and worse, the characters lack the necessary spine for this reader to have any sympathy with them. The characters are all too typical - the man of the man working to the point he has little contact with his family, the wife, a 'migraine' sufferer; read invalid of the type one finds in the Pre-Raphaelite Era. So bad was this book, I never completed it because I simply didn't care what happened or didn't happen. My suggestion to potential buyers of this book is to spend the money on another book and leave this one where I did, in with the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be, back to the library","review":"I didn't care to much for this book, I really was falling asleep and had to put it down after Leon (first 51 pages)came home. I didn't find it interesting and it couldn't hold my attention. I'm amazed at how people have such diverse opinions about this book, this interests more than the reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good book for a first novel...!","review":"Ok, it's not his first but it reads like one. Very pedestrian, borish. The details are charming, a bit Waugh-ish without the humor, but because I knew Briony did something for which she would then atone I wasn't able to _read_, I was waiting for the event which wasn't realistically terrible. I didn't find it or the aftermath credible. The writing isn't really that bad but the story is told in a postmodern way that's almost cliche by now--how many novels do we need that are told from different perspectives? It's not new, it's not fresh, it doesn't inspire me to want to read more of his works. This was my first McEwan and, unless my husband who loved this book forces me, it's my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but hardly deserving of all the praise","review":"This was an ok book. The premise is compelling, but the writing is so dense. I almost gave up after about a quarter of the book because I couldn't tell what it was about. Pages and pages go by without anything happening. I kept reading because I wanted to know how it turned out but it was painful along the way. This story probably would've made a great novella. Plus it's depressing, although one should surmise that in advance given its title."},{"rating":"2","title":"could have been better","review":"This book is beautifully written...it is slow in the beginning, but it gets more interesting as the story goes on... not his best novel, but it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deeply Moving and Beautifully Written Book","review":"This is an amazingly good book. The narrative begins at a manor house in England in the mid-1930s, subsequently shifts to the battlefield and to London during World War II, and briefly ends with a family reunion in 1999. Each of these settings is vividly and movingly presented, but even more significant is McEwan's ability to convey the rich internal lives and differing perspectives of his characters. The book might seem a bit slow at first, as McEwan elaborately sets the stage for everything that follows. But once the first critical event occurs, it is almost impossible not to wonder and care about what will happen next. Almost every scene is perfect and affecting, and the ending (which I will not spoil) is exactly right."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is exhausting","review":"The only reason that I forced myself through to the end of this book is because it was a gift from someone. (I'm guessing they tried to read it first and decided to re-gift because it was dreadful.) The author has some perverse fascination with describing every tiny detail of every scene, no matter how irrelevant those details are to the story. Three pages for a woman to decide which dress to wear. Not kidding. That's all that happened, for three pages. I got through the second part by reading 2-3 sentences off of each page. The majority of it is entirely useless. It is impossible to like any of the characters, in part because the author did not make me like them, but mostly because I was so angry with this book I didn't care what happened to any of them. Any sympathy you might have felt for Briony vanishes with the self-aggrandizing ending. I am just so glad to be done with this book. I think I deserve some sort of literary prize just for reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mishmash of themes","review":"I read this for my book club and was looking forward to it, based on all the buzz about book and movie.It's certainly an interesting literary excercise because the way the plot twists and turns and the different points of view. I enjoy reading novels that are set in the English countryside.But for me, it wsan't a good read. I thought it might be a love story with conflict. It's wasn't much of a love story, it wasn't a coming of age story and it wasn't a war story. Yet there are elements of each in this book, but it felt disjointed. I didn't really care about Dunkirk. I was glad when the lovers re-connected -- but that was just a figment of Briony's imagination.I didn't find the ending uplifting, because it didn't happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the effort","review":"Like several of the other reviews I've read on this site, I agree that the beginning of the book is somewhat difficult to get through. The first 50-100 pages took me a while to read, due to the long descriptions, difficult vocabulary at times (at least for me!), and the lack of direction in the story. But once it picks up, it picks up fast! I read the last two-thirds of the book in one day - a few hours on a plane. I was completely absorbed in it, and it definitely touched me. It forces you to think about many different emotions and topics, and it gets you to really understand each of the main characters in a way that most books do not. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"McEwans Best?","review":"I'm not sure, being an Enduring Love fan myself, but this was hands down the best new book I read in 2002. McEwan's writing is beautiful, soulful, passionate. Even though it's an easy read, make yourself slow down to truly appreciate the ambiance and subtleties of McEwan's prose.The ending. . . I still think about it, it stays in the back of your head. For those who didn't like the ending. . . perhaps this book was too sophisticated for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending broke the spell","review":"I found the ending destructive to the story. I wish that the final thoughts, questions, premise, etc. would have evolved within the readers minds without such blatant delineation.Sorry, but the story wasn't as startling as the critics reviews (hype)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art trumps life","review":"Atonement is a tedious novel. The author was told as a youngster that he had a penchant for detail. Is it ever given in an excruciating manner with no purpose in sight. Most importantly, the author should have read Kundera's book \\"The Joke\\" and would have learned that one must stand up for inequity at the moment, not years past, otherwise your life is meaningless. Consequently, the novel is morally corrupt. McEwan has the character Briony choosing to write a story over speaking out for her wrongdoings. Two people die as a consequence of her actions. Furthermore, McEwan presents a novel as fiction, then disguised as Briony, declares that these are merely words and they shouldn't be taken seriously and if so, the writer is like God so atonement is not neccessary. It's a poor blending of fiction and reality. So if McEwan is your friend in real life, he'll choose a good story out of it and leave you hanging out to dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Torture","review":"Absolutely hated this book. I didn't read it all the way through, but I figure 260 pages of literary torture was enough. How this book has been so well received and turned out a movie is beyond my comprehension. This book was entirely inaccessible and boring. I hated the long winded laments on architecture and gardens and I hated and didn't identify with any of the characters. This has been the worst book I've read in a decade at least.After finding out the ending to this book after getting half way through it, I realized that the end could never justify the means. Many people disagree with this, but I just can't be bothered to read the rest of this book as it's more effective than ambien at putting me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty","review":"Ageing starry-eyed yuppies will eat this solipsistic-self infatuated sugar tart of a book right up as it's passed from sweaty palm to palm through all the precious literary boutiques frequented by urban liberal elites. The snob appeal is impressive; every faddish academic/critic will want one to maintain good social odor with their colleagues, dour men of letters who missed out on the Nobel Prize who specialize in the sexual anxieties of financial planners (zzzzz), and trendy California newspapers soliciting manuscripts for 30 something movie studio executives who crave \\"serious\\" recognition and full page advertising for Oscar nominations. Those who believe the life-style choices of arrogant prep school frat boys is anything but the posturing of conceited social climbers will enjoy this trashy melodrama. A contrived, pretentious bore of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Acclaimed Mediocrity","review":"ATONEMENT demonstrates again that, when she filled her pockets with stones and walked into the river, Virginia Woolf took the English novel with her.ATONEMENT is a mediocre book, unqualifiedly in love with its own prose, which is workmanlike. Both the narrator and the characters signal their punches throughout, so when we discover, at the end, that one of the characters, a highly acclaimed writer, IS the author of the book, that the book is her atonement, then we feel that those she punished have been punished doubly so.ATONEMENT presumes its readers are rather dense, won't see right away that Paul is the one who raped Briony's cousin nor that she will marry him. Are English readers dense? are they terribly distracted? they cannot be as dense as McEwen presumes.Anyway, if you seek a contemporary British novel, highly acclaimed but actually run-of-the-mill, then try ATONEMENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read in 2002","review":"This book was a gift, and I had no idea what it was about before I starting reading it. By the end of the book, I was blown away--I had to take a long walk and think about it all. This a beautifully written book, and the story was amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot more than it seems","review":"On the face of it, a very simple plotline, but there's a lot going on, and the lyrical and dense descriptive writing of things, places, emotions, feelings is a pleasure to read. One definitely needs to like this style of writing, and the 1st half of the book can occasionally drag somewhat with the richness of the text sometimes compelling me to speed-read through various descriptive passages, despite their being beautifully written. The 2nd half of the book reads much faster, and the twist at the end really gives the story beautiful closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book alot. After seeing the movie, I am so glad I read the book. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tremendous disappointment!","review":"I picked up this particular book, because one of my favorite novelist, Chris Bohjalian, recommended it at a book signing. I found the book difficult to get through and considered abandoning it altogether at times. I kept waiting for an unforgivable crime to take place, and when it did, it was hardly unforgivable, as it was committed by a 13 yr old girl. As such, the \\"atonement\\" failed to live up to the title. Although the book has literary value, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I really didn't care for this book. So wordy. I ended up skipping large portions of the book and then seeing how it ended. Pretty much a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending is worth enduring the beginning","review":"The first half of the book was not the best. It was slow and slightly boring for me. But the second half was good, and the ending great. I get that the beginning is needed for the ending to make sense, didn't know that till the end tho. Worth reading overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very english novel","review":"I would imagaine that the detail and history which inhabits Atonement may perhaps be a little unfamiliar to some american readers, but then again it is a world often visited by literature.The first part of the novel set in the english country house, portarys a vision of pre-war england which has been presented many times before, McEwan has put a little spin on this, but subtely.The second book dealing with the evacuation from Dunkirk was excellent, and the strongest segement, leading nicely into the penultimate moving back to england.The last part McEwan puts on his clever novelist hat again, and adds a quick sting in the tail.very much a playing with novels within a a novel and storytelling about stories, ultimately could have been more satisfying, but still an enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Novel Lives!","review":"This novel is a work of art. The author knows what he's doing. He's created memorable characters, riveting descriptions, a very good plot, and has thoroughly entertained the reader. Strongly recommended. The novel lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"McKewan Teaches Us About the Cost of Premature Judgment","review":"Something happened at my work recently in which someone really scrwed up. I was reading this novel at the time. The approach of the novel suggested I try to imagine my co-worker's behvavior from his perspective. I did, and it really helped me in dealing with the clean-up of the mess and in confronting the person. There is often a narrative that explains actions that seem to have evil intent, but don't. This novel gives us a rich canvas on which we can explore this message and many others.Thank you Ian McKewan for writing a novel that changed me.The audio version read by Jill Tanner is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"NINE chapters before the 'incident' actually occurs. I almost threw the book out the window.The last half was certainly more interesting than the first but I'm not sure it was worth the aggravation of getting there. Don't waste your money on a hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating, overdescriptive, disappointing","review":"The first three chapters are so aggravatingly descriptive- from the weather to the fountain to the grounds,etc- that I was often thrown from the initial thought and I found myself skimming through to find some substance to the actual storyline. Parts two and three were easier reads but still a little too drawn out. And of course a disappointing conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You","review":"A monumentally beautiful novel, it stayed with me for many weeks after I had finished it. Vivid, haunting, incendiary, \\"Atonement\\" creates a separate world which I felt I had paid a brief visit to. It is difficult to convey in a \\"review\\" the power of this book, I can only hope that it may help someone make the rewarding decision to also become immersed in this reality. This is not a book one can or should try to rush through, not a page turner, but that should not deter you from a truly great work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but......","review":"Without a doubt, this is a well written, well plotted, novel with compelling character development. Everything about it should have left the reader with a satisfying read.Unfortunetly, the author decided it would be more clever to create an ending that sets the entire preceeding chapters on their ear and leaves the reader not only feeling topsy turvy, but somehow also cheated...probably as much as the main characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsettling","review":"I had to put this novel down halfway through, as I found it a bit unsettling. It wouldn't let me stay away for long, though; I'm glad I picked it up again. McEwan's writing gets under your skin -- a good thing, since most novels are forgotten once you put them down. Rich, fleshed-out characters and situations. You spend a great deal of the novel trying to decide if you love or hate the little girl at the center of this story. Engaging and well-crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This book came highly recommended, so I was excited to read it. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. While it is obvious that McEwan is a creative and artistic writer, his book does nothing to hold one's interest. Pages of unnecessary description and little action make \\"Atonement\\" a painfully slow read. Fortunately, things pick up a bit in parts II, III and IV (191 pages into the book), but not enough to make reading it worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book ever","review":"I have tried on at least 4 occasions to read this book, and am still unable to fight through the first 100 pages. Lack of any interisting story, and a less than engaging lead character make this book next to impossible to enjoy. The highlight of the first 100 pages is the young female lead character getting in and out of a fountain. What can I say, but don't waste your money, BORING BORING BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure torture is right!","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who were left wondering why this book has gotten such good reviews. At best it was tedious; at worst simply boring. Silly plot, plodding descriptions of a confusing profusion of characters, none well enough drawn to draw us into their lives--it was difficult, right to the end of the book, to keep them straight. A huge disappointment after all the hype surrounding this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"a confused, powerless story","review":"\\"Atonement\\" is, in book-jacket terms, the panoramic story of a lie that profoundly alters the lives of those it touches. It is divided into three parts. The first tells the story of the lie: its background, why it was told, who told it. The last two show the lie's unfolding consequences.For all its careful planning, the book falls short. The first part is excellent: well-written, engaging, full of vibrant characters and an interesting story. The remainder, however, fails to live up to the beginning's promise. The second part of the book is almost devoid of plot, leaving the third part to clumsily resume and conclude the story. By then its emotion is diffused, and the book ends carelessly, trying to be powerful and succeeding only in being amusing and somewhat sad.\\"Atonement\\" is worth reading only for the lush preparation of its first part. The rest of the book in its meandering is - like the story itself - a lesson in waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was all the fuss about?","review":"I must agree with the previous reviewer...it was pure torture. I stayed with it only because of so many glowing reviews, saying to myself, \\"The good part is just around the corner.\\" It never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused about the Hype","review":"I have picked up many books and put them down without ever reading them through, usually with the thought \\"That's the worst book I've ever had the mis-fortune to try reading\\". With this book, I forced myself to read it though simply because it's supposed to be an award winning novel and so fantastic that they are making a film of it. I hope they have better luck with the film...because when I say I forced myself to read the story, I was thinking when I finished it \\"That's the worst book I've ever had the mis-fortune to read through it's entirety\\".Don't get me wrong, it had a few events that held you for a page or two, but overall, the story was so wordy that usually by the time you reached the bottom of the page you were forgetting what was going on and having to read it again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painter of Pictures","review":"I have great respect for writers who use words in interesting ways, to paint pictures and tell stories from a unique perspective. Ian McEwan is a master, and I enjoyed Atonement although it did drag a bit. I have also found another writer whose words intrigue me. Were Robert Frost or Claude Monet to employ pen or brush to craft an epic love story, Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin would be the creation. Martin's lyrical prose fuses the drama of The Bridges of Madison County with the emotional weight of The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. McEwan and Martin provide a fine complement, McEwan dealing with heavier material while Martin soars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordiness for wordiness' sake","review":"So the first 70 pages took forever to get through. It started picking up, but I didn't think the wordiness was worth the effort and didn't help the plot. The writing was beautiful, but beautiful writing that doesn't help advance the plot? What's the point? McEwan describes so much, so much that doesn't matter!!!! I thought this book was mostly boring, and had a very self important feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good investment","review":"The overall state of the book was perfect, though the book had to travel a large distance it had no damage at all!!!The novell itself is allright though very psichological to my liking. You can learn enough of the second world war from a very particular point of view. It's entertaining and very educative.Recomendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"bucking the trend","review":"I was very disappointed in the book and gave up before the end of the first long section. A few moments are well-rendered, but the story is riddled with cliches and overused devices. A sex scene is particularly overwritten, and the writing style is indistinguishable from a cheap romance.my 2 cents"},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat disappointing","review":"Atonement was highly recommended from a review I saw on TV- I was surprised at how slow the story moves --- it was in slo-mo for the first half -- then the war part dragged along. The ending is Ok, but not worthy of the high praise it had received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding & Boring","review":"Another literary darling falls off my radar screen. I am always looking for good authors and good writing, but this novel plodded along at its own slooowwwww pace, a sure cure for insomnia, but hardly entertaining and downright maddening at times. It takes until page 150 to get to the climax scene where Briony mistakes a display of passion for rape. By then I had ceased caring about the characters, if I ever had - spoiled rich Brits on their country estate waiting for something to happen. I was not overly wowed by the writing style either along the way by this suppossedly superior author. Blah, blah blah and on and on he driveled. Alas, I am putting it down for good this time. Time to take it back to the half price bookstore and salvage at least something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"I read reviews before buying this book and was excited to get reading. About halfway through the book, and many yawns later I put this book down for good.The plot was very unstimulating, I could have cared less as to what happened to any of the characters. There was way too much discription and no real substance.This book was a waste of money and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was his editor??","review":"A talented writer--an awful story.There is no doubt Mr. McEwan can write--some of his prose is magical. But how depressing to read a whole book about how a child's mistake ruins two lives. And how tedious to re-read the detailed events from so many points of view (especially from the mother--how many descriptions of her migraines did we really need?) I wish his editor had been a bit braver and done some cutting. But even if the poor editor had, I fear I still would have found the novel slow and pointlessly sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atonement","review":"I selected this book because of the rave reviews and numerous awards it received. HOW?????? I could NOT get through it. Too many words to describe too little of anything. I will never pick up another Ian McEwan novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try As I Might, I Could Not Get Into This Book","review":"I have three words for this one: plodding, plodding and plodding. It's a big seller at the bookstores, and I've *heard* it's great. I asked around and was told to hang tight and just try to keep going. But I kept getting Very Very Sleepy...Three more words: Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment!!","review":"Suprisingly dull, completely unsatisfactory! I really wish I had saved my money and my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of telling, no showing","review":"I've read about a third of this book, and I can't understand all the positive reviews. The author uses many words to say very little; it's all exposition with very little dialogue in the entire book (I flipped through, thinking there had to be more dialogue coming up). I'm not pulled into the plot nor do I feel any attachment to any character, not even Briony. I had high hopes for the book. The summary read very interesting, but I'm giving the rest of it a miss and moving on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"I had to force myself to get through the book. The author spends too much time on his writing style and not enough on the plot. I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book.","review":"The story itself is interesting, I'll give it that. But by the end, all I wanted to do was hold it open face-down, and shake it until all the unnecessary and superfluous description that took of 75 percent of the book sprinkled out. It was slow to start, but my book club promised that once you get past the first 200 pages, it really picks up. It did pick up, but I was overwhelmingly disappointed and felt absolutely no connection to a single character."},{"rating":"1","title":"so incredibly disappointing","review":"perhaps the hype surrounding this book was too intense. i waited about 3 months to retrieve this book through the library system and several times i debated buying it just so i could feel part of the critical adulation of this book. boy, i would have been so sad if i had actually paid for this book! i hated all the characters right from the beginning and found all that foreboding to be totally obnoxious. i wish someone could just explain to me the merits of \\"atonement.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and predictable","review":"What an overrated piece of soap-operatic junk! I can't recall when I was so disappointed in a book. With all the accolades, I was expecting something really special (tho' I should know better by now, as commercial/popular success seems these days to be inversely related to quality). While the prose itself is nice, the entire book hangs on an event that occurs early on and is so contrived and unbelievable, with an outcome that is so predictable, that it was difficult for me to keep reading -- and the only reason I did keep reading was because I kept hoping it would get better, that an intelligent and complex structure would ultimately emerge to justify the contrivance and its predictability -- but alas, it never does. I can't get into specifics without giving away details that shouldn't be revealed to those who still want to read this trash, but if you're looking for an intelligent read with some substance and honesty, DON'T read this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Atonement \\" was not for me","review":"I can't understand how anyone liked this book, but it's good we have diverse tastes, I guess. I can't add much to previous reviewers who also hated this book, except that I found that even the rare interesting parts were completely unbelievable. Does anyone really believe that a first kiss would lead to first sex moments later, in the library, standing up, and with family nearby no less? I don't think so. And then would Lola and her \\"rapist\\", who turns out to be her boyfriend, really be in the mood to engage in the act while searching for her lost brothers? I skimmed most everything after the first 30 pages, because I kept expecting it to get better. If it hadn't been a gift from a close friend, I wouldn't have attempted to wade through the drivel at all. I'll rent the DVD eventually when I have a free rental coming up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I cannot remember the last time I was so disappointed with a book. Atonement lacked substance and continuity both with its characters and storyline. I stuck with it until the end and threw it down in disgust. Rarely have I been so disenchanted with a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Can't wait until my Netflix comes so I can stop reading. I'm hoping the movie is better. So far, just snoreville and seems to be going nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The eye of the beholder and consequences","review":"This is a story of a young girl who is trying to balance a lively imagination with the innocent morality of youth with family loyalities with social prejudices of society. The telling of Briony's actions based on her perception of reality is fascinating. The story is frightening also, how lives can be changed forever due to actions with no ill intent.The reader is left to decide if Briony has atoned for her actions. The reader is the beholder and decides the consequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you know it's based off a book, read the book before the movie...","review":"I really wish I would've known about the book before seeing the movie, because of course I would've read the novel first. Because I saw the movie first, the book seemed a bit drawn out, overly descriptive and tedious. I felt like I could skip a few paragraphs, or even pages, and still not have missed out on the overall plot. This is a great reason I don't like watching the movies before reading the book. That said, I did absolutely love the original story line and overall plot. The exploitation of a child's innocence was taken in a grim view of over-fantasized dramatic life sequences that played off of that child's objection to reality, and later, guilt. This novel is quite the page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I expected so much more from this book, given the glowing reviews on amazon and in the media. The first part is very well written, especially when describing the house and gardens and the English countryside on a summer day shortly before WWII.However, most of the characters are so annoying, exept Robbie. And how is it that the police believe the story of a 13 year old child, resulting in a man being sent to jail? Surely they would and should investigate somewhat more closely and thoroughly, despite the class difference of the accuser and the accused? I had a hard time swallowing this.The book moves very slowly and the ending, which I unfortunately envisioned as one of the scenarios, was very unsatisfying - but most likely the only possible one. Nobody really atoned, though. I wished I had gotten the book at the library first, as I finally gave it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book vs Movie?","review":"I found that the movie was very thorough and from what I remember of the book, it's also very close. The book, however, of course, does explain the story behind the vase that gets broken and things like that, but I'm not sure if it's any better or worse than the movie. So if you like reading things then read the book, but if you like watching the movies better then the movie is so close you might want to do that :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Reading....","review":"It took a while for me to plunge through this book. Most of that time was spent on the first 100 pages. I never thought I'd be giving it five stars, but I encourage you to keep reading. The author uses a lot of words and it seemed to me at first that he spent way too much time describing the simplest of things. Soon I got used to his style and found it captivating. I haven't seen the movie and find myself wondering just how it could be made into a movie and be nearly as good as the book. This would be a good book for a study group or literature class."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARRRRGGGGGGHHHH !!!","review":"Brioney Tallis is one of the most despicable, manipulative, outrageously egotisical characters to ever grace the page...Ian McEwan is a master of creation....Who was the inspiration for this monster of a girl- woman? There are are many real- life Briony's off the page. Sadley, real Life Briony's exist OFF the page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Embodiment","review":"I would start my review with a summary of the book, but I believe other reviewers have more than covered for that. What particularly captured me about McEwan's novel was that McEwan's own writing directly reflected that of the aspiring writer, Briony. He described how she used odd, yet interesting adjectives to set up situations, and he does exactly this at times. He is truly gifted at not only setting up extremely creative stories, but at completing the full embodiment of these stories at every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help for insomniacs","review":"I wish I had read the reviews here on Amazon before I picked it up. Had I seen the various comments toward Woolf I would have run away screaming. For those who enjoy overdescriptive multisyllabic \\"in the moment\\" writings, this book will be a joy. Personally I have already lived through (aka had been forced to) reading Woolf -- and I don't have to anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't understand all the big words, it's just downright annoying to be distracted by them. When I read I want to become so engrossed in the story that I forget I'm reading. With this book, that doesn't happen for me; I'm instead bored with the colorless characters and incessant descriptions of their surroundings. I will probably donate this to the local book drive where some poor kid will have to read it for school.. at least he won't have to pay full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....too much fluff","review":"This could have been a very good book because is it shocking what the little girl does and consequences that result from it.

It was very boring.First, take the book, some 350 pages & flip through it looking through the words---see many quotes for conversations??That's because there aren't many! That's one problemSecond, start reading if you like, then start to notice that the author uses 20 words to describe something where one work would have sufficed. Then notice that this goes on, on EVERY page!!This book could have been shortened up to probably 150 pages. Easy!I had a very hard time getting through this book. I love to read, and have a nice size vocab, but come on!!!I'll admit the ending was interesting though. Curiosity kept me going to see what would happen"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of paper","review":"this is another strange book by ian mcewan,it features the misinterpretation of a young girl named Briony and her false accusation of the man who raped her cousin.it is cleverly divided into different time periods;1935,1939 and 1999 therefore showing the events leading up to world war 2 and during and after.it includes startling and accurate viewpoints from nurses and soldiers.i think this book is only let down by ian mcewans habit of rambling on and over analysing a situation or feeling. not a bad read but uneventful and slightly dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overwritten Bore","review":"On the recommendation of a friend and its literary reputation, I wasted two nights ploughing through the first 85 pages of this book and skimming another 20 before I gave up entirely. It had the \\"literary\\" quality of endlessly describing the unimportant - details which might be interesting if you cared about any of these people, but I did not. I agree, the first chapter was charming. But nothing after it gave me a single reason to want to waste more time with these characters and their torturous, petty, over-analyzed lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Moby Dick","review":"I've slogged through Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Hardy, and a host of other lengthy, meandering classics, but I could not get through this.Many, many people have praised the writing in this novel. It read like a high school sophomore's stab at Very Important Writing--lots of pretentious descriptions about whatever caught a character's eye, but not much else. When the Briony character immersed herself in the fountain to get the pieces of vase that were broken in there, I had to put the book down. Had Briony ever heard of bending over and reaching into the fountain? Did this job really require a total-body immersion? This plot \\"development\\" and so much else in the book strained credibility to the breaking point.In short, Mr. McEwan seems to have confused writing copious detail with providing a substantive plot or believable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atonement by Ian McEwan","review":"My wife bought the book because it was highly rated. She read it then told me that I had to read it because it was good. It didn't take long before I was bored. 15 pages in I wanted to quit! But I kept reading hoping that it would get better. By page 33 I said to my wife that I wasn't going to read it. She laughed. She said she wanted to see how far I would get, how soon I would quit. I read 2-3 books a week and I have read some boring books but why should I?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Wonderful Book, Read It, Not The Reviews","review":"I cannot believe the audacity of reviewers to give away the brilliant twists of this novel. Please do not risk spoiling some of the shine of the book by wading through these reviews.Having said that, this is a favorite and the best work by a very talented author. I have enjoyed McEwan's other books, but Atonement was the most engaging. I think this was the most heartbreaking book I have ever read.The clever way the book is written is not cheap or gimmicky, and McEwan leads you along the story, telling the reader quite plainly that terrible things are going to happen. But this is not just a gloomy, ominous book. It is a wonderful love story and, obviously, a story of redemption. He called it his Jane Austen book, but I really thought it felt like the best of Hemingway, but with far more heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but not flawless","review":"Unlike some readers, I do think this book was quite predictable. Certain little nuances in the text intimated what was to come.That is not the point.McEwan gives no implication that he wishes to surprise the reader with an unpredictable ending.His merit is in his ability to create an extremely psychologically challenging book.Good art makes you question.McEwan did so.Having said that, there is an element of the contrived in this novel, and if you are looking for something completely novel, you will be disappointed (excuse the pun).It should have won the Booker over Vernon God Little."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Did I Miss?","review":"It took me over a week to slog (and I DO mean \\"slog\\"!) through this book. It was with great anticipation that I bought it, after having read so many rave reviews, but what a disappointment. The first part was so tedious, I could barely get through it ...... . On I slogged, nonetheless, searching for something to care about in any of the characters, waiting for something - anything - of interest to happen. While some of the prose was beautifully written, the actual story had no flow or coherence. I didn't feel the characters were fleshed out in any way ....Within 10 or so pages of the end, I could have happily put the book down and not even bothered to finish it. I am a voracious reader and I don't recall having felt that way about another book I've read. You get the point.

Instead Mr. McKewan douses the plot in unnecessary prose to the point I didn't care about the characters or the story. I just wanted to scream...get to the point already!

In short, the book is a luminous, finely crafted work of art, as exquisite - and fragile - as the vase which plays a crucial role in the plot.Don't compare it to McEwan's other novels. Forget BIRDSONG too. Read ATONEMENT for what it is, and like many readers you will discover a masterpiece, a beautiful artifice that at its heart is also about the act of writing itself.And here's another tip from VN to heighten your reading pleasure: draw yourself a diagram of the household and grounds, and watch how McEwan artfully stage manages the comings and goings of his characters in part one. What a delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atonement","review":"Very hard to follow and very hard to keep interested.

I'm glad I did, although knowing there was a surprise ending gave a good portion of the surprise away fairly early in the book. I would definitely recommend reading the book prior to seeing the film.McEwan keeps your interest riveted throughout the shifts in time and place that occur in the novel with strongly etched characters, and deep philosophical ruminations. It's a rewarding literary journey, but I have to admit feeling sad, and empty at the end..intellectually enlightened, but emotionally drained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good as everyone makes it out to be","review":"The book is terribly boring.

Save your time--go buy Webster\`s ........."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic excuse for literature","review":"This book completely blew me away with the fact that the main charactor never ever uses the word tractor. This was about the only thing I enjoyed in the book. As a professor of micrefonology I was shocked at the way roosters are portrayed in this book.In short, I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves pumpkin pie.Thank you,Professor Horace Montgomery"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Novel On Guilt, Atonement and Absolution","review":"Quite simply this is the finest novel from Ian McEwan that I've read, replete with much of his eloquent, poetic prose. Although one may not be initially compelled by the characters, most notably the protagonist Briony Tallis, the author creates a captivating, mesmerizing look at English country life near the eve of World War II. And then he skips ahead a few years, immersing us in the bloody aftermath of the fall of France and the British retreat from Dunkirk, where he picks up anew the tangled web of intrigue surrounding the lives of Briony, her older sister Cecilia and their neighbor Robbie Turner. Some may question the novel's brief epitaph-like ending, towards the close of the 20th Century, but here the author dwells on the choices - or lack thereof - made by his protagonist. Without divulging more details of the plot, this splendid novel is a powerful contemporary exploration of guilt, atonement and absolution; one which shouldn't be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and compelling","review":"Atonement is one of those novels that takes you to another place and leaves you there, long after the cover is closed. These characters will linger in your thoughts as you work out their choices and consequences and fates. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling read, well worth it.","review":"Atonement is a delicious tale of the mind of a young girl in the 1930's.Through her window, her older sister Cecilia, and family friend Robbie are standing by the garden fountain until Cecila strips of her clothes and disappears in.What this young girl sees, and the incidents that follow, make for a compelling read that made me do little else until I had devoured every last word.A delightfully intruiging tale that takes you back to the era of flawless manners where a lady never eats whilst standing and men always where coats to dinner.Proof perfect that life, is not all that it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my top 5 list!","review":"I loved this book, I would say it's one of my favorites, I would put it up there with 'To Kill a Mockingbird' - the author has the same ability to really get into every charachter and even writing as a young girl, he really pulls it off! I was totally engrossed in young Briony's world. In our book club, although everyone loved the book, people were split as to which parts they liked best (it's almost 3 stories in one), but we did all agree that at times there is too much detail (hence the 4 stars rather than 5!). Still, it's such a clever premise, the final chapter is especially moving - this is a novel that you could read again and again and see something new every time. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's satire folks!","review":"Many reviewers don't seem to get what McEwan is doing here. The first, tightly written first section (highly praised by most reviewers) is McEwan writing. The rest (roundly criticized by many) is satire. It is Briony writing in the overblown style we are warned to expect in the first section. The trick McEwan has to pull-off is to make Briony's writing sufficiently readable to drag the reader through to the final denouement. In my view his attempt at satire fails. It is too over the top and too long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One-time ceasefire","review":"Atonement was assigned reading this semester in my contemporary fiction class and, for once, every single person in class fell in love with it. I've NEVER seen overeducated lit students and good genuine people unite like that. On the Touchingly Surreal scale, it was like the Christmas Truce or something. This book is so sweet and tender, and frustrating -- it was very difficult not to invest a lot of emotion in it. Some moments between Robbie and Cecelia, and others in Briony's thoughts, still knock me completely out.~~One of the quintessential good reads~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishing","review":"I've recommended this masterwork to several friends and colleages...A truly impressive piece of literature. Should be on everyone's top ten list. McEwan is officially one of our greatest living writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait till the end","review":"It sounded like a good book when I bought it, but didn't enjoy it.It seems that most people really love this book, but I hated it. I only give it two stars because various passages of the book were interesting. I enjoyed those few pieces but as a whole I wanted to toss it in the trash. The book seemed to drag on and on.I was not able to care about any of the characters, I found them all self absorbed and immature. I could neither really love or hate them, they seemed too fake to me. Without the story invoking feeling I couldn't get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Effort","review":"What a beautifully written novel. Truly a work of *literary* fiction. It makes all the other pulpy stuff seem embarrassingly trite. McKewan creates a wonderful meta-narrative at the end, that cleverly satiates the reader's desire for a happy ending while making the reality of the book all the more poignant and beautiful. The writing is crisp, spase, intelligent, very British. This was one of the best reading experiences I have had this year. The first chapters are slow-going but it is definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.","review":"I can't account for some of the negative reviews posted here, some of which are misrepresentative. It seems a lot of people are disappointed that this book wasn't a straight forward story about Briony atoning for her crime. The actual story is far more interesting and human. It's about remorse and lost chances and finding oneself in the position of being able to do nothing but imagine what things could have or should have been like had they discovered their mistake and done something about it sooner. This is one of the best books I've read in years. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly overrated","review":"Having heard that Atonement was a 'masterpiece' it is possible that I went in with expectations which were too high. Also, I'd recently read Jo Walton's Farthing which I can absolutely qualify as a masterpiece - engaging, chilling, compelling - and Atonement didn't compare at all favorably.It's a meandering tale which, by my lights, suffers from having the major plot point captured in the summary. You know Briony makes a terrible error in judgment and the book belabors it over, and over, and over. The 'twist' at the end was the only point at which the novel 'grabbed' me and by then it was too little, too late.I expect the novel will make a great film because you can hack out enormous chunks of it and not miss a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Win From Ian McEwan","review":"This is a good novel. Some UK reviewers have called it an epic and a masterpiece. It is neither. Although long for a McEwan novel, 351 pages does not an epic make. And McEwan's loyal readers (including this one) are still waiting for the masterpiece he will one day, no doubt, achieve. \\"Atonement\\" works on many levels: Here we have the annoying British class system, a stunning depiction of the BEF's retreat to Dunkirk and images of London during the Blitz. The stitching that holds it all together is betrayal and the quest for atonement thereafter. This novel should be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy handed and thin","review":"After ploughing through Atonement for a book group, I was very disappointed. The writing is heavy handed, the character development is virtually nonexistent, many of the key characters disappear after the \\"crime\\", and the plot development is thin. It would have made an interesting short story, but McEwan fills up page after page with irrelevant war experiences of two of the characters that have nothing to do with the plot of the book and stretches an interesting premise into an empty novel. Atonement for the main character, Briony, is irrelevant since the only two characters who can give her forgiveness, we find out in the last pages, are dead. Just as the story dwells endlessly inside of the head of immature, fantasy prone, histrionic Briony--her perceived atonement is just as fantastical. This book is much ado about nothing. I'm surprised McEwan got such good press. Perhaps it's because he is a Booker prize winner for a prior work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel about remorse","review":"At the core of Atonement, an ambitious work by Ian McEwan (previouly I had started Enduring Love, but I found it wordly and discarded it) is an interesting theme, about the implications in life of an erroneous and almost arbitrary choice made by someone in a certain situation. At the beginning I found it difficult to get involved and interesting in the story but in the end I found the book strangely affecting. Perhaps the most original section is the first one, which deals with the events that happen when Briony, the main character, is about 14 years old. McEwan expertly portays her point of view, and although twisted, I couldn't help but understand her. I also thought that the book was well researched. For all this, Atonement earns a recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"McEwan is a priceless treasure, and this effort represents his ability well. His words pierce into the psychological depths in such a way that no other medium accomplishes. You will finish this book enriched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Succeeds on so many levels","review":"I have read and enjoyed several of McEwan's novels, but none surpasses \\"Atonement.\\" It is wonderfully written, each sentence well crafted. But McEwan is far more than just a good \\"writer,\\" he is a good storyteller, as well, which seems to be an increasingly diminishing capability with so many of today's authors. From the initial moments of deceit at the beginning of the novel, to the incredible description of the horrors of war which comprise the middle of the book, to the resolution in the final pages, this is a beautiful page-turner. To borrow an over-used saying, but one which is true in this particular case, McEwan is truly a writer at the top of his craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"not time well spent","review":"this book deals with noble sentiments in a noble way..and i dearly wanted to enjoy it ..much like i want kids to give up their bus seats for old people .but the mundane war time detail just bored me..the characters bored me especially bryony /mcewan who seem to mistake art for clever rambling sentence structure and forget that a novel and a dairy are different things ..and that sometimes people just want to be entertained ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This book put me to sleep. I like the plot, but the book was too wordy. I did not like the way everything is overly described. I am an avid reader and have a very vivid imagination; I do not need all those unnecessary sentences to get me hooked on the book. I found myself skipping full paragraphs to avoid all the unnecessary details and get to the good stuff. After reading like this, for half the book I finally gave up and put the book down for good. I am looking forward to going to the theater and watching the film, hopefully it doesn't make me sleepy too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly told story of lifelong anguish and resolve","review":"\\"Atonement\\", Ian McEwan's follow up novel to the hugely successful Booker Prize-winner \\"Amsterdam\\", is a very richly told story about the lifelong struggle of a young girl who makes a tragic mistake and ruins three lives in the process.Young Briony accuses a college-aged friend of the family of a horrible crime, destroying his life and the life of her older sister who loves him. The book tells the story of the lives of these three characters as they struggle to recover from the tragedy. But is all really as it seems?McEwan does an excellent job convincing the reader that they know what the truth is - but it isn't until the final pages that the real truth is known. It's a well-told story that will surprise you in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts slow.. ends up great","review":"I'm not sure why it was a slow start for me. Luckily I kept on reading.. and it was well worth it. I love the characters, the story line, and how the writer sums it all up. I'm not one for cheesy love stories.. there is indeed a love story here, but not at all cheesy or overdone. Beautiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start","review":"Hang in there, it takes about 75 pages until it starts to get readable. Does make an interesting book club book. Anxious to see the movie to understand how this was a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring!","review":"I really thought this book was extremely boring. Moved way too slowly and there was honestly nothing in this book that made me WANT to finish it. I would not recommend this book unless you need something to help put you to sleep every night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who decided this was a well written book?","review":"Yes, I'd love to know who makes up the panel that decides what are well written books, or award winning stories. And they made a movie out of this?? Those were the most boring first 189 pages I've ever read, and that was just to get half-way through the book. The only reason I continued on is because I was reading it for a book club discussion. The amount of excrutiatingly boring details was just more than I could bear!! Sorry to say (after all the buzz I've heard about it) but I'll definitely stir away from anything else McEwan has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book moves slower than a glacier!","review":"I found the pacing of this novel to be very slow and the characters were stereotypical. There is so much detail that little is left to the imagination.The elaborate descriptions are distracting. There are way too many scenes where nothing of interest is happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustration thy name is atonement","review":"If this book's a masterpiece, I gotta start writing more.Words, words, words. Then more words. (Did McEwan never read Elements of Style? Omit Needless Words?) There are so many paragraphs here -- so many pages -- that writers like Graham Swift and William Boyd could have dashed off with a single line, losing nothing. For example, THREE PAGES to dissect Cecilia's choice of a dress for the evening??? And in those pages, false lines abound, like -- \\"...and though one bore wine stains and another a burn hole from her first cigarette...\\" Ugh! (How about \\"...and though one bore wine stains and another a burn hole from a cigarette (her first!) ...\\"?)I liked both Amsterdam and The Innocent very much. Wonderful, clean, direct writing, with interesting engaging characters. Before McEwan starts his next book, I suggest he reads less Jane Austen, and more Elmore Leonard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow starter, but worth the read","review":"This is a much hyped book that I was eagerly waiting for. I even pre-ordered it based on various TV accolades. Well, the first 50 pages were very difficult to plow through, but then it picked up and after setting it aside twice, I finished it.It's no Jane Eyre, or even the fast moving Tom Clancy, but worth the money and the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this got a good review!","review":"This book started out well but ended in a thud of nothingness. The ending made no sense but the book fell out of favor about half-way through. I suspect people say they love Atonement solely to make people think they read \\"serious\\" fiction. A waste of valuable time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but . . . .","review":"Absolutely beautiful, but . . . This book is elegantly written. Unfortunately, most of us read books today for the story, or at least the pace of story development. Not a criticism but a fact of life in today's world in which the various forms of video entertainment make plowing through a book seem 'slow'. There is no reward here for the reader seeking a fast paced thriller. But if you chew on your prose and enjoy skillfully phrased and artistic prose, as I do, then you will love this work of art. Frankly, McEwan intimidates me at times with his mastery of the language. Unfortunately, his story will appeal to a limited readership. Frankly, if you are in the club, ain't it grand. To the rest, maybe you don't know what you are missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Dull","review":"I've made it to page 80 but am giving up. I only stuck with the book this long because I kept thinking it was going to get better, based on the 3 pages of rave reviews on the first few pages. But, it's just too slow and dull for me and I have too many other good books to read. I am mystified how 500+ people have given this book 5 stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atonement","review":"Sorry, this was one of the slowest books I have ever read. I couldn't wait to finish it, which took forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. Don't believe the hype","review":"This novel reads like an exercise in a creative writing class. Its a concept more than a real story. The characters are flat, the story is implausible and it just keeps going on and on and on. It maybe could have worked as a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I didn't care for this book much at all. All the reviews said that it was slow getting into it, but worth it. Not really. It is my book for the letter \\"I\\" and I am very happy to move on to \\"J\\".The basic plot of the book is about a 13 year old girl who has the wrong impression of her sister's relationship with a boy and accuses him of raping her cousin and gets him sent to prison. Then her growing up and him getting out and the true story and them trying to make amends and what not.Like I mentioned, very slow moving. The author seemed to go off on tangents that had nothing to do with anything and went on forever! I found myself jumping paragraphs like crazy because it was all blah blah blah to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and drawn out!","review":"I tried for weeks to read this book and still haven't finished it. It is just so so slow! Not sure I could finish...when I inquired about the movie 'Atonement' reviews were quite similar...Definitely not my cup of tea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless story","review":"I just finished reading this book and if I didn't have to read it for my book club, I never would have read to the end. Very boring, tedious and too much detail. I literally skipped 30-40 pages when Robbie was fighting in the war. I never felt like I got to know the characters. We know Briony commits a terrible crime and it's supposed to change her life. But the author doesn't show us how her life was changed. He jumps from when she's 18 to the age of 77 and we don't know how she lived her life in between. I was a bit angry as I read the story because I felt I was wasting my time. To me, the story was pointless and when I finished, I wondered, who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unengaging","review":"I read this for a book club where a number of the other members had described this as one of their absolute favorite books ever, so I had high hopes. It became an arduous and unrewarding slog through pedantic, verbose descriptions of landscapes and characters. I never figured out why I should care for even one second about any of the people in the story, so completely unsympathetic were they. As a side note, I saw the movie after a friend said it was better than the book, but I found it equally uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow read","review":"This was my first Ian McEwan book and it was such a slow read for me. Ian describes EVERYTHING in too much detail for my taste. I was impatient to get on with the story. I realize this descriptiveness is what appeals to others. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought, Overdone, Overkill","review":"Not on my best-seller list!I really had to trudge through the first 50-80 pages to gain a sense of direction. Too much time and attention was devoted to unncessary scenery and minutiae at the characters' expense. Only from the book jacket did I get a real grasp of the time frame for the story. Was the over-wrought description of the vase really necessary? Did it lend anything to the story? I just didn't find the characters well-developed -- given the lack of dialogue and interaction.Part II felt very much like a reincarnation of \\"Birdsong\\" by Sebastian Faulks.The book's only saving grace was the juxtaposition of the final section, and the questions left to ponder. Hardly enough, in my humble estimation, to warrant the first 150 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atonement","review":"What a frustrating, pretentious book! McEwan puts together a nineteenth century novel and then \\"cleverly\\" refuses to end it, because the godlike author/narrator is unable to do so. A tired concept and a rip-off. Nothing Pirandello didn't do a whole lot better a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing...","review":"I found this book very disappointing considering its place on various bestseller lists. It takes a very long time to get where it's going and the language does not warrant the wait; neither do the characters. The \\"unreliable narrator\\" may be a fictional fad or may be here to stay but this one was a waste of my time. And I really disliike books that contort themselves in the last few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the setting and time period of the characters in this book; however, I found the plot and conclusion to be predictable. The writing is beautiful but the book is really quite boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end does not justify the means...","review":"An earlier review gave Atonement a five-star recommendation even after acknowledging that it was \\"horribly boring for the first 330 pages.\\" The alleged saving grace was the book's \\"shocking\\" ending. Sorry, but if a novel is only entertaining in hindsight, it's not really entertaining at all. The art of telling a story with a twist ending is to ensure that the story itself is compelling -- separate and apart from its ending. McEwan utterly fails in that regard. The characters are dull. The prose is long-winded and tedious. There's not one whit of wit anywhere in the story. And the only satisfying aspect of the aforementioned ending is that it finally puts an end to the tedium that precedes it. Ian McEwan will have to do much better next time to atone for Atonement."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll Love It or You'll Hate it","review":"Personally, I hated it. The writing was beautiful, the characters were alive and realistic and the story was believable yet moving; and I hated it. It was difficult for me to get into and while some moments seemed to drag on for 50 pages, others seemed to pass in a paragraph. I found myself skipping over pages and saying to myself \\"Ok, I get it already, move on\\". This was my primary reason for disliking the book, my other reasons are based more on personal taste so I won't bore you with them. Basically, I can put up with a lot for a good ending. Atonement's ending lacked... well, an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandon all Hope ye who Enter Here","review":"In all my life, I have only ever been unable to finish two books. Atonement is the second. After having such high hopes from other reviewers and friends, I made it halfway into this book - reaching, at last, the crime - before having to toss the book aside. It is cliche, none of the characters are remotely likable, or even bearable, and the writing is over-detailed to the point that it makes a reader struggle to remember what is actually happening in the story. It is with great regret that I am forced to add another book to my \\"Unbearable\\" list, and hope that no more innocents are trapped into reading Atonement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cramped, overwritten book","review":"I won't offer a plot summary that can be found in other book reviews. I'll offer my frank opinion that this book is over-rated and destined for the literary dustbin. \\"Atonement\\" is a cramped miniaturist piece that aspires to something greater, particularly in its commentary about written narrative, but ultimately, the major plot points boil down to the warped opinions of an adolescent mind. Lies, false accusations, fanciful opinions, need for drama--all products of a prepubescent's girl's mind. And unfortunately, a rather likable student is sent to war, separating him from his true love, because everyone is too willing to believe the idiotic opinions of the teenage girl Briony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slow, slow","review":"I was expecting this to be an exciting, interesting book and I stalled at 3/4's of the way through because it still hadn't gotten any momemtum or reached the conflict stage. I will probably finish it, but only when I have nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how to love it","review":"I rented this movie upon hearing the famous title song and \\"I Dont Know How To Love Him\\". But what I found instead was something that looked like some hippies went out to the desert to sing. Now, I usually understand even the most complex of movies. But this one perplexed me. I didn't understand why after he was crucified, everyone packed up, in normal clothes as if everything was okay and they had just come to act out a part and crucify Him. That is the only part I didn't understand. And King Herod's hats made me kinda sick or some reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Acting, Terrible Singing, Terrible Direction","review":"It's pretty obvious to me that the director doesn't understand much, if anything about Christianity and Jesus. But, leaving the religion aside, and even the content of the film, the acting is just plain terrible. The singing is excruciatingly bad. The direction is uninspired and lifeless. Just a plain badly done film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like it","review":"I think Christions did not like it for many reasons. Here are some reasons why Ithink they didn't like it.for one thing, they had tanks and guns and they did not really use them. I do not think it was appropriate. In Jesus' time, guns and tanks were not even invented.Another thing that disturbed viewers was, It was as if they made him into a rockstar. He was not a rock star or anything like that. So I did not think that the christians would have liked it.Finally, I did not like it because I did not think it was the complete truth about jesus' life. They did not show hs mother or that he lived with her. They did not show that he was a carpenter. It was made in the 70's when people were growing their hair out and doing drugs. He did not care to help people and I got the impression that he did not want to help everybody.It was not the story from the Bible to me.That's why I think christians did not like it.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"i hated it","review":"From watching this movie I can clearly see why the Christians were outraged. It was nothing like they tell in the Bible. The most unusual part of this movie was when all the guys and girls started dancing all over Jesus. They were all acting like they were on drugs because this was the seventies when many of the kids were growing their hair out and doing drugs. This movie reminded more of Charles Manson than Jesus Christ. If it were my opinion I would never watch this movie again. I can see from this movie that Andrew Lloyd Weber did not believe in God's ways. If I could find Mr. Webber's telephone number, I would call him up and ask him what he was thinking when he created this musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not really like the movie","review":"I thought one scene was alright.

One really gets the feeling for what life might have been like in Jesus' time, but then there is a modern twist to really get the Gospels to come to life. This does not have the extreme gore factor of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, but still one realizes Jesus' life and suffering which might not be as apparent with a simple read of the bible. You can now read the Gospels and feel the power of Christ. I owned this movie on VHS and now wanted to be able to play it on my computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality","review":"I bought \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" from this individual bacause of the high number of 5 star ratings.

I bought the dvd for our anniversary. It was fantastic to see the actors and hear the same voices we have been listening to for years. The singing is outstanding. The clothes, hair, and props take one back a few decades, and may be somewhat offsetting for someone that wants to see something more period, but we trully enjoyed it. I would recommend this product to any of my friends.Jesus Christ Superstar (Special Edition)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so special about this edition?","review":"As is common with Amazon, no info in what makes this a Special Edition from the regular edition released years ago.A reviewer pointed out that the sound & picture are no different, and nobody has said or reviewed anything about any extras.So as my title asks:\\"WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS EDITION?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewison (as usual) stays true to the stage vision","review":"With Jesus Christ Superstar,Norman Jewison proves that \\"Yes it is possible to take a show from the stage to the screen and stay true to the original vision that made that show what it was.a good example of the opposite would be Alan Parker's verson of \\"Evita\\"(he made Eva Peron look like a girlscout!) This movie will not won't be everybodys cup of tea.Firstly the main thing to remember is this is not the Gospel according to Luke,Matthew,or John.It's the Gospel according to Judus so don't expect to see Jesus as we as christians have(if he did do you think he would have betrayed him?) Secondly,it's opera with libretto,no talking just singing .But what singing!!! the vocals in this are killer,and the powerful music of Andrew Lloyd-Webber makes for a great movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sound quality","review":"First off, I love the music, and once owned the LP version of the soundtrack. But for whatever reason, the soundtrack on the DVD is so quiet that I had to turn the volume WAY UP just to hear it. What gives? Are they saving \\"bits\\" for some other recording? If the original movie was this \\"quiet\\", why couldn't they boost the sound level? This isn't me or my DVD player. All my other movies play \\"normally\\".For this reason I CANNOT recommend that you buy this DVD. You will be sorely disappointed by the sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat","review":"I am not a big fan of religion (not to insult anyone), but I loved this movie.

While I absolutely LOVED this piece...the ending has always puzzled me a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST cast!","review":"This original movie version of Lord Lloyd Webber's work stands out as the BEST version of JCS. Ted Neeley shines in his portrayal of Jesus, the casting couldn't have been better. Neeley's performance shows us what made Jesus so special, he was not a big man, he was not some larger-than-life WWE Wrestler, he was an average, if not small man, who did great things. Neeley's voice is powerful, and his performance brilliant. In \\"Gethsemane\\" his anguish evokes tears from any viewer. The rest of the cast is also stunning, Yvonne puts in her usual stellar performance of Mary Magdalene, and Carl's such a great Judas. Do not pass this movie over, and disregard any negative comments about Ted Neeley, this is a MUST for any JCS, or ALW fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was o.k.","review":"Folowing the end of the movie, i had mixed feelings.Iliked the way Ted Neely and Carl Anderson played there parts.I didn't like the way everybody else played.Everybody sang great though.I didn't think Andrew Loyld Webber set it up.Al the bad guys had guns in every scene.It also was not likewhat they had in the bible.I can see why the Christians were outraged.It was pure dissen GOD.The Non Christians are a different storie.they were mad because it was about jesus. No one Was making them watch it.So in my opinion they need to shut up and not watch it.I mean come on ,the title isJesus Christ Superstar.Some of the people though were mad because it was a ' rock' opera.They thought electric guitars and base drums shouldn't be in there. So thats what I thought about the movie.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Christ Superstar(1973)","review":"I have this DVD version of Jesus Christ Superstar because I did not like the way Norman Jewison made the songs in this version. (I did like the Overture) As far as the video goes - what was the deal with the Bus? And the Army tanks? And the Planes? The director's choices were a distraction. Back to the music - did any make the observation that the director forgot to put in the reprise of the song Everything's Alright that is in the the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of the DVD? Buy the other version(Jesus Christ Superstar-Broadway) Made by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. Don't buy this one (Jesus Christ Superstar-1973)unless you are a collector of musicals like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"About that dont blow your money on this movie.","review":"I didnt like the movie because it did not enternain very well and, besides my teachers makin me do this because she liked it a little to much if u get what i mean.The main reason i did not like is because it was a musical. I really do not like musicals. Way back when the movie was made no1 really liked it because it was about relegion, and offended non-christians,christians.If u like it thats fine with me but i SERIOUSLY would not buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Places your Immortal Soul in jeopardy","review":"I have read reviews wherein friends have stated that, religious beliefs notwithstanding, it was a good film. How in the name of Hoot Gibson can a movie about Jesus be regarded as anything but religious. People are going to watch it and draw conclusions about the Life of Our Savior.\\"For all you care, this bread could be My Body!\\" Are you kidding me? Where these the words with which He instituted the Eucharist?I had a Catholic tell me that Jesus isn't REALLY present in the Eucharist. It's just a \\"symbol!\\" He may have gotten this impression from watching \\"Modernist\\" heresey like this movie.I like to watch movies about my Faith, however, I reached a point, in my life, when I said that I would never again watch one about Our Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed...","review":"I was shocked when I saw this film.. I found out recently that there was a film made for Jesus Christ Superstar that was made a while ago.. and being a huge Andrew Lloyd Weber fan I decided to see if this was any good.. and to my surprise it wasn't good. I basically fast forwarded through most of it.. I lost interest very quickly.. I thought it was very boring.. ALthough I love the work of Andrew Lloyd Weber .. This movie just slapped him in the face.. it was horribly made.. the scenes didn't match up.. there was hardly a story line to follow.. the story was harder to follow than Weber's musical Cats which basically had no storyline but was a lot more interesting than this butchered musical.. The vocals were quite impressive though.. And I did enjoy the rock/roll songs very much.. but there were hardly any to enjoy... This has got to be a huge dissapointment to all his fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superstar?, More like Bench Warmer","review":"Ted Neeley should be crucified, literally, for being the worst Jesus in any film. Was Jimmy Stewart unavailable to play a worse version of Jesus? I think Ted Neeley is also the first person to play Jesus with a lazy eye. This is just the beginning of my problems with this movie.I could have sworn Yoko Ono was playing Mary Magdaline. The actress had the same vocal abilities as Yoko. In my opinion, Elton John did the best job playing King Herod. Rick James would have made a great Judas.I realize my review is just addressing the acting, what about the plot you ask? There was not one. The keep singing bad songs until they are mercifully stopped when Jesus is crucufied. The best part was making the Last Supper into a picnic. Who brought the Spam?As a Christian, I have never hated a Bible story. But what they have done to the story of Jesus life certainly has turned the greatest story into a sham. I would rather go blind than watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who the Hell did they get to play Jesus?!","review":"The guy who plays Jesus is an awful singer. He ruined the entire movie sounding like the lead from some punk band. Also, it's clear they did not cast the actors based on their looks (or even their talent for that matter). I tried very hard to like this. I love musicals but this ranks down there with Cats, Hair, and Nine. If you want a great musical based on the scripture, check out the amazing Godspell."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is [...] and i am over [..]of age!","review":"Jesus Christ superstar is one of the most annoying movies I have ever been made to watch. The characters would not stop singing and it is most defiantly not a \`G' rated!This movie was a bit too far fetch as in the year 0ad (or 4bce) to the time he died there wore not any airplanes or army tanks!

It is the favorite of most of us in my family. It never get old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Moving!!","review":"This movie is a classic! If you can watch this without being moved, then you are not being open to the message it is trying to give. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times in my life and still find wisdom in the story. (plus I have always been moved to tears) It protrays the human emotions that all the characters may have felt - from Jesus, and Judas, to Pilot, etc. Very eye opening if you stay open minded. This is not meant to be an accurate historical documentary, just merely a different perspective that MAY be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five star movie!!!

I had to replace my DVD so I bought this special edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thought Provoking","review":"I'm not a rock fan but when my sons where in their early teens, quite a few years ago, this movie helped them to relate to the story of Jesus in music they liked and helped us, as parents, to discuss the subject of Jesus as a family, which was good. I also found it very moving. It gave pause to think about ones beliefs. It just drew you right into it, in a way that I cannot explain. To have the entire movie sung and sung well was remarkable. The performance by Judas was outstanding. I have since become a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber which adds to my appreciation of a thought provoking musical. My one disappointment was it did not end with the Resurrection of Jesus. If anyone has another opinion about the ending, I would be very interested in hearing it. As a Christian I think it is a film well worth seeing because it does cause you to think about what you believe and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best musicals ever.....","review":"If you like musicals and can appreciate \\"NEW\\" (70's) trends, then you should like this movie. The music is entrancing and the scenery spectacular. Keep in mind that this is not a traditional biblical movie, but a 70's interpretation, full of the power and force that drove the early part of the decade. Turn down the lights and crank up the sound for an enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rompe los esquemas religiosos","review":"El rol de Magdalena junto a Jesus cristo rompe los patrones de comportamiento establecidos por la religiosidad"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I loved the original recording of Superstar.

Mary Magdalen said it right when she sang \\"he's just a man, he's just a man\\". my Jesus is'nt just a man. he's God in the flesh. he was crucified for our sins and on the third day rose from the dead. victorious over death. without the resurrection Jesus is just a man and can't save himself let alone anyone else! how so called Christian people can so easily be fooled is mind boggling! its like the bible says \\"many are called, few are chosen\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie was awesome. Jesus Christ Superstar was full of great acting, great music and a great plot. I especially like Hared's part in the movie. He was so funny.

His performance as Jesus is edgy and dramatic and touching. The late Carl Anderson as Judas again a perfect casting amazing vocals and adds the right touch of drama and angst to Judas. You can easily sympathize with them both. Next notables are Yvonne Elliman as Mary and Jousha Mostel(son of Zero Mostel) as King Herod. Although it should be said that all the leads are very talented and bring a high level of energy to their roles.The entire ensemble put forth amazing talent dancing and singing and acting together to deliver a high powered and emotional performance.I have watched this movie more times than I can count and never tire of it.To be fair I have watched other versions of the play but NONE of them compare to this version live or on film!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Christ Superstar DVD","review":"It was a great buy.

Musicals were about to make a comeback, thanks to Barbra Striesand. But this film \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" (which Miss Striesand has nothing to do with) just may have killed all musicals forever. This film is a rock and roll musical of a modern-day Jesus. You won't learn anything about the real Jesus here. The singing is out of tune at times. There is one nice tune, \\"I Don't Know How To Love Him\\" sung by Yvonne Elliman, who incidentally, sang the hit song, \\"If I Can't Have You!\\", for the filmSaturday Night Fever [Blu-ray] (1977). Good performance by Yvonne Elliman as \\"Mary Magdalene\\".Buy instead,Jesus of Nazareth(1977), starring Robert Powell and an all-star cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"I really did not see anything special with this film. THe people that played Judas and Mary were excellent wonderful voices and were fun to watch, but other than that the movie was jsut alright. The other singing voices were downright annoying (the people that played Jesus and one of the high priest...their voices were painful to hear... I thought my windows might break)"},{"rating":"2","title":"After 25 Years, Jesus Christ Superstar Still Moves Me","review":"The performances of Ted Neely and Carl Anderson are so passionate and powerful. This movie has had such a profound effect in my personal understanding of the life of Christ. Ted Neely protrays Jesus in such a way that you can actually feel inside your chest the pain of his persecution. Carl Andersons portral of Judus brings some understanding of how he betrayed Jesus. He shows how difficult it was for an apostle to turn on Jesus while at the same time, thinking he was saving him from being destroyed. The music is outstanding as each song fills the moments with intense emotion. With the movie filmed in location in Israel, one could wonder if Jesus really stood on the same spots. This production has entertained each generation in my home, from my nine year old son, to my mother-in-law, all whom when watching, are completely consumed with its passion. This truly is the best movie and musical ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gratos recuerdos ...","review":"Cuando la pelicula fue exibida no tenia edad para poder entrar a un teatro a verla.

La recomiendo para los creyentes y amantes del rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST movies ever...","review":"You know, I don't much care about people that can throw an entire movie out with the bathwater because someone has a minor, and I mean MINOR lazy eye. Ted Neely is not only gorgeous, seriously, but the man can sing. Today? He still plays the part in Broadway shows, and does an astounding job singing every note. Never once hit a bad note, nor a weak note the night we saw him.The movie is a wee bit dated, but overall it is an honest, and heartfelt interpretation of the New Testament. Neely as Christ, is honest, heartfelt, and open in his role, and Judas is an astonishing actor, and singer, period. Not a huge fan of Yvonne as Mary, but that's just me. She sings just fine. :)Go watch, place yourself in the time and space, and imagine..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth seeing","review":"Fabulous production of the Passion of Jesus. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that at first, I thought Ted Neeley was a little weak as Jesus. I also wasn't thrilled w/Yvonne Elliman's not-so-stellar singing voice (she slides all around the notes!) But as with many other films, repeated viewings have swayed my opinion. I now really enjoy Neeley's vocal delivery and presence (and I overlook weird little things like his shuffling walk). Carl Anderson as Judas is EXCELLENT, as is the ensemble of dancers. The 1970's production is a little dated, but the flare pants and phrases like \\"What's the buzz?\\" now only seem to add to its kitchy charm. Like coffee and beer, this one is an acquired taste - but once acquired, you'll love it!! Great music, and the location in Israel is beautiful. Really left me pondering the enduring appeal of the story of Jesus, his mission, and crucifixion. Very dramatic - get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jesus christ superstar","review":"i am only 16 and may be a younger fan of the work of the likes of Lloyd-Webber, Rice,and Sondheim, but i feel that i know a good musical when i see one. Superstar is one musical that will never 'grow old' or fade away, it covers a topic that almost everyone comes across everyday in their lives. The video may not have many fancy lighting techniques or even any flash costumes (save the superstar costumes) but the theme makes it a whole lot more believable and realistic. Carl Anderson has the voice that many man envy, a flexible vocal range that carries the role of Judas off perfectly. Ted Neely, although bringing the high notes to a whole new level,he also seemed too quiet or even frail for the part of Jesus. The cast together, formed a great chorus and Herod's Song added that touch of humor. The whole bus thing was confusing at first, but i slowly grew to like it's symbolism. And yes, the backward glancs from Carl Anderson at the end was the icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"fresh and innovative after all these years","review":"I enjoy this film more with each viewing, and despite the bellbottoms and big hair, it's as fresh as ever. The cast is superb. Carl Anderson's Judas, Yvonne Elliman's Magdalene, and in the smaller parts, Bob Bingham as Caiaphas, Barry Dennen as Pilate, and Joshua Mostel as a flabby and decadent, charleston dancing Herod.Ted Neeley is my all-time favorite \\"film Jesus\\"...though small in physique, he shows so much strength and emotion, in his movements and his face...and what a beautiful face ! This was truly great casting.Filmed in Israel, the cinematography is spectacular, as this play unfolds among the ruins and desert regions...I also like the use of color...the lavendars and oranges, etc. This was, and remains, an innovative, one of a kind film, and one that's here to stay for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome film!","review":"First thing I have to say before anything else- watch this film with an open mind. The music is just wonderful, and the singers are even better (Especially Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson). The choreography, especially to Simon Zealot, is awesome. THis film has, I've heard, has caused some controversy over the relationship implied between Mary Magdalene and Jesus. If you ask me, it's just the way you look at it.

It's authoritative and well written...and by a single author. the competing book, by ADK, was originally written by about 30 contributors--and there's no map, so you have to buy the Conference maps. There's no BS in this book, either--no pretentious, over authoritative hype...just clean straight forward trail information by someone who is probably the single most knowledgeable Catskill hiker ALIVE. Get it...you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately a necessity.","review":"This guide is very detailed and very useful. It comes with a map of all of the trails in the Catskills.

They are considered 1 hit wonders, and with good reason, they did only have 1 true hit in \\"Whip It\\". However they also made alot of very good music in the early part of the 80's. Though they never really made a big splash after \\"Whip It\\", they deserve alot of respect for pushing new wave and post punk music to a whole level. One of the highlights is \\"Jerkin Back and Forth\\", a VERY good song to go cruising to on a sunny afternoon with the windows down. A MUST HAVE for any fan of 80's music and new wave in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"added bass on cell phone, great on cordless phones","review":"I ordered this elswhere, but I wish I used amazon.

Wish you could adjust the volume but there is no control to do that.

I didn't know the original masters were mono record dubs that have lots of scratches, and faded-in intros. Not to mention that they got three titles (and technically, four, if you go by the titles on the original 45s and LP's) wrong on the cd. This cd appears to be a 10 track reissue of a 20 track LP on Laurie Records put out in the 1980's on vinyl (yet on that LP every song is mono or slightly rechanneled, they do not fade in or have massive record scratches). This cd is a complete waste of time and money. Try hunting down the Best Of Ronnie Dove cd on Stardust records of Canada, it has fairly good sound with some tracks from master tapes and while some are vinyl dubs the sound is not as horrendous as this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for Soc Majors...","review":"I am a Sociology major, and I have to say, this book is very fascinating.

It focuses way too much on percentages rather than involving the reader in actually learning something. Statistical evidence is a good way to learn but in this case, it takes the subject to the extreme. My sociology professor required this book and I am getting more and more bored with the reading. Anyway, if you have to get it, spend some time and look for it used.........the only thing you will learn is how to shop around."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally lame book...","review":"... that was required for a class. It was what the teacher wanted but WOW what a boring read. Like any other school book, this had some useful tools but you need several shots of espresso to read the rest.

Even if you are just a casual college football fan, this book is pretty easy to read and helps explain a lot of things, like how Notre Dame can remain outside of the conference system and why the post season is so chaotic.If there is any short-coming, it might be that the book focuses a little too much on the internal management of the NCAA, especially the consolidation of power that occurred under Wally Byers. But, in the end, this is such a gigantic subject that it had to have some kind of hook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy","review":"The product got here in the agreed upon time.

This is a must read for any college football fan, who wants to fully understand the inner workings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Nice","review":"I usually only do reviews for albums that knock me over - this one doesn't but for several tracks that are brilliant. This album has a bit of an ethereal feel with interwoven jazz textures, electronica, and vocal splashes, but somehow is all really nicely tied together - Blade Runner meets Miles meets Daft Punk. 7 songs were amply iTunes-worthy, my favorite being \\"I Don't Mind\\". From the sleeve, this seems like a very young guy with kinda of a backyard/garage thing happening, so I think we can only look forward to bigger and better things from such a talented artist :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I already threw them away","review":"I thought these scissors would help with things like cutting edges on photographs and other delicate scissor jobs that are hard to keep strait.

You can cut through very thin pieces of paper (such as a single credit card receipt) but even with normal weight paper it jams or gets stuck. It wasn't worth the money. I have more success with snipping at receipts with a regular pair of scissors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work","review":"This was a great idea, and I was very very excited about it.

Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome gag gift for someone in the office","review":"Seriously, right? It's a laser on a scissor. Once you get past the fact that running with them is now dangerous to any retina within laser beam distance, you soon realize that using a guide to cut that moves with the scissor is a rather silly idea. Sure you're cuts will be laser straight, but if your hand isn't, well, then...you get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"The scissors work fine but...","review":"I received these from my Aunt who purchased them and was disappointed with them and when I said it was a cool concept she let me have them. The scissors themselves work like you would expect from your run of the mill scissors however the laser guide is just gimmicky. The problem with the laser guidance system is that if you turn the scissors slightly the line moves with it so it serves absolutely no purpose. For that reason alone I could not give this a good score however I gave it one extra then the 1 star the laser guidance system would warrant because the scissor portion is perfectly functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"total boondogle","review":"This item sounded like a great idea, but it just doesn't work.

All in all, a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"I don't know why on earth I bought these things. I guess for a low price, I thought these scissors would be worth trying. I wanted them for cutting a straight line through lengths of fabric.Heh, they were so awful, the laughs were worth the money (that and I now have a new pair of scissors AND my dogs have a new laser toy).The problem? The laser makes this line that you are supposed to cut on...but as you cut and your hand moves, the laser moves, so the whole thing is pointless. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo--these are terrible.","review":"I was really excited about these scissors after finding them on Sky Mall! I know I'm not the only one who reads that magazine!

I think Amazon is a very good source of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the One!","review":"I enjoyed the first Elizabeth Bevarly mainstream novel and even those published by Silhouette. However, these last few have missed the mark. \\"He Could be the One\\" should not have been published as a mass market mainstream novel. The plot is flimsy and was held together by the author repeating the heroine's thoughts and speech repeatedly in order to stretch the story. While Eve and Wyatt's story could have been fantastic if given the proper depth, this rendition only left a disappointed fan. I sensed the secondary character, Eve's sister Simone, might get a story of her own. If so, lets hope the author takes the time to develop the story more fully before going to market. I would suggest buying this used or waiting for a paperback exchange at your local library. I probably won't make another purchase unless I read the reviews first."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"The problem with romantic comedy plots is that too many authors writing for the genre have no sense of humor. Or else their humor is so tedious it has the reader pulling her hair out. That was certainly the case with Bevarly.The thought that two grown women are so obsessed with events/people from high school twenty years earlier is really quite pathetic. An entire book around that premise is excruciating. The entire plot is one contrivance after another.This author needs to study up on writing men. Men do not talk like that!!! The two guys in the story were indistinguishable from each other when they spoke, as were all the flat cardboard characters.It's interesting to note that the only people who gave this book a good review are other writers. Certainly the readers weren't fooled in this instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS ONE!","review":"This is not a keeper. I'm not saying throw it back, just don't pay full price for this book. The story would have worked much better had EB limited her use of \\"uh\\", \\"eh\\", \\"um\\", \\"mmm\\", \\"hmm\\", and \\"gee.\\" A little of this and the reader thinks it's cute, but too much will drive you crazy. To make matters worse, the hero is primarily the guilty party. Instead of making him endearing, he comes across as being inept. Let's hope this isn't a trend which EB plans to adopt for future books. If you haven't read \\"How To Trap A Tycoon\\". . .do so. It's EB at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gripping","review":"Yet another contemporary romance which stars a private investigator as a bodyguard to the heroine [actually two of the PIs]. What the threat is, in addition primarily to being 20 years in the past, is kept a secret; thus the reader can't worry too much about the heroine and her sister. The romantic conflict is that the hero can't get involved with heroine again after he had a crush on her in high school, while the heroine is just touchy about everything. It just isn't a gripping premise, and nothing as the story progresses makes it more so. I'm sure Bevarly is an accomplished author, but she is obviously turning out ill-conceived projects to meet rapid-fire publisher deadlines, with the result I just put the book aside even though I was trapped on a non-stop cross-country flight with nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Framework for coping with disruptive changes","review":"Clark Gilbert and Joseph L.

It is an interesting subject, but the authors do not really enter the territory by great depths. The focus is primarily on the impact of the Internet on traditional organizations, but even on this subject the authors barely touch the surface.

It speaks to the realities of what it means to be a Christian. Sometimes Christians are expected to be super human (not to have real feelings), even by fellow Christians. This book reminds us that God gave us feelings and we are to bring all of those feelings and emotions to Christ--the good and the bad. For me, this book was confirmation that I am on the right track to a true relationship with my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Before reading this book, please pray and ask the Holy Spirit to open your mind and give you understanding. You must be ready, spiritually, for what the authors say. They don't sugar coat, and they will challenge some old beliefs that may be hindering your relationship with Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to Soviet Generals","review":"I picked this book up when I was in England years ago and to this day it remains one of the best compilations on the Generals and Marshals of the Red Army during WWII. Many interesting facts I never knew are dispersed with general accounts and histories of the Generals as they went from 1941 defeats to final victory in 1945. Although many Generals are missing the ones discussed most definitely deserve the attention that they have received by the authors. Tukhachevsky's account was interesting, but I would liked to see Yakir right there next to him. Another Soviet General who was killed during the purges who had a great impact on Soviet Strategy and theory was A. A. Svechin the author of \\"Strategy\\" him I would have also liked to read about.

Wetboy rips the lid off the ugly side of politics in a way politicians don't want you to see. This movie is going to have impact. It's suspenseful, well shot, slowly builds tension, and has got plenty of plot twists. The dialogue is razor sharp, and through the use of repeating motifs (such as the Wilford Brimley character having his secretary announce the hero is coming into his office four or five times in the movie) makes you re-examine just who you can trust. I really hope more people see this movie and I will be working hard to get people to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music of The Yearning was absolutely beautiful.","review":"I received my copy of The Yearning very quickly after ordering from the Internet. I found the music to be relaxing and beautiful. As a massage therapist I search for music to promote relaxation and to provide a pleasant escape for my clients.

She wrote that when she needs to feel safe and secure, this is what she cues up to set the mood. Since I so enjoy having her as my own personal creative therapist (through her books), I decided to give Hoppe a try. Julia was right-again. The combination of quiet synthesizers and a luminous flute, with simple melodies that gently lead your soul, is a welcome respite from a noisy world. I found the music set my mind free to wander or just float freely. There's a fascinating backstory to this collection of compositions as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The FIVE STARS are correct...","review":"I've been getting professional massage for many years, and have been exposed to a wide range of relaxing AND beautiful music. During a recent massage I heard this CD. It touched me uniquely. It was a combination of the timbre of the alto flute (with which I was unfamiliar prior to this) and the compositions themselves. The performance and recording quality were also excellent. But on a personal note, the music evoked an amazing collection of associations, memories, sheer romance-in-the-moment that music rarely does for me.In its particular class---as both a relaxing collection for massage, and a stimulating collection for romantic memories and romantic hopes/dreams---this CD is the best.And I agree with the reviewer who asked for a sixth star. There are some albums that are so clearly at the top of their genre that they need a category beyond \\"excellent\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was so excited to purchase this CD. The reviews were so glowing and enthusiastic about the music. I was sure I would love it. Well......I didn't. The music was all right, but surely not the most beautiful I'd ever heard. And, I discovered that I could hear an intake of breath after every phrase. I found this to be very distracting. I will most likely pass this CD along to my mother, and if she doesn't like it, it will probably go to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Float on the calm...","review":"Several years ago I was visited an \\"Earth Expo\\" in New York City.

When listening to this disc, one gets the sense that Chick is putting his entire self into the piano. The dark atonal passages delivered in perfect rhythm will send chills down your spine. The first two tracks, Steps-What Was and Matrix, are worth the price alone. Corea plays with the fury and passion of the 1960s in the language of European modernists like Bartok and Stravinsky. The interesting part is that this album also swings. Hard. Roy Haynes is absolutely fabulous as always, and has the perfect sound to accompany Chick. Miroslav Vitous provides an extremely powerful rhythmic and harmonic presence, as well as virtuosic, freaklike proficiency in his solos. This is an overlooked masterpiece, and one of the best trio performances of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This recording is just phenomenal.

They were from different vendors I believe but all fulfilled through Amazon. The book I got in this order, book 4 \\"The birth of Flux and Anchor\\" was in horrible condition when I got it. The spine was creased in three places. The cover has been folded over and creased. The edges of the book all around are scuffed. If it weren't for the fact that the return shipping cost more than the book I'd return it immediately. The description for this book should read, \\"Cover and spine damaged and creased but the pages are readable.\\" It should be rated no higher than poor or very poor (whatever the lowest category is). It was rated either good or very good when I bought it. What a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always, with the Michael Gruber books, the characters are wonderful","review":"Michael Gruber co-wrote (or perhaps completely wrote) Tanenbaum's first 15 books in this series, and I love them all, esp. this one. His characters have almost a Dickensian vividness. El Chivato, the hired killer who thinks Lucy Karp is channeling his sainted mother, Lucy, who speaks Vietnamese with a \\"slangy Saigon accent\\", Marlene who sings a French lullaby to her daughter to allow her to escape El Chivato--they are all deeply comic and wonderful.I think the Arabs get a little confusing, and there are so many killings they start to have a comic book lack of seriousness, but the plot problems pale beside the wonderful fun of the characters.

Having achieved shark fame through \\"Jaws\\", Mr. Benchley was subsequently invited over the next several years to come play in the sea with the fearsome critters by numerous people looking to hype their own shark agendas with an appearance by the creator of \\"Jaws\\". After many years of diving and rubbing shoulders with shark legends, actual sharks and researchers in the field of shark behavior, Peter Benchly writes this memoir to philosophically reflect on the experience of his personal shark odyssey while touching from time to time on the emerging scientific understanding of the shark. I found it to be an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, pens a non-fiction book setting the record straight on shark behavior. It sounds like a great idea and it is, but the execution is horrible. I would say maybe 50% of this book is actually about sharks; the rest merely lists dangers of the ocean (rips, tides, etc.) and non-shark creatures to be feared. Useful and mildly interesting, but I wanted a *shark* book. Another irritant is Benchley's \\"man is the real threat\\" stance. While valid (and true), his position is presented with an incredibly heavy hand. Peter, that horse isn't getting any more dead, so lay off!

As described in this book, by 1996, LEAN became a way of thinking and operating, expanding around the world in several industries. Although this book gives a clear explanation of LEAN principles, it is still oriented into manufacturing.

Jones sound a battle cry against institutional waste. What a pity, they say, that so much time, energy, and money are needlessly thrown away. They urge executives to redefine their values based on customer experiences and to track the flow of value from manufacturing to final sale. The result, they promise, is that companies will save time, energy and money - and will revolutionize their entire organizations in the bargain. Not content to simply study western problem-solving methods, the worldly authors guide their readers through a wide array of Japanese manufacturing wisdom as well. Their generosity and depth make this a pleasantly informative book, which defies the current trend in business books of proclaiming doom and then offering a quick fix. This book would rather proclaim hope, which is just one of the reasons that we [...] recommend it to serious managers who want to trim the fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zedd's Dead","review":"If you know anything at all about the Cinema of Transgression, you'll find this book fairly interesting.

What's really fun about this collection is everything else! Lot's of oddities/rarities that you'll most likely not find anywhere else.

My only complaint is the sound quality is somewhat uneven throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Grooves","review":"Amon tobin's newest feels like a natural progression from 'Supermodified.' Even less jazz influences, more menace, and a welcome and unique addition of guitar samples to his sonic alchemy. 'Back from Space' opens the album and is just that, distant chimes, eerie background vocals and rumbling bass behind some scattered break beats make for perfect sci-fi tracking. 'Verbal' finds Mr. Tobin doing warped dissecting of an MC's vocals. 'Chronic Tronic' and 'Cosmo Retro Intro Outro' pulverize the listener with spit-fire percussions while 'Searchers' and 'El Wraith' are chillling pieces that will make you want to keep the nightlight on when you go to sleep. The album closes with a come-down track (similar to the last two releases) reminiscent of the intro to Primal Scream's 'Shine Like Stars' before morphing into Amon Tobin's characteristic eerie sway. This is a class effort from an artist whose creative load is far from shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Electronic Dance Music","review":"I love this CD. Some of the tracks are great for tribal/goth and alternative bellydance. Track 2 is great to dance to, has a hip hop sort of style. Tracks 9 and 10 are very trance like with a solid down tempo.

There a few tunes with quicker beats but these songs could all be classified as downtempo industrial. They're all about 80 bpm, and have the \\"banging on a steel barrel in a warehouse\\" feel, and are all somewhat atmospheric.

While the author paints a colorful picture of Chinatown amd the way of life there, that is all I could find interest in. The plot strung you along at the pace of a snail crawling in circles and then left you hanging at the end. It was as if the author's editor called him and said he needed the book finished in 20 minutes. All the buildup in the last few chapters led me to believe the ending would be so much better. I found myself hitting the next page button over and over again thinking there had to be something more.While I was bored with this book 20% into it, I stayed the course and finished it, only to realize the more exciting plot I was hoping for wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up one third in","review":"I tried, but with the Chinese sprinkled in all the time it was too exhausting.

Sometimes I succeeded, sometimes not so much.I did like Detective Jack to a degree (which is probably why I finished the book), but I didn't feel like I learned to know Jack as well as I would have liked. He seemed to be stuck in a hate/love relationship between two cultural worlds, but couldn't quite make both work for him at same time.

I read about 30% off the book before I couldn't take it anymore. Even from where I stopped, the plot was not clear. The author seems to want to teach you more about Chinese words and Chinatown than actually writing a book. There wasn't an even flow while reading because of the Chinese words. And honestly, if you don't know Chinese, writing in Chinese and the correct pronunciation it are two different things.I know Chinatown so while I was excited to read it, I had to give up.

A New York City detective assigned to the Fifth Precinct in Chinatown, he faces daily prejudice from his brother officers and contempt in the community he serves.He is a man tormented by anger--anger over the sudden death of his father who never accepted the son's choice of career, anger at those who prey upon the people least able to defend themselves, anger at those who accept things as they are.But he is a good detective, and this is most ably demonstrated when he takes the lead in a case where a serial rapist is targeting young Chinese girls. This plotline is subsumed when Jack is drawn into another case where the mistress of a Tong leader takes drastic action to gain her freedom, resulting in a cross-country chase and a life-changing conclusion.There are rich characters and exciting plot elements here, though the story does meander a bit. I hope to read more about Jack Yu in other books in Chang's series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking air within a month of use","review":"I bought two tubes and new tires to replace on my son's bicycle.

The reamer I use to clean crud out of tight areas of items that collect such. I use the large screw-driver and the Phillips often. Some do not like the Phllips because of its location (on the side rather than an end like the flat screw drivers), but I like the location as I use it a lot on quarter-turn fasteners with a Phillips slot.Overall a great little knife that I get my money's worth out of and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard to find treasure for Stuart fans.","review":"I have been looking for this book for many years.

Lyons approaches his subjects with neither judgment nor pathos, and has recorded them without succumbing to the pitfalls of romanticism.

The only positive emotion found in these photos is the result of the reunion of a couple separated from each other by a prison sentence. Although American Indians face a plethora of problems they are among the most resilient people on the face of this earth. They smile, laugh and love, but Lyon chose to leave all of this out.

While the novel does involve supernatural elements, they are muted for much of its length - suggestive rather than in-your-face. Reading it, I was continually reminded of the work of John Cowper Powys - particularly A GLASTONBURY ROMANCE. The characters and setting are beautifully realized, and Rickman's writing is fluid without ever descending to the pap that constitutes most popular writing.

Now, I use two BRAND NEW BAGS, and they BOTH leak. I have to throw them out after one use because they both leak.

(Isn't that why you'd buy a book with this title?) It's as if Jeffrey first wrote a typical Christian book, with various topics, from Time Management, to Child Rearing, to Money Management, in the typical DOs and DON'Ts style, then realized, \\"Whoa!

Nicholas Ray was apparently one of the great directors, but in this film he's dying of cancer and still smoking cigarettes. The vibe I quickly pick up on is two fellow artists who always reached for greatness rather than just phoning it in.It's kinda quirky, funny most of the time, powerfully moving in spots which gain strength from the unusual bits surrounding them, occasionally confusing but never boring or off-putting, and on the whole just a very watchable and memorable documentary. Moments of extreme lucidity by Nicholas Ray make the mumbly bits of his deterioration more striking.It made me glad I had some unwatched Wim Wenders DVDs in the house and it made me want to watch something by Nicholas Ray. REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, maybe, which I've always heard is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Legal \\"Snuff\\" Film...","review":"Although in obvious pain and near death, Nick is badgered and filmed in what should have been private moments with the people closest to him or not, at their descretion.

It's a allright album for starters but personally I think that the music they made from 1994-1999 was the best and many of those songs are not here, while lots of newer one's that doesn't offer you the true sound of Scooter that are here aren't very good. I own \\"Rough & Tough & Dangerous: 94-98\\" that does include some of the classics and it also offers you some wonderful instrumental trance songs that really proves the genius of this band (We don't see that very often anymore though). While songs like \\"How Much is the Fish\\" \\"I'm your Pusher\\" \\"Call me Manana\\" and \\"We are the greatest\\" are all great songs you can find them on \\"No time to Chill\\" instead, other then that, get the album I recommended instead of this that isn't really their \\"Best of\\" anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"a greenhouse must","review":"This works as described - very well!

The solar collector does not appear to need long or direct sun to keep the lights charged, mine were behind a deck, under trees and semi-covered with snow. These come with the 600ma batteries, and though I still have the 900ma batteries I bought for the older failed lights, I haven't felt pressed to upgrade.

I find it difficult to believe that almost no work in the classical tradition was submitted. The work in these pages contained almost no work of a traditional figurative nature. Both in galleries in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as at art shows/faires, there is plenty of traditional figurative work being done now in clay and bronze. I can only conclude that the judges hold a strong bias for non-traditional work.There is also an alarming gap between what I will term \\"high end art\\" and mediocre. It's pretty obvious who the former are (e.g., Violet Frey, Beth Cavener Stichter); there are all too many in the latter category.It may be that your \\"call\\" for art went out to a limited audience (to university art departments and art schools, perhaps?) and failed to capture the attention of more professional artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like this at all","review":"This book is very disappointing.It is as if they found all the disturbing, creepy figures they could find and put them in a book.

A lot of detail is presented on the structure of the Lancea Sanctum, from the role a typical ancillae plays to how the Covenant relates to other World of Darkness entities. Factions, Bloodlines, Disciplines, and new Thebean Sorcery rituals are included to add mechanical support to this broad take on one of the oldest vampiric organizations.Unfortunately, Lancea Sanctum speaks far too much in vague generalities and adds little new and interesting material to this Covenant. The rites, prayers, and roles observed by members are simplistic modifications of existing church roles that any Storyteller could easily invent. The history of the Covenant starts out interesting, but quickly degrades into a historical survey of questionable use. Finally, the new game mechanics (Bloodlines, Disciplines, etc.) are sparse and largely flavorless."},{"rating":"2","title":"bachmann two-story house","review":"I like this house.

Anyone interested in the Byzantine era would enjoy some of the details woven through the narrative.However, as I encountered in Foucault's Pendululm, there were sections that were a bit over the top for me.Nevertheless, it was a good page turner, and the character of Baudolino was well thought out in my opinion. Just his tale of how he got to be involved in the whole saga was well thought out...the elusive search for Prester John (and the associated twists and turns) was also very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good place to start reading Eco","review":"Of the four Eco books I've read (Name of the Rose, Foucault's Pendulum, Island of the Day Before, Baudolino) this is the most accessible and so it's a good place to start reading Eco and get a sense of his style of writing. What I liked most about this book is that (and I can say this without spoiling the plot!) because Baudolino states at the outset that he is a liar, the reader has to interpret the truth of the text as the story unfolds. This extends the book beyond the usual one-dimensional reading of fiction. If you like books to be bigger in this way then Eco is your man, and I'd also recommend Milorad Pavic. But let's not get carried away, here's a good place to start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Book","review":"Eco's Baudolino is a wonderful story -- but what makes it worth reading is his treatment of themes that are timeless and transcend the story -- how people come to believe what they believe, the relationship between truth and fiction, between friendship, ambition, and treachery, between a leader and his advisors. He moves from chapter to chapter writing a complex medieval romance, weaving in his store of knowledge of magical creatures, medieval theology, and science, and that story is compelling. But at the same time he tells a story of the relationship of his characters to each other, and to truth, lies, and power, that rings as modern as a headline or political memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never dull, but just too long","review":"This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion.If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith makes things become true","review":"Baudolino utters this remark 400 pages into this 500-page anything-but-a-quick-read. You kind of wish Eco had spared us the history and mythology surrounding Baudolino's life by mentioning this a little sooner.This book is a chore. Some of the history is interesting, but the overriding themes about false faith and effort in vain make the reader question the task of plowing through the book.If you're a big history buff, there might be enough in here to keep you interested. However, if you liked Eco's Name of The Rose and you're hoping this will be as good, forget it and pass this one over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible, funny and interesting","review":"I picked up the audio version of this book and absolutely adored it.

I loved \\"Name of the Rose\\" and had high hopes for this novel, but it was a colossal disappointment. The book meanders hopelessly for 500 pages and lacks any suspense whatsoever. It took 3 attempts to actually finish the novel. The first time, I read to page 200 and desisted. I then waited 2 years and made it to page 400, but stopped reading due to shear boredom. I then waited 6-months and read the final 100 pages. I have read close to 2,000 books and this is one of the 20 most boring books I have ever encountered in my lifetime. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ THIS NOVEL unless your are an insomniac that requires a sleeping aid. Reading this book is the equivalent of watching paint dry or grass grow. Baudolino is boredom at its finest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bilbo Baggins discusses the true nature of God.","review":"I read \\"The Name Of The Rose\\" and loved every page.

I had high hopes of Eco as I had heard that he's a linguistics professor. There is always a possibility that it was the translator who made this book read with the fluency of a Dick and Jane novel. Either way, now I would have a really hard time reading another Eco book. The other reviewers make me feel that perhaps I might appreciate his other books. It would be hard to open another Eco book though. I admit I kind of feel a grudge against him for writing this book. I can actually forgive the tedious personality of Baudolino, it's the lowest common denominator writing style that really made this an unfortunate reading experience for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baudolino is tedious","review":"Page after page of Eco spinning his wheels, never really saying anything. Every sentence pokes fun at something. Baudolino reminds me of Catch-22; both make you laugh, and after 500 hundred pages of the same jokes over and over you get tired. I started putting it down for a week every once in a while, and I never missed it. When I picked it back up again it was always amusing for the first day, then I would get bored again.The novel is tedious. Zero stars for readability.You do learn a little about the history of language, and Eco does an excellent job of making you feel like you relate to, humans living in the 12th-13th century. 2 pity stars.Read Calvino if you are looking for a contemporary Italian novelist with fascinating prose and something to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is for Italian History buffs...","review":"I'm still wading through the book, but I have to agree with the gentleman who said that this story is tedious, because it is. I'm not really engaged in the character Baudolino. I could care less what happens to him. The setting feels incomplete. I don't have a good picture of where the characters are at any point in time. I think that fans of Italian or Middle Age history may enjoy this more as it seems to reference a lot of history that I am not well-versed in.

If you are, in my opinion, more evolved than that and you seek to strengthen and employ the power within your Self, then you'll find this book about as helpful as a Baptist hymnal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for.","review":"This product is well made and was easy to install if you warm it up a bit first.

I was bored beyond the first few chapters, I agree with the other reviewers when they made the point that Mr. Saul tried to hard to make his main character liked. Her daughter is totally forgettable and her son is an utter hellion. It was very predictable, one reason for that were the typical characters. The irate Social worker, and the gastrological challenged Detective.Not only that the actual method the spooky cronies were using to extract whatever juice from the children is never really explained. Vague descriptions gore and of the shadowy shapes that are committing these acts.All in all it was an extremely irritating (dare I say painful) book to actually finish. After closing the book I vowed to write a review so no one would make the same mistake I made in buying this book. I know Mr. Saul can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Very nice read. One of those books you don't want to put down.The only thing I would have changed would have been more information at the ending about who the Rockwell people were, what they were, where they went, and how they did what they did. A lot of that was left to the imagination, when I would have preferred it just be explained.I felt very sorry for the little girl who had been adopted...the one the social worker went to investigate. For some reason I was drawn to her character, and still feel pangs of sympathy for her when I think of her and her situation.I haven't read all of John Saul's books, but I've read a few, and this one has been the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roman Polanski Rip-Off","review":"MIDNIGHT VOICES is a rip-off of Roman Polanski's THE TENANT and ROSEMARY'S BABY, but without the edge, suspense, characters, or atmosphere. Although the technical writing is solid, it feels bland and generic, and, like a PG-13 movie, this title should be placed in the \\"young adults\\" section. The pace picks up a bit towards the end, but it was hard to get through the melodramatic daytime soap opera dialogue of the first two-thirds. I enjoyed reading this author when I was younger, but I guess 15 years later my taste in horror runs a little deeper and more original. Did Mr. Saul really think people wouldn't compare this with Polanski's work? He should know not to mess with perfection.

I have never read any of John Saul's books before, and am very glad I chose him as a author. His work seemed appealing to me since I do enjoy reading suspense/horror books. It was not as good as Dean Koontz, but this is only because I am a huge Koontz fan, but nevertheless, I enjoyed the book. The beginning was slightly confusing, since it started off with her husband being murdered. It didnt go into as much detail as some authors would have, but it did get the point across. Secondly between the beginning and the end it did become slightly dry at times, then would pick back up and get you wanting to read the next page. The end was well writting, though, since it became more descriptive on the murders. This book has influenced me to read more of his books, since they do seem well written. My personal advice is to get out and get one of his books, read it and see how you like it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Predictable","review":"Admittedly, I'm not a big fan of horror fiction, but this was the worst novel that I've read in a long time. The pacing is s-l-o-w. The characters are so simple and one-dimensional that they areren't credible.

I guess it relates to the book, in one way or another. I liked this book compared to some of the other books by John Saul. This was one of the very few that actually had a pretty decent ending. I have to say that a lot of what he wrote about in the begining was somewhat boreing, but it really does tie in with what the rest of the book has to say. I think that John Saul should have gone further deep on giving us information about the hotel and the people in it. This would have given a better conection to the hotel, characters, and title of the book. The one thing about all of John Saul's books, that I like is that he really goes into detail about the main setting, although some of the characters are a little spacy. This is a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in murder, mystery, and gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"New York City is a pretty exciting place, so I imagined, when I bought this book, that I would be reading a pretty exciting book. After all, it was written by the former Police Commissioner, Howard Safir. And, while Safir was already out of office when the tragedy of Sept. 11 occurred, he was there during the Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima cases. That's essentially why I decided to read this book, to find out what Safir was thinking during all that chaos. To my great disappointment, he didn't tell us much. In fact, throughout the entire book, there is very little feel for the man Safir is. Perhaps he and his ghost writer weren't able to communicate or maybe Safir is just trying to forget those dark days as 'top cop'. I don't know. What I do know is, this is little more than a commercial for his new venture into homeland security. Lots of fluff, very little else. Too bad. I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Competition","review":"The reviewer above who doesn't understand how one can love this album AND admit that they are playing against, rather than with, each other, just doesn't get it. That's what grabs me in every minute of this recording- three brilliant minds, challenging each other to break out of the square box of jazz in all its forms. It's clear that each of these men is a composer in their own right, and the competition is thick. It's like watching a boxing match between the top heavyweights- every second is fascinating. I can feel Mingus struggling to impress the Duke, and sometimes getting grumpy when he can't keep up. Then he starts plucking aggressively, daring Ellington to break out. Roach, always the gentleman, dodges and sways with each punch the two dish out, like a cool referee.

Such a shame that the original engineer ruined it, and all the 24-bit remastering in the world is not going to salvage it.Listen to the samples before you buy - this is one severely distorted recording.

Instead, I felt like I had wasted my money on this book because it didn't explain much but circumvented the issues. I think the title says a lot calling violent children as savage spawn. Is he implying that children are born evil? No, I don't think so. I think he means well but the children described and their cases have many underlying factors such as poverty, broken homes, divorce, single parents, violence, and abuse to help infuse their violent natures. No, children aren't born violent but are nurtured by these factors. Kellerman sounds like an expert without having to deal with first-hand as if it's not his neighborhood. His reflections are quite vague in thought despite his background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kellerman should stick to novel writing","review":"Filled with sensational phrases (beginning with the title), this thin little book purports to be reflections on violent children. Beyond dropping a few names, Kellerman has little to add to the question of how to deal with severely troubled children. Instead, he fans the flames of fear and loathing of youthful offenders with sensationalism and rhetoric by alluding to Hitler, Butch Cassidy, and Ted Kaczynski. Maybe the readers of USA Today can find something worthwhile in this drivel, but I found Savage Spawn to be a wasted effort.

Instead, Kellerman stretched it out into a book, and the results are less than inspiring. Although he does bring in some interesting insight and ideas, best expressed in two specific examples, he continually adresses the broader issue of psycopathy in general, instead of in children. Also, Kellerman obviously has a political agenda that includes harsh prison sentences and the belief that some people are born evil. While there is nothing wrong with these beliefs, they unfortunately affect the authors objectivity on the subject he is writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire rubbish","review":"The fact that JK trained as a child psychologist horrifies me.

I thought he was maybe saying that because they DO work and he wouldn't get the business if everyone started using them. But he was right.

I call Comcast and they sent a technician to check. The technician ran a test to check the signal strenght. It was 3. The normal range should between 0 and 16 so 3 is in the low range and he said that may be why the connection drops. The incoming coaxial cable splits two ways, one goes to the TV and the other goes to the modem. That weekens the signal further. He suggested not to split the cable and make it go to the modem directly. After that, the modem works fine. So, the major problem is not entirely on Linksys.

The local telephone company wanted $125 to install a phone line extension in our living room on an outside wall needed to connect to a DirecTV system.The only phone jacks in our home was 1 telephone jack in the kitchen and one in the master bedroom. I plugged the transmitter unit into a power recepticle in the bedroom and connected the unit to a nearby phone jack. I then plugged the receiver unit into the power recepticle in the living room and used a telephone to test the circuit in the living room. Worked great with no noise on the line. Unplugged the telephone and connected the receiver unit to the DirecTV receiver. All worked great. Instructions that came with the system were easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"I purchased this product to connect to my directv receiver which has a caller id feature. Some of these devices similar to teh RC930 that I looked at doesn't support caller id and were not well documented that they didn't. The RCA930 clearly states that it does and it works!I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the price. This is the second one that I have purchased in the past 3 years. Old technology but does what I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough for a fax machine","review":"I just used one of these to move my fax machine to a location that didn't have a phone jack. There's a pretty bad 60 Hz hum (powerline noise) on the line, so I wouldn't use it for a voice line, but I've both sent and received faxes with it successfully.Some of the reviews indicate that buyers clearly don't understand the technology. This product is \\"wireless\\" only in the sense that it allows you to avoid running a dedicated telephone wire. However, the base and extension units communicate with each other over the power wiring in your home, not via any wireless communication technology. This is why the devices are sensitive to being plugged in via surge protectors. The documentation provided with the product fails to make this clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well... for a little while","review":"I was happy with this product for a year.

I'll stick with the long phone lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product can be a useful compromise","review":"This product will reduce the connection/sound quality in any and all circumstances, but may also be a useful compromise. If you have decided not to add a new telephone jack, even though you could probably use one; you may want to get this. The \\"wireless modem jacks\\" are superior to the less expensive \\"wireless phone jacks,\\" they provide better sound quality and faster data rates. I know this from experience(the modulation of the telephone signal into a radio signal is the source of the quality loss). I have also read that nearby ham radios may experience some interference.All in all, I'm glad that I have one but the outrageous prices that are charged for this very simple device prevent me from giving it more than two stars...This price is bad enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a champ","review":"I wasn't sure if this would work, but it works great.

The quality of the sound was fair (always a low hum and static, but I could still carry on a conversation.) The modem connection was slow, as noted by other reviewers. The reason I took it back was that the phone hooked to this jack would ring 20 or 30 times a day, but no one was calling.

This unit is really lousy. I called tivo for an unrelated issue one day, and the guy on the phone said \\"you're using one of those wireless modem things aren't you\\" - he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir. I didn't know because the tivo managed to mask the failures, but after trying several online tivo updates, I got to finding out how much this really doesn't work.

The stations are about 20 feet apart with a wall and furniture in between, but I have not had connectivity issues. I have two wireless networks (b and g)in the same area and have not had the interference problems others have mentioned. That said, my parents tried using the same system in their home and got lots of static and dropped modem connections over a 15 ft. line-of-sight installation with no other wireless networks, so the system seems to be somewhat picky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going to swith to Phonex PX 441","review":"I had the same problems as the other reviewers.

Not recommended at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much interference","review":"I bought this item for a customer. There was so much electrical noise on the system that you couldn't hear a dial tone at all. I then took the system to my house which has a good grounding system thinking that the electrical interference would be minimized but found that although it would work, there was the electrical hum there also and very loud. I tried to use it for a fax line, but half the time the faxes wouldn't go through so I had to disconnect it and I'm probably going to throw it away since I've had it so long I don't feel right about returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Track Record","review":"I purchased the cordless phone jack for my DirecTV system, and it worked fine for three months. Then it broke down. I reset the system and it worked great for another two days before breaking down again. I decided I must have gotten a lemon (it happens), and I purchased a new system.

I am returning the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for Tivo/ReplayTV","review":"If you don't want to run a new phone jack to accomodate a PTV recorder such as Tivo or ReplayTV, this jack works just fine. While it may only be connecting at 33.6 or so, it has been rock solid reliable since I've gotten it, and saved the expense of installing a new jack.

This is a big problem because it is almost impossible to find miter guides and other accessories such as sliding miter tables, etc. that will work with this saw. To make matters worse, the miter guide that comes with the saw is a joke. It is not very accurate, and it is very short.

The only charcoal grill I would buy is a weber-the quality is definately worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"We're enjoying our new Weber grill. Quality is superb, this grill will last a long time. The size is terrific for us - we don't feed the hordes. It's on our deck, and the ash catcher at the bottom works perfectly. We actually have a gas grill, but don't use it now because grilling over charcoal tastes so much better, and this Weber makes it ultra-convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent grill","review":"Like others, I debated which size and model grill to order, as there is a pretty big price difference between the different models. I am happy with the 18.5 inch size, but if you're cooking for more that 2 people or more than one meal at a time, you will not be able to fit all of the food onto the grill at once. The main differences between the silver and gold models are the ash catcher and hinged grill plates; it may seem like a steep premium for these features, but I feel they are worth it. Also got the chimney starter and clip-on side table--really nice. I am a charcoal grilling novice, but very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool Grille !!!","review":"We owned a 22\\" Weber for 22+ years. Worked best for us for burgers and other fast cook food.Problem was, disposing the ashes was a major issue.

Enter the 18 1/2 inch with ash collector.We're happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Good customer service too. It shipped with a chipped lid.

Well you can't get any better than a Webber Grill. I've had lots of grills in my life but i have to admit this is the best one i ever had. It looks nice, it does a great job and it's made extremely well. You won't be sorry if you buy one. If your reading about grills for the first time, do yourself a favor and buy a Webber. What you pay for two or three grills over the year all you have to do is buy a Webber and they are made to last forever.

I recently purchased the 18 1/2\\" model and have found it to be very effective and easy to use.The shape of the kettle and lid distributes heat evenly across the cooking surface. The heat can be easily controlled using the vents to allow more or less airflow. Easy to assemble. Cleanup is quick. The simplicity of the design means there is little that can break or go wrong with it.Obviously the engineers at Weber put a lot of thought into how people will use the product and came up with a truly elegant design. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This grill is fabulous!","review":"I am no pro at grilling, but this grill makes it all so easy! It was easy to put together, easy to use, and easy to clean up. Everything I toss on it turns about perfectly grilled and absolutely yummy! There are cheaper charcoal grills out there, but if you're a petite woman, like me, who doesn't grill for a living, it is well worth the extra money for the little conveniences of this grill. I got the 18 1/2 inch grill, and it has plenty of room for preparing dinner for 4-6 adults. Since putting my grill together, I have cooked out every weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the larger one","review":"I bought this a year ago and it's been everything that you'd hope. It's really like magic, nothing burns and everything comes out fantastic. Not sure why, I think it has something to do with the quantity of heat that charcoal puts out, but I definitely don't know anything beyond \\"cooks like whoa\\".The legs on these grills suck, like many other reviewers have commented.I do have one piece of advice... buy the \\"normal\\" 22.5\\" weber, not this smaller one. Nearly every accessory is made for the 22.5, very very few of them fit this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, but flimsy aluminum pot","review":"The steel is solid. The lid covers the grill perfectly. The aluminum pot is of lesser quality than the gold 22.5 inch models. The aluminum part that holds the pot is thin and can be bent in all shapes and forms with little effort, but it serves its function. I probably would go with the cheaper silver model if I was to do it again. I do like that the very bottom of the grill is aluminum so it will not rust if water collects after I clean the grill. So far this weber has worked as desired. I like the portability of the 18.5 size. I can lift it easily after a cleaning and stick it in the garage. I can see I lifetime of delicious meals ahead of me. And this is made in the U.S.A.

I watched this movie in full but contemplated turning it off multiple times. Honestly, I watched it to see other films from Robert Pattinson. I am a Twilight fan. I found a lot of the quirkiness of \\"Art\\" to mimic things that the \\"Edward Cullen\\" character portrays. I found this unsettling. I did not want to see the Cullen character in Art. I came away from this movie deciding that I was not seeing \\"Art\\" and \\"Edward\\" but possibly I was seeing the quirkiness of Rob. Anyone that is a Pattinson fan will probably love this film. He is in all the scenes and does a great job in his character. I just didn't find this film funny and did not enjoy it. I much preferred \\"Little Ashes\\".

If you find it difficult to understand the \\"Queen's English\\", just watch it several times like I did. Of course Robert Pattinson is so good at playing this character \\"Art\\", and he interacts with his family and friends in this \\"no one understands me\\" way, that you have to adore his attempts.

He has no direction in life and desparately wants a close family life and to be an entertainer although he has no real talent (that hasn't stopped many young stars today)and strives to improve himself through a self help book and tutor.For what it's worth, I think Pattinson is very watchable whether playing a vampire, an anguished artist or a misunderstood young man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gift","review":"My father In Law was in fifth heaven when he received these movies.

At best it could be said Burklin is misguided. At worst I fear he is being used by the Communist authorities to promote their agenda, as many people who have alligned themselves to the Three-Self Church have become either willingly or unwittingly over the years.Burklin starts out dealing with a beautiful subject, the growth of the Church in China, but ends up with several large flies in the ointment through his inflexible and dogmatic stance for the government-sanctioned Church and his tacit opposition to the \\"illegal\\" house churches.Give this book a miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Special","review":"First of all the examples are not put on a CD, nor can you download them from the publishers website.

Acting wise, well, to say I was suprise is an understatement. Yes, there are those moments of bad dialogue and all that, but over all the cast did fairly well. Also the production values seem fairly high on this one. The picture is decent,and seems to be filmed, not taped. And the music is very good. Also the thriller part of the movie comes off very well due to the fact that the characters, although far from deep, are mostly likeable.

A very easy book to read and somewhat of a biograhy of Marshall that really captures her emotions. Her husband took her journal entries and that of others to write this book, so we get to see exactly how she felt during her trials. It is a great book to see her learning how God works and watch him conform her to His image. Marshall really battles it out with God at times, but in the end, they both win.

The writing is horrendous, the photos (or photocopies) are beyond laughable, and the research is at best shallow. My elementary school students could have done a better job. Don't bother with this book (if you can even locate a copy now). \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\" was a classy show with high quality writing, and and any book about it ought to be on par with those standards of excellence.

Wood, Jr. of TV book writers. It is obvious that Grams loves classic radio and television and that he is tireless in his efforts to write books about some of the greatest series of all time. Sadly, it is also obvious that he is one of the most incompetent writers and editors to ever produce so many texts. I feel almost guilty panning his books since he so clearly enjoys writing them. However, like Ed Wood, his enthusiasm doesn't make him any more competent or talented. Take this as a warning. Save your money, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a tome, but somewhat wearying.","review":"I awaited the arrival of this book with great eagerness. Alas,I was somewhat dissapointed. While it is a comprehensive guide to all th episodes and includes interviews with the makers of the show, plus Hitchcock filmography, the individual synopsis'could have been written with a little more familiarity to the plot. Furthermore, the authors reviews on each plot could have been written with more description and commentary. It certainly isn't a Twilight Zone companion by Marc Scott Zicree, that's for sure.However, that being said, it was a major undertaking and it will serve as a great resource. One more thing: the all the photos look like cheap xeroxes. A worthy purchase for all you Hitchcock Presents afficionados."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchable but not a must-see","review":"High production values with great scenery. But don't expect a great story--it's simple, trite, very predictable. The acting is OK. The dialogue (subtitles) is almost childish like the plot, and at times confusing.

However, I like the fact that it's lightweight and easy to take out and brush off, and since we don't use the truck for hauling much more than groceries, it's fine for our purposes.

When I went to wrap them (5 days later), I noticed they were a month beyond the freshness expiration. I took them back to the store for an exchange (a 30 mile round trip to the mall and a wasted hour of my time). The clerk went through the shelf stock and at least 90% were out of date. She finally found one that was still fresh and exchanged the cashews. I didn't hang around to see if the out of date stock went back on the shelf, but I think it's inexcusable to sell old merchandise and I'm seeing it more and more at retail shops.This company used to be more quality conscious, but after this experience, I cannot recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Just Never Got off the Ground!","review":"After reading Neil Ravin's Informed Consent, my first question is, where was the editor? Generic drugs are capitalized, trade names are not, medical slang is misspelled. This tale of a doctor in a research-oriented university hospital has many promising elements, but they just aren't developed well enough to make a good book. The subplot involving the investigative reporter could have been intriguing but instead is ho-hum; why tell us the contents of her well-stocked medicine cabinet without disclosing her need for the many heavy-duty psychotropics? Unlike the characters in Ravin's earlier M.D., these doctors are poorly defined and sort of blur into each other. The noncompliant, hospital-hating patient does get our sympathy, and the details of the medical detective work involved in identifying his disease are interesting, but I found the book to limp along without the spark and freshness of M.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but irritating","review":"Holladay's a pretty decent lexicon.

Unfortunately, I was highly disappointed. The plot seemed to owe far too much to other \\"woman in distress\\" pastiches we've all read, and the characters just doesn't seem to ring true.

The story features a great ensemble of voice actors (besides the VA who does Kenan..but to be fair...there wasn't much range to work with). Digimon isn't usually known for a strong background score, but this season the production company chose to change that by offering a blend of strong rock/keyboard blend that really works in the tense battles situations. The set itself is designed fairly well and as for the content...while I personally don't prefer Widescreen, it's bearable.

Benny Hinn captures this special realationship in a way that will show you how to find that same intimacy with God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read","review":"I write this review as someone who has loved the ministry of benny Hinn, until recent. The writings in this book would appear to be true, but what I know about Benny Hinn makes me wonder if anything the pastor has said holds any truth. He has gone as far as to clame Christ will appear physically in bodily form at meetings. He has also claimed to speak to kathryn kuhlman in an out of body experience. He has also cursed his enemies openly as well. All of this info is documented, just look on the internet. If you want more info do a search of benny hinn on a search engine. Read with caution. Remember, Christians are to bless those that curse them, and pray for those that spightfully use them. Also jesus warned us that if someone claims that christ is here or there, beliieve them not. For many false prohets and false christ's shall show great signs and wonders to decieve the elect if possible. Matt. 24:23,24"},{"rating":"2","title":"MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW","review":"I believe, as a Christian, nothing other than salvation is more important to know about then the revelation and work of the Holy Spirit in these endtimes. Pastor Benny Hinn in his outstanding book, \\"Good Morning, Holy Spirit\\" opens the door to a better understanding of the One who is at work within us and around us.Often the Christian community of writers seems to overlook the importance of the third person of the Trinity. We as the Body of Christ need to learn how to cooperate with His work within us and on the earth.Pastor Hinn shares his story of meeting and growing in his relationship with the Holy Spirit. He speaks of His personality and how important He is in the Godhead and encourages you as a believer to hunger after His companionship, as He greatly hungers after yours.I enjoyed this book and felt it helped my spiritual walk. We need more like it!Shirley Johnson/Reviewer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Benny Hinn a son of Lucifer ?","review":"It is sad to see so many people deceived by Benny Hinn.

Just because a man is successful according to the standards of the world (i.e. the largeness of this man's \\"ministry\\" and even the converts who claim to be changed) does not make him a spiritual success. \\"Good Morning Holy Spirit\\" is so full of doctrinal errors...every true believer born of the spirit should be able to see right through it. From his corrupt view of the Trinity to the idea that God wants everyone to be prosperous, it should be made known that getting involved with Hinn's movement can be very dangerous to one's spiritual growth. For those truly interesting in having a healthy relationship with God and leaving the diet of cotton candy and Milk Duds, try something like \\"Mere Christianity\\" by CS Lewis. It would be so much better for your health!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Morning Holy Spirit","review":"My Journey to Spiritual RestorationThis is a powerful book.

I listen to it during my hour drive to work, it helps keep the imagination fired in spite of the mind-numbing commute. I haven't tried it in Faerun yet, but look forward to it. This CD makes perfect atmosphere music; it is moody and rich, but it's subtle enough so that it doesn't distract or intrude.***UPDATE: here it is a year later, and I still listen to this CD all the time.

As a longtime Midnight Syndicate fan and avid roleplaying gamer, I was really looking forward to this release, but the band has been getting whimpier and whimpier with its last few cd's, and this one is really boring on top of it. A lot of the tracks just keep on repeating the same monotonous melodies over and over (and over and over!). There's one track called \\"Behind Door Number One\\" that sounds like someone forgot to turn off the microphone at the end of a recording session, and all you hear are some muffled voices. There are a few tracks that can be used as background music, but they aren't as moody or melodic as the band's earlier material.If you are running a D&D campaign where you want your party members to fall asleep, this is the soundtrack for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Syndicate fans rejoice!!","review":"Honestly I was disappointed that the new Syndicate CD was to be a D&D themed release. How could my favorite halloween artist's do this to me? But, I'm a good sport so I figured I'd get it anyway. Thankfully, this CD is excellent and does not disappoint this longtime Midnight Syndicate fan. There's still a horror-esque element to many of the tracks, while other tracks have an epic feel with melodies that are catchy and tend to linger long after the music has stopped. Sound effects are present but used sparingly and to good effect. My personal favorite has to be track #5 \\"Descent into the Depths\\". Overall, this is a strong album that makes for a good spin. I never got into D&D when I was growing up but I'm sure this CD would create the perfect mood as you roll the dice only to find that your favorite character gets eaten by an Orc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey Beyond Imagination","review":"Midnight Syndicate has always been about the journey - taking you somewhere unique and special with their music, and leaving you with a lasting memory of the time you spent there. Their discs evoke compelling imagery and fantastic exploits without the need for a vocal tour guide. Like any great movie score, a Midnight Syndicate disc resonates with emotion, leading you through another reality with passion, pride, and confidence.The official Dungeons & Dragons soundtrack is more than just cool sound to play in the background of your roleplaying games. It's a companion on your quest, always reminding you that the adventure comes first, and always reminding you that danger and challenges beyond your imagination await you ahead.And for those of you assuming that this disc is only for RPG geeks, think again! Do you like Dead Can Dance? Bauhaus? Then you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great encounters album.","review":"This soundtrack is very well arranged and produced, and if you were to just throw it on, people would wonder what it was while simultaneously enjoying the music. However, if you are running a gaming group, this album can really enhance the experience. A dragon is about to swoop down onto your group? There is a track for that. Being chased by some hardcore bad guys, or perhaps the town watch? Gotcha covered. About to descend into the Underdark? Yep...got that. Pretty much any type of encounter or situation has its own soundtrack if you have this album.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Content good - Presentation poor","review":"The title gives the impression that you are going to be whisked away into that world everyone dreams about - your secret place.

It's a low-cost production, it seems they not even tried to hide that it was shoot in Germany and not the U.S.. The story was more than thin and the repetitions of scenes again and again were absolutely unnecessary, except for the reason to stretch the movie...Well... like Ian wrote a few years ago (after \\"The Lost Samaritan\\") on a message board: \\"It's been a crazy road but I'm back in the saddle and wanting to send a huge thank you and express to you that I'm truly sorry for bad movies, bad characters and most of all a bad disappearing act!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I do not own this but my cello professor does.

I heard echoes of the albums Foxbase Alpha, Continental, and, in terms of keyboards, The Misadventures of Saint Etienne. It's music for the head and heart.

You also get wonderful the track \\"Soft Like Me\\", with a great rap intro, jump on the dance floor when \\"Shower Scene\\" starts playing. Other standouts include \\"New Thing\\" and \\"B92\\".

Opening a few years before the death of Peter Abelard (d. 1142), it revolves around the basic tenets of his religious philosophy. The love story of Abelard and Hélose serve both as a backdrop and as the outline for the romantic sub-theme involving the main character, Catherine LeVendeur.The mystery is pure good versus evil, but it is not as simple as it may seem. Readers may want to brush up on the basics of Abelard's philosophy to recognize the parallels. Also, the storytelling is skilled so that whodunnit remains a mystery until the end.The book opens what promises to be an excellent medieval mystery series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Mystery","review":"Catherine, a novice at the Paraclete, finds herself embroiled in a mystery outside the safe walls of the convent.

Catherine is asked by her Mother Superior to retrieve something that has been found near her home so she leaves the convent to do so. She gets embroiled in a nasty conspiracy that forces her to use all her wits to keep herself and an interesting scholar that she meets out of trouble. There's lots of excitement - dead bodies, stolen gems and more plots and counterplots within a great abby. Catherine manages to uncover all the mysteries, and finds love at the same time.

It's kind of like he took a snapshot of his own day that has endured until our time. Now that's what I call sweet history action!!!

Then explains basic posing from the how to place the feet for good support to the tilt of the head. From the best clothes to trouble shooting problems like what to do with eyeglasses, double chins, overweight and a bald head. The book has many pages on lighting, 45 degree lighting with 4 lights, narrow and broad lighting, to split lighting and butterfly lighting.I also recommend \\"Master Posing Guide for Portrait Photography\\" by J.D.

In particular, such recipes as Nutola should be declared illegal. If you lose weight on this diet, it will be a testament to the resilience of your stomach and colon. Please try some other plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This diet book is a waste of money. If I would go on this diet, I would starve. It is so restrictive that I would very soon be bored with the foods allowed. I want to lose weight but I don't think I would be able to stick to this restrictive a plan.

If you are an informed health and consumer, there is absolutely nothing new in this book for you to learn.There are three food groups: proteins, fats and carbs. Like most diet books today, when you toss out carbs you leave the other two. This book says eat all you want of the fats but make that good fats-avocados, yada, yada, yada.

It also comes with the usual dietary myths, i.e. after 6 weeks of no carbs, no sweets, no fruits, no starchy veggies, you'll adjust and be repulsed by the dessert tray and your palate will awaken to the full range of flavors found in celery...... Don't count on it.The diet leaves you with very very limited choices (spinach and almond salad 5x week?). No question weight loss will follow. I just don't believe anyone with the tremendous willpower to follow this diet would need it. Few people would be satisfied on a permanent diet of limited lean meat and green leafy vegetables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle price shouldn't be same or higher than paperback price","review":"Publisher collusion (not Amazon's fault): The Kindle price for this book (at the time of this writing) is higher than the physical book price. The only explanation for this is collusion on the part of publishers. There are very little supply-chain costs related to the e-book version, and those cost savings should be reflected in the retail price of the e-book version, which is effectively set by the publisher via their wholesale price to places like Amazon. Competition should prevent this from happening, but because there are only a few major publishers, they are able to control prices in this manner. I will not support publishers who do this, and instead buy a used copy of the physical book so that they will benefit only minimally from their anti-competitive way of doing business."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rosedale Diet","review":"We are currently on the diet and it seems to be working.

I was able to read it cover to cover in an hour or so while sitting in an airport and found nothing remarkable - the striking part is that the book dismisses objects, methods and properties which the author does not understand or have experience with. REFRESH, for example (which is treated dismissively in the book) must be used in order to refresh a changed collection in a multi-user environment or update a collection in a rapidly changing single-user environment, or the field that you expected to be gone will still appear; or the table that you just built using DAO won't be in the collection.I was disappointed that Oreilly allowed such a book to be published.

They are there to furfill the wish of the father, Elwood, who had them visit in his own youth. They lead the family in carols and give them all baseball equipment to play all of the Christmas Eve night!The pictures are terrific. They show a very down to earth, non-fancy family, with all kinds of neat details of their life. The Christmas message is there, but in a subtle and fun to read way.

We are a family of book lovers, and this one just totally misses all marks. I GUESS if you have a really large fondness for cows and anything cow-themed you might find it cute, but for the average person it wasn't very holiday-ish, it seemed like a really forced effort to parody a classic Christmas tale and was just weird rather than creative.

My wife and I watched this concert over and over on our Tivo, and like this live concerts vertions of the REO songs better than the original album vertions. The audio and video quality of the broadcast concert were outstanding and I hope it is on this DVD also. I am trying to find this concert on Blu Ray, but if it is not offered that way, I will still buy the regular DVD vertion because this is a performance I know I will enjoy with my wife for years to come.After being so impressed with this, I will admit that my wife and I went to the REO Speedwagon web site to see if we can go see them live in concert!

This means immediate write-through to prevent data loss. Furthermore, I am ultra-careful never to simply pull the drive out. I always either use the eject function or leave it in while I power down my laptop.These days all I put on it are MP3s that are only read. It simply loses files.

The novel is soaked in the sights and sounds of fifties pop culture--I was not alive in this era of Stereophonic Sound and Joan Crawford weepies, but this novel transported me into a gentler era, or at least the illusion of one. I can't count how many times I laughed reading of Benjamin's (and his family's) capers--I really felt like I was inside the mind of a 9-year old Los Angeles boy trying to make sense of the world around him as much as he is the platitudes his mother is fond of tossing at him.

From 1966-72, artillery, bombing, communist repression forced peasants to leave their villages to migrate to cities. The atrocities of the Viet Cong during and after the 1968 Tet attack caused people \\"to vote with their feet\\": they ran away as soon as they heard communists were coming. This was also the cause of the 1975 diaspora during which two million people escaped Vietnam on rickety boats. At least 500,000 others drowned or died from other causes at sea.The author who is to be congratulated for his in-depth analysis of this important problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"We use this phone outside by our hottub and pool.

The interpretations on this album are extremely literal, and that's not a compliment.

Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories about the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International.

My son likes to jump on his bed occasionally, and this mattress just couldn't stand up to it. If you have a tame child who will use the mattress just to sleep, then you should be fine.

She is not as sexy in this film as she can be, she is not as interesting as she can be and in fact she looks bored.Val Kilmer offers a little bit of comedic relief but eventually grows tiresome as the film enters it's final act.I'd give this film two out of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for American history shelves","review":"Bill O'Neal's The Johnson County War is a true, historical count of a violent and bloody conflict in Wyoming's northern rangeland.

While all of the views of the author are not necessarily my own, she does present this material in a way that is thought provoking and informative. Birthing women and their partners can benefit from reading this material in that it gives back to them a sense of control that is sadly lacking in today's highly mechanized childbirth.

I definitely recommend the rolling cart (some could find the grill somewhat heavy and cumbersome) and propane tank attachment - especially if you plan on grilling a lot on a trip or at a tailgate.

Serious drawbacks should be considered before the purchase of this item. 1)* The fold out leafs are plastic, warp easily and offer little support. 2) The tank support provides only for a narrow disposable cylinder and needs to be removed for a wider one. 3) The grill simply does not provide enough heat to cook any thing rare to MR without having to move the item perpetually around the grill to get the grate to sear it. Forget about Tuna or any other high grade Fish Searing as well as a great rare to MR steak unless it's over two inches thick.I expect more from a no frills single burner grill costing $ 180- I can get the same poor results from a $50 grill.

She suggested a new regulator, but since I've already replaced it once, I think I'll just junk this grill. I hear if you use the little disposables that this problem doesn't exist, but that isn't exactly sustainable, is it?there has to be a better way to engineer this grill. in the meantime, find another one if you intend to use a full size home tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best gas grill I've ever used!","review":"I bought this because one of my friends had one and I had to use it when mine wouldn't work.

Its burner is too small to heat sufficiently, especially when it is cold outside. At only 12,000 BTUs it cannot generate enough heat to get the cover even moderately warm and consequently, it does not grill well. It is too large to be truly portable, in the way of tent camping. And the side shelves are too weak to hold a plate of hamburgers without bending precariously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, underpowered, faulty","review":"Our Q200 arrived with a faulty ignition system. Since purchasing we saw a review of this item in the local paper, and their's also had a faulty ignition system. We reported the problem to Weber which quickly sent out -- a replacement, but sent the part for a different model. So we are still lighting by hand. The Weber does cook food well, but remember that unless you spring for the Q300 you get only one burner, and no warming plates -- fine if you are cooking a few burgers, but a problem if you are cooking multiple items. It means that you have to magically cook everything so that it is done simultaneously in order to keep all items warm. I can only assume that all the positive reviews come from people who have never cooked with gas before, and are thrilled at the easy and even cooking that this, and most gas BBQs provide. But anyone with experience with a larger home unit providing multiple burners will find the Q Series a frustrating experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Does not light.

It fails every time we use it. It is cumbersome, not easily portable. It goes out in the slighest breeze. Can't imagine using it on a windy beach. Sometimes it goes out for no apparent reason. The hose connecting the grill to a regular propane tank was defective and had to be replaced. Sometimes the grill will not heat above 200 degrees. When the flame fails, a long wait is required before re-lighting. The small propane cylinder is inadequate for entertaining more than a few, but that doesn't matter, because there are so many other defects, you may never run out of fuel in the first place.The little rolling cart is flimsy. There is no place to put the larger conventional propane tank.The product may be cute, but it is the perfect way to spoil a party.A complete dud. In our experence three sticks and a match work just as well. Not what you might expect from Weber."},{"rating":"1","title":"180 bucks for that???","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the Weber Q grill is a quality grill that grills up food very nicely. But for $180 it's surprising the lack of features it has for a portable grill.For a portable grill, it's heavy. Does it have a built-in stand that collapses into a handle and wheels, so that you can wheel it around? How about interchangeable cooking surfaces, so you can do more than grill? How about 2 burners so you can cook at different temps?I'm sorry, I might pay $80 or so for a portable gas grill with this limited set of features. I think the other $100 is for the Weber name stamped on it.If you'd like to look at something a lot more versatile and feature rich, check out theColeman 9949-750 Road Trip Grill LXE (Red)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No customer service","review":"if you ever have to call Weber customer service you are in trouble.They employ the nicest sounding, most polite people on the face of the earth but they are clueless.They are worse than the the strictest script reading overseas CSR's because they are convinced that you are stupid and the key to your intellectual salvation lies on the scripted response sheet they have in front of them.If you have mechanical or engineering experience that indicates what they are telling you might be wrong, well you are just a silly man!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little Grill","review":"We had this grill for 2 summers and just loved it.

The main unit itself was great and cooked our food really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great Initially...then problems....","review":"We purchased the Weber 200 based on it's compact size & the good reviews that we found here on Amazon - and was pleased w/the grill's performance for approx 6 months until we decided to convert/using the convertor hose w/a 20lb LP tank. (The smaller portable tanks are OK but are not recycylable in our area.) Once we started to use the hose/tank combo, the safety mechanism on the regulator would be triggered, causing low flames/temperatures. We tried 'resetting' the grill MANY, MANY times, but did not have much luck. Too bad- have to throw away a good grill into the landfill and get another one (charbroil next time perhaps?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for tailgating","review":"I use mine at the Jets game and its perfect. Folds and unfolds very easily and handles any meal you want to prepare. The best is that it fits full sized aluminum foil trays with the cover closed, so you can bring home-cooked stew, chili, etc. and reheat it at the game.The rolling duffel bag is very heavy duty and has 3 roller blade wheels on one end to easily roll it to your tailgating location. It also has plenty of extra room inside to carry spare tanks. The bag is my favorite part of the grill. It has a huge Weber logo on the side and people stare when you lift that huge bag out of your car.The stand is also a great accessory because it frees up table space and folds down flat when you are done.I definately recommend this grill to anyone who tailgates or needs a small grill at there summer home or back patio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portable Grill","review":"This is a very well made and durable grill. I bought it from a local hardware store after reading other reviews about shipping damage. It is quite heavy for a portable grill. Don't plan on carrying it long distances from the car unless you have someone else there to help you. The only complaint I have about it so far is that it can be difficult to light under windy conditions. The electric starter won't light the flame if the wind is blowing so bring a lighter or matches with you, just in case. Other than that, we are very happy with the Q.

After watching the 2006 reviews of the AMA Superbike and the Motogp, I was equally excited to watch the 2006 sbk.It's a good review; however, it's choppy compared to the ama and motogp reviews. the dvd follow the race year through, but with more clips of the races...and not as much of summarys with commentary....basically, it's like someone just through all the 2006 races on the cutting board and chopped them all down to size.Still worth watching, but you might end up skipping through as you'll find it a little hard to keep your attention. I would recommend the 2006motogp review 1st, the 2006 AMA superbike review 2nd, the 2006 formula 1 review 3rd and the 2006 world superbike review 4th."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good, not bad","review":"I have several other years of the SBK series' review and this was the worst. Comparing the production values from the '01 to this year: No rider interviews, no production bike reviews (steve parrish) and (this was the worst) no on-board camera footage; despite the fact the packaging and Duke Video say otherwise. The racing action is reasonably good and the commentating is reasonably good. In summary, a copy of what you'd see on TV with the on-board camera footage subtracted.

He comes across, in fact, as the ultimate boy scout in a shark-infested business. Part instructional, part ever-so-careful not to offend anyone, Martinez writes in a conversational, run-of-the-milll average-guy style that allows you to skim to the sections that may mean more to you. On the one hand, it's banal and boring and on the other, there are nut n' bolts insights that should be helpful for a rank beginner.As someone involved in the business for many years, looking for some hidden insights or juicy info, I was disappointed. But I DID learn a little more about the way pilot season works and for that reason alone, I found this very brief tome to have some worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't like reading and I read this!","review":"I typically don't like reading, but I read how great this book was so I got it.

If you are looking for someone successful in the business to tell you the truth, this is the book for you. If you are thinking about going into acting, read this first! Not only does this book tell you about how to start acting, but it gives you many answers to commonly asked questions. This is about the business side of acting - something that every actor NEEDS to learn about if they are serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Career Actors Valuable research material.","review":"Serious Career Actors Valuable research material.

The author is an Agent, and gives tons of useful advice on what to do to get ahead in your acting career.There is helpful advice on agents and managers, headhsots, auditions and lots more. I really found the chapter on TV Pilot Season very useful.Also scattered through out the book, are a few true-to-life stories of situations that happened to this agent. I really laughed at some of the stories he told about actors who came to interview with him. These stories really got his point across about the Do's and Don'ts of the acting business.All in all, a very useful and informative book for the Actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Interesting...","review":"This was a fascinating read, for the primary reason of discovering how the mind of one of the most controversial writers around today functions and processes information. Truly interestingHitchens constantly reminds his students that their primary targets for derision and out right rejection are those who \\"come from authority\\" or otherwise claim to have authority and only use it for conservative and reactionary purposes.Without getting into a discussion of how this book may contradict his later writings about the Iraq War, both sides of his writing provides interesting insight.I recommend this short book."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read for Hitchens fans","review":"I don't think it is possible to understand Hitchens' writing until you understand what motivates him. He is a contrarian. So, if he is arguing a position you don't agree with as a liberal - that is the point! We don't need our views re-inforced, we need them challenged. And Hitchens does that from a Humanist perspective, which is why I value his work. I found this book to be a wonderful and enlightening read. You learn about his past, what brought him to contrarianism and why he persists as a contrarian. If you like Hitch, or just want to understand him better, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchens is Great","review":"This is a handbook for anyone who likes to prevail in the search for truth business. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gore Vidal, alas.","review":"Other reviewers have certainly pointed out the book's and Hitchen's stong points, but I think that they're too generous. The remarkable thing about Hitchens is his rise to such great fame and authority on what is really a meagre spread. He likes to tout his receipt of the mantle from Gore Vidal, but he's neither as gifted as a writer nor as searching in his critique. It's possibly an unfair comparison, but it's one that we're invited to make, and given the contrast, the invitation seems more aggrandizing than accurate.This book, while fun, ... Well, to my eye, that's its strong point. It seems a bit of a knock-off and perhaps has it's audience among the fresh-faced and fawning.If I were looking for someone more in the line of Gore Vidal I'd suggest John Ralston Saul. Compared to Hitchens, Saul's observations and analyses are often more readable, delivered without the abrasion, and are part of a larger, coherent fabric."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book to give to a young rebel in the making","review":"I think this is intended for people slightly younger than I am, but I still greatly appreciate Hitchens' passion and defense for being an independent thinker and for pointing out some of the pitfalls and pride that come with the territory. He had a fiercely humanistic outlook that often takes a backseat to his unreserved loathing and mockery of theism, but which is very well-represented here. This is a good book to give to a punky teenage rebel. With any luck, it will help them transition into becoming a thoughtful, sophisticated rebel down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin book but thick read for a novice","review":"Super thick read for a young Hitch fan-but worth the investment.

This new series does have much better production value and the character art is my favorite to this date.

I thought this zenith would be the same but it was far from being as good as its older models. Although low priced, this zenith LACKS A LOT. First, there is no display. Five separate squares light up for various functions such as play and record but they don't let you know whether your rewinding or fast forwarding so you don't know when you've finished winding the tape. Furthermore, the cassette tape is a hassle to load into this VCR. You can't just push the cassette into the VCR in any ole way. The loading bracket in the VCR is so loose that the cassette has to be pushed into the VCR at a perfect 90 degrees. Otherwise, the cassette gets stuck at you have to press the eject button and pry the cassette out with a screwdriver. Overall, this poorly designed VCR is hardly worth the price.

It is done in a very relaxed manner in a beautiful setting with calming background music. A yoga strap and brick definitely come in handy.To see how more difficult yoga poses and stretches can be modified for the beginner, get \\"Yoga for Weight Loss\\" also by Suzanne Deason.

You won't be out of breath, and it's easy in that way. However, I was looking for yoga that was easy in a flexibility way. I am so inflexible that some of the poses were still too hard for me in this DVD. I made do with blocks and straps, but I wouldn't call it \\"easy\\" for someone as inflexible as me. However, the thing I really didn't like about it is that she goes through the poses way too quickly. Yoga is supposed to be about being in the moment and really stretching out a muscle. She goes so quickly that by the time you've gotten into a pose, she's already telling you to get out of it. This does not make it harder, per say; it just doesn't feel very \\"yoga-like\\". How can I stretch a muscle when I'm only in the pose for less than 5 seconds?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappoinment","review":"When the title said it was \\"Easy\\", I was expecting at the least some instruction.

There is little to no instruction, it seems rushed, and does not show yoga as relaxing, as it should.

The album growns on you as you listen to it more and more. My personal favorite is 'Pretty prison'. 'No regrets' will appeal more to the fans of the traditional Y&T music.

Everything about this product is excellent, it fits in the ear and comes with an adapter that converts the 2.5 to a 3.5 input. The only problem is I got screwed by its sophisticated adapter. There is a screw pattern towards the bottom of the jack thats used to screw into the adapter. This is good in that the adapter will NEVER come off and its shut tight but when I try to plug it into my palmtreo (2.5mm) it doesn't go in all the way because of the screw pattern. In order to use it for my treo I have to use the adapter (3.5mm) and then use my own adapter to convert it back into 2.5mm. It works but I had to modify it and when I go running I have to make sure my phone is fully charged if not it will die fast because of the two adapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible","review":"Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.

They are in perfect condition, have such great sound that I have to put my phone's volume on 1 so that it doesn't end up too loud, the cord is the perfect length, unlike many others that I've tried, and they fit great!!!

I will let you read the pros about this product as it is mentioned in the item description, and will only mention the cons to save you time:* First thing I noticed is that the cord is relatively short...at least 8\\" shorter than a standard headset cord.* When I inserted the 2.5 mm jack, I heard one side speaker working.

At least in that book, Morris really made an effort at analysis of Reagan.Listening to the books on tape version of this book, at least, it seemed more like a mere listing of accomplishments and citing of diary entries. There was no follow-on analysis of TR's actions.Morris needs to find different work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightfully dull","review":"I was hugely disappointed in a book that made the presidency of, of all people, Teddy Roosevelt seem dull. Perhaps I've been spoiled by historical authors like Doris Kearns Goodwin, whose writing style captures the spirit of her subjects.

I have voraciously read most of David McCullough's books, along with a host of other authors' historical works, and I so wanted to like this book. It lived on my nightstand for months, and unfortunately its only virtue was that it routinely put me to sleep after a page or two every night. I had borrowed it from a colleague, and eventually returned it only partially read. Lest one think that my \\"boredom threshold\\" may be a a bit low, realize that I have stayed up nights reading many English gardening books that I find \\"thrilling\\" by comparison to this book! Clearly I'm not planning on seeking out any additional works by Morris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book has been a pleasure to read.

Roosevelt's relationship with the media set the standard for Presidential public relations. It's apparent that his influence on the Presidency still endures. It was fascinating to read about this time so long ago and see it reflected in today's news.Best of all, Theodore Rex read like a novel. The characters are so vividly portrayed that they seem to breathe. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the last edition of the trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book!","review":"I loved this book, a brilliant word-portrait of a fascinating man. It presents TR in enough depth to be thorough and intellectually-stimulating without getting so overly detailed that we amateur historians become swamped. The story moves quickly, almost like a novel. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of TR's numerous eccentricities, like taking target practice with his pistol while riding a horse at full speed through Rock Creek Park. I recommend it to everyone with an interest in American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of a true American","review":"A dense biography of one of our country's greatest presidents. This well researched and extremely detailed biography captures the major challenges that TR faced while president. It is impossible to read this book without comparing it to \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.\\" The material was not as exciting as the first book, where TR was an adventurer, rancher, mercenary, hunter, and politician. In \\"Theodore Rex\\" he was merely the President of United States. Some of the chapters seemed to be more informational filler vice historical analysis, but this was not a major distraction. The work is politically well balanced. Morris's use of language slows down the work when he uses obscure works and drawn out sentence structure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Edith? Where is Bamie?","review":"Mr. Morris totally dismisses two of TR's lifelong most trusted advisors, his wife Edith and his older sister Bamie. We get two pages on Edith and a few scattered mentions of Bamie and his younger sister Corinne. Despite the fact that Alice was rarely on good terms with her father before her White House marriage, we see more photos and read more of Alice (who TR referred to as his \\"liability daughter\\" and his other daughter Ethel as his \\"asset daughter\\") than we do his beloved partner and wife Edith. Perhaps Edith will receive better treatment in Morris's upcoming third and concluding tome on TR's life and careers.TR did not live through eight years in the White House in a vacuum from his wife, sisters, and \\"other\\" children. Yet, one would never know this from reading \\"Theodore Rex\\". If you want to learn more about how his family influenced him and was affected by his decisions and mood swings, read Kathleen Dalton's recently published \\"A Strenous Life\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on Roosevelt","review":"I had to get Theodore Rex after reading the first book in the series, The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. I enjoy how Edmund Morris adds descriptive details about the scene he is describing. Things like describing the how the atmosphere felt at the time. It really helps to bring this book to life for me. It almost reads like an exciting novel in a way. The author knows how to leave a chapter in a cliff hanger. I also like how the chapters themselves are divided up into smaller sections so I always know where I left off. I find this to be a little on the heavy reading side, so I like to read only a few pages at a time. The dividers help to remind me where I'm at.The chapters seem to be much shorter in this book than in the previous. It also seems to move though the years faster than the last book as well. The book is almost as long as the last and every bit as good. I recommend this book to all Teddy Roosevelt fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding presidential bio - a real treat","review":"I read Morris' \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" about 20 years ago, and was extremely impressed with his writing. Written almost as if it's a novel, it was a welcome departure from the usual plodding, fact-filled, head-nodding bios of the 1980s.After a disappointing Reagan bio (\\"Dutch\\") I'm happy to say that \\"Theodore Rex\\" is every bit as impressive as the first TR volume. The writing will leave you stunned at times - Morris is almost in a class by himself as a biographer. Perhaps only Robert Caro, William Manchester, and Robert Massie are his contemporary equals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bully!","review":"This fine book is an amazing history lesson revolving around an amazing leader. You'll enjoy an all-encompassing story of a colorful man's man who was impossibly brilliant, able to read and understand countless books on a vast array of subjects from poetry to world conquest, some not even written in English. He was a President as adept at working out a settlement between men or states or countries, as he was at starting a fight, when justice and fair play would allow no other way. He brought America into a new century and turned us into a world power. The average reader will be astounded at the number of this country's greatest assets and beloved attributes that were designed and brought about by \\"Theodore Rex\\". If Teddy were alive today, I'd vote for him for President in an instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"So full and yet lacking detail on his personal/family life","review":"The initial volume (The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt) struck a wonderful balance between his personal and professional life that I find lacking in this volume.Like all in the series, this is researched to a degree that leaves you incredibly impressed and for me at least, also at times overwhelmed with the level of hyper-detail.I was disappointed that the content is so very specific with every political maneuvering imaginable, yet only gives sporadic and obligatory mention to his family. If you're like me and want to learn more about both halves of his world, this book will leave you a bit frustrated. But if you like TR, it's still worth taking in."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MAN!!!","review":"I LIVE ON LONG ISLAND AND HAVE BEEN TO HIS HOUSE BUT WHAT YOU SEE AND HEAR IS GREAT BUT YOU ARE NOT REALY WITH THIS GREAT MAN HERE IN THEODORE REX YOU GET TO FEEL THE MAN AND SEE AND LIVE HIS LIFE AS IF YOU ARE THERE WITH HIM GREAT BOOK!!!

Granted, TR's presidential years were full of trust-busting and nature conservation -- not the stuff of thrilling biography -- but Morris is able to squeeze the life out of even the most interesting events. His self-important language, misused vocabulary, and pathetic metaphors will leave you howling in pain. If you like good biography, read McCullough. Run from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, heavy book","review":"...Suffice it to say that I consider this to be an endless, horrid book. I think Ed Morris is a poor writer who continues to inflict murky, long, tiresome tomes and inspire the same sort of writing in his fans. My main complaint is that he's doing this to T. Roosevelt, who is one of our more exciting and interesting Presidents.

Now in most books they discuss personalities, events, and impacts of decisions. This book read like a cheesy novel with unncessary flowery language. There are lines that were shown as dialogue, when the information was probably gleened from several correspondence. He writes about facial expressions during conversations. Morris even wrote about what they thought during events. Most writers would state, \\"He would recall later...\\"If I had wanted to read a novel, I would have. I was disappointed not with the subject, just the way it was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Facts only Prose","review":"Considering the length of this book, the reader should come away knowing a great deal about one of our greatest presidents. Unfortunately, Edmund Morris is writing in the same style as Michael and Jeff Shaara. The only difference is that the Shaaras lists their books as fiction. This book is filled with Morris' opinions and musings on what T.R. was thinking. This book was a waste of my time and should not be listed as a historical biography. If you want to read a book on T.R., then pick up Mornings on Horseback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appropriate for a fifth grader","review":"I could not get past the first chapter. This so-called historical work is full of unverifiable emotions Morris throws in as purely literary devices, and he is NOT a novelist. It reads like pulp fiction and is insulting to the intelligent amateur historian. McCullough's \\"Mornings On Horseback\\" is a far superior work yes sadly only covers T.R.'s early years.

Theodore Roosevelt is no exception. The best aspect of this book for me was Morris' ability to showcase this transition from man of action to statesman and leader.We will never again be as innocent or brash, as casually racist or inhumane, as we were when we had Teddy in the White House. But if you'd like to see that era come alive again, and see how we are now what Teddy forged for us then, read this book.All that said, I have much more admiration for his four-term cousin, and wonder why we haven't carved him on Mount Rushmore yet. In his new memorial in Washington, he looks so alone there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs More Editing","review":"After the wonderful first biography, this book was a letdown.

Very well written and interesting as all get out. However, Theodore Rex does NOT cover the time period after Roosevelt's second term. Morris is writing another volume that will cover those years. If the previous reviewer had actually read the book he would know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit as a Bull Moose","review":"This is one of the best books ever done on a US president. Morris, after a less than satisfactory turn as Ronald Reagan's biographer, is in fine form and I cannot wait for the next volume in this series.Morris brings a real understanding of his subject in this book, the second in a series, projected to include three volumes. Prior to Morris, there were any number of fine books that dealt with TR's era, but each had its failings. I am happy to state that at last Teddy Roosevelt has found a biography that is worthy of his greatness.The strengths of the book are easy to list. First of all Morris knows his subject. He also understands the era and is very good about providing context. This last quality is something that is necessary in all great biographies, but is lacking in most of them. I cannot wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"For anyone interested in either American history, or TR in particular, this is, indeed, a \\"must read.\\"The author gives so much detail, it is slow reading at times,but, no doubt, everything is there.Especially interesting are the personal details sometimes missing from \\"histories,\\" and TR had the most interesting details of any President. Many of his friends and enemies wrotecopious letters and kept journals, so the author had a greatamount of source material, and he has used it properly.Very highly recommended for the serious student.

He was a true statesman on local, state, national, and global levels; a devoted family man; a hunter and gamesman; a soldier. And he managed to be all of these things nearly simultaneously, all the while chomping on cigars, laughing uproariously, and having the most magnificent time. InTheodore Rex, Morris tells Teddy's story in the perfect tone of voice, and I guarantee you will be engaged - and surprised - at what unfolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Read","review":"It was definitely worth a read, but I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as the author's predecessor, which was a really outstanding biography. This one seemed to be a bit less inspired. The first one managed to flow much like a great novel, while this one was more dry. To be fair, perhaps the subject matter was simply less interesting, and Theodore's time as president was less exciting than all his adventures leading up to it. That isn't to say that Roosevelt's presidency was without accomplishments-it had many, from the Panama canal to his accomplishments which garnered him a Peace Prize to his bringing progressive ideology more towards the forefront of the political landscape. I look forward to reading the final book of the trilogy soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Roosevelt to Predict the Japanese Attack of Pearl Harbor","review":"Well balanced, excellent book about both the President and his times. The book flows well. TR was a warrior, which some, including myself, may view as a negative. But he was an incredibly intelligent man. He made things happen--for the most part better. After TR negotiated a peace settlement between Japan and Russia he predicted the Japanese would attack either the Phillipines or Pearl Harbor. TR was forty years ahead of his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as \\"The Rise\\"","review":"I started this book right after reading \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" by Morris. While I was riveted to the first book, this one took a little while longer to read.

In addition to really painting a colorful picture of Roosevelt, Morris does a great job of capturing the times in which Roosevelt lived, making the book a great primer on America and the world at the turn of the last century.Roosevelt did a nice job of separating what the public wanted from what would do it the most good. He was a long-term thinker and a person who could weigh both sides of an issue and find the solution that took both sides into account (often with the end result of making everyone mad at him rather than just one side.) Rooseevelt negotiated treaties and intitiated projects (like the Panama Canal) that changed the direction of world history.Fantastic book for fans of history and biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teddy's Presidency","review":"This is not a full biography, but rather focusses on Roosevelt's politics from the death of McKinley to his last days in office. It features the major issues of the era, and how Roosevelt worked to fix them. These include the anthracite coal strike, the Russo-Japanese war, the Panama canal, interstate trusts, and ecology conservation. Through these events and others, Morris shows how the President was a master of mediation and diplomacy. This book is perfect for learning about the issues of the early twentieth century, but If you're looking for a book on Roosevelt's personal life, you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid account of a most interesting President","review":"While not quite as outstanding as his first book of Roosevelt's pre-presidential years, \\"The Rise of Theordore Roosevelt\\", Edmund Morris's \\"Theodore Rex\\" is still a vivid account of Roosevelt's Presidency (1901-1909).\\"Theodore Rex\\" is an account of Roosevelt's memorable and nation changing years as President.

It was, for the most part, entertaining. The only objectively negative comment I can make is the repeated misunderstanding of the fine points of priestly formation and of ecclesiological terms. One example is the use of the term \\"vows\\" in reference to diocesan seminarians. Diocesan priests do not, in the formal sense, take vows. There were several such comments throughout the book.

A few songs later, he mixes things up again by tossing in banjo, electric slide, and a hint of twang, and still later, very simple strings accent his beautiful melodies.All these elements combined with a few instrumental vignettes make for an album that avoids the trap of monotony into which many other quiet, mellow bands fall. Song after song, O'Connell finds the correct piece of flair -- whether it be a sample, an instrument, or a vocal inflection -- to turn his singer-songwriter style into a record as interesting as it is unpredictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not buy this book.","review":"If you want to read this book or any other from this author just buy Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern AC and Refrigeration systems all ESCO press did was reprint the same info word for word from the above mentioned book and put into three other books by the same author.

It has knitting lessons, projects, and her autobiography (digressions, she calls them) which makes for a fascinating read. I love that she asks knitters to THINK, not just follow a pattern row-by-row. I am presently knitting the pi-r-square shawl - it's great that I can take it to work on anywhere, and don't have to bring the directions. She says \\"you can do this...or try this...\\" and lets me make the project my own while giving me the confidence to do it!I highly recommend this book, and would dearly love to see the original videos that were made for PBS to go with it.

Atlas takes pot shots at Bellow througout the book and actually attempts to psychoanalyze him several times! Instead of focusing on the brilliant works Bellow has produced, Atlas whacks Bellow over the head time and again for being a womanizer.Fortunately, a couple of knowledgeable and appreciative authors have come forward and set the record straight concerning Bellow's unmatched contribution to American letters. Most recently, Charles Simic wrote a fabulous appreciation of Bellow in the New York Review of Books (May 31, 2001, \\"The Thinking Man's Comedy\\"). A recent Harper's magazine piece (February or March 2001 issue, I believe) also takes Atlas to task for producing such a pile of dung.I refer Bellow fans and other interested readers to the above-mentioned articles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant Biographer","review":"I liked other works by James Atlas and so ran out and bought this book as soon as it came out. I was so disappointed, since Atlas writes with a subtext of superiority--amend that: sometimes his competitive streak IS the text. Nothing I say can hold a candle to Lee Seigel's great review in The New Republic where he shows, and I agree, that Atlas--straight-laced member of the Ambitious Generation is doing a hatchet job on the masters of yore, in this case Bellow. Do not buy this book if you are a Bellow Lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biographer as Parasite","review":"This is not a biography, it is a way for the author to advance his own career, using Saul Bellow, a really distiinguished novelist, as a stepping stone. Why would you pick a subject to write about if you disapprove of him? Yet every page of this book reeks with the author's smug sanctimonious alleged superiority (morally?) Very bogus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A 600 page inferiority complex","review":"Why on earth was this book published in the first place? It is clear from the off that James Atlas has a grudge against Saul Bellow - based on no other reason that he is bitterly jealous of his literary success - and he launches into a badly written and ill informed diatribe attempting to explain Saul Bellow's progression through life and understand his motives as those of a deeply insecure emotional coward. And the adjectives are a disgrace. Take this for an example, when Bellow is asked what his son will do on a sabbatical in Paris: ''F*ck' his brains out' said Bellow, dismissively', Atlas records. Dismissively! No way. Lovingly, perhaps, or enviously. But never dismissively.James Atlas you should be ashamed of yourself. You know nothing of what made Bellow tick, this book is a cynical and parasitical attempt to cash in on his legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Biography of less than admirable subject","review":"If you wonder how an individual endowed with every blessing humanly imaginable could still be disgruntled, read this biography. It's a study of near-pathological narcissism and the affliction seems to have worsened rather than regressed as time went on. Believe it or not, I love Bellow's work and will continue reading him. But how else can you describe a man who has been gifted with fame, talent, looks(not my cup of tea, but Atlas insists women found him devastating), wealth, family (4 of them, in fact) and apparently miraculous health (he fathered a child at 85), yet he comes across as an infantile malcontent. I have to admit the most fascinating aspect of this book for me was the dichotomy between Bellow's abundance of earthly blessings and his nasty, petty nature. On the other hand, there are people living under the cruelest circumstances who are nonetheless angelic.

My point is simple, Jim Hall was use to say: Make Musical Sense and Consequence of chaos has neither musical sense orn a single interesting or new musical idea.That's very sad and I really hope that next album will take mr.

If you want to describe it with a few words, there is no music in it - yes there are few (well, lots) fast passages on the guitar, lots of which you normally find in studies written for students to practice your fingerings, but all in all it sound to me like very, very unnaturally assembled bits and pieces that form an amalgam of no music. It is like if you get 10 - 20 studies for a guitar, cut random pieces of them and then randomly assemble them - the chance you get similar music are very high.I have listened to much, much better pieces of music from Al DiMeola from his earlier recordings.

Also there are bass and treble controls on the sub. These are dials and easier to use, but if your sub is under your desk it could be difficult to operate.

It's also reasonably accurate as concerns places and names, and its descriptions of the scenery at high altitudes is evocative. Always remember, though, the main story is pure fiction. Like the yeti itself. Read the book for pleasure, but don't expect to become informed about Nepal in any detailed sense. The author evidently has only visited the area, he hasn't lived there long enough to get to know it in depth. He doesn't know enough about caste and tribal distinctions and he has a rather naive slant on internal politics. But I don't want to be too harsh, for at least in an allegorical sense he provides some useful insights about clashes between the modernization the Nepalese want and the traditional values they don't want to lose, and about some of the environmental problems and paradoxes that bedevil the whole modernization process. (Note: I was US Ambassador to Nepal, 1981-84)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offbeat and Charming","review":"I've read most of Robinson's science fiction novels, and have enjoyed most of them. However, this book is a whole different kettle of fish!A series of stories about the misadventures of two jaded American climbers in the Himalayas, this book is wacky and laugh-out-loud funny. Interweaving such elements as Buddhism, yetis (abominable snowmen), exploitation of third-world countries by the West, and very believable descriptions of climbing expeditions in the Himalayas and the crazy people who undertake them, this book has a warm and gentle heart. I enjoyed it so much the first time I read it that I re-read it every couple of years to enjoy it again.The yeti in a Dodger's baseball cap encountering a surprised ex-president Jimmy Carter in a Kathmandu hotel stairway still makes me laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adventurous unique buddy book","review":"Very imaginative, very creative.

But handicapped by Meltzer's sophomoric, borderline 7th grade prose, his latest rambling, semi-coherent, ambiguously convoluted \\"novel\\" fails to engage.In giving credit where it is due, the singular accomplishment that I would begrudgingly confer upon Meltzer is his somewhat realistic dialog. Whereas some novelists construct stilted, obviously manufactured conversations, Meltzer's banter rings strangely true.However, even this comes at a price. The reader is bombarded with a barrage of sniveling, whining, pseudo-sarcastic repartee that constitutes over 50% of the book. So even though there is a tinge of verisimilitude to the dialog, it gets old rather quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book of Fate","review":"This was the first time that I read this author. I was intrigued with the Masonic reference and was extremely disappointed in the scarity of masonic references. I also felt the book started slowly and gradually gained speed, but by that time, I just wanted to finish. In fact, I almost put it down mid-way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing","review":"This book plays out a little more like a movie of the week. It took me a long time to finish, as it really never made me want to continue reading it. I strived on, though, and finished it after a few weeks. I was expecting a little more in regards to the Mason thing. The book certainly gives that impression, but it really doesn't follow through. I didn't feel much for the main character, and the supporting characters were rather........annoying. I don't like to write long, overblown reviews where people like to set-up the plot. Read the inside cover and decide for yourself, but I would only recommend it if you have nothing else to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic and Juvenile","review":"I decided to read this book based on the fact that I mildly enjoy Brad Meltzer's TV show. Like my title for this review says, the book is idiotic and juvenile. It is literally like a college kid writing a terrible political conspiracy book aimed at 8th graders. The plot sucked. The characters are crap. We have to suffer through every character having some dumb named like \\"Rogo\\" or \\"Dreidel\\". This book was the lamest thing I've read in YEARS. As far as I can tell, Meltzer has zero talent as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"Great book, excellent service, thanks for a wonderful transaction. Book is in first rate condition, the Wife loves it. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Reading this book was like listening to nails dragged across a chalkboard. It was so bad I cringed. Meltzer has created the wimpiest protagonist imaginable. You just want to punch this character in the face and scream, \\"Man up!\\" The plot itself is hardly \\"thrilling,\\" but its banality is far surpassed by the grating dialogue -- complete with pointless character bickering, constant interruptions, and repeated statements of the obvious -- and enough adverbs and adjectives to make Mark Twain roll over in his grave. I can't believe how bad this book was. One star is being kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book of Fate","review":"Mr. Meltzer did not put his best foot forward with this book. Some things were stretched way beyond anything believable when it came to time and ability to accomplish tasks. In the beginning, I felt sorry for Wes but as time played out I was sick of his incessant whining about his disfiguring injury. The continued focus on his injury was almost an insult to Mr. Meltzer's readers, as though they would forget how this injury had \\"handicapped\\" or diminished Wes. I also found myself wishing that Mr. Meltzer had fleshed out some of the other characters a bit more so the reader could understand what was driving them to engage in certain behaviors. On its own, The Book of Fate was somewhat disappointing; however, as the precursor to The Inner Circle, it was helpful in establishing some background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong order","review":"All of my orders are for Kindle.

I was charged for it but never received the full book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code with the Flu","review":"Having read Identity Crisis and appreciating the close attention to detail that Brad Meltzer spent on that book, I was very disappointed by The Book of Fate.The style and plot line reminded me too much of The Da Vinci Code, except the story was weaker and the characters were not developed at all. Even the title itself seems inappropriately named, as the plot focused more on the boring cat and mouse chase between the Three and the book's protagonist.Overall, I expect great things for Meltzer and look forward to his future works, but this book was not worth the time or money I spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"I hated how the author would start a sentence and then all of the sudden -From the descriptions this sounded like a very good book, but after 100 pages I can't take Wes anymore.Well, on to the next -"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this book","review":"But I failed. In fact I disliked it intensely. Mr. Meltzer is known for his books on political intrigue. Wh//ile I have some issues with his extravagant use of adjectives and adverbs, I often enjoyed his books.However this one was beyond imagination. Even if there had been a plot- you would have forgotten what was going on by the time you finished reading all the descriptions of the most minute details. I rarely say this , authors are entitled to off books, but this was so bad, I will simply not ever buy another Meltzer book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and lacks credibility","review":"This is based on the Unabridged audio book.This book has little to do with the free masons. That is just one of many disappointments.My second problem was the way the author dragged the story out. This would have made an OK story at two thirds the length. Much of the filler was spent over dramatizing the anguish of the main character. If I was actually reading the book I would have skimmed over those parts. That is hard with CDs. The reader added to the problem by over acting these parts.The ending was preposterous. I suspect the author thought he was being creative by coming out of left field with the unveiling of the secret. The main reason I did not think of this option is because it made no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"The publisher's description of the book leads you to believe that this is another book about the Freemasons. While exciting in premise, it fell far short of delivering on it's promises. The plot gets jumbled at times, and the book was longer than it should have been.The one thing of note however was the character development. You see several, flawed characters go through things that change them along the way. Something that is always great to see that is done in so few novels of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"I hardly have enough time to write a review let alone read a 500-page book. However, I needed an escape so I picked this one up on someone saying it has sold a lot of copies and was in the DaVinci Code family. Last time I ever listen to him. (I should have read the online reviews first.) This is nothing but a sophomoric dime novel wrapped in a title to allure in readers. The book is filled with fluff that is neither well written nor compelling. I was really hoping for some kind of twist at the end. It is repetitive and stale. Perhaps this is my angst being vocalized but I just wasted an enormous amount of time. Even if I put in the spoiler for the story and you still read it, you would look back and say it did not matter. But you should know...it has next to nothing to do with the Free Masons or The Book of Fate. First time and last time I ever read this author. To the author: Be Honest! This is the perfect example that \\"You can not read a book by its cover.\\" Arghhhhh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Previous Meltzer books were good reads.

I was so happy to get to the end of this very confusingbook. There are no heros, no one that you can relate to. The main character is a shaking, sweating mess of a man that you can not idenify with at all. There are so many sub plots that you need to keep notes. I hope he goes back to the style I am usedto."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book of Fatal Flaws","review":"Perhaps fate has a sense of irony, for there was nothing \\"fateful\\" about The Book of Fate other than, perhaps, being left feeling apalled by the deceit and misdirection of the title and synopsis. If you think this book has anything to do about Fate, the Masons, or even D.C. politics, you're wrong. Instead, what one gets is a hap-hazard, 24-esque, boilerplate whodunnit. And the author's note at the end is laughable, with its brief discussion of the Masons (more than what you'll get in the book). What the heck does Sandusky, Ohio have to do with ANYTHING in the book? Maybe Meltzer was trying to make an absurdist connection to roller-coasters... the kind that make you sick, though, not the kind that are thrilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bait and switch job.","review":"IF there was any significant mention/reference to Thomas Jefferson and or the FreeMason conspiracy, maybe I missed it as I nodded off during this too long, weak plot waste of good forest product. Skip this at all costs and pray they don't make it into a TV movie. The book description leads one to believe there might be a story here, there isn't. A Total waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-pity","review":"I should have written this review right after I finished listening to the book on audio. I waited in vain for the promised mysteries of Free Masonry which the author hints at in his preface. Alas, it was all in the preface... As it turns out, The Book of Fate is a rather bland, uninspired story with a bunch of unlikable characters, which didn't help. The main protagonist, in particular, had the unfortunate and major flaw of wallowing in buckets of self-pity from beginning to end... Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Political Thriller","review":"Meltzer takes the symbols and codes of the past and their meaning to show us how they can be twisted to justify a religious fanatic's murderous deeds. Manipulated by men in positions of government power, the assassin kills and manes the people he is told are evil and doing the work of the devil. Greed being the basis for this manipulation, the plot continues even after the assassin is caught.Meltzer gives us an insightful story that seamlessly interjects historical facts with possible ill-gotten government deeds of the present. A very well written political thriller"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Decently written, but this book had so many holes I can't even cover them all. If you're looking for a Dan Brown-ish puzzle (which is what the cover makes it sound like), you'll be very disappointed. The actual \\"book\\" is only referenced by the crazy guy and never even explained. That being said, the plot is paced well and keeps you reading. There are just so many good books out there, than an average one like this should be skipped altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"The title of the book can give you the impression that the story is complex and thought provoking. However, to me it was very simple reading. It did not get that deep. But, it has everything else; mystery/thriller, lots of twists and turns and good dialogue between characters. I loved the story and wish Wes and his friend's good luck on whatever path they choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOOK OF FATE","review":"A very good read!! lots of interesting things in it.

I figured if he had the cooperation of 2 ex-presidents, that it would be a thoughtful, quality thriller. Big let down. Don't waste your time! For fans of age old conspiracies, the Mason angle appears to be window dressing only. For those interested in behind the scenes life of ex-presidents, it is of some interest, but you have to wade through a lot to get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Reader for a Decent Book","review":"Scott Brick gives us a superior reading of a decent but not superior book in the conspiracy genre. All in all, it does qualify as a thriller though one which undermines its impact by having too many plot lines which are not developed in such a manner as to earn applause when their linkage to the central dilemma is revealed.Too many timesa plot line is developed only to end up nowhere in terms of the center of action. More rigorous use of the editorial blue pencil would have helped.Despite the author's failures, the book was entertaining and, overall,successful at creating a number of interesting characters and subplots. The reader's acting adds sufficient value to the book io make it easy to recommend as a good\\" listen\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book of Fate","review":"Read the other negative reviews - I would only be repeating what has already been stated. The only other thing I can add is, despite the fact Meltzer claims to research his stuff thoroughly, there are numerous errors in his book such as one of the characters cocking his firearm before holstering it and having his primary character peering between the \\"spine\\" of a door and the \\"threshold\\". Somebody needs to tell him that nobody with any knowledge of firearms will put a cocked weapon in a holster and, he needs to know what a \\"threshold\\" is. I also could not figure out why his characters kept using their \\"pointer\\" fingers rather than their \\"index\\" fingers. A graduate of U of M and Columbia Law? If that's the case, I think Mr. Meltzer is a classic example of the person with substantial book knowledge but little practical knowledge. The book was purchased because of the allusion to some Masonic connection. It was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"Unfortunately I felt this book to be tedious and rather pretentious. I wanted to like it and kept hoping it would pick up momentum,but it really never did. It needed tightening up and the title truly is misleading. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful read","review":"First off, I'm a big Meltzer fan, but as many before me have stated;this is clearly his worst novel. I'm frankly shocked at how bad it is. It was as painful a read as I've ever experienced. I found myself having to skip over multiple pages just to find something of substance to keep my interest. Full of filler, annoying characters, and a long tedious storyline, the Book of Fate is a clear F grade when compared to other Meltzer works. If this is the standard that readers of future Meltzer novels can expect, then I consider myself a former reader rather than a current one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It took me 3 weeks of 'pick it up for an hour, put it down for three days' to plow through this book. The only reason I finished it is that I have a compulsion for finishing anything (books, movies, tasks) that I start. This one was absolutely painful at times. The plot bounced around with no cohesion, the storyline was full of holes and was, frankly, beyond unbelievable, the characters were either weak, pathetic, unlikable or all three, and the interweaving of the Mason angle was absolutely idiotic. There is no way I would recommend that anyone waste irretrievable hours of their life reading this book. Sorry Brad, I liked your other books. Hope you can return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with many other reviewers!","review":"I'm sorry to say that I agree with many other reviewers so far. I have really enjoyed Meltzer's other books, but this one was just too much. I would have let him get away with some of the typical complaints (whiny main character, etc) but it was just so long (qty of pages). I pick up a book like this for entertainment value (I know it's not going to win any awards) but I really just stopped being entertained and wanted to know \\"what's the point\\" after a while. And that conversation in the final chapter/epilogue with the \\"whose getting nooky\\" convo between Wes and Rogo was just bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unabashed Meltzer fan, thoroughly disappointed.","review":"In this book I felt as though Meltzer relied too heavily on the mystique surrounding characters that hold positions of high esteem within the book world. In his previous novels like 'The First Counsel' and 'The Tenth Justice' he used characters who occupied very prestigious positions in Washington to spin exceptionally entertaining tales. This time around the main character is a hollow shell of his predecessors and the fact that he is connected to an ex-President of the United States does nothing at all to make him appealing. Possibly noone was there to tell Meltzer 'No!' this time around and the result was a book I put down for good after a very tedious 150 pages. Pick it up Brad, I actually bought this book so next time around you owe me buddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars Only Because I'm A Brad Meltzer Fan","review":"I've enjoyed Brad Meltzer's other books so much that I TRIED to like THE BOOK OF FATE but just couldn't. I was so excited because it was long and I felt I'd be engrossed in this hard-to-put down thriller. On the contrary, I finally just gave up trying to follow the plot and returned the book to the library. I would have been mad if I had bought this book. However, I still look forward to Brad's next offering because he is an outstanding writer capable of producing another real page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to enjoy this book","review":"But I didn't.In fact I disliked it intensely.The premise sounded interesting and Mr. Meltzer is known for his stories of political intrique. But the plot was lost in a maze of \\"facts\\" about the Masons (which had nothing to do with the story), adjectives too numerous to stomach(5 adjectives for every noun- when 3 would have been too many), adverbs and metaphors not only too numerous, but thrown in for the most inconsequential portions of the narrative.I won't be reading Mr. Meltzer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off of symbol","review":"I purchased Brad Meltzer's \\"The Book of Fate\\" because I was looking for something to read and the cover had the image of a square and compass. As a Freemason, I am familiar with the square and compasses and was interested in seeing his fictional interpretation of Masonic working and fate. What a rip off. Meltzer is attempting to follow the success of Dan Brown. Yes, I know that this book was published well before \\"The Lost Symbol\\" but after at least after one of Brown's other books.My point is that the Masonic Fraternity is mentioned only a few times and one instance is a list of men who served our country and were Masons. There is also a character who has a Masonic tattoo. Congratulations Meltzer for getting me to spend my hard earned case on a book that is written on a low reading level and to misrepresent a symbol of my Fraternity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its difinitly Fate with me its awsome","review":"Brad Meltzer in away like himingway in his writing that u feel the reality of the breath the walk his ability of writing is totally briliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The characters are poorly developed, the plot is ridiculous and poorly explained, the writing style is choppy, sloppy, and boring, and the reader is teased with a mildly interesting Freemason angle only to find out that it's barely even a footnote on the plot as a whole. I was expecting a light, entertaining thriller and was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational: A Must to Read","review":"Captivating characters. Well put together prose and the plot intrigues as the story unfolds and does not fail with providing entertaining details keeping the reader wanting to turn the pages. I disagree with the Miami Herald's comment \\"Meet the next John Grisham.\\" Meltzer's writing far exceeds Grisham's; that being, \\"The Book of Fate\\" holds together like peanut butter to bread and mesmerizes the reader as watching fireworks hit the sky one at time does. This is not a book that was written in haste. I would guess that Meltzer cares not about deadlines when it comes to his writing. You will not want to stop until you reach the last page and even then you'll want to go on to San Francisco with Will, Lisbeth and Rogo: all characters that the author makes sure you get to know along the way. Development gets an A+ in \\"The Book of Fate\\" The character Rogo gets the prize for humor, Will the prize for integrity and Lisbeth the prize for learning honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only paid a buck for this at a garage sale.","review":"Ordinarily, I enjoy suspending disbelief for the sake of diversion when I read these thrillers, but for the most part it wasn't worth it. There was a lot of inane details that ultimately didn't mean much and, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the use of cryptologic references that alluded to Jefferson and the Masons was really just a cheap trick that led nowhere. This was my first Meltzer, and I sure hope that his other stuff is better. Of course, my appreciation of it may have been negatively influenced because it was sandwiched by 1776 and the World is Flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible","review":"I tried and tried to like this book, but just couldn't. This is one book where a review of zero stars is appropriate. The writing style is horrible. There are no real conversations, just numerous backgrounds thoughts that constantly intrude during a conversation between characters in the book. The characters in this book are similar to those in a terrible horror movie. When something horrible is about to happen the character continues to stare back at the oncoming horror instead of running. Finally, the book takes forever to get anywhere. There are no interesting points where you can't wait to see what happens next. Instead, you'll keep thinking \\"When the hell is something interesting going to happen\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of Fate, Brad Meltzer","review":"This author has never disappointed me. Books always a page turner. A favorite author and hope to read all his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement","review":"This book has nothing to do with the Masons or the book of Fate. It is a gory thriller with rather predictable outcomes and an anticlimactic plot. Much of the disappointment that the book creates is due to the title and description. For those who are interested in a well-crafted conspiracy drama that cleverly weaves historical fact with fiction, don't waste your time on this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like The Book of Cheap Marketing Ploy","review":"I admit that the cover and back flap are what drew my attention to this book. The sad thing is thats what the publishers were counting on. One would assume that since the cover contains a square and compass, that the Freemasons would be invovled. One would also assume after reading the back cover of the book, that there is a 200 year old secret involving Thomas Jefferson. Well ladies and gentlemen, you would be wrong. The Freemasons are \\"mentioned\\" in this book a grand total of 3 brief times. The 200 year old \\"secret\\" is glanced over so briefly near the end, that I actually had to go back and reread a chapter to realize it. Basically what you have here is a cheap and shameless attempt to cash in on the \\"DaVinci Code and National Treasure\\" craze. What you actually get is a less than average political thriller... Shame on you Meltzer."},{"rating":"1","title":"did they glue the wrong cover on the book?","review":"This book truly inspires anyone to become a writer. It shows anyone can do it. The premise of the book is based on \\"DaVinci Code\\" style intrigue, evidenced on the cover, which never seems to occur. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional. You never care what happens to the self absorbed characters. You are asked to believe that political operatives at the top of the game fall for reporter tricks, etc. Total nonsense. I would encourage readers (and Mr. Meltzer) to go read Michael Connelly, Daniel Silva or even Stuart Woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough research","review":"It's funny - he talks about his 3 years of research in the Masons....yet the recurring scream Wes hears (way too many times in this book) is in \\"C Minor.\\" Here's the problem, any minor musical research would have told him C minor is a chord or a key signature, and requires at least 3 notes...every time I read about the C minor scream, I kept thinking \\"moron.\\" You can't scream 3 notes, or a full scale, which are the only things designated as C minor.Wes was an annoying protagonist....well into his 30s and unable to stand up for himself...even at the end.Book was OK, but certainly not brilliant....and way too long....random dead people everywhere, and no discussion of what happened when the random bodies were found....If he spent 3 years researching what was an unbelievably minor (no pun intended) part of the story, he could have gone for realism a bit more in the other 450 pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is a very obvious and miserable attempt to capitalize on the recent popularity of conspiracy thrillers. The genre is entertaining - but this contribution is awful.The cover suggests a strong link to Freemasonry - the link is superficial and cursory at best.The title suggests the story is built around a significant artifact \\"the book of fate\\" - the artifact is an after thought and plays no useful role in the story.The characters are one-dimensional and not engaging. Indeed, each time the main character appears you'll find yourself wanting to quickly read past him as he becomes ever more annoying.The \\"twist\\" at the end is transparent and disappointing.As you read you will desperately hope for some redemption at the end of the book. Instead you'll hear only the sound of a thud as the book hits the floor and you realize you've wasted time that could have been devoted to better books.You will want your money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I was really looking forward to reading The Book of Fate because I had heard so many good things about the author. After the first 50 pages or so, I knew I was in trouble. What a complicated and mostly boring book. It took me many days to finally finish it. Everytime I'd start it, I'd fall asleep. What a struggle. Don't waste your time or money.After lots of research on some of his other books, I'm going to give Brad Meltzer another chance. He has to be better than what he showed in The Book of Fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"You keep expecting it to go somewhere. If this was his first book he would never have another one published. I read around 100 books per year and this is the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite Yawner","review":"I suffered through all 15 CDs of this book waiting for something to happen. The Masonic reference is obviously just a sales technique as it disappears midway through the book. Could be the most tedious and boring book I've read/listened to in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"By way of John Grisham???","review":"I really like Brad Meltzer but I fear he's on Grisham's road - he's finding it harder and harder to find a good story to tell.I'm not quite finished with this one yet and I will finish it - it's not so bad that I don't want to find out the ending but I have to say - the characters suck. Every one of them. Wes is a buffoon. He shakes, twitters, stutters, trips and hits everything in whatever room he's in - I'll be very disappointed if he doesn't turn into a man at some point. And for Pete's sake - hasn't anyone ever heard of plastic surgery? I would think the President would have paid for it seeing as how he's the President and probably has good medical insurance. If Wes is truly the Elephant Man after the shooting - do something about it!Sorry to be picky - but I can't stand it when not one character in a book is worth rooting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Book","review":"Nice price for unabridged edition of this book. First read of this author, and I recommend his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The quintessential 'Monkeys with typewriters' pop novel","review":"Like so many \\"thrillers\\" these days, it appears to have been written by a committee on a tight deadline.Plot holes abound, minor characters enter and exit with no real purpose, some sequences end too quickly while others go on interminably. And the topper -- \\"let's put in some references to Masonic codes and secrets to capture the Dan Brown fans\\" -- that's such a blatant marketing ploy it makes your head spin.By about the 10th time Wes started to cry, I wanted to off him.That's it for this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrring","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this book. It sounded like a good read. I forced myself to read 100 pages hoping it was just a slow take off. Not so. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad I listened to the abridged version","review":"I'm glade I bought the abridged version of this book after reading the two reviews on this site. I enjoyed this book, thought it was very interesting. I liked the twists and plots but then I like stories that keep me guessing till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!!!!","review":"I have to admit I didn't finish the book. That is because it never started... I read the cover blurb and then proceeded to attempt to go through the first fifty pages. Life is too short for reading nonsense. I am surprized because Meltzer's other books were good. This one was completely without merit and none of the basic tenets of good writing were followed.None of the characters related to people I could identify with.It really doesn't deserve a review. It deserves a recall. The publishers condone this kind of junk while really good authors can't get any notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing can't save this story","review":"First, I'll freely admit, I only made it through 1/3 of the book, so my review must be judged with that in mind.This was my first story by this author, and I hate to say it, but his writing style did not fit well with me. For starters, his decision to write in the first-person drove me absoltely nuts. Many sentences included I over and over, at first I noticed it, then it got tedious, then it started to drive me nuts. I know there are somewhat conflicting opinions on first-person writing, but from what I understand it takes a real talent to make it work, I don't think Brad has that ability.Second, and this is harder to nail down, but the more I read it, the more I felt like the writing was forced, or just didn't read well. It was like an out-of-tune guitar, the tune was correct, but it sounded god-awful.Its sad to say, but I think the only reason this book made it to the top of the list was because it is knock-off of the Da Vinci Code, or at least Da Vinci-esque."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no DaVinchi Code. Borrow, don't buy.","review":"After listening to the NPR review I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of Meltzer's new book. The NPR review stated that Meltzer does meticulous research for his books and that his books are lies that try to sound like the truth. The book is sold on the premise that there is a mystery involving the presidency of the United States and that the Free Masons are somehow involved with the fate of everyone. Meltzer fails to make a convincing argument.The book seemed under researched and poorly attempts to tie loose ends of secret societies together. It makes very little mention of the masons with any substance or character. The idea of fatalism is a great idea for a book, but after reading Meltzer's version the great idea remains. If you enjoyed the DaVinchi Code by Dan Brown, you will be let down. If you want a relatively quick read that is implausible, superficial, dime store-book entertainment, this book will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so glad I got this book at the library! SKIP IT","review":"This book had a good premise that soon went bad .it is bloated and gets to over 500 pages with boring filler.I found Wes to be whiny and frankly his character drove me nuts. His self pity and lack of action got very tedious.It can get back to the library fast enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, Strange & Boring","review":"My Headline says it all. This book starts out with so many unknown characters that it is confusing. Then it gets strange. Then it gets boring. I tried to finish it, but finally gave up to read something worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Glad I didn't buy it!","review":"Meltzer's earlier books weren't bad at all. But this one!!! The protagonist is a loser; talks and works like one. Sets a poor tone for the rest of the drivel. The plot wanders according to fate, no contact with the author.If Warner Books stays with him, I hope his next offering is much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap!","review":"This book is poorly written, predictable, formulaic, juvenile, and a complete waste of time. I am just as angry with myself for investing the time into reading this book, as I am at the author and publisher for putting such a piece of crap out there for mass consumption. Save yourself some time and go read a third grader's essay at you local elementary school--it will be a better use of your time than reading this book!!This book makes me wish Amazon would allow a rating of zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've enjoyed all of Meltzer's other books. I could only force myself to read 3/4 of this one. There are too many other GOOD books out there to waste my time on this muddled, boring, tedious book. I hated all the characters, the plot was confusing and far-fetched. I didn't like the fact that he tells whats going to happen before it happens, and then tells about it again when it happens. Hopefully, Mr. Meltzer will read these Amazon reviews and realize his fans would like him to stick to the formulas that have worked for him before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book was flat, flat, flat. I read a review somewhere that said it was the best thing since sliced bread. Don't remember where I read that, but I wish I remembered so that I could sue them for the hours of my life that I lost to this terribly dull and uninteresting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, difficult to follow plot","review":"This is one of the few books that I have read to the end and am still not sure what actually happened. The author introduces and develops a plot line about freemasons and their political impact, only to have the plot line completely disappear. The book discusses a group of conspirators called The Three and later The Four and I am still not sure what they they were conspiring to do and why it required someone to fake their own death (in the middle of an assassination attempt on the president, no less!). I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that this is an unfinished book that was somehow published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great chase","review":"A tremendous look into the world of an ex-president. It has a very involving and readable plot. I never did understand the how the \\"Book of Fate\\" or the Mason's were involved, seemed like a calculated superficial plot element intended to cash in on the \\"Davinci Code\\" craze. But it was a very engrossing and plausible ameture vs spy plot. Very well written. I am still happy to have read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it Fated to be so bad?","review":"I've only read one other book of Meltzer's and that was The Zero Game. That book was a random pick-up at the bookstore and a surprise in disguise. I told my husband how much I loved it and how soon I was going to get another of Meltzer's book.So I got The Book of Fate.Good Lord. It started off well enough. But it got bad so fast, I kept checking the cover to make sure I was actually reading a Meltzer. Why were there so many holes? Why could I not care for Wes, the President, or anyone else? What was the link to Thomas Jefferson? What was the point of the crossword puzzle?Maybe he had a good idea when he started out. But somewhere it got bogged down in silly details and the details or explanations that should've come forth, never materialized.I was very disappointed. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise from first book","review":"This was the first book I got my hands on from Brad Meltzer. This was given to me by my friend. He said that book was fine.I fell in love with it in first pages. This book is great if you like mystery, secrets, action and stories about Freemasons. Brad will take you spinning in the mystery through out the book. It will keep you up at night time and it will be hard to put down. Really recomend it to people who like mysteries and Freemason stories. After this book I started to read more about Freemasons. Also I thing Meltzer has done a good job on research for this book.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME! on you Brad Meltzer!","review":"Shame on you Brad Meltzer. This is an UNFINISHED work that you allowed to be published. Cover to cover this is an AWFUL book. The plotline is steady enough, but seriously. You lead the reader down a number of interesting threads that NEVER go anywhere. The Masonic backdrop? You know the cover of the book? NEVER goes anywhere. Please at least do a droplet of research (see Freemasons for Dummies). Your main character...I was left really not liking the guy at all in the end.BRAD MELTZER...do the right thing. Recast this book! It is far from finished. You have cheated your readers. A good start...but you are a year away from publication quality. Oh yes, and shame on you Warner books. i won't forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, at best","review":"Too many \\"what if's\\" in this book make it a lesser read. The author spends so much time spinning different scenarios, that by the time the mystery is actually solved, I didn't care anymore. I thought maybe it was just another \\"what if.\\" The main character, Wes, is such a whimpy, low self-esteem character, that I had a hard time relating. (Okay, I know, he was shot and that would get me down, too, but MOVE ON ALREADY!) And the ending Epilogue section was just pointless and full of filler. I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for a \\"thinking man's\\" thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unanswered questions","review":"This was written well and keeps you interested. However, it starts out like the Da Vinci Code and ends up like a simple story about theft.We are never told what the \\"book of fate\\" is, if it actually exists, and if it did how it was used. The tie in with the masons is laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"For a book that starts with a note from the author about how he researched Freemasons for two years, you'd think there would be some indication of it. It has almost nothing to do with Freemasons, the plot is standard thriller fare sans any real shocking or surprising moments. The main characters is barely likable and mostly pathetic. The other problem I had with it was Brad Meltzer's writing style. In almost every paragraph, the narration will interrupt itself. For example, \\"He ran into the room and found...no...it can't be.\\" After the billionth time, it gets really old. Also, the sheer amount of melodrama made me roll my eyes on more occasions than I could count. Do yourself a favor and read something else. This book is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all","review":"I bought the DVD DR from Digital Innovations in the hopes of restoring a couple of discs that I had that weren't working properly.

The other was \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\", again, something from the past played with a renewed sound, the musicianship is outstanding from all players.The two re-worked acoustic versions are also worth the purchase, \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes\\", and \\"Ride Easy\\" gives feel and new flavor to the performances of both.I'm awaiting the DVD in October to see how the songs were performed, and with Wetton's recent illness, is the only Asia we'll see for a little while.The mix, backbeat and all peformers are done very well for a live recording, 5 stars + from me...A great CD for any musician, music, or Asia fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A KARAOKE CD!!","review":"If you want a great cdg disc of Queen songs to use in your karaoke machine, THEN DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!

The bulk of the book focuses on the efforts needed to steer children in the right direction using positive reinforcement, goal setting, and motivation through encouraging passions.The book loses some luster on the quality of its advice which ranges from the well known to the obvious.

I knew Minor Threat, Fugazi, and much of the old harDCore stuff (and love it!), but some of the stuff from Dischord's little known second generation of bands on disc two (most of them defunct) is like a revelation. I suspect I'll be exploring some of these artists in the near future.My only gripe (and it's a minor one) is that all 50 bands get equal billing. Bands like Fugazi, Jawbox, Minor Threat are simply in a different league than some of the acts, but they all get just one song; it must be said that there are a couple of stinkers. But that's okay, 'cause you already have everything Fugazi has put out. Right?!!

As much as I hoped it would grow on me, it has not yet. As brilliant as Minor Threat and Government Issue were, the reason why you probably never heard of a lot of these bands is simply because their songs weren't very good.

That said, there are some good singles strewn throughout like Marginal Man's \\"Missing Rungs,\\" Circus Lupus' \\"Pop Man,\\" and Embrace's classic \\"Money.\\" Dischord is an unassailable indie label, so it is no surprise that they would choose to democratically showcase all the artists on their roster rather than focus in on a few popular bands.

No, this is not your typical Aristotelian drama, but that is partially why I love it so much; the other huge reason would be Drake's challenge to the complacency and the overwhelming lack of anger in the gay community. There's plenty to be angry about for anyone -- gay, straight and in-between -- and Drake presents his rage and his humanity in a form that is accessible, moving and real. This play is a gift to anyone who loves dramas that expand the realms of possibility or who have ever felt the activist spirit churning within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, great songs, great introduction...","review":"The Staple Singers sing classic bluesy gospel music and they mostly swing, when they sing.

The often unusual photos enjoy a very high quality reproduction. The music is fantastic, by the best singer-songwriter in Honduras, Guillermo Anderson. He covers the wide range of musical styles found in this multi-cultural region with little segues of non-musical local sounds between most tracks. The surprise for me was the prose by Julio Escoto, poetic short stories and descriptions, validating his position as one of the best contemporary authors in Central America. The book could use a bit of explanation about the photos and music for those not familiar with the rich culture of this area, but the project stands on its own as a sensual ethnography that captures a place and time more of the world should be aware of. And for a CD and hardcover book w/ full page high-quality color photography the price is quite a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"About Swordmakers, not swords, not swordmaking.","review":"This is a book about German swordmakers. It contains very little information about swords in the technical sense, e.g. construction methods or design evolution. There is a listing of the swordmakers names, dates of swordmaking and family connections. There are many pictures of Solingen factories and other historical venues. There is a list of maker's marks which does not seem to be complete nor is it presented as such. There is not much in the way of pictures of swords showing types, characteristic designs, patterns or maker innovations. The photos are of questionable quality and most of the pictures are illustrations with little provenance. Some interesting information on which makers also exported to the U.S. is included. As is usual these days, there is no appendix or detailed Table of Contents. A good book for historians but not so good for the collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the photograohs???","review":"While written material information is excellant in this book, It lacks enough photographs to make it useful for a collector to successfully identify a sword he may have. Also it should have included French, British and German designs. Sorry but this book does not help me at all. The proof marks are availible almost everywhere else.

Better books than this are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Specific Book for Specific Purpose","review":"This is a fair book. Overall it does provide history of German blade-smithing and lists most of the German sword marks. The book provides good facts, but lacks completeness of the sword manufacturers and is missing a number of sword-makers. The sword illustrations are terrible, the photos are very few and are of poor to average quality. The bibliography is absent and some facts are somewhat questionable.

The product was very solid, the color excellent. The size was a little large but given the features a good tradeoff. I needed to sync the E-100 with two different PCs (Windows98 & WindowsNT). The sync with NT worked flawlessly but I was never able to sync (using Active Sync 3.0) on my Compact Presario (Windows98/Outlook2000). Customer service was never able to resolve the problem as to why it would not sync on Windows98/Outlook2000. Without the sync ability the usefullness of the product was eliminated and I had to go back to the Palm. Seems to be a good product with older software/systems (WindowsNT 4.0/Outlook98) but seems to lack compatibility with Windows98/Office2000 products.

The power switch is awkward to use. The power runs out quickly and needs to be recharged, so if you travel internationally it can't simply be plugged in whereas the Palm uses AAA battries that can be gotten anywhere. Despite being CE based it doesn't sync up with Outlook any better than the Palm.

After reading this book you can really see further into those images Avedon made, and mostly why he chose a particular image over another.

The size of the base is very large. Some of the operations are a bit mystical. If someone else answers the phone and you want to get on the same line and talk too or if your answering machine gets the call first, you need to push the line of the call once, wait for 2 seconds and then push the line again. If you have guests you need to train them on how to use the phone.Worst of all is the customer service department. If you call the 800 line it may take as much as 6-8 hours to get through. When I called and asked for a supervisor, I was put into voice mail.

I agree with another reviewer's assertion that the author's own insecurities and issues are full on display. There is a lot of agenda going on in this book. It's not a bad book, it just feels like there was no editor involved. Things repeat over and over and drag on. I liberally skipped paragraphs and sometimes pages just to get to the point, and kept reading just to see what happened and hoped that it'd get better. It didn't really. To the author's credit, I cared what happened to the character enough to keep reading despite the main character being a total narcissist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching For a Place to Hang Her Hat","review":"Amy is not only searching for \\"a place to hang her hat\\". She is also searching for herself. Abandoned by her mother, her father in jail, she was raised by Grandma Lil. As her biological clock ticks and she has her 30th birthday, she wants to learn more about her background. This reporter pursues her own investigation to find her mother. This tender and comical story with interesting, well-developed characters is hard to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hats Off!","review":"You cannot help but root for the main character. An off-beat grandmother, ex-con father and absentee mother did not stop her from making her way in life. Of course her past effects her present, but we know she will persevere as well as prevail. We are allowed along for the ride as she tries to track down her mother for answers and closure; as well as journey with her in a parallel subplot where she watches a young man try to track down his father.The writing is, of course, a pleasure to read.FYI: I have read this book twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Dull, Dull","review":"This was the first Susan Isaacs novel I've read and it will probably be the last. I felt the author was trying to be funny throughout the book--and failing miserably. The main character was boring, the ending managed to be both predictable and implausible, and the whole book was utterly forgettable. Maybe Isaacs has done better, but judging from Any Place I Hang My Hat, I don't get the hype about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Read","review":"This book introduced me to Susan Isaacs, and it's still my favorite. This is a lovely story of finding oneself, of negotiating past and family and self. It's funny and touching. The emotions are restrained and therefore more powerful. I found it an extremely satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-handed political tripe","review":"This book drove me batty! Amy broke her arm, as they say, patting herself on her back for being so intelligent. However, Isaacs just keeps telling us that Amy's another Einstein, but she doesn't show us her brilliance. And the politics! Give me a break! I felt like I was reading an article in The Nation. If that's your taste in politics, you'll feel right at home. It's nonstop liberal politics throughout the book, so be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new standup comedian","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed Susan Isaacs' books and looked forward to reading this one. After 50 painful pages or so, I closed the cover with the relief that I was permitting myself to abandon the rest. Susan seems to be competing with Janet Evanovich, a writer I do not enjoy. When people have mentioned Janet, I say, \\"Why not try Susan Isaacs? She has wonderful plots into which she weaves the most fantastic humor. I find myself suddenly laughing aloud.\\" Unfortunately, in this book the humor appears to be the main thrust with whatever plot there is taking backseat. She simply tried too hard to be funny. I did not choose the book to read one-liners, but that is what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Isaacs latest novel - the only one I have not liked","review":"I have read all of Susan Isaacs' books and loved them all. This one was a great disappointment. I could not figure out why I should care about her or her unfortunate family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"This novel was so bland and predictable. There were also errors in grammer, specifically, the misuse of the first person, which always drives me crazy. Then the candidate's campaign manager morphed into his press scretary by the end of the book, which is really sloppy. Finally, her pro-israeli positions, which are not supported by fact was really disappointing. Trying to charge people with left leaning political views of being anti-Semetic because they oppose the occupation of Palestinian land was absurd. Many Israelis agree that Israel is turning into an apartheid state. How being in support of an oppressed people can be turned into anti-Semitism really devalues genuine bigotry."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment!","review":"I have never written a review on a book before, but must because this book is a big letdown. I have read all of Isaacs other books and found them to be great funny reads. She was out to lunch on this one. I kept expecting something important to happen in the book, but it never did. Awful and Boring! The main character was so unlikeable I kept hoping she wouldn't get back together with her boyfriend. She didn't deserve him. If you are like me and have read all of the other books by her, don't automatically buy this one counting on a great few hours of reading, I did and it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses by a mile","review":"I've enjoyed other books by Susan Isaacs and, as a ex-New Yorker, continue to enjoy her accurate eye and ear for Jewish New York nuance. But \\"Any Place I Hang My Hat\\" was a big disappointment. Predictable plot. Too heavy (and obvious) on election politics. And way too many self-congratulatory comments from Amy, the main character. But my biggest beef with this book is that Amy is supposed to be pushing thirty, yet her professed youth doesn't come off convincingly. Throughout, I kept \\"hearing\\" the voice of the middle-aged writer trying to sound young. Maybe it's time for Isaacs to take a rest and contemplate a new writing direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too mallow and boring book... You have permission to stop in the middle...","review":"It is my first book of the author Susan Isaacs and I got to read (actually listen to audio book) base on the recommendation of my wife. The book starts nice and interesting with the quest of Amy Lincoln to meet her mom, her relationship with her boyfriend John, her friend Teddi, and the Fiasco around Freddy Corrasco. This is how it starts, continues and ends with not much ups and down in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for USB Drives that Need Power","review":"It wasn't clear (at least to me) from the write-up in Amazon that the cord isn't thick enough to supply power to a USB hard drive. Says so right on the package, but too late. So BEWARE if you were hoping to use this cord with an external USB drive (as I was)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of El Hazard","review":"This is the best of the El Hazard series in my opinion. Just give them a shot. I own the full VHS set. Very funny. ^^"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even bear to finish this series.","review":"To sum everything up at the start, I didn't find a single redeeming element in this particular series. The characters were all goofy and I didn't find myself liking any of them. The animation was weak and the art style B-grade anime fare. The storyline was also weak and goofy, and after three-quarters of the show it still didn't redeem itself. I still didn't care what was happening or what was going to happen.Now, I haven't watched the OVAs where this rehash was supposedly based on. Maybe I should, because I've heard and read from reviews that it is better. I'm not picky when it comes to anime, but even I couldn't get into this one. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the OVA's","review":"I watched the original OVAs and loved them, so I thought a TV series would becool. This however, was not the case. The things that made the OVAs so magical were removed, and what I saw of it was a rehash. If you haven't seen the OVAs, you might like the TV series."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected.","review":"Not what we expected. My daughter was hoping this was a little more person friendly. very hard to read. Would of rather had an actual game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Binding is Falling Apart","review":"Maybe the supplier for this title saved some money by purchasing a run of cheaply bound copies from the publisher. Trying to read, study and reread a NEW textbook from which each page comes loose from the binding as it is turned is not just inconvenient, it is maddening. Imagine dropping the book on a classroom floor and having to spend hours putting the pages back in their proper order! An expensive textbook like this should be an investment for a serious student who may wish keep it on his bookshelf for years. Good luck with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"whereis it","review":"NOT RECEIVED YET !

I have not installed them but they look like they are perfect for the Job. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP F50 Review","review":"DON'T but it! I bought an HP home PC almost two years ago, which included an F50 monitor. The monitor itself has great clarity and color and a nice aesthetic quality as well. The problem is a horizontal line of pixels burnt out about 1 1/2 years after I bought it. So basically I have a horizontal black line running dead center throught my monitor. When I called HP Support they told me my monitor needed to be replaced. I find this unacceptable after only a year and a half of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ive never liked HP...","review":"I don't own this moniter myself, but I used it for a while at my friends house. When I first used it, I didn't think it was a flat screen, because it wan't any brighter or sharper than any other moniters. When you stare at the text and the pictures you can read it, but theres nothing really special to it. The bad part is when you scroll. When your scroll down, all the text, pictures, ect...become VERY blurry. It just looks like a big blob. If your a person who likes to scroll and read at the same time (like me), than this isn't the right moniter for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the finest poetry in the modern world","review":"Some of the finest poetry in the modern world.

I could have made a better movie with a camera phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe to Use with any carseat","review":"NEVER use any extra padding in a carseat unless the seat came with it. Although I applaud the innovation and idea, truly needed, the design is seriously flawed. Reading the other reviews I see everyone says, \\"I had to loosen the straps on the car seat...\\". This puts your child at serious risk if in an accident as the padding will compress and suddenly the straps are not tight enough. Same goes for coats and buntings, they should NEVER be used with a carseat. For your baby's safety just use blankets or even get one of the seat covers that just go over the top of the seat, but anything that interferes with the straps is a BIG safety risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A SAFE PRODUCT!!!","review":"This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic & Safety Administration) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that \\"after-market products\\" should not be used. It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer's description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"It is excellent! Very warm, soft, beautiful and easy to use.

We put this on and it fits our car seat perfectly, was easy to install and is easy to remove, and keeps our baby warm in the very cold weather we live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Bought this new from Amazon. It is definitely very soft and warm. The only catch I found is that we have a Graco Safeseat, and as this is a larger carseat (designed to hold infants up to 30#), the Bundle Me doesn't quite stretch to cover the entire top of the carseat. But this is really just cosmetic, it doesn't effect it's use.I haven't washed mine yet, but I have seen other Bundle Me's after they've been washed a few times, and they definitely start to show their wear.But all in all, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Install, Easy to Wash, We Love IT","review":"This is a nice product, my wife and daughter love it.

IT REALLY KEEPS THE BABY WARM EVEN IN THE COLDEST WINTER. WHEN THE WIND IS WHIPPING, THE GENEROUS FRONT FLAP FLIPS UP OVER THE CARRYING ARM OF THE BABY SEAT AND ALSO KEEPS THE BABY WARM. NO FUSSY COATS AND HUNDREDS OF BLANKETS. I HOPE TO USE IT NEXT WINTER ALSO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Warm","review":"This item is not just a replacment for a snow suit. When we were using the infant carseat, we would use it to cover the baby's face when its windy, raining or snowing. We even used it to cover his face while walking past smokers outside of stores and malls (it has to filter the smokey air at least a little bit).Now that we are into the next size in carseat, I unzipped the top half (it's removable) and use the bottom half to line the carseat. It's great for protecting the seat from spit-up and such, also on the bitter cold days it stays quite a bit warmer than the carseat material."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-05dd9661"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/31.md","filePath":"quotesmag/31.md"}'),H={name:"quotesmag/31.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
