It seemed like everyone was killed off in the sequel, though, and Medraut (an amazing character) was mentioned in the book for a short time near the end. It just seemed like the King Arthur culture and the African culture didn't mix well. Here would be my outline:The Winter Prince: Set in Britain. All the King Arthur characters.Coalition of Lions: The author seemed to kill off all the King Arthur characters, and veer off onto a totally different topic.I felt like Medraut and his siblings were destroyed.

I happen to have a label from a vers 2 element I bought before, and I compared them. The specs on the Vers 1 label are actually lower (better) than the Vers 2.

However....Once installed, this game would start what can only be described as a screen flutter. The screen would flutter throughout the gameplay, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. This would continue to the point that certain parts of the screen would not show any text at all, and would run very very slow (if at all). Numerous requests for tech support with the manufacturer of the game came to nothing, as they claimed to never have heard of the problem before.I'm sure this is a great game, but after having to fight with screen flutters, I gave up. Perhaps when I'm finished with Sims2, I'll try this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definatly a keeper....(Go buy it!!)","review":"Well, what can I say about Restraunt Empire? Bored one day, I picked it up after looking at pictures from the game. The pictures were definatly stunning, and the idea was awsome, original, and just sweet. Controls are easy to manuver with nice looking windows to navagate. Once you work through the tutorials on the story line, things are great. I especially love the \\"cook offs\\". Finally an Iron Chief type deal!! Great fun!! Two modes of play, Story or Sandbox (sandbox starts you from scratch to make your own restruant) it has potential for hours and hours of enjoyment. If you like Sim games, Please, pick this up, it is WELL worth it.

The concept behind Restaurant Empire is somewhat original but I'm inclined to throw this one into the category of low-budget software titles just the same.The graphics aren't as sharp as Roller Coaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, or The Sims but I can't say that I haven't seen worse. It was a facet of the game that I could overlook if only the rest of the game made up for it.When you get down to it, the game replay value just isn't there for me. While the first few scenarios were interesting, after a couple of hours, it just got pretty boring. Here I thought I would be in control of so much more than what I actually got from the game and whether or not you play with scenarios or in sandbox mode, it all looks the same after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"It looks like it was made for an older people, however older people usualy don't play these kinds of games.

This book is another warm, quick, comforting read that is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"after coming to terms with my own sexual orientation, i read this book. what a mistake. the writing is simple and stupid. the characters are gay stereotypes (the flamboyant femme-fatale, the shy flirt, and the not-so-straight jock.) and they are extremely two dimensional. the plot went nowhere. this book had so much potential but fell flat on it's face."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way as good as the first book. Too leaden and patronizing","review":"I loved Rainbow Boys and was very excited for the sequel. But this second book was very plodding and patronizing. It treats readers like idiots just moving on from one gay issue to next in a manner similar to a really boring game of connect the dots. Its like a bad soap opera where the obvious just keeps happening. I know the audience is gay teens - but they're not idiots. Its a shame because I fell in love with the characters in the first book - and half-way through this sequel - i just didnt care anymore. Shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great continuation","review":"Continuing from the successful \\"Rainbow Boys\\", \\"Rainbow High\\" follows Nelson, Jason, and Kyle through most of their senior year in high school as they look forward to their futures after graduation, but will they all be together? Nelson struggles with having an HIV+ boyfriend, while Jason and Kyle work through the beginnings of their relationship. Kyle is hesitant to decide on a college until he knows where Jason is heading. Jason, meanwhile, decides to come out to his basketball coach and team, but this could jeopardize his scholarship, or will it? This young adult novel explores friendship and dating in these characters' lives, and paints a hopeful picture of being young and gay. While the story does gloss over much of the emotional intricacies of the teens, \\"Rainbow High\\" is a delight to read. Like in his first book, Sanchez also includes resources for gay youth after the story's conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!!","review":"I am not gay but I was so in love with Rainbow Boys when I checked it out of the librarry 1 day that I read the book in a hour.

Higgs is a captivating and creative storyteller who can take familiar Bible stories and transform them into modern tales that teach valuable lessons. Whether it's fiction like this or children's books or Bible studies, Higgs is a delight to read and learn from.Years ago when Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code was popular, Mary Magdalene became a hot topic. Higgs' book Unveiling Mary Magdalene sets the record straight about who Mary was (a woman freed from demons) and who she was not (Jesus' romantic interest). In typical Higgs fashion, the book is part novel -- telling the story of tortured soul Mary Margaret Delaney and her deliverance -- and part study, taking Biblical accounts of Mary Magdalene and applying what we can learn from her life as a passionate, delivered, transformed follower of Jesus to our lives as we seek to know Him more.This book is a treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for discussion","review":"We are reading this book in a women's small group study. We have read all of the authors' other books in the \\"Bad Girls of the Bible\\" series. Her presentation of the story in a modern setting helps us relate to the story. We also appreciate the Biblical research that she includes. We would definitely recommend this book & the authors other books to any woman reader or women's group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dose of encouraging reality","review":"Wow! This book is fabulous. Written with typical Liz humor and deep insight, this book is a must for anyone who wants to really understand Mary Magdalene. Liz lets us know why most of our perceptions about Mary Magdalene are erroneous. She also has that wonderful ability to modernize the story for us. We see a fictional modern woman and situation juxtaposed against the scriptural Mary. This really brings Mary to life. If you've read the DaVinci Code, you'll want to compare the two Marys represented.I can also recommend Bad Girls of the Bible and Really Bad Girls of the Bible by the same author, who describes herself as a \\"former bad girl.\\" Funny, moving, and meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very creative author","review":"This is a very unique way to study the Bible and its interesting characters. Higgs is extremely witty and creative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so Many Typos?","review":"I have this book on Kindle and I am very curious to find out if there are different proofreaders/editors for print vs digital books. I am a new Kindle owner and for the most part I am loving it, but the Kindle version of this book is loaded with spelling and grammatical errors. Is this the case with the print version also? Mad Mary's last named is misspelled so many times one could wonder what her last name actually is. And some words are so jumbled that one has to guess what word the author intended to use. Also, the possesive apostrophe is omitted way too frequently.This is very off-putting to me and detracts from my enjoyment of the story, which is actually pretty good. This book deserves a better proofreader/editor. If the errors were corrected I would rate the book higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get R.E.A.L.","review":"I would spend your money more wisely.

I read the book, then bought another for my mother, who could relate to many of the stories. I too, was molested at a very young age, and I am happy to see that a book can treat this topic with such sensitivity and candor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renaissance Faire Gone Bad!","review":"Ryna and Phoenix return to Pendragon to find it under new management full of theatrical bubbling PINK energy, half the best acts gone and their gypsy vardo torn down. The mood among the rennies is gloomy and pessimistic, a mood cultivated and exploited by Liam and his Darkworld cronies. Yes, Liam is back and if you thought he was dangerous in \\"From the Ashes,\\" he is truly frightening in \\"Into the Storm.\\" The balance between the worlds is in danger and Ryna's soul may be lost forever.Ms. Bruner has woven a roller coaster ride novel that has you holding your breath one minute and crying the next. In this sequel, she focuses more on the main characters and plot; and a bit less on the romance of the Renaissance Faire atmosphere and activities. Though the atmosphere may be missed, the Darkworld holds the reader captive as surely as it holds Ryna. A \\"must read.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy - perfect with the little black dress","review":"I purchased this pair of shoes for my favorite little black dress and they are stunning. The only downside is that the straps on the back (at the heel) don't fit perfectly so there is a little gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've enjoyed many of Enoch's other books, so I was surprised at how much I disliked this one. The heroine (Angel) is secretly engaged to the hero's cousin (Simon). For some ridiculous reason, Angel's parents insist on not only a very long engagement but also on keeping the engagement itself a secret. And so Simon comes up with a very silly plan to push Angel's parents into speeding things up by having his \\"rakehell\\" (in quotes because there's nothing here to indicate that's true) cousin (James/Jamie/Devil) flirt with/pursue Angel. So, there's the really really contrived premise. It's all pretty transparent and there really is no conflict at the end. Angel has some TSTL moments that almost had me put the book down for good. And the Devil nickname is just ridiculous.I suppose for its time it was okay. I'm about a decade too late to really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I liked this book fairly well, and it did keep me reading. I have to say, though, that certain aspects just didn't make sense to me, most particularly Angel's parents. (Spoiler alert.) Sure James has a bad reputation...but he is also a rich Marquis and war veteran. Even after they spend time with him and learn that he isn't that bad, they still insist on painting him as a horrible guy. Also, when James and Angel are caught kissing, the logical response would have been to insist that they marry. Marrying her off to Simon would not have been especially helpful to her ruined reputation.Despite all that, I did enjoy reading the book, which is why I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essential Wagner","review":"This book is Wagner's seminal essay where he fully explains his principles and opinions regarding opera and music. If you like his operas, this is the one book that is a must have on your reading shelf.In 1893, the London Wagner Society published an English translation of Wagner's 8 volume collected works. This is volume 2 of that series. It contains the full text of \\"Oper und Drama\\", translated as \\"Opera and Drama\\". Our old friend, William Ashton Ellis, did the stilted but essential English translations.Much of what Wagner wrote has nothing to do with music, and quite a large portion is pretty forgettable. However, this book is important, and goes a long way toward helping you understand his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs to remember!","review":"Not many people outside Brazil are familiar with Montenegro's music.

All I know is that it had been awhile since I had a good fictional read, and this one was extremely satisfying. It was refreshing to be introduced to a young man who was so deeply in love with his life partner. I wondered what it was going to take to snap him out of his self-absorbtion. So what if it was a needy young boy, emotionally abandoned by his 2-career parents? Did this bother some of our guilt-ridden readers? So what if several coincidences were somewhat contrived? I enjoyed every page, and was sorry to reach the last one. I love happy endings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ocean Apart","review":"This book was read on the strength of how much I enjoyed the stories of Rosamunde Pilcher; however, I found it contained a well-worn, rather boring plot, with a predictable ending. Suffice it to say, the kindest words I can think of would be to strongly suggest that Robin direct his energies elsewhere and leave writing to his mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but a little unbelievable","review":"I just finished reading An Ocean Apart. Mr. Pilcher is a good story teller, but leans too much toward the unbelievable. Except for losing the love of his life, the main charachter, was touched with an incredibly charmed life. He was just too perfect to be true. In less than two weeks he manages to move to another country, find a job, a rent-free house in a very nice neighborhood, a (free) car, a dog, make several close friends, solve all the problems of a teenage boy, and find another love of his life. The biggest problem of the book was the offensive language. I doubt I will read another one of his books, for this reason alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I barely started this book. I was hoping for more of the style of writing of Robin's mom, Rosamunde. I was having a hard time staying with the book. He simply cannot write like she does and I was expecting too much. I was very turned off by the crudeness and swearing, which I have never encountered in her books. I should have expected that as a man, he would write differently, but I was still surprised. I am comparing this to his mom's writing, because that is why I bought the book. She makes every word count, but this was a blend that I just could not stay with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"I have never read a book by the author's mother so this is a stand alone opinion based on the story itself. The premise of this novel is based on a man's wife dieing and him not being able to cope with this and withdrawing from his family and life. Luckily his family is rich enough that he does not need to go to work and can instead garden all day. I found this very insulting and demeaning to all the people who's spouse die and have to continue on after maybe a week of bereavement time from their jobs. My father passed away while my brother and I were in high school and my mother had no choice but to carry on. Does this mean her devastation was any less then the main characters? No. It is just that in real life people have to be stronger then the weak selfish main character presented here. If you can make it past this maybe you will find the novel entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FAMILY AFFAIR","review":"It's a great book which is not a mystery but a family affair of two different worlds--Scotland and America.

The characters were real and the story drew me in and made me not want to put the book down. A great summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I should have known -- the fact that Rosemunde Pilcher's name is always used in conjunction with her son's book is a definite clue that the publisher wasn't sure he could hold his own. I suspect if his name had been Bilcher instead of Pilcher, the book wouldn't have been published or certainly not sold as well.This story is so predictable. A situation presents itself and in the next few paragraphs, there's the solution! And he definitely didn't get American speech.Reading this book reminded me of watching the videa of \\"Coming Home.\\" In the book, Rosemunde Pilcher weaves a wonderful story with many varied characters. When I saw the video, the story seems shallow and insipid because so many characters were left out and so much of the story line changed. \\"An Ocean Apart\\" is shallow and insipid, too. In my opinion, Robin should have stuck to his day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing","review":"This is the third review I've written for this book. Although I have carefully followed all the rules, neither of my reviews have been printed. I suspect you only print favorable reviews because your job is to sell books, not serve the public. How disappointing. I will never read or write a review of a book again. My time is too valuable, and I have lost my respect for your review process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a collection of blog entries, and not good ones.","review":"The back copy implies this will either be funny/snarky or dramatic. It's neither. It reads like a \\"blog book\\" - a collection of stuff thrown together for a book deal.History's Last Stand suffers from erratic coverage. It notes Belle Starr's last day alive, but not who she was. It's presumed the reader knows. I had to Wikipedia her, and okay, she's interesting, but not enough IMO to deserve an entry for Her Last Dying Day. One of Bugsy Siegel's entries notes that he hated the nickname Bugsy, but nowhere is his actual name mentioned.I got it from the library, hoping for a good \\"tank topper\\" (plunk it on the toilet tank and skim it when you're using the facilities), but there are better tank toppers out there.

In other writings he has shown himself to be dishonest with his readers and himself. His devotion to disproving evolution in favor of ID has distorted his ability to clearly see reality in both science and numbers. Science is science and if a theory is bad it will be proved so over time. It turns out that ID has no scientific evidence for viability so Dembski distorts science to fit ID, not very honest, and you will get nothing out of his book unless you are a creationist/ID'er that needs a boost in your own belief system. This is not a work of science to prove a new theory but of twisted science to make a bad theory work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan*tastic","review":"This book is one of my favorites in the sci-fi genre. I love the way Mr. Dembski writes long sentences about math and science, and still has the time to come to a conclusion about Designer Genes and such. Having read his books over the years, I would say he's finally evolving into a kind of Rennaissance man, practically a new Michelangelo.What's really great is where he says, on page 13, that \\"Mankind is the inventor of his own destiny, a destiny that I share.\\"But the best part is the vast amounts of math in the book. I have reviewed all the equations that Dembski has added to give credence to his theories and I have determined that the math leads us to one inexcapable conclusion: Mathematically speaking, we do not yet exist, and so evolution has not yet even begun. Brilliant!Bob DavisMore Evolution Theories"},{"rating":"1","title":"ID Should Be Based On Science","review":"While I do not reject creationist theology, I think ID must be based on science. Dembski's book is poor reading because it mixes the two. This is the same mistake the Darwinists make when they confuse their ID opponents with creationists. While the ID position shares much common ground with creationism, that position is strongest when it relies on it's scientific strengths, as with Michael Behe's \\"Darwin's Black Box: The Bio-Chemical Challenge To Evolution\\". If the argument for Intelligent Design is ever proven, then the question of whom the designer is can be addressed, until then the emotion-laden issue of God's existence should be put aside. Science and religion may one day come together but that day is not here yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"What amazes me is that if you view the other reviews of this book the objections given by those who give this book a one-star rating are actually answered in the contents of the book itself! Given that, it's rather obvious these people have never read the book nor do they intend to; they're the symbolic ostrich with its head in the sand.Now the only negative is that I'd like to see more predictions made (I realize ID has a rather narrow focus; that of merely detecting design), a detailed analysis of what emergent, self-organized, chaotic, non-linear systems can actually accomplish, and a thorough discussion of preventing false positives (and what it means if in the long run new evidence leads to ID resulting in a negative for Biological life). Otherwise this book is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same product, different packaging","review":"In this book the creationists spin their wheels flooding you with pseudo-science in an attempt to convince you that evolution was controlled and part of the plan of a \\"designer\\" (a code word for this tribal God Jehovah fellow from the Book of Genesis).

Barn lid Velcros shut tightly so can carry without opening. I did not attempt to make any noises with the animals because I did not want to run out the batteries, but they are so cute I do not think the noises being there or not makes much of a difference. Will buy again if I become an aunt again. BTW, the names of the animals were not stitched on the sides, which I should take off another star on educational value (only 3 stars for educational). However, not having the names really does not take anything else away from the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"My 4 month old loves this toy! She smiles at all the sounds and the different shapes of the animals are great for teaching her to grasp and hold. There are no small or dangerous parts. I believe this toy will have lasting appeal even once she's a toddler; though the sounds will probably stop working at some point since there is no way to change the batteries inside the plush animals. I would highly recommend this toy for even very young babies, and I plan to purchase some of the other sets in this line as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an AWESOME barn toy!!!!!","review":"We bought this for our youngest daughter for Christmas (at the time she was 8 months old) at first, she giggled at the animals when we'd make them make sounds. Now she is 13 months old and just LOVES going to get her barn for us to play with! I thought at first the construction of the barn wasn't going to hold up against her banging and sitting on it, etc, but it has! She can now identify all the animals and is working on being able to say what sounds each one makes! LOVE THIS TOY!!! Would very much recommend it to anyone looking for something \\"not so traditional\\" that they sell at the store but still is just as fun! My daughter LOVES it - and so do I!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So fun AND educational!","review":"I love this toy! I purchased it for my 15 month old nephrew. The names of the animals are embroidered on them so kids learn the word. Each animal makes their respective noise, although the pig noise is a little strange. I thought these were cute in the picture, but they are even better in real life. The detail of the animals is great especially considering their small size. LOVE IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plush Barn","review":"We LOVE this barn My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and we're always looking for small portable toys to take with us when we travel.

Suburban mom Jenny Meade spends a lot of time carpooling her 4-year-old Linnea and her Matthew, 10-year-old Patsy and her big mouthed friend Crista and 14-year-old Philip from school to swim meets to home. Jenny is a semi-retired pilot anxious to get back into the wild blue yonder. Berlie, Jenny's husband has some neo-Neanderthal ideas of what he expects of his wife -- he wants her to get a ghastly station wagon instead of keeping the spiffy 1979 Honda Accord (to her credit, Jenny keeps the Honda) and tries to ground her airplane aspirations. To her credit, Jenny gets back into the cockpit at the end of the story.To throw some adult themes into the mix, we have a suicide (actually it is a murder, but Jenny won't rest until she finds the killer), and her kids' doctor is an adulterer about town. It ain't great folks, but it'll entertain you when the computer is down and you finished all your other pleasure reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that hits so close to home","review":"This book would have been great without the murder mystery.

This album is indie-rock at it's best: catchy songs with jangly guitars and clever lyrics. The songs, \\"My Friend's Band\\" and \\"Trains and Parades\\", were two of my favorite songs in 2004. \\"You Forget About Your Heart\\" was the most played album this past summer at the college radio station in the town where I live."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must agree with the other reviewers.....","review":"I'm not much of an EP guy, but based off the full lenth LP this band did, i wanted/needed to give this a shot. I'm glad i did as the EP is a strong and solid album with different sorts of sounds which ended up being involved on the LP.The EP at times is a bit more rock than the LP and it serves it well. In addition, it's got some slower songs which melt your ears while listening via headphones. It's a wonderful companion piece to the LP and if you love the band, you should 100% grab this Ep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This whole series was just awful, unreadable dreck.

While it deals with an interesting world it just doesn't \\"feel\\" like fantasy. For a long time Magic novels have proudly combined fantasy with scifi, but this clearly felt to much like scifi. In addition he got characteristics of the colors wrong, lacked much character development, and refused to give any sense of politics to it forgetting a long tradition of MTG politics involving many points of view that in this novel have been traded in for just Glissa's."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGIC has come alive","review":"I play the card game and thought this book would be all about the cards but it actually had a great plot. Glissa an elf who had her parents murdered seeks to avenge them but in doing so she realizes she is part of a much bigger picture. I think that the story ends a little abrubtly but in doing so makes you dream about the sequal until you find it and get reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Sci-Fi ever written","review":"I bought this book because I collect the Magic the Gathering cards. I expected the books to be nothing but fighting. However although it is action packed, it also has an amazing plot. This book follows Glissa, an orphaned elf, seeking to avenge her slaughtered parents. She joins a goblin, Slobad, who has always had a hard life. Now because of a careless error on her part, Slobad must leave his home. As she makes her quest she raelizes that she is going to play a much bigger role in the world of Mirrodin. She must also stop a foe, who if succeeds, will destroy the entire world. With the help of a mage, giant metal man, goblin, and entire race of cat people, she must succeed.

I don't know what it is specifically about the album, but it sticks in my head and I relish it being there. Strangely enough, the track that is probably my favorite on the album is about two or three minutes into the silence following the final listed track...anyone who has this CD and hasn't listened beyond the actual track should most definitely do so as soon as they have an opportunity. Beyond that track my favorites are The Protagonist, Naughty H, Vanish, and Melt Into Your Eyes...but the whole CD is quite excellent.

Despite this falsehood, \\"Platinum's on the Wall\\" is a good but not great DVD collection; the best of the bunch, hands down, is the hot video to \\"Say My Name.\\" Otherwise, there are no extras on this DVD: no lyrics, no discography, no interview footage, nada.

But, beyond that, I was always intrigued by star JoAnna Cameron. The actress even than was rather distant and reclusive. I remember reading stories that she would always keep to herself rarely speaking to the other actors. So, it's a shame, it appears she was not interviewed for the DVD release.

While I am a bit disappointed that Joanna Cameron did not participate in interviews for the dvd set,the other interviews are outstanding! I must also say that the video quality of the episodes is better than I expected! The moral clips,on the other hand,could have been better,but I'm glad that we have them!

At 60 I still break out with a lot of products (including lightweight moisturizers) and yet I'm also fighting dry skin! Besides that, a lot of sunscreens run into my eyes and cause burning. Still, I feel it's extremely important to use a good sunscreen. I wear it year around and it's especially important to me during summer months when I'm outside a lot.This goes on a bit heavy, although not nearly as much as some of their other sunscreens. It also starts out somewhat white, but that goes away with careful application. In other words, don't rub a handful onto your face all at once. Start with smaller amounts and do it by sections (as in forehead, chin, cheeks, etc.). The only thing I don't like about it is it makes my face very shiny, but otherwise, it's comfortable, doesn't cause any irritation and I don't break out from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A godsend!!!!","review":"This is literally the most amazing sunscreen ever!!

Most realize that the story line can be pretty elementary, and the acting sometimes quite amateurish - that's what makes a \\"B\\" Western. After all, they were made quickly (sometimes in a week or not much more time)and incorporated dozens of extras whose only job was to hang around the town as background, or ride a horse chasing either the good guy who was mistaken for the villain, or after the bad guy wearing a black hat, often running him off the edge of a cliff.What surprised me about this particular DVD was the more superior quality of the black and white images. I was prepared for a fuzzy washed-out picture with the speaking parts difficult to understand. Such was not the case for this particular DVD.

But despite it's lack of any real substance, this slim volume is mandatory reading for all students of the Troubles only because it is part of the indoctrination process for all IRA volunteers.

The story of \\"Rinaldo\\" takes place during the first Crusade; but this production shows the Crusaders wearing modern suits: for instance, when Rinaldo first appears, he is wearing a blue trench coat and a fedora! Argante (the King of Jerusalem, and enemy of the Crusaders) was one of the few characters who seemed to be wearing an outfit that looked appropriate for the time period. I didn't like the acting either: Goffredo (the general of the Christian Army) is portayed as a coward! The sets are very weird (they look like surrealistic modern art).

If I would be a singer of one of these operas or a Handel's heir I certainly sue Mr. Alden. Would someone explain to me what is the message in this horrible and insulting stage production?

This is the saving grace. However, the stage production is so absurd that it takes away from the pleasure of enjoying this fine opera. An opera that can be enjoyed without the visuals.

With uncharismatic John Hodiak in the lead as an amnesia victim, the film is a mishmash of confusion punctuated by some of the dumbest lines ever handed to a leading lady, starlet Nancy Guild, a Gene Tierney look alike. There are isolated good moments and some excellent supporting actors but the overall effect is tedium and disorder. This film needed stars like Bogart and Bacall and a director like Howard Hawks to pull it off! A ruthless editor would have helped too.The print of the film is excellent and since film noir has such a cult following, the DVD gets a commentary from noir expert Eddie Mueller. Mueller is realistic about the film's weaknesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOSEPH L. MANKIEWICZ, OPUS 2","review":"**** 1946. Co-written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. An amnesiac tries to find out, all alone, in Los Angeles the man who could reveal him his identity. Another great film noir of the Fox collection even if its last 30 minutes are a little too verbose even for a film directed by Mankiewicz, the dialogue's wizard.

Be reminded of all those old British comedies that you can watch on PBS stations. The quality is not as sharp...due to the Transfer process. The other issue it that it was recorded in 1995.

The final encore with 17 different Valjeans from world wide productions singing \\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\\" in their native language is truly memorable and \\"worth the price of admission\\".Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It just doesn't get any better than this.","review":"How can you go wrong?

The music was so inspired and keeps you singing the tunes for days...weeks... even years after hearing it.The musical is great that being said I don't understand why they would market it in the concert format. As good as the music is by itself it's even better to have the actions etc along with it.

It was the first play I ever went to and love every second of it.This DVD captures none of that. What it does capture is the music. However, since they are no longer have Les Mis on Broadway, I wanted to show my girlfriend the show and how wonderful it is. It is impossible using this DVD. It's all singing. While beautiful, it does nothing for storytelling. Unless you've seen the play, you will have NO idea what's going on here.That being the case, if you're just looking for the music, why not buy the Audio CD?

Every time Colm Wilkinson opens his mouth, there's a sense of disappointment. It ruins the experience. I loved the play on Broadway. I love the CD. In the past, I felt joy and chills at the sound of Colm Wilkinson's voice. But time has taken its toll. His voice has no strength, no range, no resonance on this DVD. It's not my equipment, which is high quality. LG 47LW6500 HDTV. OPPO BDP-93 Blu-ray. Marantz SR7005 A/V receiver. Aperion 5T & 5C speakers & 10D subwoofer. It's not my personal taste.

The singing is, of course, superb; however, this is a CONCERT, not a real production. Seeing the actors standing on a stage in front of microphone can't possibly do the work justice (especially after having seen the musical on Broadway). Personally, I think purchasing a recording would be far more effective since it won't provide the negative imagery of the characters standing on stage not engaging each other in any meaningful way (not to mention the recordings of this performance can be found at far more reasonable prices)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order Les Miserables","review":"I am extremely disappointed that the dvd I ordered for my birthday on 6 August has still not arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better! :o)","review":"This is entertainment at it's 100% absolute best.

Best introductory book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Book of Lunar Observing","review":"Beginning lunar observers should have this book. Lacroux and Legrand provide a very functional set of images covering many of the major features during two weeks from crescent to full moon. The unique aspect of the book is presentation of very functional photographs presented in pairs on facing pages that show the features as seen through a Newtonian scope and a refractor with star diagonal. Identification of features are on the facing pages. For the beginning lunar observer this makes it easy to find features as the view through the eyepiece easily matches one or the other photo while at the telescope. Some of the front illustrations are still in French, but this did not detract as most of the terms have English cognates. French amateur astronomy is very strong and this translation for the English-speaking world is most welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Discover the Moon\\" by Jean Lacroux","review":"No matter what type of small telescope you might have, the pictures in this book will be helpfull. The pictures show what you will see with refractors and with reflectors. This makes the book particularly usefull to beginning astronomers. Bear in mind that reflectors turn the image upside down. While this might seem like not much of an advantage, just try to identify lunar details without this feature.The book is well written and well translated. Some of the pictures have the original French terms which might be a small disadvantage to those who do not read French, but the text will get the idea across.All in all, I'm glad I bought the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality Molds","review":"I purchased aspic molds from this company after using an alternative mold and found them to be of top quality and first rate.

His twin seems to always be just a little bit better, while Koji feels he can't seem to do anything right. When his twin saves a rich merchant's life, Koji is surprised when his parents choose him to become the apprentice. After failing with the merchant, Koji runs away only to be captured by Ninjas, or, as they call themselves, blades of grass. The book begins somewhat slowly and focuses heavily on the culture of Ninjas, so it will not appeal to readers who wish for constant action. It is however very strong historical fiction and will leave the reader knowing far more about the fascinating world of Ninjas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for all children","review":"This is a great book for children of all ages. It has action suspense and everything a good book needs. First of all you meet Koji and you learn that he is not as good at things as his brother, which in turn he loses some respect from his parents. All through the book Koji is met with challenges that he overcomes, which may help some in their real life. The action starts rather early in the book and continuers right in to the end. I really liked how they explained life around camp, I don't know much about ninjas but this stuff seems really believable. The author really gets detailed about the training and missions Koji faces. The only thing about this book that made me a little disappointed is how quickly it ended I felt the author could of added more or something. As I said before I recommend this book to anyone.S. Bricker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended for insomniacs.","review":"An insipid plot line and sterotypical characters make for a very dull book. The conflict is the overused Great Misunderstanding between hero and heroine, who spends most of the novel assuming the worst behavior of the hero without giving him the opportunity to explain his actions or even understand her accusations. The hero, on the other hand, spends much time rescuing her from her ignorance and poor education. Despite his lessons, the turning point doesn't come until she gets a pair of eyeglasses, and then she is magically transformed into a thoughtful political writer. (Note to author: as character development, eyeglasses leave much to be desired.) The comical minor characters provide the only glimmer of entertainment. Highly recommended reading for insomniacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overzealous publisher","review":"Being intimately familiar with the original publication of this trilogy, I can say with utmost disdain that whoever was responsible for taking the liberties of rewriting what was very nearly perfection must have a great fondness for soap operas and should stick with romance novels instead. Not only are there additional passages inserted that were never written by Conrad Richter, there are also altered meanings of existing passages that totally change the flavor and the original intent. There are so many instances in all three volumes that I don't even know where to begin with examples. This is by far the most appalling reprint of an award-winning piece of historical fiction I have ever witnessed. You would do better to find a used copy from the original publisher, Alfred A.

As the Co-director of Netherlands Opera in those years I feel proud of this product of ideal \\"Stagione\\" in the opera.Nando Schellen 08-10-11"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"Rosenkavalier\\" on Disc","review":"Von Stade is probably the best Octavian among the fine sopranos who have recorded this role. Unfortunately, Evelyn Lear is so far past her prime that she may qualify as the worst of the Marschallins, and Ruth Welting is outclassed by every recorded Sophie (yes, I've heard them all). DeWaart's tempi are sometimes laborious, seemingly to accomodate Lear's vocal problems. The supporting cast is seldom more than adequate; the Marianne is a horror. Bastin's excellent Ochs gets rather lost in the noise. Von Karajan (Schwarzkopf) is still the best, with Solti (Crespin) a very close second. For the budget conscious, the live recording with Janowitz, Minton, and the superb Lucia Popp on Opera d'oro beats this recording by miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice choice (maybe) for von Stade's fans","review":"The blistering two-star review below has the facts right but may be too harsh in its judgments. Von Stade has countless fans who might want to hear her at her freshest in 1976 as Oktavian, and there's a passing glimpse of Jose Carreras as the Italian tenor. De Waart conducts deliberately; he wins good playing from his Rotterdam orchestra and warm sonics from Decca. But Bastin's voice is too lean for Baron Ochs, and his German pronunciation is stilted, as are his attempts to be Viennese. Welting is adequate as Sophie. The real question as to listenability is Lear's fragile Marschallin, whose fading voice actualy helps develop the image of a vulnerable, aging woman, too old for Strauss's conception but still touching.In the end, there's too much wrong to make this a good Rosenkavalier, but the intimate scenes between Von Stade and Lear have their moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"counterfeit","review":"The print quality of this book below standards.

The part I didn't like was the fact you have to flip back and forth when you are holding strands of hair figuring out what to do with them because of the terminology. I think it would have been much more efficient if the book had more step by step details on how to do the styles. It has been discouraging for me to know that achieving some of these do's will take more time than necessary because of the lack of detail in the instructions. I am getting there, with a lot of practice, of course. I do love the idea of a book on how to do a vintage 'do'.

Long, dull, nothing-happening scenes are punctuated with moments of insane behavior and events with little explanation. If there is a reasoning to all this, we the viewers are certainly asked to fill in the gaps far too much. There is little substantiation to this movie and it duly suffers in the credibility department. You know something is amiss when the product description on the back cover of the DVD makes more sense than the movie does. Now, I openly admit I haven't seen any of director Joo Pedro Rodrigues' other films, and perhaps I am probably not savvy enough to understand them, but if this movie is representative, I am highly inclined not to give them a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond dreadful","review":"Superbly awful.

Car accidents happen.From then on we observe very peculiar serie of events. The worst is that the action slows down dramatically. The shots are loooong and don't make the whole thing more clear.Even if the acting is good it doesn't change the whole impression. The actors seem to be as much lost as I was at some moments. If I had to point the best one, it would be with no doubt the one who portrayed the graving mother. The scene at the cementary at the grave of her husband is still in my mind.Well, the ending...My jaw literally dropped. And it's not because it was so amazing.

Unfortunately, it did not deliver. There were numerous problems, an implausible storyline and frustrating characters chief among them. It meandered far too much and ultimately ended on a ridiculous note. I recall reading favorable reviews of this film and was anxious to buy the DVD. I doubt it will remain in my library - it just wasn't terribly engaging and suggests Joao Pedro Rodrigues took far too formulaic a path in constructing this work both substantively and dramatically. I also feel the development and rather dark transformations of his two leads seemed to follow the same trajectory as his lead character in O FANTASMA. It just didn't resonate with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"Well-made product that's great in bed with the wife or for wearing during the day once in a while.

If you read this book then you will remember it - it's that type of story. It's inspirational, thoughtful, and rings true.

It's that good.This is a book about a kid named Jimmy Carter, who loses his vision when his friend lights a firecracker and it explodes in his face.The book chronicles Jimmy's schooling at a school for the blind, and his relationship with Leader, his seeing eye dog. The book will also teach your children the value of forgiveness. It will also teach them that, while some things come easy to them, others have to struggle. What this book WON'T teach people is to pity blind poeple. Jimmy is by NO means a weak kid. When you finish reading \\"Follow My Leader\\" you will have a new respect for him.Buy it.

My best friend and I took turns checking it out from the school library, and often explored the concept of \\"disability\\" by taking turns pretending to be blind. This story is a classic story of overcoming adversity - it probably would made an excellent tv movie as well. It also is an excellent book for teaching kids about disability awarness, and that kids with disabilities can do lots of important things (like the challenge the main character overcomes in the story). My 9 year old daughter recently read it, and loved it too. She brought it to her 3rd grade class, and the class took turns reading it during free time.

It was quite interesting to me. It was also interesting that it was written nearly fifty years ago, so there were a few things, like the novelty of a straw (made out of glass, no less) during his hospital stay that reminded you of how old the book was. (Also the job Jimmy got at a newsstand was a job belonging to a different day and age.) But these things added to the charm of the story.We were genuinely sorry to see the story come to an end, and my son asked if there were a sequel. That shows how much he enjoyed it.

Who was that calling? A high tech feature like a redial button would have been nicer than the putzy two-handed menu button and line-pickup procedure.

What's worse than that is that inexplicably callers get cut off in the middle of their message. Also you can be assured that if line two rings while line 1 is taking a message the answering machine cuts off. Switching lines or using the built in address book is totally non-intuitive. It reminds me of the original calculators using reverse polish notation. (no slur intended) Normally, when one wants to make a call, we pick up the receiver and dial right? With this phone you must select your line, scroll through the address book to find the number you wish to call, go through the menu system and only then pick up the handset and it auto-dials.

For sure, implementing avenues of provocative innovation - open source research and expensive company training programs - is harder than it sounds.

Each resembles the findings of the authors during their long journey in search of new ways of doing business. The section on innovation is compelling. The authors also provide a lot of annotated references that by themselves are worth the price: the Appendix Maverick Material (20 pages) and the end notes (roughly 20 pages too).

The handset speaker-phone is excellent, and the sound via an optional earphone is as well. Unfortunately, the interface has some unpleasant limitations. If you don't have caller-ID, you'll probably avoid the address book. Entering names is painful, and isn't shared between handsets (or even the base). If you want to mix upper/lowercase letters, you'll be pressing the keypad all day, as it cycles through all of the options on each number (e.g. ABC2abc or even worse PQRS7pqrs).It would be nice if it answered when lifted off of the base, but that I can forgive.Our phones have worked well for about a year, and seem very reliable. They co-exist well with our wireless LAN (802.11g), and have a good range.

One had a bad static problem where you cannot hear the person at the other end of the line, and the other two headsets varied depending on how far from the base station you were. It is not clear to me whether it is a signal strenth issue, a channel interference issue, a bad headset, or a bad base. Either way, the troubleshooting guide makes no mention of a proper diagnosis of the problem (and of course, no proper solution) and AT&T tech support hasn't claimed that they heard of this problem before.

Anyway, Eliana was a good heroine, her musician side helped to counteract the normal-female-heroineness of her.

The green toning balls are significantly larger and are too hard for me to hold, rendering them useless to me. The green ones are also hard, not malleable like my blue 2 pounders.

I urge Hollywood to do a remake of this movie, but this time, feature an (appropriate) all-Asian cast (like in Joy Luck Club), make it 3-hour long and focus on the whole story (not just the 1st half of the book like in this movie).

In other words, a lot of ground to cover.It was soap-opera-like at times but had some visually dramatic moments, too, capped off by a locust attack at the end of the film. That was astounding to view. Considering this film is over 70 years old, the special-effects crew on this film did a spectacular job.Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day and they don't disappoint here, both giving powerful performances. The only problem is credibility as all the Asians are played by Caucasians and some of them, like Walter Connolly, just don't look real. I'd like to see a re-make of this movie with all-Asian actors, not for PC reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it for being a MOVIE, not a representation of a book!","review":"This movie has major good qualities and bad qualities. First off, it makes no difference that the actors aren't Chinese because they were VERY GOOD! The beginning of the movie was very loyal to the plot of the Good Earth. However as the plot goes on, the movie strays a little. The movie DOES show cultural differences of American and Chinese society, however, the reviewer who thought that this was the importance of the book was wrong! The book marvelously illustrated the bond that a simple farmer had with his land, a bond that couldn't be broken through flood, famine, or riches. Whether the movie illustrates this theme is a questionable matter if you ask me. It is a classic movie and one that i include as a personal favorite. Like i said, it is a good MOVIE, not a good representation of a book. So most important of all, READ THE BOOK! It is excellent and few movies (if any!) are ever better than the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood memory!","review":"I saw this movie many times on TV because this was my Mom's favorite movie.

I figure paying a one time cost of twenty dollars for the locking fuel cap to continuously safeguard my fuel is money well spent.

I strongly recommend the 40-Day Prosperity Plan and suggest that the above-mentioned audiocassette be used in conjunction with this book.

This book would have been better if it were more character-driven -- the characters were stale and, for the most part, unlikable. The last 100 pages are laughable.

It's just that the writer has zero literary talents. What he should have written was an essay, debating very important topics of euthanasia, medical ethics and civic responsibility.

I've reread this one many times over the years. There's just something about the the way every characters story comes together to form the whole, gripping tale that hooked me. The way the past blends into the present, and all the twists and turns. Right up until the end. I found there to be some things/details missing (having reread it many times, you notice and wonder what happend to ____?) or intentionally left a bit vague, perhaps to allow one's own conclusions. Something to think about afterwards. In any case, I love this story and will likely read it again sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"It took me a while to finish this book...but it was worth the read.

This is a quality product that will definitely provide excellent moisturization to your lips. It contains pepperment, which has a tingling, soothing factor that many people love (although I personally prefer a non-minty balm). Also, the texture is firmer than many other balms (eg, Chapstick), so this is not for someone who prefers a soft lip product. Finally, this balm could be improved by inclusion of a sunscreen, which would reduce any further drying to the lips. Overal, however, this is a very good lip balm, especially for those who prefer an all-natural product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the price?","review":"It's the best chapstick in the world no doubt, but I'm from Raleigh and I can get this way cheaper in stores here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What crazy policies!","review":"What kind of company tricks you by listing their products such as burts bees lip balm at $.01 and then says there is a standard $1.95 per item on top plus another s/h fee.

I had to reapply at least a few times a day. The worst thing was that the next day my lips were in even worst condition than before the applications.

Even after listening to it over and over again for several nights, 6+ hours at a time, one might think I'd never want to hear it ever again, but quite the opposite! My particular favorites are House of 1000 Corpses, Dr. Wolfenstein, Brick House, Run Rabbit Run, and some of the musical pieces with signature heavy base lines. The Ramones and other tracks are definite bonuses. If you liked Hellbilly Deluxe, Super Sexy Swinging Sounds, etc you will like this one too.

I bought the CD before seeing the movie and was completely disapointed. I mean why would you want an album consisting of Rob and Buck Owens? After seeing the movie, which was rather psycotic and made Natural Born Killers seem like a family film, I was able to appriciate the CD a little more but it's still pretty much a waste of $15. Get it used after seeing the movie, it will definitly help you to appriciate whats on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie A Go-Go...","review":"Have yet to see the movie, but the soundtrack is very enjoyable. Very cool how soundbites from the flick are interlaced w/ the music, which includes everything from Slim Whitman, to new tracks by Rob that are awesome. The music is Zombie all the way, and you can see some of his influences for the movie just by listening to the disc. They range from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to all the classic cult horror movies of the modern era. If you know horror you'll pick it up right away. Rob Zombie has probably made one of the scariest movies ever produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves much to be desired","review":"As much as I enjoyed Rob Zombie's directorial debut House of 1000 Corpses, this soundtrack is very lacking. It features five new songs from Rob and a cover of \\"Brickhouse\\", all of which are decent tracks that are more than worth a listen, but most of the rest of the soundtrack is sound clips from the film. While it puts a smile on my face to see a good 'ol Ramones song on here as well, this soundtrack is primarily for hardcore fans of Rob's solo work or die hard fans of the film. In either case though, it would have been great to see some other bands on here as well, and I just couldn't help but feel cheated if I paid a full list price for this. The House of 1000 Corpses soundtrack isn't bad, but wait until it's in a bargain bin to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My God!!","review":"I loved this CD.

There are a few good Rob Z toons on it, especially Brick House 2003, but, that is about it. There are no long, moody-spookie tracks on it, the isolated clips are trite, and I could have lived without the Slim Whitman and Buck Owens.If you are hoping for another Rob Zombie album, this is not it.

I also like the fact that Mr Zamoyski doesnt use too many military terms to explain the strategies of both armies.His account is very clear and easy to follow.His account of Tsar Alexander was very truthful and sincere,describing Alexander as he was,a wimp when facing Napoleon,at least during this campaign.

These CDs also line up songs of vastly differning quality, forcing listeners to constantly adjust the volume, and in some cases, just advance past the unlistenable cuts.It is very cool to have this much Jelly Roll, but I would have traded quantity for better quality. Of course, we are talking about five CDs for [$] which is quite the deal.If you must have everything by Mr. Morton, this package is certainly comprehensive.

The list is very long. He has been called the \\"British Don Robey\\" and is so reviled in London he has to have a bodyguard. Beware JSP records. It's a shame this man gets away with what he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but....","review":"I agree with the two previous reviewers. Morton was the first great genius of jazz and this five discs contain his finest recordings in the best available sound quality.I have just one proviso. Like RCA, this set omits some of Morton's Victor recordings of the period. Two sessions with the dreadful clarinetist Wilton Crawley, and two sets of accompaniments (to Lizzie Miles and Billie Young) are missing. From outside Victor, the 1928 Johnny Dunn and Levee Serenader sessions are also absent.None of these sessions can compare with the 1926-30 Red Hot Pepper sides, but Morton fanatics such as me will want them. They are available on the Masters of Jazz set (who have so far issued Morton's complete recordings from 1923 - 1934), and the Victor titles only are available on the French RCA release.Competists will,by definition, want everything.

But Dr. Laura can't get along with her Mom, so she just bends that one enough to where She doesn't have to follow it but she pretends that its ok for her. That is a terrible example. She thinks she doesn't have to get along with her Mom, and she won't even talk to her...for something like ten years now. She says in her book that .... the commandment doesn't say you have to \\"love you parents\\". If she had bothered to read the New Testament she would have read about a great Jewish man named Jesus who when asked, ... which of the commandments is the greatest.... He answered....

I find the book straight forward in its content. It clearly points out our divergence from morality just to make us feel good. This book clearly gives you the tools and the foresight to follow the laws. Yes, it is not an over-night conversion but it shows the gap we have made. One thing I like about Dr. Laura, she does not claim to be innocent, only human.

She gently slides reminders or placeholders in strategically keeping the reader turning pages. This technique, mastered with the Vorkosigan Saga (MORE, Please), makes Bujold's works a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"What can I say about this book? It's absolutely wonderful. I've read it time and time again and never plan to let it go. The main character is an intelligent humble man brought low by circumstance who is led by the gods down a particular road that brings him into mystery, political intrigue and romance; where he is used and abused by supernatural beings but somehow miraculously comes out on top. The book itself would make an incredible movie. Some of the scenes are iconic and one of a kind. My only wish is that McMaster Bujold would write another story featuring this character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong in places, weak in others","review":"For all that some Bujold fans swear by her prose and dialogue, I found it spotty in places, enjoyable in others. The style is very much the same as her SF novels, which is fine except that occasionally it is jarring in a fantasy setting. Perhaps the exeptional praise I saw here elevated my expectations to the point where it was going to be hard not to be disappointed. There a seceral really enjoyable scenes and some really witty exchanges, but I a;so found some parts tedious and a little on the amateurish side. In my opinion, Bujold is a much better writer of futuristic fiction that of medieval style fantasy. I await her return to the Vorkosigan saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving","review":"Not really a book for true fantasy fans: no magic, no swords, no enchantment. Plenty of court intrigue if that interests you but the book made me yearn for classic fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles in sheepish clothing","review":"LMB does reluctant heroes well. Certainly Miles V. is one of the better ones in the SF genre. But it's getting old.Despite \\"reader\\" reviews that sound like they were written by the advertising department of the publisher, I can't say this knocked me off my feet. I mean, it was enjoyable, but again, it annoyed me to see a standard set of Bujold characters reclothed and set forth into another genre. Is SF not profitable enough? It's sad to see authors diversifying without love for the writing, as if the books they produce are part of stock portfolios.This is certainly a readable book, if you don't mind seeing Miles in another form. I hope that LMB will seek to expand her repertoire of characterization in the inevitable sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful stuff!","review":"Bujold proves to the hilt that she is an amazing author even without Miles Vorkosigan to kick around. Glorious, amazing, character-driven writing with scenes of breathtaking power. Buy this book, and then clear your calendar for the next couple of days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle price more than paperback?","review":"This review has nothing to do with the book/story itself just that the pricing is more for Kindle than Paperback. I will not be buying the book because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I bought this book because I had just finished Bujolds's Sharing Knife series and enjoyed it. Since this book has higher ratings than that series, I was looking forward to it. But I had to force myself to slog through the first 40% of the book. It picked up after that, but was still only an okay read. The book is a standard sword and romance medieval-type fantasy. Even the main character is not well-developed and all the other characters were worse. The only characters I could reliably identify after they hadn't been written about recently were the 2 villians and the 2 main women. And those women were indistinguishable from each other. If this book had been much shorter, it would have been much better. The best part of the book was the well-developed religious beliefs, which were interesting and unusual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Miles, but still worth reading","review":"Its not Miles and its not Science Fiction. It is another Bujold book to read and enjoy and it does show that she is able to write other than Science Fiction. A thoroughly enjoyable book with a new hero set in an entirely different universe. I expected to be disappointed in this book as I am not really a Fantasy reader but I found that once I had started it I couldn't put it down. There were no fairies or elves, but there was a well thought out religion and environment. Cazaril our hero is a man who has seen a lot of life and just wants to find somewhere to sit quietly and hide. Instead he finds himself in the spotlight - the only man willing to try to save Iselle from the curse that hangs over her family. Read the book. I guarantee that you will enjoy it. It's a well written powerful story. As I said it's not Miles but it will certainly fill the gap until the next Vorkosigan novel arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great bujold story","review":"Just read this from the library, now I have to get my own copy, since I'll be re-reading it from time to time. I've read every L.M. Bujold book I could get my hands on and have loved the miles series, but this was a nice change. It was still up to the excellent standard of story-telling of everything else she's written though. I find myself either laughing out loud or with tears in my eyes (or both at the same time) more often with her stories than any other author. I can't recommend them highly enough. Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written a pleasant surprise","review":"The story is excellent. The writing wonderful.

I find the Chalion/Ibra/ 5 Gods Universe very attractive. My husband was wondering why I was listening to a book with so much terrible pain for the characters. This made me think - One reason I love Lois McMaster Bujold is that her heroes meet realistic and horrendous dangers and they might be overwhelmed for a time but they grow and come back to fight harder the next time. They give me hope. It is okay to fail sometimes as long as you don't let failure stop you from trying again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy world breathed to life","review":"The Curse of Chalion (print version) is a favorite read but hearing it read aloud let me pick up nuances in the story I had missed.

I loved the characters, flaws and all I became wrapped up in their lives. While I was listening everything around me disappeared. The Authors descriptions say so much in so few words. The story just picked me up and took me along. There are such strong relationships between so many of the characters it seemed to add magic to the story.I would have to say this story is now up there my favourites of all my listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tortured man endeavors to a great task","review":"This is the story of Caz, a soldier who was sold into slavery after loosing a war. The book starts as he walks home, injured and beaten. Caz just wants to live a quiet life, but instead he is drawn to protect a princess and lift a curse.\\"Curse of Chalion\\" is a wonderful story of personal growth and sacrifice. The author does a wonderful job of building sympathy for Caz, and building him a robust and believable personality. I particularly liked his flaws.Engaging, exciting, and emotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Curse of Chalion - Lois Bujold in a new Universe","review":"As usual Lois Bujold's latest book, \\"The Curse of Chalion\\" is tightly plotted and beautifully and sympathetically written, with believeable three-dimensional characters. It is a fantasy, set in an area not unlike 15th Century Spain, but with a very different theology. It is written from one point of view, that of Cazaril, sometime page, sometime soldier, sometime commander of a besieged castle, and, most recently, sometime galley slave. Like all her heroes he has the ability to play the hand he has been dealt - and to make wry observations, to himself and others, about it. A short review should not risk spoiling the plot for readers, but I shall tantalise with one most Bujoldian quote:- \\"...utterly indifferent to wealth.\\" \\"No, I'm not,\\" Cazaril assured him earnestly, \\"I just dress badly. I quite like wealth.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting adventure, with humor","review":"This book is a wonderful story, featuring a new fantasy world and peopled with new characters. Usually I prefer the author's Vorkosigan novels -- but this book was great! The protagonist, Cazaril returns destitute to Valenda, in rags and injured after escaping as a galley slave due to betrayal. He is given a position as tutor to the princess Istelle and her companion Betriz. The intrigues, strategies, and divine intervention make a lively and interesting story. But this story has more than a good plot. Unlike a run of the mill sword and sorcery, here the characters are richly developed and the story is laced with humor. Parts of the book are very funny indeed. I read much of this book while stuck in an airport. I couldn't stop chortling, even though my fellow delayed passengers were giving me some strange looks. Buy this book! You won't regret it, it is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"A slow start, but it still held my interest due to the characterization and how well written it is. Not really a sword and sorcery fantasy tale, and not a grand epic(I mean that in a good way- it's a more personal tale and it is wrapped up very completely in this novel). The protagonist, Cazaril, is an interesting and complex character, but definitely not an invicible warrior. I empathized with Caz throughout his journey, and enjoyed the philosophical and theological struggles that accompany his many challenges.If you've liked other books by this author, you'll probably like this one a lot. A better tale than her prior fantasy novel \\"The Spirit Ring\\", imho.Fun, compelling, and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven","review":"Imagine showing up to an opera house expecting an evening of Gilbert and Sullivan when suddenly the orchestra starts playing Beethoven. That's what reading this book was like. I have always loved Miles, but it was definitely more in the category of light reading for me. Imagine my surprise when I start reading \\"Curse of Chalion\\" and it's not frothy and pithy at all, but a hard-slogging, coherent, well-thought-out fantasy world. I actually remember thinking \\"No, really...who actually wrote this?\\" But then I started seeing the sparkle that Bujold does so well in the characters' interrelationships, and with that ability to make you feel what the characters feel without going overboard into schmaltz. To see an author make a leap in writing skill like Bujold definitely has in \\"Curse\\" makes me happy for both of us: I get more great fantasy reading in the near future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but a very good showing overall","review":"Summary: excellent original fantasy (a rare commodity these days), good writing, and highly worthwhile. I like L.McM-B's writing, partly for her effective use of humor in serious stories, her characters, etc. This book is very different from the Miles V. books in some ways, similar in others. The hero is operating from a position of incredible disadvantage, but does well by being a decent and thoughtful fellow. And there are lots of serious \\"important\\" goings-on. But the gentle humor of the Vorkosigan books is missing, this is somewhat heavier in tone. And it is really slow to start; I nearly put it down. But, once it gets going, this is an outstanding example of the fantasy genre. The theology/philosophy assumptions are detailed, critical to the story, and thought provoking. Caz, the main character, is as memorable as Miles although less easy to relate to (for reasons I won't share for fear of spoiling the story)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rousing Spanish-style fantasy--nice break from the Celts!","review":"Cazaril is a terrific central character, with all the aches and pains of a thirty-odd-year old over-resigned to his mortality after his escape from years of brutal hardship. An excellent portrayal of honor--and the prices and rewards. Normally I don't go for over-determined religion in my fantasy, but here Bujold makes it work, even sing.The texture of the countryside is well done--I could have used a little more, but that's not where Bujold puts her focus.This book is sure to sweep up many of the SF & F rewards this year--it's that strong in what was sadly, in 2001, a somewhat weak year."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree--its about the 'turn'","review":"This book's strength is that the author was present for this historic timeframe and his ability to recount details and nuances of character of the Amercians and Russians involved in the negotiation process.

This one does one thing; takes great movies. I have tested many of these economical alternatives and the Point And Shoot takes the best low light movies out of all of them.

Not a good idea unless you carry a laptop also. The video sharing program must install on the host computer.

Something flexible would make a lot more sense for versatility and be less fragile. The shape is also completely non-ergonomic.You'd think by the reviews that this was a miracle machine.

Well this is very true but they do not mention that you need Quicktime 7.0 or later to play your movies.This means you must be running a newer version of Mac OS X (i believe later than at least 10.3) to download this Quicktime version. I was able to find a work around by using a Media playthat played AVI movies, but er the quility was not as good and the sound was delayed and echoed.Eventually I was able to find a converter that changed the AVI format to a Quicktime movie format and it worked great.

I did not want them to use my expensive Canon camcorder or any standard tape-based or DVD-based camcorder because I knew these camcorders would not hold up to the rigors of my kids. These camcorders have no moving parts (other than the buttons). Even the zoom is electronic so the lens does not move. This fact makes these camcorders a cheap solution for a simple-enough-for-kids, and rugged little camcorder they can use to do their video creating. Just remember these camcorders have no image stabilization so the videos will have more jiggling than usual, and their low light capability is rather poor.

Of the original album's 10 songs, 5 are interesting, 5 are rubbish. The interesting ones are the opener The Bitch Is Back (a nice up-tempo song for fans of Saturday Night's Allright), Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me (one of Elton's best ever songs), Stinker (a nice bluesy rocker), You're So Static (another good song, but like Bitch, the live version on Here & There is superior), and Ticking (a somewhat pretentious album closer). Of the bonus tracks, Pinball Wizard, the Who cover from the Tommy movie is a worthwile song also. The other bonus songs are decent if not spectacular. If you are an Elton John fan this belongs in your collection, but make sure you have some of his other albums first."},{"rating":"2","title":"I DON'T CARE!","review":"I don't care if it was a rushed album. I don't care what the critics think about it! In my opinion this album was better than 2low4zero which I see has a 5 star rating. From \\"The *** is Back\\" to \\"Your So Static\\" you find a great selection of \\"fun\\" songs! Who cares about the lyrics to \\"Solar Prestige a gammon\\"! He never claimed to be a philosipher(sp?). The song was written for fun and should be accepted that way. If you listen to the first six songs with that understanding, you'll find yourself in the same \\"fun mood\\" Elton was in when he recorded them!The only \\"stinker\\" on this album was aptly titled. But even his greatest album, \\"Goodbye Yellow brick Road\\" had \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\" and \\"Social Disease\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bitch is Back","review":"Caribou is a much criticised Elton John L.P. mainly because it came inbetween his two biggest records, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Captain Fantastic. This however gives an unfair reflection of the albums merits. Caribou is an excellent release focusing purely on the balding pub pianist and his backing band and containing some great unrecognised Elton tracks. \\"Pinky\\" is one of Eltons best album tracks along with the mad \\"Solar Prestige a Gammon\\" and \\"You're so Static\\" it accumulates a great array of piano based rock and pop. The main track on the album is of course \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\", what can be said for this, possibly Elton's finest .AND LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT \\"The Bitch is Back\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Key Elton","review":"After the bombastic Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Caribou makes no attempt to match the previous album's power. Instead, Elton makes a very low key album symbolized by the ballad \\"Pinky.\\" Perhaps influenced by the cold winterland where it was recorded, Elton makes an album here that seems like it was designed to be listened to in front of a roaring fireplace, with a glass of wine or two. Fans that expected more \\"Benny And The Jets\\" were undoubtedly disppointed, but fans of Tumbleweed Connection and Madman Across The Water can find a lot to listen to here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans can never be objective...","review":"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...This like \\"Don't Shoot Me\\" isn't consistent, but again has four songs that rank among Elton's best...Pinky, The Bitch Is Back, Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me, and Stinker.

In Q & A format, the topics range from the specific to the historical, which includes a brief biography of Sayyid 'Abd al-Bari Shah. The book also includes a brief biography of Shaykh Azad Rasool (written by Shaykh Rashid), a glossary of Arabic words relevant to Sufism as part of the text, several pages of notes in the back to explain concepts and give citations.

However, this is a very mixed bag. There are moving sections, as when she describes the genocide perpetrated against the native peoples by Europeans (you would not believe the atrocities and torture they visited the Indians, whom they considered lower than animals - much worse in its ferocity than the Holocaust of WWII). The writing can be quite bad at times (at one point, her powers of description comes up with a fruit she tried, \\"bitter as semen\\"). But the worse is, she seems to be a very bad science writer and researcher. Who edited this book? Certainly not people versed in science or Portuguese. She gets everything in Portuguese wrong. The scientific names and terms are often misspelled. Proceed with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching for Wholeness in the Unknown","review":"Sy Montgomery's Journey of the Pink Dolphin book is the most beautifully written and insightful scientific \\"read\\" I've encountered this year. Not only does it relate biological facts, geological history, and the current problems the Amazon basin faces, it is also a hilarious travelogue, full of adventure, national history, folklore, questions and dreams. Color photographs record the abundance of life in the jungle where beauty and danger twine around every view. In each chapter, Montgomery immodestly seeks to find meaning, strength and purpose in her own life. As an armchair adventurer, Journey of the Pink Dolphin greatly enriched and inspired my life as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey of the Pink Dolphins : An Amazon Quest","review":"I approached this book with the enthusiasm of a scientist wishing to discover something about the elusive pink dolphin.

In this way, Burgess creates a fascinating and engaging lifestory of the young provincial man who became the greatest playwright of our language. While clearly a novel, it manages to make real, palpable people from those faceless names of the Elizabethean time, and helps makes sense (or nonsense) of so many of the theories surrounding Shakespeare's genius. It's vividness shows Burgess as a master of both academia and imagination. A thoroughly good read, and a must for anyone remotely interested in Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Robin Lane Fox's book \\"The Search for Alexander\\". The book was very interesting and informative and the photographs were outstanding.

I have also read Mr. Fox's books \\"Alexander the Great\\" and \\"The Making of Alexander\\". I have enjoyed reading and re-reading all three of his books.

Somerset was homosexual and the emotions that Philip expresses throughout the novel are autobiographical. Taken in that context, the novel is an interesting \\"self-discovery\\" piece. The non-sexual Mildred and his utter disinterest in the voluptuous young girl at the end further this theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic that you won't soon forget","review":"This is one of Maugham's first novels, which he wrote in 1915. Partly biographical, this book follows the journey of a sensitive, interesting and smart man named Phillip as he seeks to find his place in the world and discover love and passion. I found this book compelling on many levels; plot, characters and the searching for the answer motif, that is a signature of Maugham's.Another point I rather enjoyed, was that you can observe from the beginning to the end the growth of the author as a writer, which is parallel to the growth of Phillip. Maugham has a crisp and classic style of writing, but his characters and plot is modern...this rare combination also serves this book well.Well worth the money given and time spent for a forgotten masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional kaleidoscope","review":"This is a very long novel; it does not feature too many dialogues, nor does it have any action that would be faster than an angry turtle.

Sometimes there aren't words to describe a classic piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trapped","review":"After reading the preview on the back of the book \\"Of Human Bondage\\", I was hooked. It spoke of a young man who would answer to the beck and call of his woman even after she used, tormented, and abused him. I wondered what type of man he was. Was he sympathetic and caring or weak with no self-control? The book kept me on my toes. As each new woman was introduced, I asked, \\"Is she the heartless one?\\" Throughout the novel, the main character, Philip, is searching for his position in life. I think people are able to relate to Philip because most readeres have struggled with difficult choices at one time or another. At times, I did not agree with the choices he made, but in the end, it all worked out for te best. Because the reader can see into Philip's thoughts, it clears up some questions about why he thinks the way he does. Overall, I believe W. Somerset Maugham wrote an excellent novel. It portrays a real human being who feels and acts in the same manner that most of us do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid book.","review":"Phillip is a very genuine character who lives and loves, exults and suffers, learns and grows. He has talents and faults and his life is nothing extraordinary, except that he is so compelling to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"One of the most compelling human portraits ever sketched. Through Philip Carey, Maughm paints an unforgettable picture of human emotion. Whether or not you like Philip, you will undoubtedly identify with his core issues. If I could have just one book on my deserted island, this would be it. A word of caution: Maughm's narration can at times move a bit slowly. I suggest reading this when you are not pressed for time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story lightly peppered with breathtaking sentences","review":"What makes this story so powerful and beautiful? It's the combination of a great story, vivid characters, messages about life, and a gentle peppering of poetic sentences. Maugham simply told the story. He forced nothing. This is one of those books that can change your life when you're looking for answers. By far it's my all time favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absorbing Work of Art","review":"Maugham's classic tale of a boy's coming of age and earlyadulthood is a masterpiece. Philip, the protagonist, isportrayed with empathy and realism. Philip's doomed infatuation with Mildred, the centerpiece of the book, is completely absorbing. Maugham's treatment of the nature of love and attraction is fascinating and provides much food for thought. This book haunted me -- I felt totally involved in Philip's obsession and despair. The book's resolution is satisfying and uplifting. This is a sensitive and unforgettable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am glad I stuck with this book.","review":"The first 50% of this book was slow and hard to get into. I have reading rules, however, so I stuck with it and I am really glad I did. I LOVED the second half. There are many kinds of human bondage. Philip experienced life in Europe in the early 1800's with a club foot. He lost both his parents when he was very young. He was tortured by unrequited love. He experienced life in many realms of social class including becoming homeless and destitute. He had a moral conscience although he debated giving in many times he remained true to what is right. Great ending. In all, a very satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Human Bondage As Book And Movie","review":"Of Human Bondage was first published in 1915 and that version of the book is much longer than the abridged edition that was approved by the author. I suspect that this might explain some of Philip's sudden revelations and insights. I just finished reading an old Pocket Books paperback edition with a \\"new\\" introduction by Somerset Maugham in which he explained his motivations for writing this book, I found this to be very interesting.This was a reread for me after many decades on the shelf, I felt it compelling then and I still feel the same.If you enjoy classic cinema, please view the 1934 movie \\"Of Human Bondage\\" with Bette Davis as Mildred in one of her best performances and Leslie Howard as Philip, an unforgetable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"I have heard so much about this novel over the years, I figured it was finally time to find out what all the fuss was about.

A tender examination of the flawed nature of man, showing the glory of human life is not in success, but in the struggle for meaning, forgiveness, and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped reading 150 or so pages in","review":"Some people really love this book, I found it tedious without a clear plot or relatable protagonist. That being said, I wouldn't continue reading it so perhaps it picks up and gets really awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and brilliant","review":"I had been recommended to read this book for some time before i actually read and i'm thankful i did, in fact i now think it would have been a tragedy if i had gone through my life without ever having read this briliant book. \\"Of Human Bondage\\" tells the story of Phillip Carey and his awkward journey through childhood, teenage angst and adulthood. The story is timeless and anyone who ever felt alone in the world, lost and confused will relate. The passages about being bullied at school and the inherant awkward trials of being a bookish and shy teenage ring true a century after they were written. I thought that the delusional ambitions and subsequent suicide of the character Fanny Price were one of the most moving passages i have ever read in litrature. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants litrature that engages the heart and mind thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"Describing this book as clearly written is more accurate than declaring it as profound or deeply probing. It's quite an easy read and that is not a mark against it; the lucidity made me not mind reading a book which was honestly not very engaging. I thought Philip petty and he floats through his life as blown by a wind from orthodox Christianity, to Parisian art, to a \\"respectable\\" profession, finally settling down with a woman he does not love for a life which is far from the searching adventurousness which he once fancied all with the stoic spirit of, if it gets to hard, I'll just commit suicide. The disengaged lightness of tone in Razor's Edge works much better than an aimless wondering through writing a novel. I did not find this book inspiring (but it wasn't bad either)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult, depressing, hard to read...","review":"I know, I know, everyone speaks of what a classic this book is. And I must admit, when my book club decided to read this book I was initially pleased, as I really liked Razor's Edge. But of all ten of us in the club, only one finished the book!I got as far as page 394, so I really did try. But I kept wanting to give Philip a shake, tell him to \\"get over it\\" and get on with his life already. Mildred was a perfect pill, and I was quite annoyed with how she abused his faith and love. The other characters were, for the most part, either one-dimensional, or unlikeable.I know I'll most likely get slammed for daring to say this, but I just didn't like this book, and I was not the only one. It was just too depressing and full of despair. Avoid this unless you like a hard slog through the muck of sadness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tad disappointing","review":"This started okay and was interesting when the boy was growing up.

Anyway, it's a great book, long but not overlong, a true bildungsroman, if I can be permitted some pretension. Fun to read, magnificently written, populated with memorable characters, a great story-arc...y'all bibliophiles can't ask for much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't get discouraged...","review":"The beggining to the middle of this book is actually quite dull, but the middle to the end is excellent reading.

The time when Phillip (protagonist) is in dire poverty is probably the best part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Lifeless","review":"A dull, lifeless work mired in traditional, outdated musicology. Little of the revolution in musicological thought, including social, cultural, and philsophical approaches has impacted this work. Interdiscplinary aspects of music and other arts largely are ignored.To consider Western classical music as disconnected from science, sociocultural influences, and not intimately connected to art and literature, is a travesty. This is very old school and therefore best avoided, unless one likes traditional encyclopedias (even Groves is better than this). Someone needs to overtake this franchise completely with a new work worthy of the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"the publishers rake it in on this","review":"The book, though a fine book, is simply overpriced. The book is used primarily for students who are music majors. It is a very good marketing ploy for the publishers to rip the students off with this material. A student could probably buy a cheap car for the price of this book. As far as the content goes, it is extremely detailed and often difficult to follow. In short, this book is not worth the pruchase.

When I want more detail about a period or specific composers or styles, then there are numurous more detailed books available. I have found it comprehensive in coverage, informative, easy to read and containing enough information without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. I believe there could be more on 20th century composers/techniques, but given the scope of music development for that period, I believe a more dedicated book should be used. I must agree that as a general student text book, it is rather pricey; sadly the CD's are also very useful and NOT cheap either.

I really loved the intimacy captured in the interviews, and the sencerity of effection they have for those they come in contact with. You really see not only Rhett and Link's search for Ms. Locklear - their 1st grade teacher, but the unfolding of the cultural issues of a nation of people. A people that Ms. Locklear belongs to - so she is no longer just a teacher, but someone with influence and power to effect the lives of those around her.

Gary Reed's paintings are Hawaii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty in the sense of the word.","review":"His realism is superb in the classic sense. He is one of very few artists who can capture intricate detail with shade and color. His paintings are so true-to-life that it sometimes takes a second look to realize that they are actually a work of art, and not a photograph. His subject matter, often scenes of the Hawaiian Islands, holds great meaning for those of us who live here, and he's one of the very best interpreters of our state's beauty. This book gives Gary's fans a fuller appreciation of his art, and the work that goes into the paintings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Recommend It","review":"It is so simplified and child like, an intelligent memory challenged adult might be offended or hurt.

More \\"Look to do this or that\\". Much of it is vague. Lists over 20 indicators to look at, suggestions on what to look for, but there are no examples or charts. It reads like a general overview of his investing philisophy or a primer. You won't come away with any new techniques. The main theme is don't buy and hold, there are times to go short and look at the big picture.He does touch on cycle theory and Elliot wave briefly. He list many sentiment and breadth indicators to look at or calculate. Some can be gotten through data services, others you have to calculate by hand from data from sources like Barrons.

If you are committed to wealth creation, if you are willing to do the work and are open to other's opinions, then read this book. Harry does not preach the merits of technical analysis; he presents the history of market action, correlates it to technical indicators and lets the reader accept or disregard the evidence. He also challenges the \\"Ameri-central\\" view of geopolitical and geoeconomic events and activity, and further challenges the reader to seek the most accurate information on which to base decisions.

I cut out a circle the same diameter as the crystal and slapped it on....it works great. I wear it everywhere. Anyways check out the watch you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch, bar the Crystal","review":"This is the Great watch. I have it from seller in the US. I am just wondering why all Citizen watches in the US market will not come with Sapphine crystal. What is the big deal? Still this watch is still fine on my wrist for almost a month. But like other have said, it will be bullet prove if it comes with Sapphine. The price is a big bonus too. In my country the cheapest one (of course, Sapphine one) will cost US$850. But I bought it on web at only US$300. What a hugh different!! Very happy with this great watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Everything is marvelous about this watch, accepts the alarm. They say that it is accurate within five minutes, but I find it more close to 15 minutes off my intended time. Also, shop around. If you can wait a couple of days you can get it for around $300. Less than the $450 I paid for it on sale. Anyhow, the titanium is really nice because it makes the otherwise bulky, heavy watch much lighter than stainless steel. But, whatever... it's a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW ,WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WATCH","review":"I just recieved this Citizen beauty, And I must say that I\\"m blown away by its Awesome Design and the fact its so well madethis is my Second ECO I have the Diver Version which is AwesomeThis will make a Beautiful Every day watch, As well as a great dress watch...........Amazons Price on this Item is the Best on the Internet......If your Thinking of buying this watch and getting away from watch batteries forever, You will be making a very wise choice, Enjoy.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, WOW","review":"Just returned from a trip to Germany. I was looking for a cronograph and ran across this ECO drive. Overthere it lists for 695.00 Euros, on Amazon.de I found it for 585.00 Euros wich is equivilent to $ 850.00. Yes it may have a saphire cristal, but 400 dollars more, insane.I ordered it while I still was in Germany so it would be at my house when I returned, from the good old American \\"Amazon.com\\" and Amazon gets five stars from me too.As mentioned by others, the watch is very light, but the glass and the guts have the normal weight, but it is OK and not bothersome. Oh yes, it keeps time too and the 12 hour cronograph is what I was looking for.Happy and smiling,John."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch at the best price I could find anywhere.","review":"Great looking watch, and I shopped around for the best price for about three weeks before I ordered from Amazon.

Returned product for a full refund. It is a shame. A very nice watch otherwise. But for $450, I don't want to have to worry about my watch breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I really like this watch. It gets some attention, and is fun to look at. I have another Citizen Eco-drive, and so this was a pretty easy sell. It is very lightweight for the size. For me, getting used to the bigger watch wasn't too big of a deal. I'm 6', 230 lbs, and have a large frame. I think the single biggest gripe I have about it is the fact that it isn't a perpetual calendar. I should have paid more attention to that 'missing' feature. Since my other Eco-drive does have that feature, I really have come to rely upon it. You basically set the date one time and it knows the month, day, leap year, etc. With this Calibre, although it's more than twice the price of my other Citizen, it's lacking that feature. I didn't realize this until I bought it. I can honestly say I may have purchased a different watch, if I had known I would have to fix the date every month. That is so annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, sporting looking watch","review":"You've seen the other positive reviews on this watch (and they are merited), just a couple other fyi's. The head is probably larger than your neighbors watch (45mm will look larger than 40-41mm) and a couple guys tried on the watch and thought the head was a little heavy. For me, I'm comfortable with the size now and having the titanium band made the watch significantly lighter than my last one. A couple other things: the alarm sounds great and is easy to use...but is hard to get more than about 5-7 minutes accurate (the red alarm hand is pretty short). The Chronometer buttons were pretty stiff at first, but their starting to break in. Finally, the date does need updating every other month...but that's only 6 times a year and a chance to play with the watch. Enjoy a great looking, functional watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"An \\"earthy smell\\"?","review":"That usually means something else roundabouts these here parts.

However the book doesn't demonstrate any improvements on the original story and there isn't anything really substantive in the first book other than the promise of an emerging author finding his voice. This effort just felt like something quickly put together, stuffed in an envelope and then sent to the publisher. The series' potential is wasted by laziness and apathy. I think the book holds up well enough as a sequel to the first, but sadly that isn't granting it a whole lot. Camp fiction fans might like this in the same way they to watch bad horror movies on cable. Serious horror fans, who are attuned to the intricacies of Anne Rice et al will be as receptive to this as one is to pofessional wrestling or tractor pulls."},{"rating":"1","title":"A small one","review":"This book is awfully trash, the first is readble but this one stinks, the main caracter sucks, he's not a man but a type of Rambo, or better an antizombie conan and rest...the rest are simply the rest...the end is horrible, i will pray to god for this trash never seen the light on film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case study on which writing mistakes not to make","review":"This book is useful for creative writing students in determining what sort of pitfalls in plot development, characterization, and mechanics to avoid. I'm judging this based on subjective elements that make a novel worthwhile to me; my viewpoint apparently doesn't apply to everyone, given some good reviews I've read about this work. I'd consider any work that gets published as a \\"draft\\" an ambiguous blessing to its author: on the one hand, it's a milestone, on the other, the remaining bodies of a writer's work will be judged on the first impression. Genre books will always find an audience, and this book (and its companion novels) fall solidly within that category. This story is engaging and works well but needs serious revisions to the aforementioned elements to be considered \\"good\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombies","review":"This book had a lot wrong with it. It's like reading some nonesense that people post on their web pages for fun or something. Everything about it insulted my intelligence.

Apocalypse End is more akin to a wad of bubble gum that you notice on your shoe AFTER you've tread on the carpet. It starts out assuming that you already know what's going on (so, yeah, it's a sequel, but most sequels are written well enough that people can infer what happened in the previous book even if they haven't read it). Then, it turns into some kind of Rocky Horror Picture Show meets Night of the Living Dead knockoff pile of last Thanksgiving's dinner that the dog ate.One of my friends thought it would be fun to try to read this aloud at a party. Lucky for us, we had plenty to drink beforehand and I think he made halfway through page 3 before he was booed to silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was supposed to explain","review":"But it adds to the confusion. Also, there was a promise of an explanation for the zombies but now one must wait for another book to find out the beginning. I also think that the new characters needed to curse more and sound natural, it's as though the writing was censored. Also, I think there was some hint that the zombies ran fast and were smart but they weren't supposed to in this one, either -- maybe they will be in the next one but I don't want that, I like the slow kind when I read -- I don't even like thinking about fast or smart zombies. I don't think it's worth trying to get involved with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sequel to a great book","review":"I loved, I mean, LOVED Reign of the Dead. It was non stop action, suspense, and suspended reality. I felt like I was living that book as I was reading it. I don't know what happened with Apocalypse. I was expecting more of the same, but instead of a Romero style zombie story, it got really complicated and started to remind me of that movie The Postman more than a horror book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rate higher on plot only","review":"The plot to this one is good. I like a lot of the ideas; gets back to the old adage that people have more to fear from other people than \\"monsters\\". But, it was hard to give this book good marks because it was written amateurishly. The book deserves a re-do, but I wouldn't buy it twice. Publishing companies should take more pride in what they put out, this book was really sloppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong presentation for anyone over 14","review":"Clean up the atrocious editing (which also means bad writing -- I don't believe the adage that the author has creative license to abuse the language), and this might be a decent young adult/preteen horror novel.

A normal person's life turned into a living hell. This book is truly a masterpiece. I coudn't take my eyes off the pages.

It isn't quite as good as the first but it is a good novel nonetheless. I thought that it could have been longer than what is was but, the storyline is solid, and the action is great. Len Barnhart is a horror master. He is one of the best Zombie Horror writer out there.

Its lid opens in one swift motion, exposing a pure wooden cavity that yearns to be filled. The base of the box is perfectly flat, too. I rest it on an otherwise bland table and it seals to the surface. Suddenly my entire living room seems to resonate with songs from an angelic choir. It is, after all, the tooth fairy box made for kings.Also, as a 21 year-old, I lost several teeth to a frozen flying squirrel (long story), but after using this box I was refunded with more riches than I could imagine.

The bad guy, in this case Richard Gere, challenges the good guy on several key areas of his macho identity: Who is the smartest, who is the best lover, who does the women prefer, is he stealing MY woman? And the predictable happens- all us stupid boys/men in the audience are drawn in as we identify with the \\"good guy\\".This is Internal Affairs in a nutshell. The plot is incredibly primitive, based on the macho competition between Garcia and Gere's characters. Nothing interesting happens, it's all totally predictable.

In this movie you'll find a ridiculous looking alien, bad acting, hillbillies who are drunk 24/7 and a couple of sleazy women. This thing is a hoot, something you'd see at the drive-in or in the old days on TV at 3 a.m. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5, is I actually like Don Dohler's \\"The Alien Factor\\" (another bad/good movie from the same director) a little better.

Chip outlines the characteristics of God and splashes practical vibrant insight into how these characteristics, when properly looked at and applied, can radically change your life. Trust me when I say that you will never look at God or his relationship with you in the same light again after reading this book.

Mothers have a bond with their children that transferring legal rights to raise the child cannot break. When a mother loses the right to raise her child, however, the child and mother suffer. The \\"genetic bewilderment\\" that Brodzinsky talks about, for instance, is something I experienced firsthand. Only after reading the term did I know how to articulate the pain I've always felt.

I for one will always have a clear spot in my heart for Rose Melberg's voice, not mention her underrated and substantial gifts for crafting beautiful pop songs. \\"Me and the Bees\\" is perhaps the most haunting song The Softies have done--and this is saying something. It has a resonance and subtlety that characterizes the album as a whole--and it's clearly the standout here. (Not to mention it's the first Softies song with drums). I love this stuff. What more to say? Buy copies for your friends, your friends' friends, their enemies, and their enemies' friends' friends. The world will be a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disposable Bird Feeder","review":"I like these feeders because they look good for platic feeders, the birds like them, they're easy to clean with a hose sprayer and they're plenty durable for the price. After 18 months or so when they start to look too worn you can throw them out without guilt that you didn't get your moneys worth. They do hold up to being chewed on by the squirrels but if they fall any distance, pieces will break and fall off. They work fine (if not better) without the port covers but the perches will become too loose after a couple of re-attachments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice feeder","review":"I think the perches need to be extended completely for the little birds to be most comfortable, but other than that, it is working well.

She absolutely loves both and seems to have no complaint. I really love how it's actually Tim Allen's voice (the Woody we got is not Tom Hanks' voice...). I haven't had any issues with anything breaking, but we've only had it a few months, and my daughter doesn't really play with it that rough. Overall I think it's great, although I do have a few of the same disapointments that some other reviewers have expressed, namely that the his helmet does NOT, in fact, do \\"that WHOOOSH thing\\" that they made such a big deal about in the movie. He doesn't have quite all the bells and whistles that they show in the movie, but overall he's pretty great and my daughter loves him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son wouldn't put this toy down for a week!","review":"My 2 year old son loves the movie Toy Story. His friend had the Buzz Lightyear toy and when he was at his house that's all he played with. He would even ask to go to his house to play w/ Buzz Lightyear. So we bought the toy. He did not put this toy down for at least a week! He ran around the house saying, \\"Buzz Lightyear flies!\\" The action figure does a variety of movements. The only annoying thing is that the wings are constantly falling off & I have to constantly put them back on. I believe the box says this is so they won't break, but I don't see what would have been the harm for them to be permantly fixed on. Oh well, hopefully they won't get lost. I also wonder why the toy doesn't say, \\"To infinity and beyond!\\" That being said, this is a very fun toy and I highly recommend it for your Buzz Lightyear fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very effective","review":"This is my first try at using HG weed.

She fills the book with useless information (i.e. she writes an in depth account of a cover of a book her brother brought home one day and then wonders what it was about.

I called the company that makes them and they did not have any suggestion as to how to make these work. They told me to return them to the company that I bought them from. Well, my husband threw away all the information because he was frustrated so now I have these plastic things that are worthless. I don't recommend these to anyone. If the company would like to contact me and do the honest thing and let me know either now to make them work or how I can get my money back, it would be nice. I am sure this won't happen.

The sticks which came with our set were much smaller than the slot for them, so they float up out of the slots at strange angles.

I kind of wanted to get this review out there ASAP. Product arrived. I went to open it to wash it before putting it in the cupboard... and within 3 seconds of unpacking it from the box I cut my finger pretty badly. The slots on the 'lid' (where the sticks go through) is very sharp aluminum. Knowing this, as an adult you will probably be fine using it. However, it's popsicles and most of us will enlist children to help. So beware of this part. Note -- the metal on the popsicle mold side is not sharp."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept","review":"The popsicles that come from this are great shape and size.

Getting the sticks in requires using metal binder clips to keep the sticks from sinking into the mold before freezing. So if you buy this product make sure you have an equal number of binder clips. The binder clip situation didn't bother me too much, however, trying to get the molds out did. What you don's see in this picture is that under the blue top, there is a thick sliver metal plat that the molds rest in. Trying to pop the molds out of the metal plate is a whole other store. It's a fight trying to get the molds to pop up with the sticks. It's not an easy task at all. I do not recommend this product. In fact, I will be looking for new molds myself. I will probably donate this product to the Goodwill and hope I don't cause any poor soul to curse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.

I purchased this item from Amazon.com because I wanted a way to make low calorie/fat treats for the summer. It works as described. Compared to other similar devices, the pops are more substantial in size, permitting you to incorporate pieces of fruit that can make the treat more interesting. It has an aluminum top that lays loosely onto the plastic mold. This top includes slots that hold popsicle sticks in place while the pop is freezing. I don't know why this part isn't plastic also. The results are very good. There are two \\"tricks\\" to using the device successfully. One is to let the pops partially freeze before inserting the sticks. This lets you control placement so the sticks don't sink/fall all the way to the top end of the pop. The other trick is to run warm water over and around the entire assembly to release the top and pops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dishwasher Safe?","review":"Watch out! The metal in this mold is made of brushed aluminum -- which isn't dishwasher safe!My husband gave me this popsicle mold for my birthday, and I was thrilled. The first set of popsicles were just fabulous -- I didn't have any problems with getting the lid on or off, and the treats popped right out after running the mold under some warm water. We stored the popsicles in plastic baggies for later consumption and then put the mold and its lid in the dishwasher to be cleaned.I was completely dismayed when it came out -- the metal had darkened, with strange streaks and discoloration all over. Hopefully we won't end up with metallic residue on our next batch of popsicles.There is no indication on the product's packaging that it needs to be hand-washed, but I guess it does.Otherwise, a great product, but buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money - Or Buy Mine for Cheap at Goodwill","review":"This popsicle form is pretty much useless --> Impossible to get the popsicles to stand straight (and thus be able to take the top off to get at the popsicles) without constant babying.> What family eats 10 popsicles at a time?

I really like that each of the pop cups can be removed from the mold for cleaning, though actually getting them out is a bit of a challenge. Mold size is appropriate, not too big or small (as I've seen some complaints about with other molds). The only other issue I have is with the sticks. If they are not perfectly straight into the mold, then the metal plate will get suck on. One great tip I found to prevent this from happening is clipping binder clips onto the sticks to ensure that they stay straight in the mold while the pops freeze.All in all, a great purchase for some yummy summer treats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Massive struggle to fit popsicle sticks into top!","review":"Re product received on July 11, 2012:There are many reviews here about popsicle sticks fitting loosely in the top and floating up during the freezing process. The manufacturer must have tried to correct this problem by making the holes more narrow. Now the problem is that the holes are so narrow that many of the popsicle sticks that CAME IN THE BOX with the product do not fit!! I discarded several that could not fit, and was able to finally get some in, but it took a lot of effort.It was also something of a struggle to get the top off once the pops were frozen. That said, once the pops were finally out (run some hot water over the molds for 10 seconds or so), they turned out very well.The good thing about this mold is the portion size -- each pop is about 3 oz., which is a nice size, in my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond bad","review":"These guys are TERRIBLE!

Several spots where there were duplicated blocks of paragraphs in the same chapter.3. Many inappropropriate spelling errors.4.

I've been through numerous copies,( and lent not a few of them out to friends, never to see them again), but that's what a great book like this does, makes the rounds and gives so much to those who have the good fortune to chance upon it. The people who inhabit the world of Strongbow, O'Sullivan Beare,Haj Harun and the rest are so alive with their dreams that they can make a lesser man feel mundane and useless.

We lost the directions immediately, so I'm still not sure whether a sequence has to be three cards or four, and the dragon action cards are a bit vague, but it comes in a very cool tin (that I anticipate outlasting the card game), and once my daughter gets the basic gin game down, I think it will be fun.Oh, and I forgot to mention: the cards smell really weird!

She has one of the most textured and nuanced voices in the business, and this album is the perfect showcase for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Remarkable","review":"For years I only knew of Jennifer Warnes through her top 40 hits. While getting into the music of Leonard Cohen, I heard Famous Blue Raincoat and my appreciation for this artist dramatically increased. And while I enjoyed The Hunter, The Well touched me far deeper. Her voice is as clear, expressive and nuanced as ever -- The Well has the same level of excellence as she displayed in Raincoat. The musicianship, arrangements, and recording are excellent too. The musical styles are varied and rich in this album. In the songs she co-wrote, along with the covers, she displays a remarkable emotional range. Yes, this is a truly remarkable album. As good as Raincoat is, this may be her finest release ever. And yes, I think it's also quite remarkable that the CD is out of print. I bought my copy used . . . and it was certainly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as hard as you think...","review":"I always wanted to know how to make my own soap.

Catherine Failor does an decent job of explaining the transparent soap making process. There is a lot of useful information.

It covers safety and equipment that is necessary to make homemade fireworks. It walks you through begginer projects and then on to advanced projects. All of the projects require something that you created or learned in an earlier project. It takes you from making black powder up to making arial shells.

If you want to learn the technique of kriya yoga, you'll get a recipe for disappointment. Schmidt doesn't teach technique at all. He muses and rambles in a soft-headed, soft-hearted way, about a lot of New Age Old Hat amalgamated with quasi-Christian notions. If you're a member of Schmidt's immediate family, by all means, buy it. Otherwise, try The Sacred Science by Paulsen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of seasonings but no meat","review":"Recipe for Bliss certainly conveys the many inner experiences and insights one gleans from a spiritual path, but for the seeker of knowledge Schmidt's prose proves to be more cryptic than clarifying. If you are serious about learning technique this book is not the one to buy. Kriya technique itself is probably best left to those who are the original disseminators of this meditation path , namely Paramahansa Yogananda's Self Realization Fellowship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carl Schmidt doesn't know anything about Kriya Yoga","review":"This book is a complete waste of time and money. Carl Schmidt doesn't know anything about Kriya Yoga and his ignorance is fully reflective in \\"A Recipe for Bliss.\\" Mr. Schmidt has no valid lineage, no guru, no realization, and no clue about what he's blabbing about. This book is all New Age hype. Carl is just like a scavenger, an eclecticist who would pick an idea from this and that book, this and that website, glue them all together and put a \\"Kriya Yoga for a New Millennium\\" tag on the finished product. It is obvious that he got his \\"Kriya Yoga\\" from the counterfeit \\"Kriya techniques\\" that has been circulating in the Internet. He is teaching by the virtue of an alleged vision of Jesus and Yogananda. Wow! What a credential! This book is pure garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follower of Teachings of SRF","review":"Having followed the teachings of SRF for more than 20 years.

However, the class turned out to be my favorite (the teacher certainly helped) and I'm keeping the book after the semester is over. Reason and Responsibility contains essays from the greatest philosophers (and some not so great) in order to give the beginner a comprehensive overview of philosophy.At times, the essays were edited so that parts of the original selection were omitted. I had difficulty writing papers which criticized certain arguments become some claims can only be made from the entire text. However, if you are just reading this for fun as an introduction to philosophy, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great philosophical read!","review":"This is a great book for understanding philosophical ideas and arguments. This book has a collection of many writings from well-known philosophers. If one wants to get an idea of others' views or even question their own, this is a perfect read.

This book of short stories bears little relation to Saunders in either style or substance.

The very fuzzy photo of the DKNY label above, if it were legible, would mention that the items on offer here are the CONTROL TOP version of the tights.

I've seen many tv performances and I'm always amazed at his vocal deliveries and beautiful melodies. I must tell you that this cd does not do him justice! I've listened carefully to each song and none have jumped out and grabbed me as I would've hoped. This purchase has been a big disappointment. Though there are strong messages and many upbeat songs, they seem to lose power and interest before entering the choruses and the melodies seem to stray. You can easily identify the typical studio mixes (pressed out) and indicate they are quick mixes.I do have another of his cd's on order and I hope to find some different songs that I can put on rotation. I do enjoy listening to his strong vocals but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This is a deck to have!It has been a long held belief that Tarot originates from Egypt.

VERY WISE CHOICE I have to say. Not only did she love this video, it helped her to understand more than I could explain and it got her excited! I am a parent who does not hide the graphic nature of life to my daughter, but this video was not very graphic. It shows the uterus and vagina with diagrams and cartoons and it shouldnt be offensive or innappropriate to parents with a more sheltering approach. This is an A+ video if you are trying to explain birth and becoming a sibling to your younger child. I also purchased a book for her \\"Being Born\\" -very graphic, VERY educational, also worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing - no more \\"shoulds\\"","review":"I went through a very difficult time a couple of years ago and stumbled across this book. It was nothing short of life changing for me. It taught me to really listen to myself, to better trust my intuition, to accept what *IS* and shed so many of the \\"how life *should* be\\" attitudes.For example: \\"Gee, I'm a horrible parent because I want to work outside the home.\\" Well, no, I'm not a horrible parent because I want to work outside the home. I'm simply a parent who wants to work outside the home. Some people in society have labeled it \\"horrible\\", but do *I* deem it \\"horrible\\"? No, I don't. So I don't let it bother me any more.Use your own standards to judge yourself, not \\"society's\\", because different societies have different standards. The Zen approach in the book is interesting, but fundamentally for me, the book is about how to love and accept yourself as you are and to stop putting societial labels on every thing you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Will Lift You Up!","review":"I bought this CD for my seven-year old's birthday. He has listened to secular rock with me for years, and I felt like we needed something else to listen to in the car, and I knew that both my kids liked praise songs from church. Wow! I also bought him a CD player at the same time, and I have been amazed how much he chooses to listen to these songs, over and over and over. We all sing to these songs, even my Pearl Jam-loving husband! I've never been one to listen to Christian rock, prefering either true gospel or secular rock. I love this music and the sound of my son singing to God. I may order another one just like it so that my twelve-year old will have his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD","review":"I just can't stop playing it in my car stereo. It is okay.

Van Creveld, himself a veteran, writes with an engaging style, if not overly technical in some places. The book was originally written in Hebrew, so some words unique to the language will slow down a lot of readers. Van Creveld also translated (and transliterated) the book into English himself, so some spellings may be different that what a reader would normally be used to. The thesis and conclusions may shatter some illusions that you may have about the IDF, but they are completely accurate. A must read for anyone interested in Israeli history, especially recent history."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Jerusalem-based military expert Martin van Creveld","review":"Written by Jerusalem-based military expert Martin van Creveld (the only non-American author on the U.S. Army's required reading list for officers), The Sword And The Olive: A Critical History Of The Israeli Defense Force is a straightforward accounting of the history of Israel's army, beginning with its origins in the early 1900's when Jews fleeing Russian pogroms banded together for defense against hostile Arabs, down to modern day Israeli military clashes in Lebanon and against Intifada uprisings. The Sword And The Olive is confidently recommended as an exhaustively researched, soberly written, and unbiased account that questions whether the Israeli Defense Force has exchanged the role of the underdog David for the role of the powerful, arrogant, yet ultimately vulnerable Goliath."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY!

The Bolivian government is trying to get the help of the United Nations to change these idiotic laws. From all I have read coca leaf tea is completely safe, non addictive, and quite tasty, though I will have to go to Bolivia to see for myself because it is a felony in my State (and the other 49) and I have no desire to ever set foot in a prison. This is just as idiotic as hemp being illegal to grow in the U.S. even though it was a major crop for most of the country's history.

Bought this book and others and decided to look at Florida. We drove the entire state, investigating dozens of communities based upon features listed in this book. Sadly, the book is very outdated --- probably a given since FL is growing so fast. And the biases of the authors towards golfing and upscale shopping made their ratings of the various communities highly biased. What they liked, we hated.

I bought it and when I received it,about 10 dasys ago, and checked it there was absolutely no revision update anywhere to be found so it had to be from 1999.

You've seen _Papillon_. Maybe you've even seen _Captives_. What if you could find all the wrongful-imprisonment...road-to-freedom-ness of these great movies in something refreshingly different, something to equal the thrills of _Mission Impossible_ and the romance of _Scarlet Letter_?_Ice Runner_ offers all such pleasures. More like watching a well-cast British piece than viewing the oft-predictablility of so many big-run films, you'll find yourself swept away by the Siberian-earthiness and mesmerizing depth of these characters.You'll find the pace and composition of _Ice Runner_ to be enjoyably different, yet never inferior.But more likely than not, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat; it's a masterfully suspenseful \\"what's-next\\" with original and unexpected love scenes that you (and your Saturday night date) will not soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting insight.","review":"Douglas states early on in the book that this book is not a how-to on profiling. Such a task would be far too complicated to ever put into a single book. What Douglas does give us, with enough detail to make things interesting, is a number of examples of how profiles are used, and how potent a weapon profiles can be against criminals. There is an ego issue; Mr. Douglas seems very proud of his achievements, but the real pride seems to be for all profilers, and how good they actually are. At times this attitude can be a little overbearing, but it's understandable. Those expecting a lot of esoteric and hitherto unrevealed knowledge about specific cases are sure to be disappointed, but all in all, this book is a very worthwhile overview of the discipline of profiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed, I cried, I was horrified...and loved every second","review":"I found this book to be amazing, and I liked knowing what Douglas was like as a youngster, this helped set the tone for us to understand who he is and how he was suited for profiling. I am almost done with this book, will be passing it on to at least 2 others. I didn't find Douglas egotistical at all, I've seen him on shows and he is far from an egotist. I find him to amazingly still have some of the wonderment of a child, and still be able to know what evil lurks in the minds of men (sorry, it's a great phrase).Read it! You will love it if you aren't looking for a text book to show you how to get into the field and become an FBI agent. No way I could do that, even though I would love to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Douglas and his experiences will stick in your mind...","review":"I listened to this book on tape. Once you can get past Douglas' ego the information he shares is valuable and important to everyone that interacts with strangers on any level.

I'm not the paranoid type, but this book sure made me glad I never let my son out of my sight as he grew up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I WISH I HADN'T READ IT!!!","review":"This book became a parody to me. I have not been so scared since I was a child, yet I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, this is rigid confirmation that truth is stranger than fiction. This makes Silence of the Lambs look positively upbeat. It is a wonder that J.Douglas can function in society with the horrors he has seen.

It was well written, colorful, kept your attention, and was truthful, which is more admirable than jsut some guy blowing his own horn. Still, I would honestly say that Anatomy of Motive is far superior to this book. The writings in this book are more personal, and some may say that is better, but I like cold hard FACTS, which is why I read this stuff in the first place. Its cool to read about someone that is a pioneer in their field, but I would rather read about catching the bad guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"The positive reviews here and the promise of a good story enticed my purchase of the tapes. Unfortunately, this title was very disappointing. I found the reading insipid relative to the several stories of brutal serial killings.

His marriage broke up and he had a stroke from the stress. I have read all of his books and I loved them all. If you dont like that kind of stuff then you should read a text book. Because this adds life to a story. Its not just a run on of facts.I do not believe this was a \\"pat on the back\\" for him, I believe he wrote this to give us insight to that kind of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mind","review":"I think this is an excellent book.

Anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and VERY disappointing","review":"From the reviews I'd read about this book, this was a must read. After chapter 4, when he still hadn't mentioned anything of significance but his life growing up, I had to REALLY struggle not to close the book and either send it back or put it in a garage sale and charge nothing for it.

Entertaining, well written kept me turning the page. Super informative and one of the best books I have ever read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual and Unsupported Conclusions","review":"I was enjoying this book and accepted that it's primary focus was on the author until about page 117 when he writes of his interview with Charles Manson. He concludes \\"I believe that he (Manson) did not plan or intend the murders of Sharon Tate and her friends.\\" pg 121. Then he states \\"If he were released...I wouldn't expect him to be a serious violent threat.\\"These conclusions come with no support but his impressions from his interviews. Mr. Douglas does not address the evidence from the trials that supported that the murders were done on Manson's orders. Nor does he provide any further evidence to support his conclusions.From that section on, I read with some skepticism and became concerned about what appeared to be a degree of \\"admiration\\" of the criminals, serial killers, and rapists about whom he reports. It is also interesting that he discusses cases about which he had little direct participation.Odd and disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about Douglas than actual profiling","review":"The book is more about Douglas' ego than about profiling. Also, from attending a number of Vernon Geberth's seminars I have come to realize that Douglas laid claim to many cases that he did not solve. To take credit for cases he did not solve is rather pathetic. As stated this book and his other books are just wars stories that many homicide investigators around the country discuss and teach. To learn how to profile read Brent Turvey's book, Criminal Profiling: An Introduction to Behavioral Evidence Analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far so ok? I guess...","review":"I think I made the right choice of reading this book after reading Whoever Fights Monster by/about Robert Ressler of the FBI who held John Douglas' job before him. Mind Hunter seems to be the same book but in a slightly different style and it really seems to be written only to try and capitalize on the success of Whoever Fights Monster's success. WFM's was a good read, this, not so much... This is sorta blah... bland... Probably because the good stuff was already in WFM's, but I do think it's worth reading if you are into stuff on the FBI and/or serial killers."},{"rating":"2","title":"good when focused on crimes and not author","review":"I was not enamored of the early part of this book in which the author describes his life and training.

It started a little too much about the guy but got going and then took off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a biography of the author ??!?!","review":"My God, talk about wanting to throw a book against the wall. I wish the author would shut about how wonderful, elite, fantastic, etc, he thinks he is, and write more about actual case work. What a self-indulgent load of you-know-what most of this book is. I picked up to read casework on serial killers, and ended up getting a stomachful of more-than-I-care-to-read than the minutia of his biography. I see he has written a number of other books that I would otherwise find interesting. I'm just afraid of more crap like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Hunter: The Auto-Biography of John Douglas","review":"NOTE: 110 people gave this book 5 stars, so clearly many people liked this book.If you have read every serial killer book and are bored with individual killers, this book might be for you. Douglas really takes the opportunity to tell his life story. The prologue and first few chapters are entirely a personal account of Douglas' life. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't expecting him to tell about the pros and cons of playing defensive line on his high school football team for 2 pages.Seriously, it's that detailed about Douglas' upbringing. Additionally, it's nauseatingly braggadocio. He tells a story of how he completely astonishes some serial rapist by revealing intimate details about his personal life during a group therapy session - and I had to shut the book and walk away from the ridiculousness of it.I would have given this book 2 stars, but nobody reads those."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have in any True Crime Library","review":"One of 4 or 5 books I call a must have, and one of two on that list by John Douglas. This is probably Douglas' second best work behind Journey Into Darkness, but since it was his first effort, it can be forgiven. Douglas is quite simply not only a genious when it comes to profiling criminals, but also a genious at putting you into his shoes and helping you right into his mind. I've read Ressler (one of Douglas' mentors) and Hazelwood, both of whom wrote similar books, but neither of them at their best match the readability of Douglas' worst efforts (but this isn't his worst).This is an excellent text on the myriad of cases and situations faced by an FBI profiler when profiling was in its infancy. Douglas truly shows his genious when describing the cases, his thought processes, and the results.Though Douglas does tend to pat himself on the back occasionally, he does so sparingly, and, well, deservingly. After all, he was the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I'm a psychology grad, and I found this book to be very fascinating and easy to read. It's been a couple years since I've read it when my father had it on loan from the local library, and I am truly excited to see it available on here. Since reading this book, I've seriously considered going back to school to focus on forensic science. If you are curious at all about why people commit serial killings and what the FBI does to track them down, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"As an avid reader of suspense, crime, and mystery novels, I found this book to be extremely fascinating and educational. John Douglas' very readable novel relates background information on some of the countries most notorious serial killers and how the FBI Behavioral Science Unit played a role in identifying and capturing them. What fascinated me most was his ability to figure out \\"details\\" of a serial killer's persona and life with only minimal amounts of information. Highlighting one serial killer after another, each with their own \\"personality\\", he takes the reader on a morbid, educational, exciting tour through the killer's mind. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look into the mind of a serial killer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for the book Mind Hunters","review":"I really expected something different. I thought it would be more on profiling and crimes,and was very disappointed when it was pretty much all about John Douglas's life story and never really spoke much on acual crimes. I did not enjoy the book at all. So unless you want to read a biography on John Douglas I wouldn't waste the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Subject Matter, Annoying Storytelling","review":"The book itself is not bad. Not great, but not bad. It provides some interesting facts about serial killers and the growth of the profiling unit of the FBI. However, Mr. Douglas' constant \\"gee, I am so great\\" references are very annoying to the reader. He seems to think he never made a mistake and that he can profile any criminal with about 3 pieces of information. As we all know now since the sniper case, profiling is very difficult, and takes a great deal of time, even if you are very good at it, as Mr. Douglas is.In short, if you can stomach Mr. Douglas' arrogance and self-aggrandizing style, you will find this book interesting. If you are like me though, his constant tooting of his own horn will dramatically reduce the quality of your experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"If there were only more John Douglas's........","review":"Everyone keeps talking about his ego...well, if I could do what this man does...I'd surely have an ego problem too! He is great at what he does and deserves to think highly of himself. He catches the lowest of the low that walks this earth, so I think everyone should just except his greatness and read his books and enjoy them!!! I did! He is a wonderful writer, as well as a profiler! Besides...he helped catch the sick man that murdered an innocent Shari Faye Smith that lived no more than 15 minutes from me...Thanks Douglas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative... Keeps you hooked.","review":"Describes the true side of serial killers/rapists. Not the Hollywood side. More in-depth than any I've read. Profiling brought into the light. A must have for any True-Crime reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for parents!","review":"John Douglas does a brilliant job explaining profiling and how we can be more aware of our surroundings and those who may do harm to loved ones.I was a volunteer in the child protective service system and this book enabled me to view profiles of parents and better understand their potential for changing their behaviors. This book was added to the foster care suggested reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracted and anecdotal, but interesting nonetheless","review":"I was disappointed, sometimes confused, with the structure of this book, which attempts to involve us both in John Douglas's life and also examine general case studies. It attempts to reveal intricacies of Mr. Douglas's life, yet wasn't nearly as specific and detailed when discussing his interviews with serail killers or his specific case work. The authors would have done well to either focus on Mr. Douglas's human experience or describe profiling in detail. Instead, we get both in a series of interesting anecdotal crime stories peppered around Mr. Douglas's life story. It lacks both linear focus of case study and in-depth autobiography. This book will be of interest to those looking for an overview of profiling. The book attempts to cover all aspects of its subject, spread itself thin, and is therefore a hodgepodge rather than a tight, focused read."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Kind of a Drag!\\"","review":"Serial killers are interesting; so is the search for them. John Douglas' personal life and childhood history are not. This title is spoiled by the interjection of Douglas' ego into every account of investigations in which he participated. Mr. Douglas' work is to be lauded; it speaks for itself. It's a pity he had to air his ego in print; otherwise, he would have written an interesting tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"All ego and little substance.","review":"What stands out most in this book is that the author has an ego that is bigger than the state of Texas. Some parts of the book are interesting, although it would be much better if Mr. Douglas could focus more on the functions of the Serial Crime Unit and less on his accomplishments."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIndhunter...John, dump your ego.","review":"The book in itself, that is, when there was interesting facts about serial killers and how the FBI solves crimes, is actually very good and interesting. The parts of this book I truged through was Mr. Douglas and his ego tripping about dating and joking around though school etc. Certainely could have lived without that. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to finish this book as it did not hold my interest. I probably will not invest in another one of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"After reading Britton's book on criminal profiling i was so fascinated by it that i bought this book...and it's terrible. I started reading it but stopped after some 30 pages (it might get better..who knows) because it was merely a description of the author's life and --damn--that is boring! plus it's really self-indulgent. My advice is to get Britton's book (Picking up the pieces)it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-Numbing","review":"Mr. Douglas should have spent less time thinking and writing about himself, and more time researching the cases he supposedly \\"worked\\" on.He makes numerous errors in the information he provides on various cases. I'll point out just a couple:At one point he speaks about \\"Los Angelos' Zodiac Killer\\" - a small amount of research would have shown that Zodiac was in and around the San Francisco Area (Vallejo, Presido, Lake Berryessa). He also states that New York's Son of Sam spree was exactly one year from July 1976- July 1977, this also is incorrect.Unless you're looking for a biography of John Douglas, save your money. There are better books out there.If I had a way to put down 0 stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this book","review":"I believe this is my second John Douglas book and although I enjoyed the first one, this one was rather boring. I still haven't finished reading it. Douglas put too much of his own personal life in this book and as always he likes to praise himself , things I don't care for. He jumps around too much in this book and it sometimes get's confusing. If you like John Douglas don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Hunter","review":"The book takes way too long to get into the specific details of how the FBI's elite, interesting unit investigates and solves crimes. Instead, the author uses the book as a means of illustrating how much of an expert he is and goes into boring details of his upbringing, with unnecessary stories of how atheltic and tough he is. Again, I felt that he used this book with the main priority to promote himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyingly Arrogant","review":"This book, is something of a journal in which John E. Douglas comes across as a testosterone-heavy policeman glorifying his career (and personal life) after the fact. It was interesting to read this book at the same time as Robert Ressler's \\"Whoever Fights Monsters\\" to compare the two. While both books contain similar information about the inner workings of the FBI and profiles of murderers, Ressler's \\"objective\\" accounts were refreshing compared to Douglas's continual self-aggrandizement. Through Ressler, we learn that many of the deeds for which Douglas claims credit were actually undertaken by Ressler while he was \\"breaking in\\" Douglas. Save yourself the annoyance, and read Ressler's book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I am the Director of Criminal Justice courses at Dodge City Community College, and I offer a course in criminology and offer a serial killer course. MindHunter is a required book for the criminology course. Douglas is able to explain psychological and criminological theories in a way that is easy for the average person to understand. Reading this book helps students apply the theories from the course to something they can understand. I receive positive feedback every semester from students who have really enjoyed reading the book.I met John Douglas a few years ago, and attended one of his seminars--his presentation on profiling was excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look into the Mindhunter Himself","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I love how he jumps right into the business of mind hunting as the book opens. Then he backs up for a moment to explain how he got to be in such a position. At this point he tells of his childhood and early adulthood, which is just as interesting as the work that he has poured his life into. As he gains more experience and goes deeper into his field, he takes the reader with him. He tells of mistakes he's made, lessons he's learned, friendships he's gained, and of the respect he's earned. I also appreciated his stories of his family; they added more of a glimpse into his off-duty life. Basically, he is a very entertaining writer, and he writes just enough about the ferocious crimes he's helped solve to explain what happened, who the victim was, and who could have done such a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"I recommend this book very much.

This book is terrible. The egotistical Edward Hirsch never tells the reader how to read a poem, but rather elaborates on his own relationship and reaction to each poem. This guy certainly gives the reader the feeling that he or she is an intellectual, but never allows the reader to interpret or break down a poem for themselves. Without a doubt the worst book that I have ever pushed myself to read. (Why didn't I quit reading it? Because it was summer reading! AHHHHHHH!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"rewarding","review":"I read \\"How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry\\" by Edward Hirsch as part of an ongoing study of the Psalms that I am engaged in (The Psalm are poems after all). Hirsch's book is oceanic. The waves of Hirsch's passion for the written word break again and again over the reader. It is not an \\"easy\\" book. Still, there is much to that can be taken away from these pages. My favorite image is that of a poem being a spell that is cast by its author (using this imagery, the Psalms are then spells cast by God through the hands of humans who are steeped in the raw earthiness of their experience--spells cast to bring future generations up in the training of prayer). The suggested reading list at the back of the book is worth the price of the book all by itself. \\"How to Read a Poem and Fall in Love with Poetry\\" is a great book that more than rewards the reader for their effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Indispensable Guide!","review":"This is one of the finest critical guides to poetry that I have ever encountered. Hirsch does more to explicate \\"the name and nature of poetry\\" than anyone I have ever encountered since the late Lawrence Perrine (Sound and Sense). For instance, readthe story of his first encounter with Emily Bronte's \\"No Coward Soul Is Mine;\\" it is typical of the way in which he moves fluently from his personal reaction to the effect of the poem on the reader. In this age of deconstruction and such-like academic twaddle, it is refreshing to find a writer who still believes that a pome DOES have a definite meaning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and Chocolaty","review":"I really enjoy reading Hirsch because he has a romantic love affair with poetry and his enthusiasm is infectious in the extreme.This is an excellent introduction to what poetry is and what it can do. Hirsch focuses on the romantic/spiritual side to poetry, his favourite poets being Whitman and Emerson.He does get a bit carried away with this at times and is best introducing new and obscure pots such as the modern Greek poet Cavafy.It is not the sort of book you read over three days.

Africa Addio is still one of the most powerful and shocking documentaries ever made, and is still pertinent (those responsible for screwing up Iraq should take note of its lessons). Distributor Jerry Gross took the original film, stripped it of all its historical context and political savvy, and released what is basically just a gross-out film under the more sensational title \\"Africa Blood and Guts\\".Blue Underground has released the uncut Africa Addio in its uncut version as part of the Mondo Cane collection.

Though Busy Signal... was better (I just had to point that out because that album is very good), this is great. I love how they mix aggressiveness with more subdued slowed down singing (but not in a wuss way, more of a cool way). There is much variety in the sounds of all of these songs, yet it is so cohesive that there is really no confusion of how or who these guys are trying to sound like. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool post-hardcore","review":"If you think that all hardcore sounds the same (which it doesn't) then you should try this album out. It is heavy, abrasive, uncompromising and unconventional. There are the occasional hints of melody buried within this madness, but the overall atmosphere is very dark and depressive (just check out the song titles) and this will put many off.

While the musicians are quite skilled, versatile players, the highlight of \\"Rock And Roll Killing Machine,\\" is Simon Brody's vocals, which deviate from the all-out screaming devised by most modern hardcore bands, and tend to utilize more melody, which is usually a disaster in most hardcore, but works great here. Brody is a skilled lyricist as well, tossing out vivid, disturbing lines like \\"We're in control, though losing blood through every hole.\\" While \\"Rock And Roll Killing Machine\\" does have it's shortcomings, (sitting through the entire thing, even at 28:39 long, is nothing short of exhausting) Drowningman will definately be band to watch over the course of their next few releases.

I contacted them about the outdoor temperature not being displayed on my unit and after 4 emails, they told me that they would exchange the item for a new one, but that I would have to pay shipping.

I finally decided to cut my loses and throw it out today since the main unit's battery just died. Looked like a good one if only it worked! Good brand, maybe I just got a dud.

The sunset/sunrise is off by an hour and the barometer is only right about half the time. After a couple of weeks the outside temperature stopped working, which was the part I wanted it the most for to begin with. After reading more reviews I realized that I am not the only one that has had the transmitter die shortly after purchase and they only warranty for 1 month, after that you are SOL. You would have to pay shipping both ways and only get a partial refund! Would be cheaper to buy a new one from a better company.

Description states 99 cities included. Great I figure it has to have either Milwaukee (metro population 1.5 million) or Madison (metro population of 300,000). Instead the only two cities they cover in Wisconsin are Green Bay and LaCrosse. It makes no sense to include those 2 cities but not Milwaukee or Madison. Both cities are over 200 miles from me.

Very irritatingly, it is very easy to accidentally set the alarm which defaults to 6am. I've been woken up several times by this \\"feature\\" after having picked up the unit to fix an issue.Finally after 18 months, the unit started to fail. I replaced batteries several times and it still didn't work. Contacting customer service is useless as nobody ever responds.

I read a lot of positive reviews on this product and just a few negative reviews and decided to take a chance. Big mistake. Received the unit and it worked fine for a few minutes, and then the display lost the link with the sensor while they were sitting just a few feet apart. This is a major inconvience because the batteries have to be pulled out and the unit reprogrammed in order to reestablish the link. With my previous LaCrosse stations, I had them at least a year before they started losing connection.Needless so say, this goes right back in the box within an hour of receiving it. This is the last time I will spend money on LaCrosse products.

Photography binds this brief novel together and Bainbridge revels in its historical and metaphorical possibilities. She organizes her chapters around photographs, which makes the reader immediately aware that she/he is to infer meaning from this practice and speculate on the role of photography in determing what and how we see and remember. Bainbridge is very sensitive to and aware of 19th century photography: its use during the Crimean War (the first war that photographs were taken of), connection to both science and magic, and the practice of post-mortem photography. The reader does have to work to explore the themes suggested by the author, but her historical grounding, lucid prose and rich subject make the effort worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIFE SEEN THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY","review":"It's difficult to know quite where to begin here, in the face of such overwhelming praise from so many satisfied readers. It's not that it's badly written, just that it fails to illuminate Master Georgie's life. That after all should be its purpose, particularly where, as here, that person existed and at least one of the events described took place. The author is content to conjure up others to act as prisms, which would be a useful literary device if they illuminated the central figure, but instead we see him through a glass darkly. I may be in a minority of one, but it failed to live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spare yet telling portraits","review":"It is amazing how some writers can blather on for hundreds of pages and yet be barren of memorable phrase or image, yet how a select few demonstrate the maxim of \\"less is more.\\" Beryl Bainbridge and her most recent novel Master Georgie surely fall into this latter category. Each chapter in this short (190 pages) novel takes its title from a picture illustrating its contents. This is an effective technique, as the photographic image provides both a jumping-off point for Bainbridge's particular scene and narrator (the novel is given from several points of view) and a framing device for the scene. I look forward to more of her fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"How does she do it? That's what I asked myself when I finished reading Master Georgie. The descriptions are compact, yet they bring the scenes to life so that I can see them in my mind. I love this kind of visual writing. Other authors offer long drawn out description that tells us nothing (see Cold Mountain) while Bainbridge hardly seems to be describing anything and yet shows so much. This book is completely absorbing. If it were longer it might not be as good, but because I like the writing so much, I was sorry to see it end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sisappointment","review":"The news of the death of Beryl Bainbridge last year made me want to read books by a very accomplished writer. In our book club we chose to read Master Georgie.This was a great disappointment. We should have asked for advice on what books to read. The book was nominated for the Booker prize in 1998, but did not win the award.While there is an interesting historical episode as the background, and there were different viewpoints, the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read. At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives. This did not happen.So need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of Beryl Bainbridge"},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly unengaging and boring","review":"I finished this book as fast as I could. I felt the author was on another wavelength to the reader. I didn't care that the story was about this Georgie fellow. He seemed peripheral and the written perspective on him oblique. The writing was good and I may try some other of the authors works but the plot was feeble. Try Pat McCabe's breakfast on Pluto for energy and a raw story or Ian McEwan's Amsterdam for a page turner with a plot of some interest.

Through stubborness and sheer ignorance, they end up making a number of expensive errors as they attempt to build their dream house. The story is narrated by their friend and lawyer Bill, well played by Melvyn Douglas, a cynical man who learns it's easier to just let them make their mistakes. Grant is the perfect actor to express the exasperation of the whole process. The man had amazing comedic timing, deceptively making it look easy. The script hits all of the potential problems with building, and the film is smoothly produced. This is the kind of comedy that will appeal to most people, because almost everyone has had the opportunity to experience the joy that is remodelling, landscaping, decorating, or building. There's something in here for everyone to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I teach design and wanted this movie for my class to enjoy.

Love the Color Enhanced Version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and timeless","review":"This is one of those movies that I watch every time it's on TV, even though I own the DVD! There's just something about it, when it's on, I must watch.Anyone who's ever built or even remodeled a house knows the endless mess and money involved. Amazingly, nothing's changed since 1948, and Mr. Blandings shows these trials and tribulations in an outright hilarious way.Cary Grant is a brilliantly charming comic, both subtle and broad--watching Grant is pretty much enough reason to sit through any film, but he's truly wonderful here. Myrna Loy is deliciously dry. The situations are both wild and totally realistic. And the movie is very, very funny.The scene with the painter is a classic--but so are many other moments.Martha Stewart has just chosen this as one of her picks of TCM (Turner Classic Movies) which is wonderful and ironic, given how the movie shows the price of \\"perfection\\" (and ultimately, its rewards)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious comedy","review":"Due to his daughters growing up Mr. Blandings' house becomes a little too small. By buying a nice old house in the country the problem seems to be solved; however, the house turns out to be a money pit. One downfall after another brings the family to the edge of bankruptcy. Nice old comedy starring Cary Grant as the ever optimistic (and somewhat grumpy) Mr. Blandings and Myrna Loy as his spouse that hasn't got a clue to what minor changes in the architecture may cost.Considering the movie is from 1948 it is remarkably sparkling as if it was made yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Blandings Is a Miss","review":"I'm an \\"old movie buff\\" and I find this to be a pretty awful movie. It's really full of the most simple-minded dialogue. See these great actors in something that's a little less polemical. The writers' social conservatism just jumps off the screen. You could use this for a Media Studies film to contrast with an \\"old film\\" from the same time that shows people living with much more self-awareness. Two stars only for the bright young daughters - great actresses!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny? Far from it!","review":"I bought this movie because of my girlfriend's recommendation. I told her that I loved the movie \\"The Money Pit\\" with Tom Hanks and she said I just had to get \\"Mr. Blandings Dream House\\". In all fairness, I did not finish seeing the movie to the end but came within a half hour of seeing the entire movie. Why? Because it was that bad...not even a chuckle. Even if the last half hour was rip roaring hilarious which I highly doubt, it would not be worth seeing. I love Cary Grant but this movie did not do him justice. The quality of the movie was excellent but who cares if the movie stinks. I don't know why other reviewers are giving it such high marks. I may be missing something but I'm not going to waste another 2 hours to find out what it was. Stick with \\"The Money Pit\\". It's the REAL \\"Dream House\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Talent","review":"Take a thin book to start, add two world class talents mix in a screewriter and director who clearly never built a house and you get this mess. The book was amusing and wry but the movie could never figure out what it wanted to be. The screenwriter's additions just made no sense; Bill Cole the lawyer as a love interest, (unbelieveable next to Cary Grant), a struggle to meet an ad deadline (with a racist ending that's painful to watch in the 21st century.) All these point to a group of people who didn't believe that the core story had legs, and went on to embelish it with distractions. If there was ever a movie designed by committee this was it."},{"rating":"1","title":"-- Wretched! --","review":"Look at it right side up, turned upside down, from the left side, from the right, or from the backside Ñ it will not matter!

Ellsworth Stubbins, the Great Man shines in his small role - displaying immediate chemistry with the one-and-only ZaSu Pitts. Too bad \\"Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch\\" was their sole film together.

Pauline Lord, well known on stage, sinks the ship time and again, but actually has a curious affecting -- and affected -- way about her. Fields, according to his recent bio, didn't think much of this and he knew his material.

But as it is, the lid bends because the first, positive-side-up battery pushes it out too far to meet the negative-side-up battery right beside it. You can solve this with a bit of tape at the contact or tape to hold the lid down (or both). But it really couldn't have been much more idiotic considering how simple this device is.

For roughly the same price, this Panasonic iron is much more satisfying. The iron heats up quickly and generates lots of steam. I wish the water tank was larger, because I use the steam button pretty aggressively and I can run the tank down after ironing just two items. The retractable cord works very well and which will prevent this iron from being pulled down on to my daughter's head.

This iron isn't perfect but I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dial already broken","review":"I have had the product for just a couple weeks and the dial has already broken. I was already not really satisfied with the iron. The placement of the dial made it difficult to read.

She wanted the same model but it was no longer available so I ordered the NI-C78SR. In the meantime, she had tried several other brands but did not like any. The NI-C78SR was almost exactly what she had. The only downside for my wife was that it was a little heavier but the steam performance, sole plate slickness and maneuverability is superb, beating out Tefal and Rowenta among others. She is very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great iron, but NOT for lefties","review":"This is the best iron my husband has ever owned according to him. It heats well, uses steam well, overall a great product. Luckily, he is the one who does most of the ironing in our home. I am left handed and it is absolutely annoying for me to use. The cord comes out on one side and can't be adjusted. It always gets in my way either when ironing or when trying to set it down upright. My husband (a righty) says no wonder it never gets in his way. I agree that it is a great iron, works well, no complaints (no leaking like others have mentioned). The retractable cord is also great. If the cord could be switched from one side to the other, it would get 5 stars.

After it reached desired temperature it turns off. So there is no way to tell if iron is off or warmed up to desired temperature2) Indicator light is obscured by the handle and is not easily visible.3) Iron tips over very easily (possibly due to having a cord storage reel)4) [Not 100% sure about this one, haven't tested enough] Seems like when iron is shut down after time out indicator stays off and there is no indication that iron is plugged in.Here is how indicator works on my old iron (and should work on any iron IMO): it is not lit only when iron is unplugged. When iron is warming up indicator is orange. When temperature is reached it becomes red. After auto-shutdown (due to time-out or tip-over) indicator blinks red until it is unplugged or righted.That being said iron performs well but these design flaws make it dangerous. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good iron, but not quite happy for why I selected it","review":"The retractible cord take some effort to use. There's so little room in the housing that you have to carefully feed it in or it will get stuck. In comparison, I have a rice cooker where you pull the cord, and it gets pulled back in without any further effort. The whole reason I bought this iron was that I don't like messing around with a cord in the morning when I want to get to work. Now instead of wrapping the cord in a ball, I have to mess with the retraction mechanism, and that takes longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 17 months","review":"Got it, loved it and then it broke after about year and half.

I bought this iron after my daughter complained that the iron I had was lousy. I bought the iron, used it once, maybe twice. I thought, great, I have a good iron for when my daughter visits. That was over a year ago. It hasn't been used since. Yesterday, I needed to iron my Thanksgiving tablecloth. I dug out the \\"good iron\\" and plugged it in. It did not get hot, then the light that lets you know the iron is on, would not stay lit. Essentially, the iron turns off right after it is turned on. Maybe a short somewhere?

Would rather have an off/on button.I've used my Panasonic iron once or twice a week in the 5 weeks I've owned it. It's been very convenient and has done an acceptable job. I love the convenience of the removable tank which makes it easy to empty after each use (which I didn't do with my last iron) It's comfortable to hold (not too heavy) and it steams very well. The heat settings (fabric listings) are located on the back, so until I familiarize myself with the chart it's a minor incovenience to know which number to set the heat on. The cord retracts very well if I do it gently. Reading the manual has made me realize the mistakes I've made with past irons so I hope this one will last awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor workmanship","review":"I really liked this iron at first, but after 30 days of use, the steam boost button stopped working, and that is the main reason for buying the iron.It is a good iron if you don't plan on using the boost steam button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine, but only lasted 1 year, 2 months","review":"This iron worked fine, but only lasted one year and two months.

So I went for this popular Panasonic model. In short, on the \\"silk\\" setting, the temperature of the soleplate varied tremendously, cooling to the point where I could comfortably place my hand on the soleplate before the thermostat finally kicked in to reheat. I could tell when the plate was cooling when the steam generation stopped and wrinkles didn't disappear. Even on the \\"linen\\" setting, when the iron was hottest, wrinkles in linen didn't disappear, even with the the steam burst. I had to \\"spray\\" the wrinkles, but the spray is a thin stream which just saturates the fabric in a thin line. IMHO, the detachable tank and retractable cord features are just gimmicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"The iron works great. It heats up quickly and holds its heat. I like the vertical steamer feature. It isn't as good as a real vertical steamer, but definitely works better than nothing.

Price is right","review":"I have lots of silk blouses that requires frequent ironing.I bought this iron to replace my 10 year old model mostly because of the vertical ironing function with jet-of-steam.

My older iron still works, but had some rust on it. That is why we got this iron. We loved the retractable card and how you could take out the tank to fill up the water on this model.

Someone at Panasonic really put some thought into designing this iron....I have only owned if for a few months now, I just hope it will last, but with the price I will just buy another one. FOLLOW UP DECEMBER 2012---After three years, this iron has some warts. It leaks a little and needs to be on 'high' for any heat.

The iron is fairly small but heavy. The color is ugly...seems rather poorly constructed.I will say that it was very easy to return the iron to amazon. And they are refunding the cost I paid as well as shipping for the product.

Honestly, they didn't look much better than when they came out of the dryer! It was not \\"Operator Failure\\" because I learned how to iron over 50 years ago!

It seems like a good iron for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron died after two years of average use","review":"I'm looking for a new iron because this Panasonic died on me after two years of use. It shorted and won't turn on anymore. The time, energy and postage needed for repairs are not worth it. I iron about 3-4 dress shirts and a couple of slacks every week. I use starch on my shirts and try to use distilled water whenever I can. The max temp is good enough for cotton shirts but not on linen shirts and sheets. The steam power does not match the professional steaming irons I've used as a child--my mom was a seamstress. You'll need a separate steamer for suits and other formal wear. The hotplate is pretty good at not staining compared to other inexpensive irons I've used. The removeable water storage unit is convenient. So there are some good things about this iron but overall an iron should not keel over after two years. Panasonic may mean quality in electronics and other things but not in irons.

This causes the button to poke uncomfortably into your hand the entire time you hold the iron. If you scoot your hand back on the handle, the heel of your hand will be resting on the cord retracting button.I am male with average size hands and the grip on this iron is too small and poorly designed for even short, occasional use."},{"rating":"1","title":"just died after only 3 years ownership","review":"I loved this iron while it worked, but just the other day it seemed to overheat during use. The iron got so hot it burned my ironing board cover and it was smoking a bit. I turned it off and when I plugged it back in it would not work.

For the price you pay, you are getting a well-made, easy to use iron, that has sufficient cord-length, and a handy storage mechanism for the cord. The only issue I've had is that if you live in a place with hard water, the self-cleaning function can leave some occasional debris on your clothes. After this occured I switched to using filtered water, and this seems to have fixed the issue. All in all, great iron at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product for your Shirts","review":"Basically I'm using this iron for my shirts and blazers.

An analysis of true masterpieces of storytelling and film-making, the authors use a multi-disciplinary approach to highlight the inherent Christian theology that can be found in the Matrix films. Not attempting to posit The Matrix as any type of alternate gospel, Mr. Seay and Mr. Garrett cite canonical and gnostic scripture, as well as mythological and popular culture evidence to support their thesis that Neo's \\"walking the path\\" can mirror the Christian believer's. A caution: not for the reader seeking a book that explores all the religious implications of The Matrix. This is an analysis based primarily on Christian beliefs, although other doctrine is included to support the point at hand. I applaud the authors for writing a positive, encouraging book on a film trilogy often dismissed by Christians when, in fact, we can see that our own faith is illuminated by viewing The Matrix films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable, it is a great read for any Matrix Fan","review":"When I first saw The Matrix I was blown away and this book is the perfect companion to the films. Seay and Garrett pack the book with information about the varied symbols and influences in these films such as anime, greek mythology, postmodern philosophy, gnosticism, budhism, comics, and of course Christianity. The discussion of both films make it the only book out that is current and timely. I am buying more for gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"Very inspiring work. Watching the Matrix films are now a completely new experience. If you are into philosophy and theology, this book will not disappoint. My only suggestion for an improvement on the book would be to touch on the 2nd and 3rd film installments a little more. But, nonetheless it is a very masterfully written book and would grace any bookshelf well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting ideas","review":"This book is a fun, interesting look at themes in the Matrix films from a Christian point of view. The authors never claim to know the true meaning of the film triology but offer insightful and thought provoking reflections on the film in dialogue with Christianity.Far from dogmatic, this book should stimulate further discussion and reflection on the Matrix triology and it's relationship to issues of faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHRISTIANITY COOPTS THE MATRIX","review":"This book really deserves two and a half stars. I give the authors credit for their more liberal slants on traditional christianity. That said, throughout its 2,000 year history christainity has played the role of mind control that the makers fo the Matrix movies are criticizing. A central theme of the Matrix Reloaded sequel is that the Machines are using the cult of Neo's messiahood as a mechanism of social control.However, this book misses that point and joins the current trend in christianity to coopt popular aspects of pop culture (as opposed to creating anything original itself) and misuse them to gain converts. (Christianity, like Walmart, always needs new customers.) For that \\"original sin\\", I docked the book a couple of stars. The authors seemed interesting and bright, why spend their time trying not to stand on the shoulders of the Wachowski brothers when the Wachowski brothers make movies that undermine the dogma of christianity?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, on the whole","review":"A quote from page 126: \\"A good steak dinner laced with strychnine is farm more dangerous than a clearly marked bottle, especially if you are hungry.\\"Anyone hoping this book will help them understand homeschooling should know that it is a pro-spanking, fundamentalist Christian tome and not even clearly Biblical. \\"Pain does teach!\\" and \\"Spanking is not hitting\\" take it outside the field of homeschooling, and perhaps Amazon should re-categorize it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly offensive to anyone not sharing her fanatical Christian views","review":"This book should have a warning on the cover which states \\"Most material in this book will offend non-Christians.\\" The author used what could have been a wonderful resource for homeschooling families as a soapbox for her own fanatical religious views.Because many families do homescool for religious reasons, I have come to expect a religious slant to most books on the subject. Most authors, however, are able to present the material so that their writing is able to relay useful information without infuriating the reader. If I wrote a secular homeschooling guide and ripped apart Christianity the way this author does to non-Christian thinking, I would probably have trouble getting it published and receive bags of Christian hate-mail if it were published.This one is going out with the recycling as I wouldn't want to subject anyone else. I received no valuable information from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I found this book very disappointing. For one thing, the author suggests a creepy method of spanking children, including a chart on the wall of the \\"discipline\\" to be administered with a wooden spoon for various offenses.

Once the pot is heated the glue melts making the hot plaque fall off onto the table, then the melted glue will continue dripping down the side of the pot into the flame permeating the air with a burnt chemical smell. It is obvious that this product was not tested before going to market but on the bright side, the plaque is (in my opinion) ugly so the fondue pot looks better without it.

It is clear to me which one Lou prefers.Given a choice, Lou Dobbs would not want a China like Japan, Singapore, South Korea, or Taiwan, all of which were ruled by a one-party state, became rich through trade with America, and are now pro-US.

Quest after quest to obtain some ridiculous goal, only to find yet other goals for additional quests. At times I thought the author was creating situations to add pages. While one could argue that the protagonist is unlike others of this genre, I found the hero to be moody, obsessed and contrived, and as unlikable as he is improbable. In addition, the leaps of logic required to follow this story are too much to keep this tale interesting. In the end, I found myself reading to finish the book, rather than out of enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"best game i ever played","review":"i had this years ago. i had so much fun with it i bought it again. it's a great game.it's a DOS game so i had to use win 98se to play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're in E-business, you NEED this book!","review":"Outstanding coverage of E-privacy from the political end as well as the technical end.

Now that Fripp has retitled his \\"Frippertronics\\" technique as \\"soundscapes,\\" it definitely adds a somewhat different audio dimension to his delivery and the end result, of course, is simply exquisite. Be sure to check out his similar work with Bill Rieflin and Trey Gunn .... Amazing stuff indeed!This release though is highly recommended for those of you who enjoy listening to something different but still within a \\"passive\\" mode.Great job, as always, Robert!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"F&F build a mesmerizing &#65533;temple&#65533; of sound","review":"As Robert Fripp and his colleague Jeffrey Fayman make their debut on the Projekt label, they join an artist roster that includes such spacey synthesists as Steve Roach and Vidna Obmana. The four-part Temple In The Clouds CD actually fits in fairly well with the works of Roach and Obmana. It consists of four variations on swirling, droning synthesized atmospherics with a few nature sounds thrown in (mainly ocean waves). The closest reference is Fripp's Soundscape series, where he used his \\"Frippertronics\\" style of guitar playing to create abstract tones and electronic \\"sound installations.\\" (see also Fripp's collaborations with Brian Eno) The four pieces on Temple are lovely, majestic, drifting ambient themes. If you're a fan of King Crimson electric guitar, you might be a bit put off by this CD. If you like the Soundcapes, though, you ought to give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly Boring","review":"I liked some of Fripp's other sound loop projects, but this was so boring I couldn't stand it.

Although Gilberto is amazing, de Souza is a cut above. I absolutely love her. She is a constant in my rotation. This is her first album and is rightfully her best. Her voice is sweet, soulful, and epitomizes true bossa nova/samba with a spark. The music revolves around consistent drum beats and other catchy percussion rhythms. Her voice play is smooth, effortless, and blends perfectly with the rhythms. I'm not sure what she is saying, but her songs make you feel like your in love on an island paradise. I would highly recommend her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosalia De Souza - Garota Moderna","review":"The handiwork of Nicola Conte is all over Rosalia De Souza's debut album, Garota Moderna. There are plenty of Italian jazz flourishes over the tracks, sprinkled on generously like freshly grated Parmesan cheese over a steaming bowl of pasta. De Souza's voice is light and gentle, perfectly suited to the quick and easygoing rhythms that Conte lays down for her. A few tracks, like \\"Saudosismo,\\" go for a more relaxed attitude, rather than for a samba. A little more than half the tracks are remakes, but Conte shows that he's comfortable arranging others' tracks for maximum enjoyment. Garota Moderna is irrepressibly sunny, from \\"Bossa 31\\" to the beach-ready \\"Ipanema.\\" Plenty to enjoy here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, just needs more pictures of Samaritans","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and reference it quite often. It does a good job of detailing the historical, theological, and political situations surrounding the Samaritans. Due to the fact that various aspects of Samaritan theology and perspectives are relatively unknown outside of the scholarly world thie book is a good introduction to this important part of Israeli culture. I have a friend in Holon, Israel who is a Samaritan and this book is helpful in understanding the Samaritan perspective on history.The book could use more pictures of the Samaritans actually living out their culture, but regardless this is an introduction. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about the Samaritans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came with a hole","review":"I got a pair of this a while ago, and I didn't open it until now, only to find it has an enormous hole in it.

At 30 minutes, it covers only the barest of details about Austen's life and brings no insights to bear on the subject.It's just photo after photo mixed with terrible video shots of current day Austen sites like Bath.Very dreary and not a bit worthy of Jane Austen.

Florio is the James Callendar of the NFL - a rumormonger without scruples. No \\"scoop\\" is unfit for Florio to print - even if it's completely untrue.Florio's book is much the same, unfortunately. Quarterback of the Future is very much a hodgepodge of lame and tired cliches about race mixed in with a pinch of science fiction. It doesn't work.It's very difficult to pull of a quality sports novel. Many great writers have tried and failed. Florio is not a great writer, and he too fails. Miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST A REAL BAND OF THE NEW MILLENIUM","review":"The DAMAGE MANUAL came out with a mediocure EP entitled ONE a few monthes ago, but I was very impressed with their debue full length album. This band is basically an all-star industrial mega-group. Chris Connely (revolting cocks) on vocals, Martin Atkins (PIL, Pigface) on electronics, Jah Wobble (Killing Joke)on drums, and the fantastic guitarist also from Killing Joke, I forget his name....Any how, Atkins is the all reining master of gritty-techno electronics with Connely's David Bowie like voice to top it all off. This album has unique remixes of Sunset Gun, Blame and Demand, and Damage Addict which 1st appeared on the EP. This is a must by for any serious music fan, these guys aren't no TRL sell-outs, THIS IS THE REAL THING !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sociology minus the marxism","review":"Ever want a solid and scholarly introduction to sociology, but have been turned off by the marxist tenor, and knee jerk leftism of all the sociology profs that were on your college campus? let alone the majors?this book is fantastic. it follows the five main currents of \\"golden age\\" sociology- community, authority, status, the sacred, and alienation. he pays special attention to Tocqueville, Marx, Weber, Durkheim and Simmel. Mostly he uses Marx just to kick him around- which is great. or he uses Marx to point out how particularly dumb Rousseau was. Double great.if you want access to the tool box of sociology, but from an honest academic with a conservative view of the field, pick up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Text Book?","review":"This is no text book; maybe for a doctoral program but never for bachelors level reading. It is very hard for the reader to follow main points. The author uses intervening ideas within sentences that causes the reader to lose the purpose of the original thought and the author does this throughout the book. I simply stopped reading his side notes within sentences and would jump to his main point where he left off. Even doing this the reader would still need to have a thesaurus and a source to do historical research on the \\"thinkers\\" of sociology, as the author calls them because he only provides his views on what those historical figures thought and wrote. For a good sociology theory text book, read/study, \\"Social Theory Re-Wired: New Connections to Classical and Contemporary Perspectives (Contemporary Sociological Perspectives)\\", it is far superior and more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I have no idea if this movie itself is any good or not because we couldn't stand to listen to all the background static sound and alot of the time faces weren't recognizable, so we turned it off after a try of 20 minutes.

Mixturing lots of styles (one of the main characteristics from the band), they have written one of the most glorious pages from the rock history of all times. From songs as \\"Balada do Louco\\" (ironically, today it sounds as a Requiem for the brilliant leader Arnaldo Baptista) to the ravishing \\"Beijo Exagerado\\", from the psychedelic \\"Dune Buggy\\" to the beautiful CSN&Y vocals style of \\"Rua Augusta\\", from the Latin rythmics of \\"Cantor de Mambo\\" to the censored hard rock \\"A Hora e a Vez do Cabelo Nascer\\" (by the 70's Brazilian Military Dictatorship), this album is their main masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"cheap fabric, but looks great on my sons window.

She got it muddy after a few days and I threw it in the washer and none of the stuffing moved. When I took it out of the dryer it looked like new. I got the 36x23 for my chow mix for his XL foldable crate. He loves it too and the baby blue is very pretty also. I love these and when they wear out I will order more.

I decided to compare since we own another MidWest 13x20 quiet time bed (bought several years ago & the reason I decided to buy another). When put up to each other, the new MidWest \\"fashion pink\\" bed is significantly smaller than our original MidWest \\"sherpa off-white\\" bed. The fashion pink bed measured 11.5x20 while our other is a true 13x20. This is disappointing.

I have a slight cement slope that connects to my garage floor so I thought 1-1/3\\" (in the saddle) would be a perfect fit for this jack to go under my crossmember. WRONG ANSWER! The end result for this jack to work is I needed to place a 5/8\\" plywood in front of the tires and drive my front wheels on it. After that, the jack had enough clearance to get under my crossmember. If it wasn't for this clearance issue, I would rate this jack more than 5 stars.

The bottom line is that this jack is not nearly as well made as many reviewers have claimed and also the one I received is bent as not all 4 wheels will rest on the garage floor at any one time, no doubt a combination of poor chinese manufacturing techniques and rough transit conditions in this country.This is the second jack that I have purchased through Amazon and both have been less than optimal. In fact the first one had to be sent back as it was so damaged upon opening it that it was not useable.Moral of this story is to spend more and get a quality product, hopefully made in the USA and stop importing this Asian trash into this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gift ever!","review":"I bought this for my adult daughter last Christmas.

Crazy Lips starts with a family in crisis. The older brother has been accused of murder and is on the run. The two sisters and mother are hounded and harassed by the press and the police. They have rocks constantly thrown through their windows. As a last resort the youngest sister goes to a psychic medium to help her locate her brother. This is where things get strange. When you see the scene with the corpse you know that horror movies have risen from the grave. How warped that scene is! How twisted, and yet refreshing to be freaked out by a horror movie again. The end is amazing. It's about 15-20 minutes of martial arts, with axes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Lips Warning:","review":"So,I just wanted to give everyone a heads up on this movie since all i got was a review telling me that i should see it because its one of those WTF?! types of movies and...

Its an okay movie once you get past the rape, necophelia and almost insest but I just wanted everyone to be warned on that front since i didn't have that warning and i sat down to watch it with my friend, her younger brother and of course there mom came in half way through.You've been warned........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, this is crap...","review":"This movie is crap with a capital CRAP. All cult movie enthusiasm aside, it's truly bad. It's for people who think things like \\"Faster Pussycat, Kill Kill!\\" are great cinema. It's not as funny though. I laughed one whole time, when Ms. Lucy hocked up a super-loogy while rambling around in the woods with an assault rifle. Otherwise, my main purpose in watching the whole thing was an ongoing disbelief that it could get any worse. I was wrong, it just got worse & worse all the way to the end. If you've got time to waste on this instead of the hundreds of much better Asian horror flicks out there, go right ahead and let it take a dump on your eyeballs.

That's the only thing I figured out 100% cause after that things got wackier than Takashi Miike on mushrooms including necrophilia, three rape scenes, a scalping, headless zombies, a musical number, lots of screaming, vomiting, violent telekinetic murders, brutal fight scenes with axes, incest and even a nuclear explosion!What does it all mean? I don't know and I couldn't care less. I just know I couldn't peel my eyes from the screen in anticipation of what was going to happen next.If you enjoy the more frenzied moments of films by Miike, Tsukamoto or Lynch then you should check out the unpredictable CRAZY LIPS. \\"What is truly happening in this house?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"strange film that ultimately falls flat","review":"I really don't get all the positive reviews on this movie; it simply wasn't that good. Basically, it is an extemely bizarre and violent film which attempts to blend extreme horror with dark comedy, but ultimately fails in both areas. Movies this strange are sure to gain some cult notoriety, but with all the five star reviews I expected so much better.If you are really looking for something strange, pick up All night Long instead.

But, if someone were going to throw me out on a desert island or into prison and I was only allowed to take one book with me, the DAKE BIBLE would be the one. Sure the man had some crackpot ideas; so did Luther. So did Calvin. So do I! But as long as you're not using the Dake as sole source for your studies, it can be extremely useful. The primary danger with any study Bible, of course, is that the notes become oracular. I have met plenty of people who either consciously or subconsciously accept the notes in the margins of ANY study Bible (Scofield, Ryrie, Arthur, Pilgrim, Zodhiates, etc.) as equally authoritative with the text. But, again--if I were only allowed to have one book, the Dake Bible would be that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Reference Tool........","review":"It is true that Dake was off somewhat in his doctrinal view, but that doesn't keep this bible from being an excellant reference tool. I am in Bible College and there is a lot of information here that is very helpful.

From the beginning a main staple of the Ravenloft setting were the lineages of the main characters. It's a motif in gothic horror that some families harbor evil in their genes that revisits generation after generation, fell curses and all that wonderful stuff. This book allows you to put that theme into game mechanics, allowing you to make PCs and NPCs in the cannon family bloodlines or create them of your own design. It's a bit rules heavy but the redeeming factor is the continuation of the Laurie and Gennifer Weathermay-Foxgrove metaplot. You never know just what mischief those sly vixens are going to get into next, and the short stories provide fine filler material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legacy of the Blood: A Legacy of Research for DM's.","review":"This product goes in line with the Gazetteers, giving the DM a thorough and large amount of information about the NPC's in Ravenloft.

I'm not sure that mail order is always the best way to go...if it was from a big box store, it would have gone right back, but because it has to be wrapped and shipped back, she'll live with it.

You can hear that Justin has definately matured and stepped away from that boy-band appeal.I think that the production is also one of the aspects that bring this album out more. Timbaland has introduced something new with the track \\"Sexyback\\" and in my opinion is about to start a new trend in hip-hop. Justin sure knows what his doing when it comes to making choices for production on his albums considering that his previous album was almost completely produced by the Neptunes and on this one Timbaland, two of the best producers ever.My favourite track on the album is \\"My love (feat. T.I)\\", just love the beat and the vocals. Outsanding...Get it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Future Garbage/Trash Can Liner!!!","review":"This cd is absolute trash. Perhaps the CD wouldn't be so bad if he would stop trying to sound like Prince and Michael Jackson. He's bringing sexy back? How can you bring back something you didn't ever have. One star because zero was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"More is Less: Don't Fall For It!","review":"Timberlake and his record company have opted to sucker music lovers into buying a mediocre, watered-down re-release of FutureSex/LoveSounds. Deluxe edition is not the term. DeSPICABLE edition is more like it.Disc 1 contains the censored versions of most of the songs along with a few remixes. Beyonce (who also is guilty of the same CD re-releasing tactic) surprisingly downgrades the original version of \\"Until The End of Time\\".Disc 2 contains videos from the CD, \\"Making of...\\" segments, and interviews about the videos. One problem: the videos are not groundbreaking. They are not even interesting. The DVD contains a few live performances also that I think most fans can live without.Don't buy it! Timberlake, Beyonce, and Usher could take a lesson from Chris Brown who released a deluxe edition along with a plain edition of his CD. It boils down to respect for music fans. Wow! Even the CD cover looks sinister and manipulating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe they edited out the explicit lyrics!!","review":"The first release with the explicit lyrics is awesome. Don't get this \\"deluxe\\" version. I hate censorship!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Both the music and the video's are edited. Avoid this release or be very disappointed. This was only released to increase sales and make more money from fans who didn't know it was edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This album is excellent. Although there are 2 songs that make the album a little boring and they could easily not be included cause they don't even fit in there. Despite that fact the album includes almost 5 to 6 songs with the new sound of Timbaland's productions and some very good mid tempo rnb beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD","review":"The cd is very good as already noted half the cd is or has been on the radio or tv and for good reason. The cd would have been a perfect 5 for me if it wasnt for Damn Girl and (Another Song) All Over Again those 2 me are the weaker \\"filler tracks\\" of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin's Music continues to evolve","review":"It's been four years since his last solo release and it's evident when you listen to this album. His voice is stronger, his beats are better (thanks in part to Timbaland), and his lyrics are definately more adult. I don't like every track on this album, but it is worth the money I spent on it. Keep it up Justin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If you like someone sounding total monotone and stuggling to sound black, then you might like this. If you like clean cut music, music with more than a note or two ~~ forget it. And definitely don't watch him performing the new song live - he is grabbing at his crotch every two seconds. No class."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't listen to it","review":"All the songs sound the same, it is a desperate cliche. What ever happened to creativity? He is talented, but this sound is just awful. All the songs sound like \\"sexy back\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin Timeberlake RULES!!!!!!!","review":"This album is amazing....Justin talent in phenominal and never ending...I listen to this cd everyday...The beats are hard and perfect for dancing to..I have been a Justin fan since NSYNC....I believe Justin and a solo artist is definitely what he was meant to do...I just recently got to see Justin's current tour FutureSex/LoveShow 2007 and he performed every song off this cd and he gave you exactly what you came to see an amazing show...I would definitely recommend this cd and recommend if you have the opportunity to go the his current tour do so you will have a great time"},{"rating":"2","title":"This man has SOUL!","review":"Justin, really out did himself with this new album. I love it! my favorite jams are the first song:future, sex, love and #10-love is all I have and #11-a song about drug use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"I read a few reviews from music critics comparing this to \\"The Gloved One\\" in his prime. Needless to say, I had high hopes for JT's sophomore effort. Unfortunately with the exception of the title track and the infectious groove of the radio hit \\"Sexy Back\\", this CD had me looking for the nearest recliner rather than my dancin' shoes. One tired track after another and I suddenly found myself looking forward to the end of the disc. Justin is a very talented guy and the vocals are impressive on a couple of tracks to be sure, but whatever talent he has seems wasted on this snooze-fest. I give it 2 stars and a bunch of zzzzzzzz's."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I really thought this was going to be a great CD from the few songs I have heard off if it then I got it! BLAHHH I was so disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUTURE SEX/LOVE SOUNDS","review":"THIS IS JUST ANOTHER OF JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE'S SENSUOUS SOFT YET STRONG SET OF SONGS HE BOTH SINGS AND WRITES HIMSELF FROM THE HEART AND WHEREVER ELSE HE GETS THESE FEELINGS. SO YOUNG, A GENTLEMAN AND TALENTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin Timberlake is a good singer, lyrics might be too racy for some.","review":"I like Justin Timberlake. I think he is a talented singer. However, the lyrics on this albumn might be a little too racy for some listeners. I probably would not play this around small children or very religious persons. Other than that, the songs have a good beat and I can listen to this while working out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album but not Great","review":"I'm a big N Sync fan and when JT came out with Justified I was sold. In FutureSex/LoveSounds I didn't quite understand what JT was trying to accomplish but he did have some great hits on this album. He collaborates with T.I. and some other big names which is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I love most of the songs on this CD + can listen to it all the time. I can't wait for Justin Timberlake's next CD + hope it will awesome like this one. He did an amazing job on this CD. I was really surprised by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked early Prince and Jackson, You will love this!","review":"The cd has a lot of catchy songs with great beats but I kept adjusting my stereo trying to make out his amazing voice, I guess it is muffled or robotic sounding on purpose on some songs. The more I listen to it the more I like it! This cd reminds of Prince and Michael Jackson's earlier work. I felt it was worth buying, and it definately has some number one dance hits on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin Rocks!!!","review":"A great version from FutureSex/LoveSounds!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! CD with 3 New Re-mixes bonus including duet with Beyonce, Missy Elliot and 50 cent! And 60 minute Bonus DVD featuring tv performances, all of his hit music videos, making of and much more!! Just perfect!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soul Less","review":"I was a bit apprehensive when it came to listening to this CD. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of JT, but I thoroughly enjoyed his previous solo debut CDJustified, which was a very soulful affair. My apprehension came upon hearing the first single from this CDSexyBack, and that the majority of the CD would be produced by Timbaland. Not with standing one or two efforts (namelyCry Me a Riverwhich is a great song) I find Timbaland production soul less & cold. Alas that is how I would describe the majority of the songs on offer here. The only redeeming factors for this CD are the cuts:(Another Song) All Over Again , and Losing my Way, which benefits from a string section, & Hezekiah Walker & the Love Fellowship Choir. Very soulful. If only the rest of the CD could have followed suite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"When I first got the CD as a gift, I only listened to the songs I had heard on the radio. One day I decided to sit down and listen to the entire thing. With the exception of maybe two songs, I love the CD. Second time was much better than the first. Good job!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very very good","review":"it's basically a justin timbo collabo all the way through and dang it is good. i wouldn't have thought so if i hadn't heard it, but trust me, it is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot","review":"One way you can tell that you have made it, is when you put out a hot cd and you have a bunch of folks hating on it as you sell millions of copies.go Justin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK .......Justin there is ONLY one Prince and you're not him!","review":"I think Justin spent way to much time trying to sound like Prince and Micheal Jackson and not enough time sounding like Justin. This CD is a poor crappy effert."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Ego In the Buisness Is Back","review":"Here we have another offering by the biggest ego in the music buisness. As usual, his fans are rallying around him like he's the coming of the great pop Messiah. He's been called innovative and the biggest force in music today...yeah right. let's get a few thing straight.a) Timbaland and computerized beats exsisted before this...it is not innovative.b) Justin imitates MJ and Prince in his vocals...nothing innovative therec) Justin is \\"hot\\" so somehow, that converts to credibility, even if he recycles things thathave made music innovative in the past and then throw them all together.\\"Futuresex\\" is yet another album of producer/his hop collaborations that make the public swoon. Why, I'll never know. This kid went from singing country on star search and doing childhood beauty pagents, to this. Get the right producers and anything is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Pretty Sure This Is The Music They Play In Hell","review":"Okay, that might be a teeny bit mean of me to say. Not all of Justin's stuff is bad. Some of it is pretty decent.However, SexyBack drives me crazy and I don't mean that in a good way. This is one of the most annoying pop hits I've ever heard.People tell me it's a lot of fun to dance to, but personally I'd have to be really really really drunk to enjoy dancing to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Song Ever! (Sexy Back)","review":"Sexy Back is jibberish. Singers could puke on a mic and their fans would buy it.. I wish they would quit playing Sexy Back on the radio. I still don't think people actually like this song, if you can call it a song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy is HOT!","review":"I must say that I was a little sceptical after seeing the title of this album, however, after listening to it I am totally hooked. Justin is so versatile and I think this album showcases that. I like all of the collaborations - they really work. Great effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This guy has no life, sexy this and sexy that sexy everything! Good club beat for \\"Sexyback\\" other than that this cd SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can dance, but he can't sing","review":"This cd has only a few songs that have a good dance beat. Seems that it's one of rip off deals where the single was pushed because it's one of the few good songs. But, I'm sorry, you can dance to these few upbeat songs, but Justin just can not sing. The vocals are horrible. Bottom line, you'd be better off to just buy the single. The rest of cd is just okay, and if you like good vocals, don't bother at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Beats, horrible writting","review":"Ok, im not a Justin Hater so the low \\"rating\\" is in part because i feel the alubm has amazing AMAZING beats but as far as writting, this cd lacks so much! The Writing is plain, unpleasant and at times boring. The cd get very repetative and i found myself listening to this cd less and less this week. (wierd since ive only had for a week) I feel that justing previous work was much more impressive however if you like \\"Sexy Back\\" and \\"My Love\\" then you will be dissapointed because the albums has nothing to offer but repetition and great beats. I only wish this cd was sold as an instrumental, not with Justin's ironic, childish, and unflattering voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE-I BRINGING SEXY BACK","review":"I LIKE THE ENTIRE CD. I HAVENT GOTTEN BORED WITH LISTENING TO IT YET"},{"rating":"2","title":"A More Mature Sound","review":"I've always admired JT from afar during his NSync days but couldn't bring myself to buy an album - because of my perception it was teenage pop (save for the \\"gone\\" record). But my tune changed with this album because I first didn't recognize him in the ubiquitous \\"sexyback\\" single on the radio until the DJ announced his name, so my interest piqued. Then I heard Justin play a few cuts on the Elvis' Duran show on my drive to work; I was moved by the Donny Hathawayesque sound of \\"Another Song (all over again).\\" He got me there and I shed my dollars afterwards to buy the CD. My favorites from the CD are: My love, Another Song, Losing My Way, and Until the end of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like the first","review":"I went out and grabbed this the first day it came out. I expected this to be more like the first. I like it but the first one was sooo much better. The album does offer some bangin hits though like \\"My Love\\" and \\"What comes around\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"FutureSex /LoveSounds","review":"I Love this CD, it is great. I think Justin Timberlake out did himself with this CD! It is wonderful! I hope he continues to record, he has a wonderful voice and I think he is number one, at least he is on my list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JT is All Grown Up","review":"I LOVE this CD! While his last CD Justified pays homage to Michael Jackson's sound, this one has Prince written all over it. I like every single song on this CD & that's rare these days. Justin & his producer Timbaland are a fantastic team & I hope they continue to work together in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Surprise..........","review":"Let me start by first saying that I only bought this CD because I needed another purchase to qualify for Amazon's free shipping. I wasn't a huge fan of the whole boy band era (my sister had all the CD's and they were OK, nothing exciting to me). I am more into rock music, so I even surprised myself buying this album. I received this CD on a Saturday and the following Thursday, I purchased tickets last minute to Justin's concert that night. This album has me hooked. I have listened to it more than the other two albums I bought at the same time (Gnarls Barkley and Wolfmother). The concert was awesome, if he comes to your area it is a must see. He has surpassed the NSync pop stuff and created a new sound that I haven't heard in a long time. My only regret is that I didn't buy this CD when it came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Back","review":"This cd was pretty good, but I mainly bought it for the hits on the radio.

Oh, ya.... so are the songs ;-) I first downloaded it just for a song or two but after listening, I really enjoy the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"i have to admit it's grown on me","review":"When I first bought this album, I thought, well there are a couple of great singles here (Sexyback!) but the album as a whole doesn't compare to his first (Justified). I'm a huge fan of the Neptunes, and missed their influence on this album's sound.But after a few weeks, I have to admit the album has really grown on me. Timbaland's producing style, while totally different from the Neptunes, does result in some really catchy tunes that I can't quite get out of my head. It's nice to see Justin continuing to take chances with his music, and not get pigeonholed into any one sound (there's no trace of the \\"Michael Jackson sound-alike\\" on this album). With this album, he's clearly gained confidence, maturity, and -- I didn't think it was possible -- more sex appeal.A definite recommend, but prepare to listen to it a few times before you really love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"sarah_katiebeth","review":"Originally I bought this CD for just a few songs, but I have really enjoyed the whole thing. It's great for getting ready in the morning, it gets me going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't taken it out of my cd player yet","review":"I have to admit...when i first put the cd in and Futuresex/Lovesound started playing, I was worried. But after a few listens, it, as well as the rest of the cd started growing on me. It took awhile, because the music is so different from most of what is considered pop now. It is definitely worth buying. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"First album much better. If you are looking for something like the first, do not buy this. Tracks 1 & 2 are fun, but the rest of the songs are not good, are slow, and most sound the same as the song before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album...","review":"This reminds me sorta of Ginuwine's first album which was a serious classic that I still jam too every now and then! JT and Tim have made an incredible album! Go and get it...it's worth it! It's such a great album that I have a bootlegged copy but I'm going to support him and buy the real one!!! Yippie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for Nickelodeon?","review":"I am shocked that the author of this explicit album hosted the Nickelodeon Kids Awards. This is inexcusable, and a huge failing for the network. Kids listen to TV more than they ever did their parents, and what is this teaching them? I am 22 years old and I know that when I watched Nickelodeon ten years ago they never would have allowed such a person to host the awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play On, Justin!","review":"I like an Artist who isn't afraid to experiment. FutureSex/LoveSounds has the freshness that I've been searching for in music these days. Justin has always had a soulful flavor to me, but it's also his other flavors that I like. This album has a little R&B;, a little Pop, some Jazz, Hip-Hop, it's all there. I even heard some 70's disco flavor. A good effort, and Justin is an artist with some staying power. Very few albums stand the test of time but this album is filled with songs that have some relevance, something that you would listen to a few years from now and still feel the meaning.Actually, Justin doesn't need the featured artists (in ex: T.I.) but they don't detract from the album either. I happen to dig the title of the album and love his tight-fitting suit. This album is enjoyable from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Birthday gift sucked!","review":"So all I wanted was this CD for my b-day (Sept. 12th). My husband went to every music store in Houston and finally found a copy.I guess Thirty \\"something\\" year old's are just not meant to listen to Justin. I loved his first album and all my friend's ribbed me about it, and said I needed to listen to their stuff that had much more substance. Well, now I see why. I flicked through every song, some with robot sounding \\"Justin\\" voices & songs that just had repetitive lyrics. I don't see the talent in this album y'all are talking about. Sorry!WHAT A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"I'm sorry that I ever purchased this CD. Can Justin really sing? All of the tracks with the exception of All Over Again sound as if they were put through some kind of filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be bringing Pharrell back...not sexy.","review":"Pre-ordered this on the strength of Pharrell's production last album (not on the weak effort by Sexyback) only to find that Timbaland is the exclusive producer on this album which is unfortunate due to his latest fasicination with an overproduced 'degraded electro' R&B sound. Just like Nelly Furtado's new record only Justin singing. I incorrectly assumed that Pharrell and Timbaland would again be sharing production credits. Oh well...for an artist like Justin he's going to be as good or as bad as the person producing the tracks. Unfortunately for him Timbaland is definitely in a slump creatively at the moment (past 2 years). The tracks and the vocals just don't function as one cohesive solid production. Justin...you need to bring Pharrell back...not your sexy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip Hop & Rap Are Ripping The EDM Scene","review":"This is why hip hop, rap and r&b are sooo unoriginal!

I am not making this up and I am not trying to be funny. Then I realized it was Justin Timberlake. Justin comes from a long line of hardcore, rough and tough, balls to the wall, in your face muscians. He follows in the footsteps of Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Keith Richards, Jim Morrison, Gregg Allman, Leslie West (Mountain), John Bonham, Bohn Scott, Keith Moon, Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKiernan, Ozzy Osbourne, James Hetfield, Chris Cornell and Kim Thayil (soundgarden).

I think Justin Timberlake is a cocky jerk and I wanted this album to blow. However, this is some of the best pop out there right now. I don't know whether to credit him or Timbaland, I mean this album sounds like Tim and the last album sounded like the Neptunes, which made it decent...Justin's only as good as his producers. For that reason, he will never be as big as Prince or Michael. but God, this is a good album! Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"JT Is MY Love","review":"This album was good but I like the first one better. This one has lots of different sounds, like JT was not sure where he was going with it. Some styles work better for him then others. The techno pop thing he did with \\"Sexyback\\", to me just is not for him. He should stick to the more tradtional JT sound like in \\"My Love\\", thats a classic return to who he was when he first came out. The other songs on the album follow that same pattern. Overall, his lyrics are nice and his delivery is great, he just needs to center his style more.

This album came out September 12, 2006. Future Sex/Love Sounds is a bit more experimental and edgy than anything he's ever done. Songs like \`lovestoned' and \`chop it up' featuring timbaland and three six mafia would never be on an nsync album. The good thing about this album is that basically all the songs on this album live up to the hype, however they're completely different and its still amazing how Justin can flow smoothly from a three six mafia song to an early Michael Jackson inspired song (\`damn girl\`). Though radio played songs like \`my love' and \`sexyback' are overplayed this album is really worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin's got \\"it\\"","review":"The boy is just awesome. He's got \\"it\\", that special something that draws me back to him time and time again (much like that of Madonna, MJ and Xtina..they all got \\"it\\") ...My favorite song on the CD by far is \\"My Love\\"..what a fantastic beat..I can't stop playing it!

Anyway! I really really like \\"Justified\\" regardless of what the reviews say. I loved the sound..it was still pop-ish but had a new R&B feel to it. This album is really great. I LOOOVE \\"Love Stoned\\", \\"Summer Love\\", \\"What Goes Around...\\" and of course \\"Sexyback\\"..i gave it 4 cause i think a couple of the songs could have been better, but overall, it's great. This album is definitely different than Justified but it's still really good.

What a great pleasure and purchase !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album!","review":"I enjoyed Justin's first solo album \\"Justified\\", but this album is even better! Most of the tracks are upbeat and just put you in a good mood and make you want to dance. The two best (and catchiest) songs are \\"My Love\\" and \\"Lovestoned\\". Timbaland produced several songs besides \\"Sexyback\\" and I think Justin and Timbaland make a great musical pair. The only songs I don't really enjoy are the last three. They are slower and sort of seem out of place when the first 3/4 of the album is so upbeat and dance-oriented. While the first single \\"Sexyback\\" is catchy, it tends to be repetitive but the rest of the songs on the album are not that way. In my opinion there are several songs that are better than \\"Sexyback\\". If you are a Justin fan or enjoyed the first single, then you won't be disappointed by the rest of the album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back.","review":"I am not a Justin hater.

The original MASH author died a few years ago but had previously sold his series to another author. However, I can verify a lot of details about the book series because my father trained the author at a Veterans Hospital in East Orange, NJ and is referred to in the book as the \\"SOB chief of thoracic surgery\\" at the hospital. I am interested in getting a new copy so my kids can read it but don't have credit cards-maybe with other options-more people can enjoy this book-the MASH books are great as a collection or by the single book.

The only problem I've found so far is that the map of the Grout Pond recreation area in VT has mistakes. 2 sites he describes in the book aren't on the map at all, and one site is on the opposite site of the hiking trail from where he says it is. I guess I'll have to go myself to see which is the correct location."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - wish it had more sites reviewed!","review":"This is a good book covering a large area. It gives thoughtful reviews of a handful of campgrounds for each of the 5 New England states - with 60 places reviewed. The descriptions are good giving hints as to which sites are secluded vs. open and which are more ideal. I would urge anyone using this (or any other book like it) to make sure to look up the campgrounds online as some have changed. For example, Mount Greylock Campground in Mass is now hike-in only. The author describes these as lug-in with a few having only 50 foot walks from the road. The Mt Greylock web site (Sept 2011) states that the sites require a 1.3 to 2.4 mile hike in depending on which site - as you must park at the parking lot on the map. This is not a criticism of the book - more a warning to folks out there to make sure you do additional research."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good tent camping","review":"my husband and i have used this book twice for tent camping in Mass.

How many novels (thrillers, love stories, good reads) are set in Afghanistan? Not many,and this all of those. I don't know if this is the \\"real\\" Afghanistan, but it is one version. The people I know are hungry to learn anything they can about this isolated country and Lie Down With Lions is a great place to begin. Ken Follett understands women and writes about them well; women will relate to this story. The Soviets are the bad guys in this book and the Afghans are the victims. Read this and get a glimmer of understanding into the background of these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting read","review":"If you like excitment and action you will love this book.

Literary Gruel.","review":"I cannot believe all the good reviews on this site for \\"Lie Down with Lions\\". It is truly an empty action novel with little to redeem it.To give the book some credit, the characters were well defined. Unfortunately they were two-dimensional and transparent. This is one of those novels where the villain is SO EVIL and the protagonist is a cartoonish superman. You can almost visualize the author rubbing his hands together between chapters, in rapture at how cool the protagonist is, but I found the character to be pathetically shallow and underdeveloped. If they made a movie out of this book, the hero would best be portrayed by Chuck Norris (and that's not a compliment).The author's world is again, a ridiculously over-simplified black and white world. \\"Ooooo, those evil Russians! Thank God for America!\\"If you're a simple-minded American who likes vapid action with no real content (and apparently there are a lot of you), I'm sure you'll think this one is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favourite....","review":"This is the first book I have ever read by Ken Follett, and it does not leave me begging for more. Seriously, this is one of the worst, most shallow, cheap-action-packed novels that I have ever read. The realness of this novel is ridiculous. It\`s the same old American good guy/bad guy story all over again, and to me it is not that appeling. If this book ever made it to the movies ,then I\`m sure that James bond would play the main character. I\`m mean...who else could beat up five menn inside a helicopter while they are cuffed on both hands?"},{"rating":"1","title":"found this one hard to get into","review":"i'm a huge fan of follet..some of his books are amongst my favorites by any author (dangerous fortune, place called freedom, code to zero, and of course the majestic pillars of the earth), but I just couldn't get into this one.It's not that I didn't like the characters. I liked the protagonist as well as the 'villains' of the book. I didn't like the setting much though.It takes place in Afghanistan during the early 80's when the locals are fighting against the russians for their freedom. I'm not really interested in the area or the setting so maybe that had something to do with it.I hate to say it but I had a hard time getting through this one. The chapters were very long which didn't help much either.There were some bright points to the book (as with all Follett books of course) but they didn't outweigh, what was to me, the boring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum thriller","review":"Having read many of this author's books and enjoyed them, I purchased this one with high hopes and in a word was disappointed. This tale tracks three protagonists - an American spy, a Russian spy and the woman \\"caught\\" between them - from Paris to Afghanistan during the height of the Cold War and the Russian-Afghani War. Not the most complicated plot but this author has made due with much less. Unfortunately not here. The characters are wooden and the plot is a yawner. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors but \\"Lie Down With Lions\\" is little more than a predictable romance novel. Several times while reading it, I wondered if Follet was channeling Danielle Steele! The characters are one dimensional, uninteresting and totally predictable. The \\"heroine\\", Jane, is especially flat - more a male fantasy figure than a developed character. The best parts of the book are the Afghan characters and we barely get to know them. The \\"hero\\", Ellis, is a CIA undercover spy caricature as are the Russian \\"bad guys\\" and the French spy, Jean-Pierre. If you are expecting something of the same quality as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" or \\"Dangerous Fortune\\" or even \\"Fall of Giants\\", you will probably be disappointed. This seems to be a grind-out novel to meet a publisher deadline instead of the gripping, well plotted novels with sharply drawn characters we've come to expect from Follett."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly romance novel","review":"Girls who are sophomores in high school might like this book, but I had to give it up after a couple of chapters.

This is a very unique and original anime show with a great storyline, wonderful animation, and characters that are on point. A show that seems to be a sure masterpiece in the future It still has some pieces that make it kind of doubtful. In these first episodes there's good action but not enough for this type of series It doesn't have to be action packed but enough like in the witch hunter robin series. The story is pretty good this seems like a show that progresses into an addictive show that you can't wait to see. The animation really shows when the E's use their powerful minds to create holding cell's for criminals out of fountain water and fight physically and mentally either one can create major damage. In conclusion this show is good but not great it should get better after it gets deeper into the story the only major flaw in this is not enough action It needs to be not too much but not too little."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing set","review":"Based on the other reviews and descriptions, I was very eager to receive this set and then very disappointed when I did. Everything is very nice quality, but the deck (far from being \\"beautiful\\") is quite ugly. The colors are muted and dull. The pictures are juvenile and creepy in a sort of silly way. The book has a lot of interesting information in it but is a tremendous departure from any tradition with which I am familiar. I may keep the book as an off-beat reference, but I will definitely divest myself of the cards. I don't like looking at them or handling them, and I would find them very difficult to read since the pictures and descriptions do not coincide with any other information on card reading (tarot or playing card) that I have encountered.

I am sorry I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreturnable....","review":"Undead and Unreturnable is an interesting choice of titles for this book, because I had a strong desire to return the book to the store. I have really enjoyed MJD's first few books in this series, but on three and now four things are heading downhill.The main plot of this book is...I'm not really sure. From the blurb on the back one expects an interesting story because of a ghost wandering through the mansion and a serial killer on the loose. The ghost basically hangs out making snide comments and patiently waiting for Betsy to get past another minor romatic snafu with Sinclair and then helps Betsy and Laura solve the entire mystery in about a chapter. No build up, no drama, no mystery.The dialogue between the characters was, as always, amusing, but that alone could not carry the book. For those that have enjoyed the earlier volumes, I would strongly recommend waiting for the paperback. At something closer in size to a novella, you should save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"she wrote this one on the fly","review":"HORRIBLE!

Betsy is annoying and I often look forward to reading the other characters then her. The sex I always liked in the books but in this installment it was not caring and unaffectionate. It was not ravishing and yerning but just a way to end or fill in a chapter.I wish the main character was stronger, her opinion makes no sense and have no ground based on her insecurities from her pre-dead life. It is like she is an idiot that was crowned queen. No wisdom, no sicerity, no back bone(unless you care for her, then she will treat you bad or go against your better and more wise judgement)Everyone is more understanding of her whole situation then she and it get boring.

I like the Undead series, and have even read a few of her other stories, but find them to be the same characters, over and over again. Betsy in herself, is a likable character, but a whole book filled with the same type left me feeling rather let down and a bit punch drunk as if I had watched Shakespere performed by the Three Stooges. The storyline was non existent and it felt as if the concept was \\"rushed.\\" I only wish the plotline was as snappy as the comebacks. The book is filled with characters who seem to have little more to do than simply walk through the house. My advice, reread one of the earlier books, and wait on the paperback. This one isn't (in my opinion) worth the $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undead and Unreturnable","review":"I LOVE these books. They are freaking hilarious!The adventures of Queen Betsy are great fun and watching her deal with her life as 'The Queen' of the vampires is quite interesting. This installment was adorable and had lot's of Betsy and Sinclair time. Eric Sinclair, her King, is beyond sexy and his dry sense of humor is a riot. He is completely and totally in love with her, too.This story had me cracking up page after page. The way Betsy thinks and talks just flat out makes me laugh. At one point I was sitting at my kitchen table, eating a bowl of cereal and reading. I read one line of dialogue that Betsy said and almost spit out a mouthful of cereal laughing! I actually had to put the book down while I tried to not choke to death laughing as I swallowed down my food.These books are great when you want something light to read that also makes you laugh.

It feels like a \\"days of our lives\\" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse. I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book. I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly. Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up. I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers. This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about. Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary what have you done????","review":"The last 2 books, and the short stories are just not the same Betsy I fell in love with. After books 1&2 I had to read all the MJD books I could find, and I liked a few of the other books. But Betsy was my fav. Untill I got the 2005/2006 books(I only buy paperback) I find them to be rushed, and fall WAY short. If you want a good read try the Southern Vamp books by Charlaine Harris or the Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich. Both are put out just as fast and the books keep getting better and better. I am not sure if I will get the next undead book now, to bad for the queen she will be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing and fun","review":"MJD's quirky dialogue continues to delight! Betsy is still learning to cope with discovering a long-lost half-sister, Laura, who is literally the spawn of satan (and wouldn't you know her stepmother had been temporarily possessed by the Devil!), being Queen of the Vampires, and living with her consort, Sinclair. Sinclair is becoming frustrated with Betsy for repeatedly pushing back their wedding date when he discovers that she can hear his thoughts. Her stepmother has another child and she spends time babysitting and interacting more than she would like with her stepmother as a result.

Betsy is getting tiresome, the characters aren't showing any growth, there's not that much humor any more, and there doesn't seem to be a good solid plot.I won't be buying any more books in the series.

I will be honest though: I couldn't get past the first forty pages so I may have missed Angel's real message of hope to the world.

He writes honestly of love, hurt, rage, and last, but never least, spirit. I think he has paved the way for other male writers to courageously explore the emotions that reside beneath their surfaces. The ones that cause them to react in ways that, I believe, they would change if adequately armed with conscious awareness of their psyche and their spirit. I thank him for this gift. He has bolstered my faith in the ability of men to discover their own peaceful solutions and as a result of that divine process, we all benefit. Namaste"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, this book has impact!","review":"If you are in need of refocusing or reprioritizing, this book will be very helpful. I was able to peel away layers of baggage and see myself more clearly - past, present, and future. By becoming more creative with my life, (starting off small and then expanding), I've discovered a more secure feeling of contentment. I believe many people will find this book very fulfilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, engrossing story","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Ms. Noble is exceptionally adept at interweaving two opposite story lines- a touching love story involving Emmeline and Quaid, and Merci's heart-wrenching spiritual journey. Not only was I entertained by her intriguing plot and wonderful writing, I was spiritually uplifted as well. I can't wait until Book 3!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gift from Zeus","review":"A lovely retelling of classical mythology, but should hardly be included among \\"children's books.\\" To begin with, as another reviewer has noted, the illustrations are a bit too \\"irreverant.\\" Descriptions of how Daedalus fashions a wooden cow for his queen to enjoy a sexual encounter with a bull seems far too adult a subject for an intended audience of 9-12 year-old readers. I had bought this book intending to read it with my six-year-old son, but it will be a few more years (quite a few) before he will see it. I am just not ready to explain to him what \\"ravish\\" means. I am very familiar with classical Greek mythology and should have known better than to have bought a book of it for a child. However, its being included in Amazon's children's section convinced me that it would be \\"safe.\\" This book would be better classified as \\"teen\\" or some such. Not for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by your stogie smokin' leering Uncle ...","review":"I applaud the idea of bringing myths to young people. I deplore this choice.There are dozens of myths that would be more understandable and certainly more interesting than Electra lusting over her father. The Steigs probably feel they put one over on us; they told some mildly dirty stories and got attention from people who feel children need to be introduced to the classics. As another reviewer observed, the obvious omission of Hercules gives a clue as to their priorties.Bleah.If you want your kids to learn the myths, go get D'Aulaires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Fresh Myth Retellings for Adults","review":"A Gift from Zeus succinctly tells sixteen classical myths in humorous prose interspersed with witty verse. Those myths are the stories of Prometheus, Demeter and Persephone, Midas, Daphne and Apollo, Leda, Pygmalion, Europa, Venus and Adonis, Daedalus and Icarus, Arachne, Hero and Leander, Perseus, Echo and Narcissus, Bellerophon, Theseus, and Orpheus and Eurydice. The language (\\"On the ravaged earth he ravaged the girl\\") and drawings are NOT for young children. This book is for teens and adults and is best enjoyed by someone who knows the myths already. If you're looking for a serious and comprehensive overview of Classical Mythology, try Edith Hamilton's Mythology. If you want a funny, irreverent look at myths, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and interesting","review":"The author did a wonderful job of covering the use of essential oil (perfumes) and botanicals in ancient Egypt (and at times other areas) from a archaeological standpoint. Many of the well known ancient perfume recipes are included and it is interesting to see how Pliny and others suggested medicinal use. I will say however people wishing Aromatherapy content, as the title denotes, will be very disappointed as there really is none. Lack of training in herbology, Aromatherapy or even botany also serves to limit the authors grasp and ability to expound. Altogether I feel the book is a great reference work and well researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is a beautiful book filled with recipes and traditional uses of herbs.

I love to play more intricate games like Runebound, Arkham Horror, and Fury of Dracula. These all have detailed rules that can be potent... in my opinion, these were beyond that. And I didn't believe that gameplay made up for it as I didn't find it to be fun.The pieces are good sturdy pieces, but that also made them very challenging to \\"punch out\\"... although technically I had to carefully cut each plastic piece... even then I found them hard to cut. But they are sturdy and will last some time.I felt the game moved slowly and didn't offer what some of my other games offered. I was sad that I bought it. If you like other games by this publisher, you might enjoy this game a lot.

While the vampiric elements are the driving force behind the plot, it mostly serves as a background to what is fundamentally a story about two friends reunited and quickly thrust apart by a bizarre set of circumstances. One might compare it to the way Shaun of the Dead was a romantic comedy that just happened to occur during the zombie apocalypse. It is well acted and certainly seems to be a solid film which unfortunately fell through the cracks due to more mainstream projects. Definitely worth watching both for it's uniqueness and for hot gothic vampire women. (I'm a guy, what can I say?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"it pretty bad...","review":"It almost felt like I was watching some really bad highschool production made by kids and filmed using their mom's camcorder.

It is a very sad and lame attempt at a gothic/vampire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much to like","review":"\\"Bloodwine\\" has unattractive actresses, very poor acting, a nonsensical script that builds no suspense or dread, bottom of the barrel special effects, and no eroticism to speak of. Not much to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Vampire movie with strong female characters","review":"There have been a lot of vampire movies coming out lately, mostly due to the Twilight books being so popular, but they're almost always aimed at either the young girls who want their heros to be brooding or the gore crowd who wants sexy vampires and lots of blood. Bloodwine caters to both crowds by filling the film with strong, well drawn female characters who aren't afraid to be themselves.Don't get me wrong, there are brooding vampires and sexy scenes of seduction, but Bloodwine has a lot more going for it. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Beautiful.","review":"I read another review about the white version of these and was horrified the buyer wasn't happy. I bought the white ones for a friend who is over the moon, and the black ones for myself and my mother. These are freshwater pearls so there is some irregularity with them, both in color and shape. It's part of their beauty. This necklace is a lovely length, and the pearls are a good size. It's got those really pretty petrol colored green and purple tinges, as well as a nice wieght to it. If you've got a few spare $1000 and are after 18mm tahitian pearls, then don't buy these. If you're after a very pretty necklace you'd be proud to be seen in and want people to comment on, then these are for you.

I understand freshwater pearls are not perfect circles but these are clearly of terrible quality. Pearls come in four classes: aaa, aa, a, and junk, where aaa is the best. I now own all four classes, and previous to the purchase of this strand only the first three. I also have a problem with the clasp. This necklace always seems to fall off for no apparent reason.

Shame on Capitol/Blue Note Records","review":"Stan Kenton's innovative and now timeless Christmas music has been run through the meat grinder and issued as a worthless piece of plastic on the legendary Capitol label by Blue Note Records. Shame on them. This disc is NOT an Audio CD. It does not comply with the CD technical specs and will not play on some cd players or any CD-ROM drive. Some half-baked copy protection system is embedded on the disc making it appear to be a worthless plastic frisbee to all computers and some cd players. Even if your intentions are honorable, Capitol/Blue Note has assumed you're a thief. Careful observers will note that nowhere on the package is this product labeled a Compact Disc. It would be nice if this tidbit were disclosed in the info above, which describes this product as an Audio CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer","review":"After reading a quick couple of comments regarding this album on the Trumpet Guild website I decided to purchase it.

There's lots of newer stuff out there - but this is an old standard that needs to be in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"A Merry Christmas by Stan Kenton and Ralph Carmichael is a classic that everyone should hear. The arrangements are great, the playing is great. The only reason that it gets four stars is that it is not the BEST recording of this material. There is an album called \\"A Stan Kenton Christmas\\" by the Capitol Bones Big Band which features all the arrangements on this album (all the real arrangements) plus a few from the group. It is sonically superior, since it was recorded in 2002 and the players really nailed the intonation in the mellophones.So if you must have the original, it's good. But I'd buy the Capitol Bones version instead. It's absolutely fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Impossible to not have this classic disc in your Christmas collection.

The author helped me understand the Oslo Accord and how it failed to bring justice to the region.This account ( using a diary format) really brings home what curfew means to daily life and the fear which comes when soldiers invade without regard to human feelings. Although written in 2003, I'm sure this holds true in 2006, and certainly makes me more attentive to news coming out of their continued struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outer Space Bird Feeder","review":"I liked the idea of this feeder.

The close-ups are few and far between and Dave Gahan's typically energized performance isn't given much camera time. The crowd gets more face time than Dave and Martin. It's just attrocious.The sound is not great and it wasn't Dave's best night vocally, but this would have been a great DVD if they had just filmed the band playing. Simple as that.

Set around the adventure to get the car back on the road, the objections of his family and locals over foreign cars and the local scene including racing. The book actually shows a character who has work ethics, a desire to make something of himself and a general love for life. For anyone who enjoys British Sports Cars, has read modern Classics such as 'The Last Open Road' series by Burt Levy, has children interested in reading or automotive fiction or just wants a copy to put back on the shelf after years of missing this classic, I highly recommend 'The Red Car', a book for children of All ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Read for Sports Car Fans of Any Age","review":"Even though I've been a sports car fan since I was a teenager xxx years ago;) and have owned a '74 Triumph TR6 and an '84 Fiero, I never knew about this book until Peter Egan mentioned it in his column in Road & Track magazine. I checked it out of the public library and read it, and was immediately hooked.I saw myself in Hap, surrounded by people who thought anything but a big, wallowing Chevrolet or Ford was a useless luxury (and a car built for six people and only carries around one most of the time is a necessity!?) I could only wish my father had been as understanding as Hap's about having a sports car at sixteen, let alone racing it on public roads.Anyone of any age who ever had to drive a sedan or a minivan when what he really wanted was a low-slung two-seat roadster will enjoy the heck out of this book.

Second it's a good reference when studying military activities abroad. The book has many countries listed with military holdings ie armamemnts and a host of other military equipment from the Air Force to the Marines. The downside of this book it can at times get a little too detailed and hard to interpret because there are many abbriviations when dealing with the military, although there is an index of acronyms in the back of the book to help I found myself constantly turning to the back of the book.

I found it disappointing and even occasionally insipid. (To be fair, the author's vocabulary occasionally shines and delights with its scope.) Lilac is portrayed as an independent woman who prefers to follow her own path; this is admirable. However, halfway through the book these same qualities begin to make her seem like an unreasonable and disagreeable twit with no depth or intuitive perception whatsoever. Interestingly, while the author's name, Dara Joy, sounds distinctly feminine, there are several passages scattered throughout the text that sound as if they are written by a man attempting to assume a female point of view. On the plus side, the cover art is lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't find any redeeming points in this book.","review":"I've read five or six Dara Joy books and I've been determined to give her a chance as so many others enjoy her work but this book genuinely upset me. As on reviewer noted 2 of the sex sceens bordered on rape and that should never be viewed as acceptable. Love making or even sex should not be done b/c the man is angry and wants to take it out on his wife. Never. After that I lost interest.Even the references to Knight of A Trillion Stars sucked. I don't like weak women especially when they are paired with controlling men and thats what Lilac and Rejar were. And then you have the Lorgin and Deanna Reference from Knight where he's just so domineering. What self respecting woman wants a man to rule her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a Disapointment!!!","review":"I was excited to read this after Mine to Take but it was not even close to it.

I didn't find Rejar's mate Lilac as likeable as I hoped but I still very much enjoyed the story and am now reading Mine to Take the third in the series. A nice escape from reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just okay.....","review":"This was a pretty good one, I guess. I didn't like it as much as DJ's 'A Knight Of A Trillion Stars' though. I had a problem with the fact (like so many other novels I've read) that the heroine was so obnoxious to the hero that I don't see why he kept trying with her. However, it did have a number of fun scenes in it, some really good secondary characters, and very hot love scenes. I would almost suggest reading it though just for the scene (no spoiler!) at the 'afternoon of embroidery'... ohmygosh.... I laughed out loud!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rejar will be REISSUED!!!","review":"A Good Message to all of you who are desperately waiting for Rejar to be reissued:It will be out in April 1999, I asked at Dorchester Publishing.This book is just great, there's nothing to add to the other reviews, Rejar is the bomb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dara Joy has just become my favorite author","review":"I just finished reading Mine To Take, then read Rejar. I know I read these kind of backwards but beleive me it did not matter in my enjoyment. Both books were wonderful. I can't recommend this series highly enough. The depths of these books boggles the mind when you read them together and see what she has done. Thank you Dara for such an unforgettable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Stars For Rejar,Lilac who??","review":"After reading all three books in this series,I must say the men are to die for. The woman should have been killed. But maybe its the fact that the mens charecters are soo hot,it would be hard to make a female as interesting. All in all I loved the books,thought they were funny and well wrote,if a little vauge on some of the plots. Iam waiting for the next novel of Traed and possibily one of the parents also. Hopefully it will be soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A FEAST FOR THE SENSES","review":"This is a superbly written book with the unique twist of combining Regency England with a science fiction sub-plot. The characters are so well engineered that they almost jump off the pages. I always feel like I am watching a movie when reading one of Dara Joy's books, which is a great compliment to her talent. Rejar is a simply wonderful, unforgettable character who steals your heart. Underneath his wild cat ways beat a sensitive kind heart that will have you aching to stoke this kitty. I enjoyed watching his relationship with Lilac, a true Regency miss, flourish and grow and I have a feeling we will see more of this relationship in future books. I can't wait to see what she does with this story or any story she writes. She has become my favorite author and I treasure each and every one of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"First book by her","review":"I've never read anything by Dara before, but I probably will again! This book was really good and I really liked Rejar."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Dara Joy brought a hero to life that was so amazing that I wish I could have one just like him myself. A must for anyone that enjoys romances with a lot of zip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's done it again!!","review":"She's done it again! I don't know how Ms.Joy does it, but this one is another winner! This was the second Matrix of Destiny book that i read, (I read Mine To Take first ) and I am totally \\"hooked\\" on them.I can't wait for the next one ! These are books that I am going to keep and re-read , my friends aren't getting these! Maybe in one of her furture books,Ms Joy could write about a female familiar, (perhaps how Rejar's mother and father got together.) This book was captivating. Like Mine to Take, I just couldn't put it down!Please give us more like these and the sooner the better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Although the concept of a sexy familiar traveling through time sounded very appealing, I was so disappointed. I understand that there must be some sort of tension in a love story, but the heroine Lilac was so irritating I couldn't understand why Rejar just didn't say forget it! I felt absolutely no chemistry between the two characters at all. I guess Lilac was supposed to be a spitfire living under the strict mores of Regency England, but she just seemed like an immature brat. In fact, she acted so much like a child I found the sex scenes disturbing. It was like Rejar was trying to seduce a little girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down to the heroine in this book","review":"I really enjoyed the other two Dara Joy books I have read, Knight of a Trillion Stars and Mine to Take. I liked the women in those books. I just wanted to slap the female lead in this story. What on earth does Rejar see in her???? She has no imagination or sense of adventure. She was totally boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I bought this book because amazon.com recommended it. I found it overflowing with sex scenes with no build up! I was disappointed. The otherworldliness was poorly covered, too. Not for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing..","review":"Rejar, with the exception of the last 6 chapters, was a disappointment to me. Compared to the 1st book and the 3rd book, it was by far the weakest when it comes to the story, plot, & the supporting new characters. It lacked emotion and depth which was mainly due to the chemistry with Rejar & his chosen mate Lilac. The setting in 1811 England, just did not work at all with this type of story premise. I am not sure if I will continue reading this series or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read but ended a little rushed!","review":"This was the first Dara Joy book I have read. I love Familiar books and this was a really good, quick read book. I would have given 5 stars except, I felt the story gets carried into many not important areas at the beginning so that when the end came I felt it was rushed.Recommended for anyone who truly loves this type of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money spent","review":"I've read all 3 of the Matrix of Destiny books and have to say, of the 3 this is the worst. That is a stretch considering the other 2 aren't particularly good either. Mine to Take was the best of the 3 and I'd only give it 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not good enough!","review":"THE BEGINING WAS VERY AMUSING BUT AS IT GETS ON I JUST DON'T FEEL THE ROMANCE ANYMORE. THE SEX IS PRETTY MUCH CONSTANT BUT THE HEROINE'S CHARACTER WAS WAY TOO CHILDISH. SHE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK. SHE'S NOT VERY EXCITING OR UNDERSTANDING LIKE THE OTHER FEMALE IN DARA JOY'S OTHER BOOK. THE GIRL JUST LEFT ME COLD AND SORRY FOR THE GUY. WELL, THE GUY IS VERY SWEET AND TRIED TO WOO HER FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END. AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A CHALLENGE TO HIM BUT THEN IT BECOMES A LOVE CHASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CUTE. ALTHOUGH HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER, THE ONGOING OF HIS MASCULINITY IS VERY ANNOYING IN THE HEROINE'S POINT OF VIEW. IT MAKES ME THINK SHE'S LUSTING AFTER HIM. BUT ANYWAY, I FIRST I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT STILL IT LEFT ME UNCERTAIN OF THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER. IF IT WAS ANY OTHER HEROINE, THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE PULL IT OFF EASILY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Teriffic!","review":"I can't say enough good things about this author. Even though I have read the books in this series, I haven't missed out on a thing. This book was wonderful. I started reading it during a windstorm that eventually knock the power out. I had to light six candles to continue reading it and I wasn't disappointed. The characters seem so read that I laughed and cried right along Rejar and Lilac. This book was a ture delight to read. A MUST READ for any Dara Joy fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REJAR, A CAT???? COME ON!!!!!!!!","review":"I admit it I bought this book because of the hunk on the cover, however when I found out he was a cat???? Well, please, that is realistic...I know this is suppose to be a fantasy of sorts but borders on the rediculous. And the heroine, she is not to bright...not much else to say about this book...even the love scenes weren't that great. If I were to describe this book the word, WEIRD..comes to mind...oh, well, to each his own.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot but a bit confusing","review":"Well this book is very hot when it comes to the love scenes. I was just a bit confused about the character of Rejar. I think that you really need to read the preceding book or books to get who he is. I liked the fact that he was both human and cat, I'm partial to cats. But it was a bit confusing on how he ended up in Regency England. I liked the secondary characters of Traed and I look forward to his book. I also enjoyed the older brother Lorgin and his wife and I will have top buy thier story. This was a very good book but I think it will make more sense when I read the others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!!!","review":"I read this book a few years back and could not forget it. When I first read Dara Joy's Knight of a Trillion Stars I thought it was funny and sexy. But when I picked up Rejar, 'Knight' could not compare. Looking forward to Dara's new one, Ritual of Proof. Hope it is as sexy and funny as Rejar. I read Dara's other books she wrote in-between and they were ok, but Rejar. I cannot say his name enough. Hope to see more of him real soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd in Matrix of Destiny Series-Hot!","review":"This is one of Dara Joy's hottest books and best heroes in my opinion. Take a mischevious, rakish, shapeshifter who's gorgeous and not used to denying himself any sexual satifaction, and drop him in the middle of Regency England. Give him a fascination for a virginal Regency miss and watch the fur fly! It's funny! It's a great read! It's got some secondary characters you'll fall in love with as well. Definitely a must read if you like romance tied to Fantasy. Dara Joy just gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Given all the hype about her, I was expecting something more from Dara Joy. While there were entertaining scenes, I found the prose, and the characters to be irritating. References to \\"said cat\\" leaped out at me through out the first half. The secondary characters seemed to be constructed of the flimsiest cardboard, and, once you got past the gimmick of the book (shape-changing alpha-male alien woos Regency England babe), the plot seemed very unimaginative. My wife says the next one is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the Heroine","review":"This was my first Dara Joy book. I have to admit the love scenes aren't too bad, and it had one hilarious part where the heroine accidentally blurts some bedroom secrets between herself and Rejar.Overall, the entire book was really boring. The heroine grated on my nerves. Rejar was such an interesting character I wish more could have been done to match him up with a better mate.There were indeed a lot of \\"Knight of the Trillion Stars\\" references which I later skimmed in a bookstore to understand some things from this book. I thought Rejar's mate was annoying, his half-brother's mate was ten times more irritating.Despite all that, I decided to give Dara Joy another chance and went to buy \\"Mine to Take\\". Dara Joy's ideal heroine appears to not to be on my personal liking list. It's a shame because all her Hero's appear to be interesting characters.I don't believe I would ever buy another Dara Joy book again. And I would never recommend her to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a peek","review":"A good book that gives a peek into the Kalis Ilustrisimo system. It would be impossible to show the finesse and level of efficiency and effectiveness of this system other than experiencing it under a qualified instructor. The level of development of this Art is impossible to capture in still photography, the finer (and most important) aspects are literally \\"lost in print\\". Still, this is very useful to the beginner wanting to get a glimpse, though for further study I would recommend training under Tony Diego."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I truly did not care for this book as a textbook. It reads more narrative style and it is very difficult to find information quickly. The author makes some great points, but the book as a whole is poorly organized and written. In my course evaluation, I suggested the professor discontinue the use of this book. This is one of the very few textbooks from graduate school that I don't mind reselling. We used this in conjuntion with Nancy Helm-Estabrooks' Aphasia Manual, which was a much easier read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned the Kindle edition","review":"I looked \\"inside this book,\\" which gave me a view of the Table of Contents. I liked what I saw, because there was a decent chapter on transcortical motor aphasias, on which I wanted an update. So I ordered and downloaded the Kindle edition, which would be the 2011 edition. There was no chapter on TMA. In fact, all the chapters on specific syndromes were gone. Instead, there appeared to be much more focus on rehabilitation. And chapter 2 is now on \\"Humanistic\\" aspects of language disorders, whatever that may mean.So, if you're sizing this up for a Kindle purchase, be forewarned: the TOC you get in the preview of the 2004 edition is radically different from the one you will receive. I have ordered a used copy of the 2004 edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"Don't be fooled by this nonsense.

I've watched many a season of cartoons with my children from Ben-10 to Scooby Doo and this was by far the most satisfying. There is a real plot and the writers have taken time to get the audience invested in the characters. In addition, the animators seem to have taken a lot more chances as the season progressed and the final run of episodes have some really imaginative and clever artwork and framing. In particular, the close up framing of the characters faces from the amazing shots of Mum-Ra to the horrified and shocked faces of Lion-O et al are brilliant and very unusual for a prime-time cartoon.

This Back to Mine album and Groove Armada's legendary Vertigo are not even in the same class.I'm a big fan of Groove Armada, and even though this is a compilation mixed from other artists' tracks, I am disappointed that their name is on the cover.Back to Mine is a good series. They get great DJ's to actually MIX their own selection of tracks. Mixing adds a unique flavour to an industry (i.e. chillout/ambient albums) that is overly saturated with subpar releases.Regardless, this is not one of the better Back to Mine albums. The track selection is horrible and stale. We all love Barry White and Al Green, but their particular tracks do not gel well with the others on this album. One may argue that the ablum is eclectic. This is true, but eclectic tracks don't work well if they lack even a little chemistry (other than just a slow tempo). I expected much more from this pair of very talented Brits.2/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groove Armada Spins","review":"The duet of Groove Armada -- with their mix of subtle horns, deep bass grooves, and fusion of unique lyrics -- is behind this elcetic compilation of tracks. It should be noted that this is *not* their original music. Fans looking for an introduction to G.A. will be much better off purchasing the groups \\"Vertigo\\" album. This is part of the 'Back to Mine' series where the group is asked to select, and mix songs that have influenced them in the past. A few tracks such \\"Description of a Fool\\" and \\"Stanway's Revenge\\" are great inclusions and you can see why G.A. picked them to appear on this album, however many of the other songs were disappointing at least in this reviewer's opinion. Moving in Stereo - d.i.roberts"},{"rating":"1","title":"They've done so much better","review":"For people expecting the chill, downtempo, easy foot-tappin' harmony of \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Back to Mine\\" doesn't quite measure up.

For those listeners new to Groove Armada, I would recommend going straight to \\"Vertigo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kemps Second Success","review":"\\"Shadows Witness\\" (The first full book featuring Erevis Cale) was surprisingly good. Surprising, because Forgotten Realms novels have been with few exceptions pretty weak in my opinion.Kemp provides another excellent novel about Erevis and does so by providing extremely interesting characters.

It is a beautiful book, but does not give any detailed directions (I'm even confused by some of the projects!) However, I do like the jig patterns in the back of the book.

It's especially powerful if you've read the whole series. I often tell people that one of the reasons I love this book so much is because by book 8, you know these characters so well that L.M. Montgomery doesn't have to explain things to you. She just mentions a simple event and it's heart-breakingly beautiful (for those of you who know this story, I'm thinking about Walter bringing her flowers in place of Jem...).

In the beginning Rilla a frivolous, nonambitious girl who only wants the most fun life can give her. She knows nothing of the sorrows or horrors of life, beyond her worries of who she'll dance with...This book tells the story of Rilla's life during the horrrible, \\"war to end all wars\\".

L.M Montgomery has done an absolutely splendid job bringing to life the red-headed girl with a fiery temper to match, but the farther I progressed into the series, the more disappointed I became. For me, the series became monotonous and depressing; the war kills Anne's beloved child, and I cannot help but despair in the numerous times Anne is mentioned with streaks of gray hair, and wrinkles in her face. This is not the lively girl of Avonlea I have come to so dearly love. So, my advice to you would be to read the first three books, and the first part of the 5th, for the end of the series should not overshadow its timeless, and inexpressibly wonderful beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Don't get me wrong; I LOVE Anne but this book was depressing. Hate it!! I hated the way Rilla treated the baby half the time. It was harsh to hear of starving children and people dying and people being mean to cats, etc etc. Also I found it VERY disturbing the way Rilla doesn't give a fig about her Aunt Marilla, whom she was named after. I guess Marilla died when she was young but her sentiments towards her are very flippant. Marilla played a HUGE role in her mother's life.

This book was such a downer that I wish I hadn't read it - but how could I know I'd wish that until after I'd read it? I loved the first seven books, but if you can stand not to read the final book of a series, I'd recommend skipping this one. It was a real disappointment for me.

This book does not belong in the \\"Anne\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of the series...","review":"This book was good, although more darker than previous installments because World War 1 begins and ends in this book, taking up much of the story. 'House of Dreams' was touched with tragedy, but here it is more central amidst the happenings of the First World War and focuses mainly on Rilla, the youngest child of Anne.I wish this story had centered more on Anne or that there was a ninth installment in this series, because in the last two books, Anne was also downplayed, so the series should have ended on a old but still vibrant Anne."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the most wonderful book I have ever read in my life.","review":"Rilla Of Ingelside was a terrific book.My words can not even describe how great this book was.At first I did not even want to read the book, then after I started reading it I could not put the book down.I ended up reading it in one day.I have never cried over a book before, but I cried over this one.When Anne's son died I could not stop crying.It was as if I could feel the characters pain and agony.This is a wonderful book and I would reccomend it for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"I've enjoyed all the Anne books but this is the best.

At most, it explains the answers to practice questions, but unless I'm going to see that exact question on the test (probably not), that still doesn't help me.If you're an awful test-taker and need strategies, sure, buy it.

I researched my options and this seemed viable (not to mention the dealer recommended it). Upon trying the product, it works OK. It takes a lot of work to get the seat color back and it does not eliminate the leather crease lines (only makes them semi-transparent).

I generally use about once every two weeks. I spray a quantity on a clean microfiber cloth and work the liquid into the seats, leave for a few minutes, then buff off with another microfiber cloth.

I have never actually read a book of this length so devoid of informational content before... Like trying to fill the pages in a mid-term paper, this author just stretches each chapter out, deffering information, shying away from assertions or concrete facts and rules... it all amounts to rambling common sense from someone who had a lucky break directing Men's Warehouse commercials for years and knows nothing else about what it's like trying to break into the industry.

My favourite songs would have to be Masturbating the War God, and Multitude of Foes, the latter which took Dallas Toler-Wade about a year to arrange!However, I am really writing this just to clear something up. Alot have been praising Pete Hammoura's drum work on this album, and while he is a great drummer, it may interest you to know that the only song he actually played on this album was 10 - To Dream of Ur. The rest of the albums drumwork was taken care of by the legendary Derek Roddy. He had never heard the material, and yet, managed to get every track down in just 27 hours!! Awesome work, and he is very often overlooked, as the album just credits him as playing 'Additional Drums'. WTF? Pete Hammoura played ONE song, therefore, making him the one who filled in some 'Additional Drums'. Just wanted to clear that up, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a chill pill, fellas...","review":"This is music? Nile should take a cue from Def Leppard and Bon Jovi (both metal masters of the 80's) and incorporate some actual melody within their music.

Instead of singing about death and destruction, it would be better to write about girls and partying 24 hours a day, just like the members of Def Leppard used to do (I LOVE ROCK 'N ROLL, INDEED!!).This music is simply a joke. Buy it at your own risk.If you do purchase this travesty, take 2 aspirins and call me in the morning.LEPPARD 'N JOVI RULE!!!PEACE OUT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've tried and tried and tried and tried....","review":"...but I just can't understand why this album has gotten so much attention. Sure, it heavy as hell, very technical, and has some very original imagery and lyrics, but the music just isn't that special! Nile's previous album caught my attention with the attempt to create \\"Egyptian\\"-style death metal, and I recognized a lot of potential, but \\"Black Seeds..\\" is very unlistenable. It might deserve more than 2 stars because, for what it is, it IS a solid effort. They create many layers of sound to sort though, but it just isn't very original and ear-catching musically. I feel it by no means should have been voted album of the year by so many critics. If you want to listen to 30+ minutes of superfast guitar, drums at neck-breaking speeds, and undecipherable deep grunts, there are a ton of albums to choose from. I just don't think this one stands out among others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea poorly executed.","review":"I hate to give this band a poor review because I can see that they have potential. The good aspects of this album are their use of Egyptian instruments in order to create interesting atmospheres. Some of the riffs are pretty good, especially those on \\"The black flame\\". The lyrics are also interesting. One problem is that many of the song titles are overthought and just downright ridiculous. The main problem with this band is that they play so fast that their music just hits a solid wall of noise. I think it would be better if the band slowed down and added more grooves to their music. Overall, this is a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE GARBAGE","review":"i bought this title a couple of days ago based on the recommendations of my friends and several reviews posted here. saying that i was incredibly dissapointed and somewhat angered at having spent money on this worthless garbage would be an understatement. words like awesome, powerful, hardcore, and great were the furthest things from my mind when i listened to this CD. Based on the other reviews i would say that these guys have figured out how to cover-up their complete lack of talent by banging their instruments really fast and appealing to those that consider metal played with any kind of talent too 'mainstream' for them. If ur looking for a good death metal band try morbid angel or napalm death, if u wan't to waste ur money and know nothing about music, then nile is for you...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful... just awful","review":"I am an emphatic death metal fan. I've seen tons of bands live, and own hundreds of CDs in the genre--some of the best and worst. I must say that this CD falls in the latter category. It's pure trash. This is not music; it's noise. The vocals are boring and completely incoherent (as opposed to say, Cryptopsy), and to sum it up briefly, the CD is basically a large, unorganized amorphous that isn't going anywhere. There's really no technicality here. It's just play play play, and hopefully something good will come out of it. It's very similiar to Morbid Angel. The songs are just played, not felt.Want some real death metal? Go with Suffocation's \\"Pierced from within,\\" Cryptopsy's \\"Whisper Supremacy,\\" either album by Carnal Forge, Napalm Death's \\"Inside the Torn apart,\\" Deicide's \\"Once upon the Cross,\\" or for more purity, try Vader's \\"De Profundus.\\"AIM - Infinity Driven"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, lets bash our faces into concrete to this nonsense!","review":"This album is just plain horrible.

I figured that since I already listen to bands like Dissection, Marduk, Cannibal Corpse and Carcass, to name a few, I wouldn't find this especially brutal. Was I in for a surprise or what?This is without a doubt the most brutal death metal album I've ever heard, period. Listen to a song like \\"Chapter For Transforming Into A Snake\\" and you'll know what I mean. At times I even find it to be too brutal. It just seems to me that some of the songs would be better if they slowed down a bit. It's also a bit hard listening to the whole album at once - sometimes it's just too much.Nevertheless, this album deserves five stars out of five possible. Not only do Nile deliver a whirlwind of terror the like of which we've never heard before, they are also original as far as the lyrics go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra Brutal Technical Death Metal Magnifigance!","review":"Nile compose Death Metal in the classic Deicide meets Cannibal Corpse manner.The guitar riffs relentlssly slash through songs like a chainsaw through a raw carcass.Nile mix ear bending tech-thrash riffs with chomping death metal chords.Drums are like fire burning down a wooden house or lava savagegly melting a city into oblivion, blast-beats and super-fast drum rolls peneetrate each track.Vocals are low and guttural,the vocals sound like a malevolent mix between Glen Benton(Deicide) and Corpsegrinder(Cannibal Corpse).Nile Focus on Egyption mythology and deliver it with a powerful smack in the jaw complete with the odd orchestration which enhances the atmosphere of the album.

That honor would belong to one of several releases by Death (the band). But for more brutal, low-growling Death Metal, this is hard to beat.The Egyptian imagery is nice, I guess, but I don't take it too seriously. Still, it's nice to see them avoid gore (never my favorite DM topic) or anti-Christian stuff (which is way overdone). Musically, it's both brutal and complex and always holds my interest. Nile is one of the best Death Metal acts around as we enter the '00's."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great introduction to death metal","review":"Well, I've recently been delving into the realm of death metal, and this album, my introduction to Nile, is more than satisfactory. (I would have liked to give this four-and-a-half stars, but that was not possible, so I gave it a four.) Forget what you hear about all death metal sounding the same! Sure, it may be less distinguishable than thrash metal (the ultimate genre), but each song by Nile has its own unique appeal. Combine double electric guitars with a triple vocal onslaught (a la Cookie Monster), add some middle-eastern flavor and top it all off with lyrics taken from ancient Egyptian manuscripts, and you've got this album. It's not the best album, even for death metal (that would be the brilliant 'Whoracle' by In Flames), but if you're bored having just mainstream thrash, industrial and nu-metal and want to hear something different, I highly recommend 'Black Seeds'."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book","review":"A very good book with several important information about history and evolution of plants.

It moves back and forth in time between the childhood of Kenzie, who grew up with alcoholism and abuse, and her present-day struggle, as an adult, to reconcile with her past and her own alcoholism. The writing transports the reader into the horrifying world of addiction and abuse, and honestly captures how it is perceived by, and affects, children.

I had to put it down and do something distracting quite often while reading this because of the overwhelming depressing feelings it created. And while I understand that forgiveness is great, I felt like the main character was very weak and flawed in that she HAD to forgive her father to get on with her own life. She used her past as a crutch and that's just so very depressing to me. So, spoiler alert, in the end nothing grand happens.

I had to put it aside and not finish because of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of alcohol abuse","review":"This story definitely revolved around an abusive father with alcoholism. It described the emotional issues to children and how they are affected as adults. Not a particularly uplifting story, but very realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read...","review":"This was fantastic reading. Ms. Mc Fadden's style of writing is such that it captivates you from the very first sentence. It made me think about my relationships with my family and friends and has changed my life for the better. A definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Powerful Storytelling!","review":"Bernice L. McFadden wrote a book a few years ago called Sugar that got my attention. With, The Warmest December, she did the almost impossible by elevating her writing to the next level. Although a very painful-to-read story about abuse due to being an alcoholic, Bernice L. McFadden weaves a totally powerful, believable, and unforgettable story. Ms. McFadden moved away from the popular \\"sista-girls\\" stuff to write a story about hate, love, understanding, and, ultimately, redemption. As hard as it was to read some of the things that happened to the Lowe family, I guarantee you won't be able to put this one down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, haunting but a good story","review":"Everyone has met people like Kenzie, Malcolm, Della and Hy-Lo. This is the story a a little girl, who grows up, not understanding the reasons for her self abuse, her alcoholism and her never ending hatred for her father, Hy-Lo. As she watches him on his death bed, she recalls the beatings and name calling shared with her brother by their father.McFadden paints a vivid picture of abuse and alcoholism that remains with the reader long after you have finished the story. I crid with every page turned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"A little hard to get into but then the characters came alive and it was hard to put down. Story of redemption and forgiveness for someone who did you wrong but ultimately forgiveness for your own faults. Feel good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but a bit depressing","review":"This highly emotional story describes the devastating effects of alcoholism on three generations. Well written and a quick read. I would have liked to read more about Kenzie as an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful writing!","review":"First but not the last Bernice McFadden book I will read. Aside from the content of the story, this is the best writing style I have encountered. She doesn't waste words, her writing truly connects you to the story - almost like reading poetry. The story is a glimpse into an abused family at the hands of an alcoholic father and a disconnected mother. I didn't find the story all that shocking as other reviews have indicated but it certainly was realistic. If not interested in reading this particular content matter, do yourself a favor and experience this author in another of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice easy read.","review":"This is a nice book. Emotion is thick if you can relate to the subject matter. If you can't, she gives you a very vivid picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Writer","review":"As I expected, The Warmest December is a very gooood book. Bernice McFadden can tell a story. When I started this book, I couldn't put it down until I finished the entire book. The theme reminded me of Gal, by Ruthie Bolton. Can't wait for her next one. Thanks for a well written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat!","review":"I like the writings of Bernice McFadden, but this isn't one of them. It is a very detailed story of the pains and misery of alcoholics. The author explicitly describes the torment and affliction of the disease. I think she did a great job with that, but the overall reading of the book was a chore. I think Ms. McFadden was bending the elbow when she wrote this one; it's not one of her best. She as done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning !","review":"\\"The Warmest December\\" details the turbulent life of a family destroyed by abuse and alcoholism. Kenzie Lowe, the eldest child of the family narrates the story. A host of strong, believable characters carry the story as the author carries the reader from one traumatic event to the next. Throughout the novel, Kenzie struggles to free herself from a past of secrecy and cruelty that has her encased. This is a powerful story of survival and ultimately forgiveness. I read, I cried, I got angry, I laughed. I anxiously awaited the death of the father only to feel sadness and empathy for him when he died. This is my first read by McFadden and I'm greatly impressed by her near flawless writing and story telling ability. I'm looking forward to reading more of her work. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The warmest December","review":"Understanding enough to be able to forgive is first real step to a true and strong sobriety.

This was right up my alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding versus Judgment","review":"After reading the first 50-75 pages of Ms. McFadden's novel, The Warmest December, this reader increasingly had reservations about being able to complete the book, being familiar with the traumas associated with domestic violence. The hook, however, that brought this reviewer to the end of the story, was threefold: (1) the author's character development that continually evolved throughout the novel; (2) her unique descriptive phrasing--\\"My words hung thick in the air around me\\"; and, (3) an ability to tell a passionate story that conveys the dynamics of abuse, a perspective that places understanding ahead of judgment, particularly if you hope to intervene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thing I have bought in a long time","review":"i used to own all the episodes from downloading them bu onc i got the cash i got the dvd for sweet sound and great video quality. it was worth every penny, i highly encourage you to buy this dvd, the commentary was awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"how could you not own this","review":"the only reason not to buy this DVD is the fact another one comes out in approx. six months with the 3rd [and possibly final] season amended to it.owning the episode 'wasted talent' is more than enough reason to own this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Show Ever, Even Better Than \\"News Radio\\"","review":"When I first saw these episodes on television, I laughed so hard I cried.

Of course, even if it was only ok youd have to buy it because family guy is turning into a classic TV series. This volume of family guy and 28 total episodes, seven from the cut-short first season, all of which are surprisingly funny. But then it really gets histarical when the second season (discs 2-4) come in.I really dont need to say much. Its family guy, so you know its going to be funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Guy: Why did it stop?","review":"Sadly Family Guy was cancelled after only three short seasons, but the lasting effects are incredible. First off, no show, short of Sout Park, makes me laugh as hard. Not so much for the language remarks, but other hidden symbols that you may not pick-up the first time you see an episode, that is why you must buy the set.I would have loved to see Family Guy go for at least five seasons so Seth could show his true span of genius. Aside from that, many people say, \\"Oh, I don't want to watch that show because it is just stupid toliet humor and dirty jokes.\\" Well, partly yes, but when isn't a dirty joke funny? I find this show funnier that the Simpsons, for instance, because it uses more references towards others incuding celebrities, politicians, and actions that many of us do day by day. Over all, these things make you step back and laugh about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Guy will always be classic","review":"Seth McFarland really put some fantastic, ironic, biting jokes in Family Guy. Everytime I watch an episode, I see something new, something that makes fun of sitcoms, drama, Fox, the Simpsons, Men, women, etc. It's fantastic! Equal-opportunity sarcasm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Home DVD","review":"I was introduced to the Family Guy and knew I had to have the DVD's. The show is priceless--simple, if you're offended, if you don't like it, don't watch it! Otherwise, it has quality writing, funny hidden messages and its much better than any ratings-hungry low- quality show on t.v. today!The visual quality at times is not great--black, blurry lines scurry accross the screen--but afterall, I didn't buy this for the DVD quality! I suggest this DVD to everyone who isn't afraid to SOMETIMES think outside the box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks, basically","review":"You can try all you want to pretend the Family Guy is'nt a sad, low-brow ripoff of the Simpson's but you'd be living in denial. It speaks volumes about a show when, by far, the most interesting character is the familiy dog. You might laugh here and there in between the celebrity cheap-shots and painfully typical movie parodies but I would'nt hold my breath. Bottom line: the Family Guy is to the Simpson's, as Go-Bots were to Transformers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I guess Family Guy has some funny moments, but I completely agree that Family Guy is a complete copy of The Simpsons. I think for the most part it's pretty boring and never makes you laugh nearly as much as the Simpsons.

It's probably (I hope) been said before, but this is such a Simpsons rip off, I just can't understand why anyone would be into it. It's like a dumb version of the Simpsons with all the worst aspects of the later years of the Simpsons and none of the good stuff. It tries so hard to be controversial and shocking, it's rather sad and transparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Simpsons Rip-Off!!","review":"I just heard that Fox is bringing this show back on the air in 2005. Why?! This show is just a rip off of The Simpsons! I kid you not, many of the jokes in the first season were shamelessly stolen from the Simpsons. For example, on many occasions, Dale suddenly and very quickly falls to the ground, but this is a joke that was done on the Simpsons a hundred times! When I first saw this on Family Guy I didn't laugh but rolled my eyes instead.This is not where it stops. Even the circus themed opening credits came from one of the opening themes of a Simpsons episode!If I want a laugh, I'll watch the Simpsons. If I want racy comedy, give me South Park. If I want to see the same jokes years later that I've seen so many times they arn't funny anymore, Family Guy takes the gold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesque and Childish","review":"It's best jokes are funnier than the jokes on \\"The Simpsons\\".

But, like its predecessor, the show is overly grotesque.If you want to see some intellegent comedy, with bite to it, that has something to say, check out \\"Mr. Show\\".

I hope many people realzie that Family Guy is really disgusting and violent. violent in animation is the last thing this world needs, because things are bad enough as it is. Please do not release anymore Family Guy DVDs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The rise and fall of western civilization","review":"Many years from now when someone huddled in a smoking crater asks me how it all started, I'll be sure to bring up this show. The main point of the writing seems to be to allow people of average to low IQ to feel smug and superior by presenting them with a oafish strawman, easily dismissed, and easily mocked. Want to be an off-the-shelf elitist? Want to be faux-clever? Want to have an ersatz and vague sense that you are an insider? This just may be the show for you. The humor is artless and unsubtle. The characters are presented in the most unsympathetic and border-line sadistic light. To summarize: entertainment by and for idiots."},{"rating":"2","title":"family fuy Vol. 1\`\`","review":"Hilarious and entertaining. Anyone who enjoys the Simpsons won't be able to stop watching Family Guy. Stewie grows on you and you'll wish they wouldn't have cancelled the show"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY times 2.","review":"This is one of the funniest show's that was ever shown on T.V, more clearer Adult Swim and also originally FOX. This whole series is about a big fat guy named Peter Griffin and his family he has a sexy wife, one unsatisfied daughter, one huge son with an intrest in art, a killing baby son, and a smart talking dog. This box set has more than 20 episodes which take up season's 1 and 2. Funnier then the simpsons and futarama, and I do not suspect that this is for children unless they know anything about puberty or at least went threw it. With it's unlimited line of humor this is by far the funniest series/show's on earth. If you can't get enough of this show there is also season 3 thats out right now. And also heard that season 4 is coming out in the year 2005 so wait until then to see some new episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Right!!!","review":"As often happens with the truly amazing shows, propper recognition is posthumously awarded. Well, \\"Family Guy\\" is not the exception to the rule. For so long I thought I was alone in my love of this show. It warms my heart to find others who mourn its loss. First, I'd like to say that the other reviews were Too Right!!! There is little I could add ... but, I'll try. Yea; the closest analogy would be the illigitimate love child of the Simpsons and South Park, but as has been stated, there is so much more to it. The show's format is not so much a structured program, as a train of thought. As in a daydream (or, I'm told, a good trip), it wanders from one random subject to another, swinging back to a psudo-reality only when absolutly necessary. Add that to its razor wit and a PC reverence on a level with an Eminem -book on tape- reading of The Idiot's Guide to The Satanic Verses, and you have a gem that fans cherish and networks cancle..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hey Tom!

There's Stewie, the one year old bent on world domination as well as committing matricide. And Brian, the booze drinking intelligent dog, who talks. This is not to mention many of the colourful charachters all araound Quahog, like Quagmire, Joe, or even the Mayor Adam West.Sit back for one of the funniest shows ever made...Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cartoon ever.","review":"The humor in this series was so witty and intelligent. I really wish Fox could of kept it going. I heard serveral different reasons as to why it was cancelled. Whatever it was, it's a shame, because this show was genius. A must own on DVD. I hope to see season 3 and 4 arrive on DVD too. I imagine they will because this DVD set will sell very well. While I give credit to The Simpsons, I feel The Family Guy was better. It's to bad it did not appeal to a wider audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD","review":"After waiting patiently for this DVD to come out I'm starting to see that it won't be as great or complete as I'd expected. While it will be great to have one the best t.v. shows in history on DVD..I've yet to see that the Christmas episode is included with this set and that was definately during the first two seasons! From what I've read: The US version will NOT have all the first and second season episodes..some are likely held back to bundle in the second set..this of course means more(not necessary)waiting time! Go to Family Guy Files and check it out. And it's been censored no matter what..I know the UK says the DVD is uncut but apparently Fox removed some material(Bin Laden)BEFORE sending it to the BBFC for them to review so it was never technically censored by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest show ever made.","review":"I've been watching Family Guy ever since it debuted on Fox in 1999. Back then, I couldn't believe that a show could possibly be this hilarious. Nevertheless, I still feel the same way. Family Guy's humor is very random and off-the-wall, so I don't expect everyone to like it, but saying that you hate this show because it's a \\"Simpsons rip-off\\" is completely stupid. First off, Family Guy is funnier than Simpsons could ever be. And secondly, Family Guy only has one or two similarities to The Simpsons, so I'd hardly call it a ripoff. Don't listen to those ignorant idiots who claim stuff like that.In conclusion, this is the funniest DVD collection ever. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best comedy show of all-time. There, I said it.","review":"I've always considered Family Guy to be what The Simpsons should have been. Family Guy works because it never sheds its roots as an offensive show with unique characters that is the king of obscure references. To be honest, I don't get many of the jokes because I didn't watch as much TV as Seth Macfarlane growing up. Regardless, everyone with a pulse can find at least one brutally funny character on the show. Also, the running jokes on the show work amazingly well, something you rarely see in today's era of TV. It is a shame that Fox cancelled this show after only three seasons (especially considering the first season was only 6 episodes). I'm so happy it's coming back thanks to people buying this exceptional DVD.I encourage everyone who is breathing to pick this up- you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Guy Vol.1 & 2","review":"Good video. Have only been watching Family Guy for a short while.Good to see the beginning of when the show started."},{"rating":"2","title":"worst career move ever","review":"purchasing this dvd box set was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. Even as I sat in front of my laptop watching episode after hilarious episode, I could faintly hear the sound of all my ambitions and dreams come tumbling down around me. Within fifty-two hours of the fateful package from Amazon.com arriving in my university mailbox, I had watched all 28 episodes at least once, the eight with commentary twice (once without, once with) and all the special features. that's roughly 14 hours, or ten hours more than I ended up sleeping during that period. If you have anything important to do, I urge you, do not buy this product. However, if you love non-sequiteur, surrealist comedy and you won't be too saddened by, say, flunking genetics, buy this box set. Buy this box set if it's the last thing you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! A MUST GET FOR ANY FAMILY GUY FAN!","review":"These episodes for Family Guy on DVD are AWESOME! I would say the Season 3 DVDs are a little bit more funny than the Season 1 and 2 DVDs but also with more adult jokes. Any fan of Family Guy should get all 3 Seasons on DVD. I've seen every episode about 5 times each but they are still hilarious! (I even notice some new jokes every time I watch an episode again)! This show NEVER gets boring and will keep anyone laughing for a long time. Probably even people who haven't seen a single episode will fall in love with Family Guy (I did and now I'm a big fan)."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad they are out on dvd!!","review":"I LOVE this crazy family.I'm sure that some of the topics/comments were far too inflammatory for a lot of the population,but as for me?

Brian drunk,and Stewie in love are not to be missed.In order to enjoy this kind of humor,you have to leave PC at the door,and just go with it.There are far more un-PC-shows on the tube today.This show makes fun of all of them,and does it so well.If you decide to get this set,and the next,prepare to laugh your collective un-PC butts off at Stewie and Brian.Don't miss them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as #@$%","review":"Seth McFarland is proven a comic genius with this show and i never appreciated his work until I bought the DVD on a whim.

A great show like this deserves more than 50 episodes. Thanks for all the laughs Mr. McFarland!Favorite Episode: All of them are funny and great; a 50 way tie as of now.PS: Thanks fox for canceling the two best cartoons ever: Futurama and Family Guy.

About 20 minutes an episode, so you get A LOT. Plus, the dvd is only 35 bucks, while most other animted dvds and such are 30 dollars. Like dbz, which has you pay 30 bucks for 3 episodes. This movie though gives you your moneys worth, with almost a dollar and 50 cents an episode. You also get tons of laughs from Peter, and uhhhh, tons of laughs from Peter.Most still love the Simpsons, yea. Anyone can agree that the Simpsons have lost their touch.

The picture quality was perfect.

Y'all must be viewing these on the crappiest, smallest television set in the world not to be complaining about it! The footage is so badly interlaced that you can notice it on even small, standard definition television sets. I don't see this problem nearly as bad when it airs on television. Don't buy this, you'd be better off recording it on-air and then clipping out the commercials. I might just do that myself.Aside from the dvd quality, the actual show itself I find to be quite hilarious. I bought all eight of the released volumes, but I've only watched the first one so far.

I'm not sure that people take this show serious enough as a stand alone show, not a Simpsons knock off. Though there are parallels Family Guy did things as a cartoon that the Simpsons would never touch, in subject matter and satire. The witty approach that Matt Groening uses to weave his characters while making you feel attached yet amused by the characters, where as McFarlane suceeds in making characters only suitable for those with the comedic tastes of a two-year olds, such as my self. Everything about these DVDs is great except for the commentary which I found to be quite lacking in every since. Somehow this commentary stuck me as the commentary for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the special edition, just not very enthralling."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incomplete set","review":"Just a couple quick gripes about this collection: the missing unaired episode from season 2 (which hopefully will show up with the next collection), and, far more annoying to me, a good third of the episodes do not include the intro scene before the theme song. For example, in the episode \\"There's Something About Paulie\\", the episode begins with the theme song, then goes directly to the Mafia guys taking care of the lemon that Peter had bought during the intro! \\"Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater\\" does the same thing, going directly from theme song to the \\"We Only Live To Kiss Your Ass\\" musical number. Cutting a bit out (eg, Stewie smuggling weapons on a plane) because of sensitivity to a national tragedy is one thing. Leaving whole scenes out to (I'm guessing) fit more content per disk is just plain wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"It is a sad commentary that even Fox did not have the coconuts to continue this brilliant comedy.

It was a very funny show and i bought the DVD shortly after it came out. The show itself is excellent, it is a more offensive, edgy version of The Simpsons with it's own style of random humor.The extras are not great. The commentary is terrible and a waste of time to listen to, because they don't say anything particularly funny. The promos are okay, but I saw them back in 98-99.

It has over 600 minutes of entertainment, and I'm finding new jokes in every episode, because I missed them the first time from laughing so hard at the previous joke. Did that make sense?

It's not, which was a little disappointing.I can only hope that Volume 2 has that particular episode, and the rest of season two, as well.

Honestly these first seasons are absolutely terrible, these seasons illustrate how they were trying to borrow from the Simpsons too heavily and not very good at it as well.

First of all, I think this show can't even be compared to the Simpsons because they are both two totally differant shows with differant senses of humor. I respect everything Groening has done with the Simpsons, I mean any show that can stay on the air for 15+ years obviously has a formula that works. I don't think that the Family Guy didn't have that formula, on the contrary, I thought it had many things working for it. I don't beleive The Simpsons pushed the boundries the way FG did, which may explain FG's short-lived airing on FOX. I think right-wing-conservative America just wasn't ready for this kind of humor on national television.

The production of this CD is really not succesfull (possibly explaining the reduced price list). The duet between the late ROSEMARY CLOONEY & BOONE falls flat.On this CD, it would have been nice to hear DEBBY sing songs more lighthearted and uptempto (must everything be produced a la \\"YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE\\" ?This CD is nothing more than a bad collection of granny songs dusted off to sooth drunk uncles who will not leave your home on the 26th after the parties of the 24th - 25th are over.

The short boom is useless.I tested this multiple times, including calling my cellphone and recording it:1) Speak directly to the phone or speakerphone: crystal clear (Philips cordless)2) Speak through the MX505 with the long boom: too soft.3) Speak through the short boom: useless.In conclusion, if you don't mind shouting, this is perfect to cancel background noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics MX505 Headsets","review":"These work great for hands off phone work; helps my multi-tasking.

Two people asked me if I had food in my mouth, the tunnel-syndrome, just unable to hear, on and on and on. Other than that it is impossible to answer your phone and put the headpiece on at the same time. Very \\"cumbersome\\" was a true description.

The sound quality is better than when I am listening to my cell phone normally and people at the other end cannot tell I am using a headset. The earpiece fits comfortable and doesn't give the feeling that it will fall off. The unique design makes it sunglass compatible but difficult with hoop earrings. The only real downfall of the design is the size and colour of the volume and mute controller-at about 2 inches x 3/4 inch x 3/8 inch (in bone colour), you must clip the wire to some piece of clothing to stop the drag from this hugely oversized element-could it not have been made smaller?

Look on the other side of the control where the icon of the microphones are and you will see a slit where you can put a pen tip in and slide the slider over to the right or left. This will increase the volume greatly. This is in the instructions that came with the headset. I do agree it is not the easiest thing to put on quickly.

So I use the self-clean feature to clean out the chamber, go back to iron the shirt and the same thing happens again. This thing got the wrinkles out but deposited dirt on my shirt...brand new out of the box.

Simply put, his material isn't as sharp and surprising as it once was.Apparently, he thinks anything he thinks of and writes down on a napkin is gut-busting funny. Some of it is, but most of it isn't.The best thing \\"Larry\\" could do, recording-wise, is take 2-3 years off, re-focus his delivery, and bounce back with some GREAT material.If he keeps putting out mediocre stuff like this, his star will fade sooner rather than later."},{"rating":"2","title":"the impact of a book on a young child","review":"I read Big Tree as an elementry student in the late 1960's.

CLAMP are such wonderful artists, and the plot is really good (You never would have guessed the ending!). The problem I have with this manga(just a tiny one) is that they like to repeat things alot, especially when they are talking. I know its just to get a point out so its not confusing, but it gets a teensy bit annoying ^^;;. I do suggest you buy this manga, and keep in mind that Fuu is the best knight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Comparing this to most of the manga I've read, I'd say it's better than decent. The drawing technique is intriguing. The characters are all completely goofy, though, saving the villains and the princess of the magical land Cephiro. This book had me laughing out loud at parts, which is very difficult, and the action scenes were good, if short. The characters were completely opposite in personality from what one recieves in the first impression. The only part that was slightly irritated me was the character attitudes. The characters were constantly comparing this adventure to a video game, and I despise when books or shows insult themselves or compare themselves to another aspect of entertainment. Overall, this book is worth buying. I recommend it for anyone that enjoys Ranma 1/2 and Sailor Moon, because this is pretty much what happens when they clash together."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was so funny!","review":"It was the one of the most funniest manga book I have ever read!

It's in English too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush artwork and an intriguing story to tell","review":"Magic Knight Rayearth is visually stunning -- as fans have come to expect from CLAMP. It also has the emotional depth, philosophical weight, and plot twists that give CLAMP's stories a tone that sets them apart from most \\"children's fare.\\" The artwork is richly detailed and reminiscent of the marvelous work by art nouveau icon Alphonse Mucha. You can live inside these pictures and never want to leave. The tale that unfolds will keep you spellbound as well. These are characters and actions that won't leave you after you put the book down but will find you asking days later \\"What would I have done in that situation?\\" If you want manga storytelling on an epic scale, enter the world of Rayearth."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAMP's work at its best!","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite comic books, American or Japanese.

I would also reccomend Sailor Moon and Card Captor Sakura."},{"rating":"2","title":"MKR rocks!","review":"If you like Anime, then you have to read this! It's my favorite Anime and is (in my opinion) one of the best.

Also, if you've seen the series, you can compare the two and see all the differences there are. Well, happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Too Many Loose Ends","review":"The book is well written and interesting but he leaves too many loose ends. Like Helen Brach's houseman. He says \\"No charges have been brought,\\" but fails to explain anymore. This is one of the more interesting parts. He says \\"no one knows what happened to Brach,\\" and leaves it hangs.Granted we don't know but he makes no attempt to wrap up loose ends. They're hanging everywhere. Granted the case is not solved to any real end. Just speculation but there isn't even notes to that.It just hangs and hangs. Everyone in the book is left hanging without the reader knowing.Good book, lousy ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great page turner!","review":"I thought this book was an excellent account of the Brach murder.

In addition to its essential boring character, I was left wondering why the author didn't bother to learn at least a few basic facts about horses before writing a book centered around horses."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Dud","review":"I disagree with Talib. Although I am not Latina, I speak/understand Spanish. While her Spanish verses flow better than her English ones, she leaves much to be desired. Her rhymes are choppy and some do not make a lot of sense and it becomes blatantly obvious that she only used a particular word or phrase because it was the only thing that she could think of. Her voice sounds like a cross between Rosie Perez and Left Eye hut unlike Lisa Lopes, though G means well, she comes up very short. At many points during the album I feel almost embarassed for her because of her lack of vocal ability and the elementary level of writing skills. Nice try, but you came up short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty terrible...","review":"I really wanted to like her being that she's a latina female rapper from NYC and all, but I just couldn't get into her music.

There are so many people that have already bought this movie online that this new release serves no purpose what so ever.

If you like this movie my advise go and search other asian DVD internet stores. They have a version that you would like better and they come in a 2-disc case loaded with features. But if you did not like this movie then ignore what I wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was an awful movie. I kept waiting for it to get better and then the credits started to roll. I was hoping for something along the lines of \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\" or \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" but this movie does not even compare. Instead it comes off as a cheap knock off of one of these great Chinese movies.The worst part about this movie is the visual effects. It tries to emulate the effects of the two movies I listed above, but it looks like it was done on a $5 budget, making it nearly unwatchable.

The canopys that come standard with most strollers just dont keep the sun off my babies, this shade works so well. It's easy to put on and store and keeps all of the sun off my boys. I like that it has the full shade cover options (great for keeping out pests and creating a dark environment for naps) but I have only needed it as a canopy extension. At first I was disappointed that they only had this product in navy ( I have a black stroller) but its a very dark blue and is so big that the color contrast is not that obvious. I would recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family tent","review":"We got this tent on sale for my husband for father's day and it turned out to be a great buy. We loved the cheerful color and the fact that the door of the tent was tall enough for a grown man to enter while standing up. We recommend that you take the time to practice putting it up and taking it down while in the comfort of your own yard. Once you understand the order that the poles are put in, if necessary, it can be put up by only one person in less than 15 minutes.As with most tents, it was almost impossible to get the tent back in the original box once it was taken out, so we now use an old wheeled suitcase to store and transport it. This works better anyway since it is rather heavy for one person to carry. Like most dome tents, the tent can be set up \\"free-standing,\\" but it works better if pulled taunt by the four stakes in the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the cash","review":"You can always subtract 2 from the 'advertised' capacity, but this was plenty big for our family.

You will either love it or hate it.If you are a sweet chocolate lover and a sweets lover, this might not 'row your boat'.

Music this technically intense isn't an easy task to pull off, yet the tightness of the material is so apparent that Tsjuder makes it sound so natural.

We used these in our basement that has sticky tile/brick flooring. We are having trouble with new eggs hatching, and the regular foggers from the stores weren't cutting it. So I spent a ton of money on these egg killing foggers. Well, they did a good job of killing whatever was alive, but the same day I had more fleas, and weeks later I still have fleas. It didn't get to the eggs. Maybe due to the little cracks in between the tiles. But before I've set off foggers I've bleached and mopped the floor, hoping they'd kill the eggs, and I've fogged 4 times. Nothing has completely worked. We've finally dwindled the flea population to about one or two new arrivals a day. But, maybe more, my poor cats were taken over by them.

My four-year-old is able to use it as designed and hop around on it quite well. My three-year-old is still getting the hang of it. She hasn't quite mastered how to coordinate her body to hop. My one-year-old loves to carry around the ball by the handle. He actually likes it most of all. I do cringe sometimes watching my oldest on it thinking that she is going to get hurt. But, so far she hasn't. The only bad thing is that fresh out of the package, the ball is VERY VERY stinky and also was covered in some kind of oily matter. I just washed it first with warm water and soap and then it was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy, Easy Set-up","review":"We purchased this ball for our kids as they have enjoyed playing with it several times at a friend's house. It is made of a very durable and hefty vinyl material. Our friend's has held up well for several months with a combination of indoor and outdoor use. Set-up of the ball was supper easy. The instructions are clear and the provided needle (if you can call it that) and plug are easy to use and work well. You obviously need to provide your own hand or foot pump to inflate the ball - any ful sized bike pump will do.

It is about the size of a large beach ball - not like the ones I've seen elsewhere, and like we had as kids. But you don't realize it until you inflate it, so not worth it to return them. It seems like it should be too small for our 5-year old - but I have to say she's using it anyway, and still managing to have a great time. So I have increased my original ratings to reflect this.BTW - we got a pink one with completely different pictures (not purple).

As charming as Poppy Montgomery (from TV's \\"Without A Trace\\") is, she does not remotely resemble Marilyn Monroe. Also, the storytelling in this biopic seems frightfully rushed; and it seems at times that the film-makers were frantically trying to condense Miss Oates' book. However, the cast is very talented, and make a good job of it. Overall, 2/5. The production design is the real stand-out, however, especially the re-staging of the \\"Diamond's Are A Girl's Best Friend\\" number from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The song 'Happy Birthday, Mr. President' sang at President Kennedy's birthday part is well done, and (thankfully, rather than making the movie delve into conspiracy theories surrounding Monroe's death) ends the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good acting...but...","review":"all in all a terrific movie, but i don't feel everything was truthful. one scene has joe dimaggio slapping marilyn across the face, and i'm not buying he ever did that. and also, i think this movie overexagerates on her sex life...i don't think she slept around with as many guys as this movie says...but very compelling and in some scenes poppy montgomery actually does look just like her. but overall the best 'marilyn' movie i've seen and i'm a huge fan of hers, but i felt the movie did a small disservice to her memory with these 'bending the truths' a little, especially since she is no longer alive and can't defend herself. so 4 stars, but def. worth getting a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing to learn about Marilyn in this movie","review":"This is based on a fictional book about MM so I tried to pretend it was someone else.

A few (could be more) interesting historical tidbits There's little drama other than a couple exciting parts. The book is mostly all the day-to-day life that readers will recognize in the running of the castle.Refreshingly the author did NOT add to the conflict by extending it to a rivalary with the sis-in-law, bravo!Conflict = Lady want's an annulment to prevent war & death / he distrusts her and his own lust for her.Also, there was no mistress, with the way this story read I just expected some wench to pop up. Again, bravo! I enjoyed it more without those typical frustrations.A good medieval romance - where I could feel the 'medieval' throughout. AND Kendric, an excellent alpha male hero.

There are some people who do not mind this, because it is a medieval romance novel. I try to take the time setting into account, but I just cannot deal with a story where the heroine is punished by being locked away for over two weeks because she angers the hero. I also cannot deal with a jerk of a hero who considers himself the lord and master of everything. He gets angry and punishes the heroine for dealing with a crooked steward(I think it was the steward) without asking permission, locks her in a solar for a time later on in the book, and pretty much treats her like a marionette with him jerking the strings any way he pleases. I guess I am just one of those \\"sensitive\\" readers.

Would you believe World War III?That is the premise of this movie in a nutshell. But don't let the simple plot line summary fool you. This is a great movie.Half the fun of this movie is in watching David Lightman (played by Matthew Broderick) get himself in deep water when he accidentally gets the United States to believe that the Soviet Union is attacking. The other half of the fun is in watching David and his new girlfriend (played by Ally Sheedy) desperately try to find the only person on the face of the earth who can stop the computer (called Joshua) from starting World War III.This is a fun, escapist movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. Don't worry about the plot holes, or the lack of believability in some areas. Just watch the movie for the fun that it is meant to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cold War period film and hacker story","review":"\\"War Games\\" is a great film that is a mix of Cold War science fiction and computer geek adventure. It focuses on a teenager played by Matthew Broderick, who is a computer hacker. One day, he accidentally hacks into a DOD computer system and begins to play \\"games\\" with the computer. This starts off as an innocent prank, but becomes much more serious when the computer refuses to end the game. This eventually sets off an automated response by the NORAD system, which could lead to an unintended ICBM missile launch. I'm trying to avoid any spoilers for those who haven't seen the movie.)As a Cold War period movie, this is a decent story. Most of it is science fiction that could never happen in real life. Real-life Air Force veterans will probably laugh at some of the events in this movie, such as guided tours of NORAD and unmanned missile silos. But the basic tension of nuclear war remains the same.

The TV commercial was so good...and lucky you, the trailer is included on the DVD, so you can see for yourself how well marketed WarGames was in its day.So here we are almost 20 years later, and I have to say I found the movie much more satisfying. I must be softening. You have to like a movie where the kid's playing Galaga in the opening scene. The bloopbleepbleep \\"Shall we play a game?\\" computer voice gives me chills. The good kind.If you look closely, you will see a nerdy Bill Gates. (As opposed to the suave, lady-killer Bill Gates, of course.)

Surprisingly, the storyline riveted my 13 & 14 year-olds despite the antiquated technology. The whole teenager who is doing something silly and funny (tickets to Paris?

Broderick plays a young gamer, who is also a outstanding computer Hacker of his day, who wants to play some new games early before their release. Instead, he accidently taps into a Defense department Computer called WOPER (also called Joshua, by its creator) and he sets off a Wargame that the computer is taking for real. With outstanding cast members of Ally Sheedy, Dabney Coleman, and Barry Corbin as the General this movie is a classic, that has finally been made into blu-ray. It is well worth the money for those of us who still ask, what would happen if Computers ran Amock?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the 80's","review":"This is an excellent movie and one of the first about computers hackers.

Ally Sheedy is awesome, in her supporting role, as Jennifer Mack, David's girlfriend.

Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy have a great amount of appeal and chemistry in the two lead roles, and the supporting cast is alright as well (though it seems unrealistic that so many men in such high places could be such idiots).

To the computer literate, it is about as believable as the average slasher flick -- unfortunately, there weren't many folks who knew any better in the mid 1980's.

Seriously though, if you have a blind date, rent this one and shell do anything you ask, even if she doesnt like you, I swear by this DVD as a date movie, it sets the mood just right.

I love this novel and have a real bone to pick with this 1932 British translation, which refers to the hero-revolutionaries as \\"terrorists,\\" a word which has come to mean something quite horrendous in America. Malraux's writing style is anything but stiff. It's the translator who chose stiff and stuffy words. Where there seems to be a tone of condescention from the translator, there is none whatsoever in the French. If anything, this is a very fluid novel, based on what Malraux considered an American style of novel writing. Fluid, fast-paced, character-driven. Why is this the only translation available to us in the US? Because the publisher probably didn't have to pay a copywright fee to publish this translation. It's a sin of greed -- how ironic when this novel is basically about that very thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man's fate","review":"I read the \\"Shanghai station\\" before and found this book mentioned in the appendix.

Not one to grandstand and parade his virtuosity, Znaider approaches each work in a somewhat laid back way. He makes this look all too easy. With Yefim Bronfman on piano, Znaider is wise to minimize embellishments for the sake of harmony and tonal balance. This is the ideal approach considering RCA's warm sonic engineering since neither the violin nor the piano overshadows the other. Perhaps both Znaider and Bronfman may be considered too \\"old school\\" for some, but for those like me who appreciate a more patrician approach, this interpretation of Brahms' violin sonatas suits us just fine.Overall then: Performance: 4 stars. Recording/Sonic Engineering: 5 stars. Packaging/Presentation: 4 stars. Track Listing: 4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Cookbook that I will really use!","review":"I have so many cookbooks that I look at once or twice and never use. This is not one of those books! I received my book about two weeks ago and have already prepared 5 of the recipes. They were all fast and easy to prepare with ingredients that I already keep in my home. Best of all...My husband and kids loved them, they didn't even notice that they were eating healthy foods. Our Favorite so far is the recipe for Chicken Enchaladas. I have now ordered the first volume of this book and anxiously look forward to receiving it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I adore this book and the first one as well.

The result is an album that has some moments of brilliance and free form, as it's mostly made up of jams and improvisational tracks. In it you can hear the \\"Laid\\" sound in between the lines, but overall I think of it more as the practicing background that helped the band perfect their sound to the point of delivering \\"Laid\\" with the sound it had, rather than an album that had a life of its own. I give it four stars. There are more fundamental albums in the discography of the band. I'd recommend this one only for hardcore James fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong and light","review":"This is a good basic catchers mask that is not to heavy. Offers strong protection.

It fits the bigger size plates just like I needed and doesn't involve sticking something onto my plate which I just didn't want to do, but honestly I had to do a little DIY help to make sure that the springs didn't stretch too much and be in danger of letting the plate slide out - it wasn't hard I just used a little string to tie the two springs together but that's why not 5 stars...."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"This item does not work. I purchased it to hang a platter that is 19.5\\" in diameter and while the hanger did fit when I tried to hang it all it would do is stretch out.

The reviews showed that the springs were too weak for plates. I thought it would work for a metal tray but I was wrong.

The hooks are too large and thick and show too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Houseware plate holder: not so good!","review":"I was really excited to finally find a plate holder of this size.

They feel great, and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape, convenience (no pain, no sticking to clothes, no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning), and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! I like this one because it is hardly noticeable so I can wear it when discretion is necessary, like when I'm around conservative grandparents or in other cases when a 'flashy' belly ring does not seem appropriate. And, it feels to me like something Cindarella would wear, so it gives me a fairy-tale-princess-luxurious thrill as well :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"When I got it, the top ball was a different color than the rest of the ring and had glitter in it.

I read an article about Anne Willan in our local paper, and had to try one of her books. I'm not ready to make the fancy French dishes (although I would like to eat them) so I decided to buy a simple book and practice the basics again.Ms. Willan explains many basic recipes in this volume. This is a nice cook book to give a new cook, or it might be a housewarming or bridal gift. I gave it to myself. I especially like the photos that show how things should look. There are photos of how things shouldn't look too, with explanations about why you got the results you did. I recommend this book if you're beginning for the first time, or beginning again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this album a try -- it rocks!","review":"Unlike much of the music on the radio these days, Michelle Anthony's new album rocks. With a bit of a country twang, the songs on the album are anything but bland and expected. The music is interesting and entertaining. Michelle's vocal quality hooks you in while the lyrics keep your attention. I'd highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fantastic","review":"I found these boots to be kind of narrow in the shaft and in the foot.

The recipes I tried were okay, but nothing special -- unlike the two-volume Art of French Cooking, or Julia Child's Kitchen, where every single recipe is a masterpiece. For example, the pasta was very flat and nowhere near as good as other recipes I've tried. I gave my copies to a charity garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing projector for under $1000","review":"I originally considered the InFocus X1, since it is highly rated and probably 'the' most recommended projector in this price range. However, I am sensitive to the 'rainbow' effect' that DLP projectors are prone to, so I had to turn to LCD. The NEC VT46 has some favorable reviews out there, and it has a shorter throw than the X1, so I decided to pick one up. Wow! The picture is much better than I expected! Despite being a 4:3 projector, it produces an amazing picture with widescreen DVDs. The colors look very natural and the contrast is excellent. The short throw lens and manual zoom allow me to create a huge image from the coffee table, and it's also very quiet so it doesn't intrude on quiet scenes. I don't hesitate to recommend this projector; It has exceeded my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price and quality, until it died within 6 months.","review":"This item failed within 5 months and 9 days.

I'd give this book 6 STARS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as we had hoped","review":"Cute idea and had some points that made sense, but not substantial enough to make it worth the purchase price. My daughter, a voracious reader, read it that afternoon and promptly forgot about it. I also read through it and found it to be \\"light\\". If you have a child that really has serious issues even touching their homework - this may help to start a conversation, but it isn't the answer to the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Name 'Sells It'","review":"How often have I heard from my kids, \\"I hate homework!\\" I even said it, as a kid, myself. I thought this humorous approach was a non-threatening, non-preachy way to introduce some helpful ideas to middle school kids. Hoping that, during less stressful moments, my kids will read it again, just out of curiosity. Although worded \\"their way\\" and humorous, it really does give helpful information and remind kids that they are not alone in homework struggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"My daughter really enjoyed this book, I believe it will help her with getting her homework done. She laughed the whole way through the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information, but a bit over-priced","review":"When I received this book I was surprised at its size. It is very small and I believe a bit over-priced.

EVERY SINGLE ONE. My son immediately identified with this book, and has been reading it out loud to me. He has smiled and laughed and appreciated all of the puns and the humor. Even if he doesn't improve on his homework skills at least he feels more comfortable that he is not alone, that someone 'out there' identifies with him and put into words what he is going through and feeling. I borrowed this from the library but I am putting it into my basket today, because we will need to repeatedly this year.

I think it will help her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing after the first two volumes","review":"I loved the first two volumes of Wodehouse Playhouse, but the third is quite disappointing. To begin with, the wonderful Pauline Collins is missing, and the chemistry between her and John Alderton was priceless. Alas, no actress here comes up to Ms. Collins' zany delivery, and the results are flat. The writing has lost its edge as well, and even the timing seems off. Only \\"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo\\" comes near attaining the hilarious heights of the first two seasons. Completists will find it a necessity, but casual viewers should stick to the first two volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Pauline Collins pass on Wodehouse Playhouse","review":"I would not have bought this DVD if I had known that it was the sans Collins version. First I am a great fan of Wodehouse done well. The PBS Jeeves and Wooster was beautifully done. Playhouse 1 and 2 was in the main beautifully done. Just 2 or 3 weak stories. The Wodehouse series, when played by regular actors, has in essence, some rather dumb scenes and stupid stories. It is the talent of Collins and Alderton that brings a new dimension and makes it so enjoyable. Collins sense of the ridiculous, is superb and quite unique. She has some of the most terrible lines and somehow makes them unforgettable. She:\\"Pah!\\", He:\\"Did you say 'Pah'?\\", She: \\"Yes I said Pah. Pah! Pah! Pah!\\" What can any other actress do with lines like that. Alderton is excellent but Wodehouse is possible without Alderton. Without Collins these stories are not worth much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this model","review":"In general I prefer electric trimmers to gas ones. I don't mind the cord, and they are cleaner and quieter than other styles. I'm looking for a new trimmer - different brand. I used a Weed-Eater brand trimmer for years, and was very happy with it. After losing that one, I bought this one... mistake...I have used this one for about a year - moderate use in a small suburban Texas yard. It worked well with the original spool. I have fought with the spool & string repeatedly since then. When it is time for a change, the entire mechanism gets stuck together to the point of being unworkable -- will not budge. Screwwdrivers and channel-locks only scrape up the spool worse. The long plastic bar broke in half yesterday when I tapped it on the ground to let out some more line - really cheap construction. Will never buy Toro again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to waste 20 to 30 minutes per lawn cut? Then buy Toro!","review":"It's incredible the amount of time I waste manually feeding out the string on this trimmer because the spool becomes essentially frozen. Factor in 20 to 30 minutes per lawn cut wasted just manually feeding out the string. Then there is the string guide, which is a separate item from the spool head and so falls out. Mine is lost. That makes the spool even more disfunctional. Toro should be ashamed to put this product on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"spool is frozen","review":"It's simple enough for a string trimmer - until you have to get the spool out. Then just throw it in the garbage and buy a new one, because the whole mechanism is frozen. I've only used it three times. Buy another brand, you might have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cap stuck, only used one time, can't recommend","review":"I wanted a small, lightweight trimmer, since I can't manage a large heavy one. This trimmer did the trick until the second time I tried to use it, and I ran out of string. The cap is completely stuck, and nothing I did budged it. I thought it was just my arthritic hands, but a quick internet search revealed that big strong men have the same problem, so I must conclude that it's the trimmer, not me. Toro's customer service is, of course, closed on weekends, so I guess I'll throw it away and get out my hand clippers. Total waste of money. I guess I'll scratch Toro off my list for yard tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than a year use","review":"Bought for the Toro name. Threw out due to the smoke from the motor.

The spool wouldn't dislodge even with a screwdriver. Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"Besides having to manually re-feed the string every 2 minutes, the handle snapped from the trimmer on the second use. Into the garbage it goes, along with my $40. Its true that you get what you pay for, however, I would expect a little more durability than less than an hours use out of it. Avoid this trimmer and spend a little more for a more durable brand"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is based on the fact that I did not get what I ordered from Brands on Sale. It was a size smaller and came with no mask. AND I am still airing for a refund. Can't believe this company is allowed to sell on Amazon!!! Deplorable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Folk Music From A Parallel Universe","review":"This is the flipside to \\"Minas\\" and initially appears to be mellower. Repeated listening reveals an album as indebted to South American folk as its predecessor was to rock and 20th-century classical. That said, it's extremely gripping, and one of the most eerily compelling and passionate albums you'll ever hear. The remastering is flawless, and the overall combination of diversity and focus lets you know you're listening to a real master. Shallow listeners will simply never understand music like this. Powerful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Illegal Operation: Tell-all Book Released\\"","review":"I picked up this book after hearing about it on the radio, and I'm glad I did. Being a heavy computer user, I have heard about some of the stories detailed in this book, but most of them just made my jaw drop as to how modern technology can screw up either by itself or by a human hitting the wrong button. So this book is highly recommended, but don't give it to any of your luddite friends. They'll use it to prove you right."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the stories are basically the same","review":"This book contains dozens of short stories about mistakes that businesses supposedly made (some of which are urban legends). Many of the stories are the same thing over and over again. How many different ways are there for companies to screw up account balances? At least ten, if you believe this book. One example would have been enough--the other nine were just repeats.Another thing that annoyed me was that the author does not know the proper meaning of the word \\"ironic.\\"It gets a second star from me because a few of the stories are interesting and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"11.

Haplo has now been to all 4 different worlds and had more than involved himself with the lowly \\"mensch\\". Haplo and his clumsy enemy, Alfred, must try to help spread the word of a power far greater than their own. I have enjoyed every Death Gate book because of it's intense storyline, fine characters, and very interesting \\"history\\" which is sprinkled for plot progression. These seven books have captived my time since more since Duncan's octology. I had read Darksword trilogy ten years ago when I was in high school, so I am familiar with their work.

After the first listen I was slightly dissapointed, since this wasn't nearly as mind-numbingly brutal as their previous albums(although it is still pretty friggin' heavy). But I suprised myself the next day by having various songs stuck in my head and decided to give a second listen to \\"Domine non es Dignus\\", some parts that really stuck in my head were the clean vocals on \\"Do not speak\\" and the marching at the beginning of \\"To err is human to dream futile\\". I love the fact that Anaal Nathrakh have grown more creative but still remain true to staying totally necro. This is an essential black metal purchase alongside \\"The Codex Necro\\" and \\"Total F*cking Necro\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time will tell","review":"This was a very inexpensive product, but I didn't expect the packaging to be different from the image you see on Amazon. The cardboard backing is the same, but there isn't a convenient tube with a screw on lid inside. Instead, there's a flat, plastic rectangle about the size of the tube in the illustration and the meager gel is in a bubble within that rectangle.

Don't let that scare you- the music is superb and the lyrics are all appropriate for any age child. It's just that every single track on this album seems superb.I also enjoy That's my name, The Bear cha-cha-cha, Brush brush bree, the list goes on.My 5 year old and three 1 year olds start dancing a jig whenever we cue this one up.Get it- you will not be disappointed.Is there another coming soon?

This book offers a handful of useful insights but is clearly slanted and does not jibe with much of what I come up which is believable.Getting any sort of a real read on the Perons is difficult and is not helped by the fact that most English language sources are filtered through several kinds of nearly impenetrable culture bias which are all irrelevant to the circumstances with which the Peron's had to deal.As nearly as I can tell, they inherited a country which was economically advanced while politically primitive, and came within a half dozen ideas and three doses of HPV vaccine or one timely cancer operation of turning it into a model for the world.

Also, the speakers don't work. They emit a crackling sound when the PSP is set into the dock and don't register sound above a whisper.Don't waste your money on this thing.

I've had a few. This one was well thought out in the design -- for instance, extended arms keep it from tipping on a hard hit; the \\"grip\\" on the ball keeps it from rolling off at angles; easy twist to loosen, move and retighten; easy height adjustment by just pushing or pulling. Minimal setup: took 30 seconds to screw together. And has a nice sturdy feel.

This keeps my rosewood properly hydrated so that the ebony color will shine. It makes the fretboard smell nice and fresh. My cleaning regimen: 1. take off strings 2. clean/wipe dirt or grime off entire guitar first with microfiber cleaner cloth 3. after cleaning off the dirt/grime, apply guitar polish to guitar body 4. use Ernie Ball fretboard conditioner on fretboard.I find that one Ernie Ball fretboard wipe has enough juice to hydrate two guitar fretboards at a time. I have guitars with rosewood and maple fretboards. I recommend using this stuff on your rosewood only. Not recommended for maple fretboard, trust me on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first TV documentary of the natural history of North America","review":"This is the BBC version of the same miniseries which was on PBS' Nature fifteen years ago. The American version, made for PBS' noncommercial format, was hosted and narrated by George Page and was about eight hours long on VHS. This version is a total of only about 6 1/2 hours, which is why I couldn't give it a five star rating. The additional footage would have added so much more to the DVD set. There is also no bonus material about how this remarkable series was made.However, I am very happy that this series is finally available on DVD. The programs are so enjoyable with their beautiful photogaphy, and the history is really interesting, especially of the Indians and the pioneers and their relationship to wildlife and the natural world. Nothing like this had been done on television before or since. This will make a unique addition to your nature/wildlife DVD collection if you love American history and wildlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBC Atlas of the Natural World - Land of the Eagle","review":"Highly recommend this to adults and children.

Rich and lush in its imagery, short in dialogue yet long in emotion, this film explores the vast landscape of aging and middle-aged love in all their permutations. Betrayal begets heartbreak and supressed fury as both artist and muse struggle through the treacherous hills and valleys of reconciliation. Its masterful conclusion leaves viewers grappling with the ultimate dilemma of \\"what would I have done?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bits and Pieces","review":"I am not sure, but I think the moviemakers of this movie took all the scene cuts they'd made for the movie, threw them up into the air, then spliced them together as they picked them up and called that their movie.To try to figure out what was supposed to be happening, I tried looking up the artist in this so-called true story, and could find nothing about him. So, I didn't have a book to read, or even a magazine article, to see what his life was like. I'd hoped if I knew a little something about him, I could make heads or tales of this movie.Therefore, I conclude that this movie if for those types of people who like to read intellectual jibberish and claim they 'understand' it. Of the more than 4,500 movies in my collection, this one comes in near or even at the bottom in the editing category.There are way too many good movies out there to waste time on this one.

I wish there were more titles by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"Reviewers who have criticized \\"Twelve\\" as uneven, or random, or not what they expected are missing the point. Patti Smith clearly experimented on the album -- when she hits you cannot get any better. I defy you to find a cover of the Beatles' \\"Within You Without You\\" that is as simple, powerful and different. The CD is worth the price alone for that song, and her covers of \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and Dylan's \\"Changing of the Guard\\" are mezmerizing. I have probably listened to the last two songs 50 times.And that voice -- incredible phrasing, hauntingly beautiful.So yes, when she misses the mark, the song might not work, but, honestly, when she hits on a song, it's hard to imagine it being done any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I've always waxed hot 'n cold on Patti Smith, but she does all right by several of the songs on here. If anything, I wish she'd dug a little deeper into the catalogs of some of the folks she covers here; for example, Smith doing Grace Slick's \\"White Rabbit\\" is good enough, but I'd have loved to hear her have a go at \\"Eskimo Blue Day\\" or \\"Two Heads,\\" two of Slick's more \\"out there\\" songs. But this is a quibble, especially when I never could've guessed that Patti Smith could cover The Allman Brothers and actually make \\"Midnight Rider\\" her own in a super version.

It's a sublime musical arrangement that brings fresh passion to an old favorite. How about Patti doing the Allman Brothers' Midnight Rider? The Godmother of Punk doing Southern Blues/Rock? How cool is that? 'Gimme Shelter' is the perfect medium for her rough contralto, and the musicans are rockin'. What's not to like? Truthfully, not every song on this album is fun to listen to more than once. But the ones that are, and a good half of them are, make for a CD that I wanted to listen to again, and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she really cover Nirvana????!!!!!!","review":"It's odd to try to rate a cover album done by someone who is considered to be one of rock and roll's greatest.Some of the tracks here are interesting to hear in her mellow voice, and her Patti Smith style. But, some are just tragic. Smells like teen spirit is a trainwreck at best. And a banjo? No, Patti SMith....just don't ever go there again. And everybody wants to rule the world. It's not so bad in her tone, but it's very close to the original. I guess I would expect more originality from her.Some of the other covers are good. There's an Allman Brothers cover, and Neil Young cover, and some are well done, and interesting to hear her sing. She has such a unique voice and style that I think you either love her or you hate her. Here....I just don't quite know what to think. It's half good, half bad, mixed with part tragic. If you listen to it you'll know what I mean. Her producer should have told her to nix the Nirvana cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"more mediocre than awful, but Otis Elevator will play it constantly","review":"Mystifying how someone so proud of showing her edge to the world could deliver this album, which sounds like it was recorded in an hour.

Randy Savage did it with his Be A Man album, William Shattner is still at it, Joe Pesci even took a stab, but nothing is as atrocious as Patti Smith covering these great classics. She makes Paul Anka's version of Smells Like Teen Spirit sound good. If you have to listen to someone else sing this song go to Tori Amos, but sticking with Patti Smith on this album is a very bad idea, unless self torture is your thing, or of course you're too old and too far in denial to think this is actually something worth owning. Patti get's my vote on the stupidest karaoke album idea of 07."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous","review":"She did a bluegrass cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit. Bluegrass.

I saw her recent performance on a CBS morning show and it was terrible. She butchered classic songs from Tear For Fears and the Rolling Stones. It was absolutely embarrassing to watch. Why has Patti Smith ever been relevant? Would we even know who she was if she didn't come from New York (you can include Lou Reed in this question). To me, she isn't even a has-been....more of a never-was. Also, a memo to the artists(?) who are now producing cover song albums.....do not do it! You are lowering yourself to what it ws like before you ever gained fame. Is Brian Ferry listening? At least he did produce some great stuff in the past.Patti Smith can thank god for: New York, Rolling Stone magazine, and a hall of fame (in Cleveland no less)willing to showcase items such as a cub scout uniform for Jim Morrison....LOL (I required to rate a minimum of 1 star)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of it works...","review":"...and some it had me begging for original material; especially not needed was the TFF song, which was played to death in the 80's and I certainly didn't welcome hearing it again.

The combination emerges as a wonderful, haunting story. It imagines Lucifer's fall from heaven - a baffling rebellion, unless some specific needs to be rebelled against. And, with an all-powerful god, even Lucifer's rejection of heaven must itself have been divinely ordained. This story posits wholly sufficient reason, a real theological thorn that irritates many mere mortals, and a Macchiavellian orchestration of Lucifer's departure.This isn't bible-thumping, though. It's story-telling, the kind where elegant images set off a thoughtful, thought-provoking myth. Along the way, it reminds us that the age of myths isn't over. Our own age needs to understand itself through fiction as much as any other ever did, and Gaiman and Russell contribute to that understanding.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Board (Eternal Destination)","review":"I am a youth group leader and I bought this to show the youth and our church.

Unfortunately, it never really lived up to that potential. There was some good acting, particularly by Mandy Patinkin, playing the mentor of Claire Dames' CIA officer. Any scene he was in was fun to watch, the way he interacted with the other characters. Damian Lewis also did a good job, but the underlying motivations for his character were far too shallow to explain his actions.I would say that the first two thirds of this show were solid four-star material, but regrettably things started going downhill and finally fell apart all together in the final three episodes as the heroine came apart at the seams(an effect that was more annoying than dramatic) and the producers took the easy way out.

Come on meow, you can do better than that.

Over 25% of Americans have at least one diagnosable mental illness, which is important to know. It's the LEADING cause of disability in the US and Canada. Until our culture can accept this we'll continue to see the media sensationalize mental illness, which is exactly what Homeland is doing. Why the audience seems to believe it does otherwise is a mystery to me. Mental illness is serious; it's not a farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been foxed again","review":"The Company \\"FOX\\" did it again, I can not see the Serie, because its BluRay Region \\"A\\" The next thing I do is, I will buy a regionfree Player, so I can f..k back.

Claire Danes is doing a great job as is Mandy patinkin, Nicholas Brody is pretty convincing is the returning vet. He kind of has you wondering if he's going in and out of some brainwashing thing. Morena Baccarin does a very good job of playing Brody's wife and with the tensions and all. I'm not a great TV critic but I'm still watching.

It was like asking a cashier to change a ten, but instead being given the US Treasury. No punches are pulled from a single character, and it's fascinating to watch each one endure devastating twists every episode. It expresses how each tier of government (on either side more or less) is marginally navigated by 99 career clowns to one dedicated professional, and how the reality of that is more than any one dedicated professional can bear. Terrific writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows ever... Its gets better with every show","review":"Loved it... Now watching the second season.... Its amazing.

Mandy Patinkin has never been better. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea, good acting, interesting plot","review":"While I said good idea, good acting, interesting plot for this episode, you really need to think of this as a series.

I am told that later episodes reverse this and have a ton of plot per minute. They lost me on number 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised me","review":"Never heard of this show until the Emmys.

Hubby and I love spy, military type thrillers and this started off fantastic. Since there is no rating on this show, I assumed it was okay for TV viewing, but I was wrong. Please do not watch this with children in the room. My husband and I ended up watching the entire show due to the interesting premise, but by the end, we found we didn't like the main CIA character at all and the sex, nudity and language were enough to deter us from watching anymore in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a show.","review":"Great services by Amazon.

I know I will probably get a lot of crap for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy","review":"I never finished the series. While I know some others who really enjoyed this series, I found the main female character a distraction from the storyline. Her storyline was a little over the top and hard to relate to. Most people would have a hard time relating to her or her choices/actions. Her actions were over the top, but not in a good way. It was just too far-fetched for me (maybe because I'm involved with Federal law enforcement and have a security clearance and boundries?)Without giving something away that's all I can really say about the series. I do, however, hope other people enjoy it. There is some entertainment value with the other actors in the series; it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"more \\"making of\\" pieces please","review":"So, the big deal about streaming is....streaming.

Clare Danes was great as a manic wild-eyed lunatic...however, she was awful(the writing)as anything resembling a big time CIA agent. This overblown glob goes downhill early on, but the pace it achieves makes for a catastrophic plot crash at the end. We won't talk about the plot twist that defy brain cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"shameful","review":"this type of entertainment shows the sad state of american entertainment.

Hope they do just as well as they did this year for Awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, well-acted","review":"I heard a lot of hype about Homeland - particularly from one of my sons. After it brought home the bacon at the Emmys I decided to buy Season 1 and give it a look. I was not disappointed. Anyone familiar with the Manchurian Candidate will recognize the plot line - captured U.S. soldier turned sleeping time bomb after months of brainwashing. But Homeland is no mere knock-off. Tightly woven into the events of 9/11, the writers manage to keep the viewer on edge and off balance. Though much is predictable, much more is not - and that's what makes one keen to see the next episode. Quite unlike me, I watched all of Season 1 in one weekend. It is that good. It's the closest thing to intelligent British drama that I've seen on U.S. television in a long while. The acting by Claire Danes and Damian Lewis is top notch, though kudos are due to the entire cast. Well-written, well-acted, well-directed and engrossing drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning is the best","review":"I think the first 7 episodes of Homeland are very good but after that it is not realistic that the wife of the imam comes to visit Carrie, behind the back of her husband, I think in real that never happens. The portrait of the imam is painted very idealistic, it promotes islam. For me I will look no further, overhere we have too much trouble with islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid - don't contaminate your mind","review":"I got this based on the fact I really like the show Life the man was in before which got canceled. This is just straight pornography 30 min in the first episode and that was too much for me I should have stopped after his wife was in the bed with his best friend but after I skipped past that I thought it would get better 2 sex scenes and at least 3 f words in 30 min something no one's mind needs to see. Not just not for families not for adults either. I realize I should have done more checking before I got this movie and that was my fault. This is just a word of warning to anyone else out there that is concerned about what they let in their mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too graphic","review":"I was too offended by the language and sex scenes.

It seems they are going to make a few seasons before to know a few things ,my advice don't buy it if you don't want to lose your money and time,go for \\"Person of interest\\" or \\"Hawaii Five- O\\" .I won't be watching season 2,i'm totally disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked !","review":"I took a chance ordering the first season of Homeland. I don't receive HBO and had never seen an episode. But noticed it won Emmys and thought it must be good. I wasn't disappointed. Now I'm hooked. I have to order the next season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography... Really?","review":"I admit I have been out of the weekly television viewing audience for a long time. Circumstances are that I have some time and desire for dull entertainment that does just that, entertains. But when did we become so complacent about pornography? Is it so commonplace that it is needed to satisfy our senses? I'm not a prude, but I sure don't need to see envy gesticulation, mammary gland, and hand stroke to get the idea of the scene. If this is what we need to feel entertained, we are in trouble. I bought the first season, watched the first four episodes to give it a chance but am deleting it from my iPad. I won't make this mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the hype","review":"Even the great performances, especially by Mandy Patinkin and the ever-amazing Claire Danes, don't compensate for the rather mediocre scripts - mediocre as compared to something like The Wire or Breaking Bad. In particular, the reason for turning into a terrorist was weak, and ultimately unbelievable. Not enough chills, spills and revelations. Kind of disappointed with this series; especially considering the hype surrounding it. Given up on Season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeland is an all-star!","review":"Great story line and superb acting makes Homeland a must-see.

I've known former pow's and they were still able to control their language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unrealistic and silly","review":"Wow what a disappointment. Just finished season 1...I can't believe anyone actually enjoyed this dreck.This show is like a watered-down, excruciatingly slow-paced, and far less realistic version of '24'. Not a single character is compelling or likeable. The producers of the show couldn't even bother to get details right (like the rank, uniform, and haircut of the main Marine character)?Given the positive reviews I guess it's just me, but I would recommend avoiding this show like the plague unless you want a cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video quality","review":"I love the show but the best video quality I can get its poor. I have a superfast video connection but the best I can get it for like 380. Which is not even standard definition in the old days. The video streaming doesn't even compare to Hulu, Hulu plus, iTunes, Vudu, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"This is a great show with amazing performances from Danes, Lewis and the actor also know as Inigo Montoya. The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is the uneven final episode, but I very much look forward to the new season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massively over rated garbage","review":"Claire Danes is great, but the series lacks any sense of excitement. None of the characters is sympathetic. I was hoping they would all die so this would end. More time is spent cutting hair than developing any sort of plausible plot line. To compare this to 24 is an insult to a wonderful show that, even at its worst, far surpassed the occasional moments of interest in this rubbish. The nudity does not spoil the show, it merely provides a break from the tedium. Save your money. No-one I know enjoyed this."},{"rating":"1","title":"homeland cd's","review":"not a new cd, there was scribbling on the covers of all the cd' s we were very unhappy because we thought we getting new cd's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sexually graphic","review":"I know this show was rated TV-MA, but this was closer to a NC17 rating.

I have watched TV-MA before, but this show is really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD CONCEPT ... BAD EXECUTION","review":"The first few episodes were promising but the story line quickly falls apart with highly improbable, almost laughable situations with increasingly offensive language. One tires of the Carrie character who seems to dominate the story with her hysterical outbreaks that may be drug induced. If this series is to survive, better writers may have to be brought in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I was not expecting porn.

I think the plot is smart and powerful and Damian Lewis is superb. Everything about this show is right.

Do not buy the Blu-ray version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploration of National Security","review":"\\"Homeland\\" Season 1 on Showtime is a riveting and highly credible portrayal of how the CIA, FBI and homeland security attempt to keep Americans safe from inside and outside terrorist threats. The Emmy winning script, acting and direction are all well deserved honors. The characters are complex and both Claire Danes and Damien Lewis do them justice in their portrayals. Sometimes the action can become a bit repeative, but overall the majority of the episodes are suspensful and also informative. I highly recommend buying or renting Season 1 on DVD and can't wait to watch Season 2 when it returns on Showtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S A SOAP OPERA!!!","review":"it's a SOAP hooking you to keep watching even though it's all about 'relationships - ugh' with a very thin plot. and its anti-military, anti-CIA propaganda is not even subtle."},{"rating":"1","title":"America bad, terrorist good.","review":"I just watched 2/3 of season one. What have I learned so far? America is a bad, bad country. Evil CIA. Evil military. Evil FBI. Evil Vice President. But terrorists are really great people who are just misunderstood.

What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped, stereotyped","review":"I had heard so many good things about this show, but after watching the first two episodes, I think I'm done. It's got an \\"idiot plot\\" (Siskel and Ebert's old definition of a plot that only moves forward because characters act like idiots), hackneyed dialogue, lots of ugly imagery, and so far, nothing much to recommend it. If someone can point me to better episodes, I'll give them a try, since I made the mistake of buying the entire first season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I didn't know what to expect at first but once I saw the first episode I was hooked.Claire Danes was tremendous and Damian Lewis also tremendous.This show really is exciting and riveting.Catches you up by surprise every episode.Really recommend this show which is like the best shows on T.V right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"This series is top notch.

It's also very choppy and some nights it won't load at all. Our internet is working fine, as we are able to stream other services, such as Hulu and Netflix through our BlueRay without any issues.

The story has credibility and the acting and production are very well done. I was personally put off by the gratuitous sex and language. It will be interesting to see how this story evolves. (Spoiler Alert!) Will Carrie fade from the story now that she has been outed as a mental patient? What will become of Brody as he continues to be doubted yet recruited by all sides? Will, as I hope, Dana become interested in a life with Homeland Security and take her experiences as Brody's daughter into the agency with her?

Well I had a few weeks off of school, studying to get my Masters, and thought I'd give it a try. What a fantastic show. I will not try to sum up the show because others have done that really well.

There is nothing worse than being faced with the real God. Therefore, if we are to have God, natural man will try to dress him up in our image.The book is not meant to address alternative theories and it is not designed to prove that God exists. It exists to turn the tables on the most common objection to Christianity by atheists: it is a crutch. Well, the crutch is on the other side as well. Before evolution, the atheists jumped on spontaneous generation. It was joyous because they no longer had to explain the world without a Creator. Spontaneous generation has long since passed, but the lesson should be learned. Men will leap on anything if they can avoid God.So if we want to debate the existance of God, let's do so...but with the knowledge that bias exists on the atheist side as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a hands-on approach to analog IC layout!","review":"Books on layouting integrated circuits that are practical and don't use an overwhelming amount of maths are very hard to find.

Based on his own experience as a circuit and layout designer, he covers every aspect of IC layouting, covering bipolar, CMOS and BiCMOS. He uses a hands-on approach, trading maths for intuitive insights, and gives pointers to overcome real-world problems (somewhat like the other \\"The Art of...\\" electronics book!). Important topics include failure mechanisms (ESD, latch-up, ...), matching, device merging, guard rings, high-voltage devices and many more. In short, THE book for anyone that needs an introduction into analog IC layout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and useful book for the CMOS designer.","review":"I read Hasting's book when it was in manuscript form, and recommended to Tom Robbins at Prentice-Hall they they publish it.

I went into the text not knowing what to expect (almost assumed it'd be drudgery since an instructor made the recommendation).In any event, I was drawn into the characters, possibly because of their quirky and off-the-beaten path personalities. Price has a firm hold on the young-adult voice, exemplified with Murray and Pearl. But he also reveals deep understanding for the troubled victims of mental illness. The fears of a parent - the fears of an alcoholic - the fears of a lonely teenage boy who is different all unfold in this, what could otherwise be a fairly straightforward murder mystery.A breeze to read (thanks for those short chapters), leaving the reader with much to ponder."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dialogue kills it for me","review":"Unlike most of the others who've reviewed this book, I was not able to get past the characters. As a middle school teacher, I spend seven hours a day around kids the same age as the characters in this book, and I can tell you, in regards to the dialogue, kids just don't talk like that. So, good idea or no, unrealistic dialogue killed the story for me. I just couldn't read it for more than a chapter or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS","review":"This is a terrible book.

Upon our return we were immediately beset by fleas. There's no evidence that a single one had died. Apparently, many flea populations have developed resistance to permethrin, which is the only active ingredient in this fogger.Look for a fogger that contains various agents, so you will have a better likelihood that one of them will work. Also, look for a product that has an IGR (Insect Growth Regulator) as it will also kill eggs and larvae -- permethrin alone will not do this.Finally, permethrin is reasonably safe for dogs and humans, but pretty dangerous for cats, so if you have cats you may want to avoid permethrin-based products altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product they're selling here is a dud - possibly expired?","review":"I had previously used this product many years ago and I remembered it to be very effective. It's supposed to burst into a cloud of white smoke a few minutes after you place it in the water cup.The product I received 3 days ago from Amazon (from Markson Supply) which I used today did not do that. There was just the tiniest wisp of smoke which left a thick gel on top of the can.

Qu shi plays an optimistic young girl who finds a message in a bottle and travels to Hong Kong to find her Prince Charming. The message was sent by a guy named Albert who turns out to be gay. He helps Qu shi's character meet and fall in love with Nick (Jackie Chan's character), who she meets while on a photo shoot with Albert on a boat. The scenery was great, including the fashion and cars. The fight scenes in this movie were not very violent, but rather entertaining and humorous. The soundtrack includes a sweet song sung by William So and Kit Yee Chan. This is a great movie to buy on DVD and watch with friends and family!

NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to \\"Americanize\\" and \\"Control\\". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to \\"French version\\" or \\"Chinese Version\\" ~!

I have to say that, even though I have my own copy of this movie and have watched it and enjoyed it several times, I am never able to suspend my disbelief. I am always bothered by the disparity in the ages of Jackie Chan and his leading teenager! I will be glad when Jackie Chan stops playing 20-somethings and moves entirely into his true age group with roles that allow him to show off his acting range (which is actually quite impressive.) The man is a good actor, and he can sing! As he matures and his impressive martial arts and acrobatic abilities inevitably change, I would like to see him develop and share his other abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Fighting","review":"Gorgeous is a fun filled adventure with some great action.

Maybe my favorit jackie chan movie, because it is so diferent.jackie chan has a chance to proove, that he is far underrated as an actor. the pictures are beautiful and the story works well. lots of chinese humor. a modern version of cinderella. the only negative thing is the australian stunt guy, who doesn't fit in the story at all. it would have done well, without the 2 kick boxing scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie.","review":"Another good film from Jackie. There are some incredible fight scenes but not many (if any) stunts. The English dubbing is appauling. It just doesn't work, but it's a small price to pay for such a great film. Worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie as you've never seen him before... slow and boring.","review":"A horrible movie! don't even rent it.A ridiculous movie about a love sick teenage girl (well acted)who is after Jackie Chan. Chan plays very convicingly a man with no personality who used to be a fighter and is now a soft eco-dogooder tycoon with goofy friends/enemies. The only really interesting character is the short white guy hired to beat Jackie up. A total of two fight scenes 5 minutes each is all we get to see of him but he really is the star in this movie!I waited the whole movie for the gangsters but they never showed ... maybe Chan's stunt guys were on stike or all still in the hospital from the last movie. If you do rent it I suggest a drinking game. Drink ... when the leading lady's name is said ... Jackie's friend tries to hurt him but not quite ... during the rocky scene ... afterwards sober up and watch Police Story to remind yourself why you are a Chan Fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Jackie Film at Best","review":"I say this because Jackie doesn't usually do wired Kung-Fu and this movie utilized that. It also utilized the sped up frame rate to make the fighters appear more skilled. Now that being said, the martial artists really are quite skilled. They really are pretty quick. They really can do most of those moves. It had some OK though special effects assisted fights, but this movie wasn't really about that. Jackie Chan was trying to break into \\"real\\" acting in this movie. I wouldn't buy it if you are trying to watch him fight, and if you buy it for the story....well that's your choice I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO EACH HIS OWN","review":"As a super fan of Jackie Chan and one who sees his movies over and over again I must say Gorgeous, was \\"not good\\" the plot is silly but most importantly a natural flow from one scene to another is missing.

A nice movie to watch with the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie Chan does romantic comedy","review":"4 of 5 stars for this romantic comedy movie. I am a huge fan of Jackie Chan. This movie is a bit different than his other movies; the focuses on the romantic and comedy elements and downplays the trade-mark Jackie Chan fights.A village girl named \\"Bu\\" meets and falls in love with business executive CN Chan (Jackie Chan). The movie is about how Bu tries to capture CN's heart. Qi Shu played Bu and was wonderfully cute; how could you not fall in love with her! The dinner scene with Bu wearing a long blue dress was fun! Well, throw-in a mob-boss, some dumb henchmen and a few Jackie Chan fights and you have the movie. Specially entertaining was a fight scene with 4 silver aluminum baseball bats.Filmed in Hong Kong and English dubbed audio. The voices were pretty good; though knowing Jackie's voice so well, it is hard to hear some other voice from his mouth. The dubbing isn't such a problem.A truly fun, funny and entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Chan Exercises Acting Muscles","review":"Not your typical Jackie Chan flick, which is why the rating is not higher. There are some very funny scenes involving a gay character and the female lead. Also hilarious is the short guy chasing Jackie all over to fight him. I found the age difference between Jackie and his co-star to be disturbing. Jackie looks great for his age, but his young co-star plays a naive young woman, and she comes across even younger than she really is. Not that there are any real love scenes between them, but there is a kiss and all I could think was \\"ICK.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it right people.","review":"Great everything...

This has to the dumbest Jackie Chan movie ever. I have seen most of his movies and built up a respectable Jackie Chan movie collection and I only wish I had rented this movie first. Kudos to Brad Allen for his impressive moves, but if i ever meet him or Jackie in my life time, I will be asking one of them to refund my $20.

You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Korny","review":"Who would actually go on a plane because, of some stupid message in a bottle? The fighting was stupid too, who would waste time to pick out a pair of cheap gloves?

This has your crazy and amazing fight scenes that are so creative and only Jackie can pull em off. The last fight scene with \\"Adam\\" the fight scene is more of a gentlemens fight, they have respect for each other, and its a pretty long fight scene, well worth the wait, the guy who plays \\"Adam\\" is actually a student of Jackie chan, you might recongize him in the background in \\"Mr. Nice Guy\\" as a \\"thug\\". The so called \\"Villian\\" in this movie, is not a villian at all, Hes a childhood rival of jackies who of course is trying to out due jackie in everything. Hes actually pretty funny, this movie to me is a overall love first action second movie. Pretty good movie, I bought it cause Im trying to complete my Jackie Chan collection and Im glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inane movie, with some killer scenes.","review":"As far as Chan's movies go, this one ranks near the bottom of my list. The plot is nonsensical, and the dubbing certainly doesn't help. If you're looking for a Jackie Chan movie that you can actually enjoy on its own merits, then skip this one.However.This movie does have the distinction of having some of the greatest fight scenes I've ever seen Jackie do. You will regret seeing the movie afterwards, but these scenes (almost) make up for the rest of this lackluster movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Chan Fans only","review":"Jackie Chan could make a successful love story for an American audience, NOT THIS ONE!

This album was beautifully remastered and makes for a fabulous gift for all who love Neil Diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hot Album","review":"If you are a Neil Diamond fan then this is a must have album. Diamond shows his many talent on this one album. Just about every song on the album was written by him. The cover shows Neil Diamond in his younger years with long hair. It really is one of those albums you can listen to over and over again and still come back for more. Any fan of Neil Diamond would be foolish not to make this a part of their collection of the best of Neil Diamond. If you like Neil Diamond this album will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality is terrible!","review":"This is one of the best albums of all time but this particular CD/Company/ remake is NOT the original...

No chance. If you want to listen to this on your car radio (circa 1950's technology) you will be fine - anything better and you will come away with a head ache.Consider yourself warned. As I was listening to it I couldn't help but wish that Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs had gotten hold of not this - but rather the original Tap Root Manuscript LP recording and remastered it. That is THE Neil Diamond masterpiece (2nd side). That said - Soolaiman ? Brother Loves Traveling Salvation Show minus the Brother Loves poriton is awesome (again if you don't expect too much sound quality)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live magic...","review":"One of the most incredible live recordings ever made. You can feel this man's passion for the music and you can feel the audience being part of something special. Incredible music sung with all the emotion and soul that only the special artists can muster. Looking for a good Neil Diamond recording to sample his music? Try this one. It got this old rock and roller hooked on Neil Diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious lesson in music and sound production","review":"Folks, no matter what you're musical persuasion and even if you don't have any, you should have this in your collection.If you know of a better piece of work by any artist I wanna know!Down the years my tastes have drifted to the likes of Vangelis, classical, you name it.. Still I have come back to this album again and again. It's a magnificent blend of energy and beauty and I aggree that it is rare that you find a live performance so good. It will serve music history as \\"Citizen Kane\\" has served film history. Well maybe that's an overstatement but I'm not sure..Now there's just one thing I am dying to know - when will we ever get to buy this gem on video/DVD? Were those \\"Hot August Nights\\" even captured on film at all?Finally, if anyone attended these concerts back in '72 I would dearly appreciate if they sent me an email - steve@aztechouse.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Diamond Hot August Night expanded 2CD","review":"I'll be sending this back. Either I got a bad copy or the technician who inserted the track segues sucks big time. The transition between each song has a burp or gap which disrupts the flow. Very annoying. Like a skip in the old LP. If my replacement is the same, then this sadly, will be BAD NEWS, and save your money. Is it a big deal? Imagine your TV station switching to a commercial with one last play in the Super Bowl. Like that.Anyone else with this issue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"incorrect version recieved","review":"I requested and of course paid for the DVD audio version of Hot August Night and received instead a CD version - I've not returned the CD and requested correction because I've been down this road before with Amazon and quite frankly the process is so time consuming that the purchaser tends to accept the incompetence and move on.

Probably one of the best live albums of all time and one of Neils best. I can listen to this album over and over and over but I put it away for a long time so I don't wear it out. Then I discover it all over again and it simply blows me away. I usually listen to it alone and actually get tears in my eyes every time I listen to it. The music on this can move you this much. Every time I let some hear it they love it.Favorite Songs on the album: Morningside, Canta Libre, Play me, And the Grass won't pay no mind, Soolaimon.So, what are you waiting for? Do you want one of the best albums of all time and be moved more than you ever been in your life with music!

From the online images I expected them to be somewhat stronger than they are but the metal is rolled over at the edges of the pans so the actual wall thickness is only about half (or maybe even slightly less) of what it appears to be in the pictures.

Sorry, Plan Toys, but this time we are going with a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is by Plan Toys?","review":"I consider toys by Plan Toys as high quality, aesthetically pleasing, extremely durable,... and high price. This toy only has the high price in common with what I am used to from Plan Toys. The pots are ugly, very flimsy, and got dented within minutes of giving them to my kids. The metal has the stability of a coke can -- the formerly round pots are now egg shaped and won't sit flat on the \\"cook top\\" anymore -- and the wooden lids have now become useless too. IKEA carries a much more cute, much more sturdy line of cooking, baking, and serving utensils at a MUCH better value.

Today, \\"The Kybalion\\" is printed by a couple of publishers (probably it has become \\"freeware\\", due to copyright not renewed...). Both books are about seven Hermetic principles (you can find out more by reading the reviews about \\"The Kybalion\\").Difference between the two is that this one aims to sound more \\"mystical\\" and complete, when in fact it is \\"The Kybalion\\" that is a true, earlier published work. It also tries to be more complete by mentioning the creation of the universe, etc.\\"Summum: Sealed, Except to the Open Mind\\" is now available as freeware and can be found at (...).

I have also tried to get a signal in Milwaukee, Denver, and Las Vegas with no luck.

It read to me, the husband of one of these women, as though Dr. Friedman was doing her best to say that since men have been doing this for years, now it's the women's turn. There were all kinds of reasons given for these affairs, but scant little was said about the damage they do, to family, friends, and even co-workers, of ALL the parties involved. The most common excuse given, the \\"I wasn't looking for it\\" just doesn't wash. Are affairs common in our society? Of course they are.

I found the sound quality to be only marginally better than what I had on my existing 45's. The packaging is ugly and the feeble attempt at liner notes is an embarrassment. As another reviewer has already noted, they even managed to get the title on cut #16 wrong. How in the world does that happen? The correct title should be \\"Get On Up\\" by the Esquires. Only redeeming features on this one is that there are 26 cuts including a couple of tunes that are extremely hard to locate. I had not heard nor have I ever seen Jimmy Castors \\"Hey Leroy\\" since it charted back in '67. Other hard to find tunes include the aforementioned \\"Get On Up\\", Kenny O'Dells \\"Beautiful People\\" as well as the Hombres \\"Let It All Hang Out\\". Unless there are a bunch of songs you are really looking for on this disc I would skip this one for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Average CD","review":"I too was slightly disappointed in this CD, although it did contain 7 tracks that I did not previously have. My copy also had \\"Get on Up\\" by The Esquires instead of their follow-up \\"And Get Away.\\" Also, there was audio damage which sounded like static all through the last track, \\"I Can't Help it If I'm Still in Love With You\\" by B. J. Thomas. But, I did get a few hard to find tracks, which, like the other reviewer says, is all you would want to buy this for.PS - \\"Get on Up\\" is listed as a track on Volume 1, which I also ordered and which hasn't yet arrived.

It is a pleasant, easy read--the story of a newborn baby left on the steps of the wealthiest home in a small town and how that baby changed the lives of the people she touched. The characters, while hiding a few surprises, behave reasonably. The dialogue is well-written. It's just a nice read. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps ur attention","review":"I haven't completely finished but so far it's got my attention. The characters seem so real and their emotions intrigue me. Other than this book, I also recommend \\"Next Time Around\\" by Kristina Bailey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook Example of Literary Hypocrisy","review":"Anna Quinlen's rise at the NYT, and subsequent success as a novelist is a textbook example of hypocrisy in the mainstream media and literary community. She has never been an interesting writer. Her fiction is filled with overwrought, empty descriptions. Her characters are the typical self-absorbed, empty headed, Caucasian hypocrites who litter the nation's landscape. There are loads of authors far better than her whom the reading public and the snobs at the New York Times should be paying attention to. But like Holden Caufield says in Sallinger's classic, \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" the world is run by phonies. And Quinlen happens to be one of their kind. So they promote her literary career. Do yourself a favor and purchase a book by a good author who doesn't receive anywhere near the attention this literary con artist does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very reflective, wonderfully descriptive and entertaining!","review":"Loved it. Highly suggest it. Couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely book","review":"Blessings is a very quiet, lovely book. I really enjoyed it and found myself very moved. It shows that a person's true character can emerge at the most unlikely time. Sweet and slow moving like honey."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was boring","review":"I was very excited to buy this book because it had been on a bestseller list. I honestly had to force myself to finish it. It was very boring. It jumped from past to present in nearly every paragraph and I could feel the writer writing the story, in otherwords, she did not accomplish making the reader lose themselves in the story, as if it were real. I felt like I was tripping through her first time book and that someone just wanted to be able to say they wrote a book. At the end, to summarize it, it was a fairly cute story, but you really had to force yourself to continue reading it until about page 179. I wouldn't recommend the book, unless you are someone who likes to say the read the book. Not any great work of literature, for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!!!","review":"...The idea of the book in and of itself is plausible and poses some interesting qualities; it's the way the characters are written, shallow and unbelievable, and the typical format of a child changing everyone around him/her to such a degree as to be miraculous ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book with enthusiasm soon after it was published, afer having listened to Anna Quindlen discuss it on television. After the first couple of chapters, I would read a few pages, put it down, and couldn't bring myself to pick it back up. It was sheer boredom, but I forced myself to get through it. I did like Skip and baby Faith, but too much else was going on to maintain interest. The writing was okay, but the flashbacks became very distracting and the ending was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies' magazine fiction","review":"It amazed me that a writer who is published in a major, national magazine (Newsweek) could produce a novel so poorly written; the dialog and descriptions are graceless and the story cliched. However, if you can endure the tedium of the first half of the book, the story does get mildly interesting towards the end. Mildly.Come on, Anna. This isn't young adult fiction, is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was thrilled to pick this book up at a book swap. I had loved Quindlen's writing and expected a good read. I was disappointed.I can generally finish any book, but this one defied me. I may have gotten half way through it, but I can't remember. It was simply slow and depressing and I was just happy to be able to put it into the next book swap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moments of Good writing, but problems in the storyline","review":"I have a friend that I recommend books to all the time but I only recommend those that I feel are really outstanding. As a result she constantly raves about my book recommendations. This book is not one I will recommend to her.Although there are moments of brillant writing and potentially strong characters in the book the story line is so broken and potential plot lines left dangling that the books suffers as a whole. At the end of the book you find yourself disappointed and unsatisfied. If you're looking for a good book try the Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood or Bel Canto by Ann Patchett."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Blessing it was short.","review":"Page after page of waiting for something with substance to happen.

There wasn't one phrase or sentence I lingered over. If I didn't have to read it for my book club...I would have put it down about the third chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the excerpt from the book in the September, 2002, issue of \\"Reader's Digest,\\" I was most anxious to read the entire book. Unfortunately, the book was disappointing. My appetite was whetted for more of the story of Skip and the baby. Instead, it dwelt mostly on the disfunctional family of Lydia. It was so entwined with Skip's story that it was confusing. Often both storylines--one of them a sequence of boring backflashes--were in one paragraph and I had to reread it more than once to avoid confusion. The only suspense involved was what would happen to the baby. How that was resolved was also disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal storytelling","review":"I loved this novel. One of the most expertly crafted stories I've ever read.The characters were deep and real and endeared themselves to my heart.I wholeheartedly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not reccommend","review":"I started the book several weeks ago, but I found the characters undefined and it could not hold my interest.

So at this point, I would not reccommend it to others. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"I thought this story was charming and wonderful.

I'll be sending it as a Christmas present to friends and family this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely boring","review":"The plot moves along very slowly.Pages and pages go by without much happening.A lot of repetitions also. The author would keep repeatingthe same thing over and over. She like to say thing again even though she said it earlier.

As the mountains gentle toward the sea-with mother and child locked in a ghostly grip-the narrative tact, the perfect economy of effect defy criticism. The analogies with Moby Dick are patent. Anna Quindlen invites the prodigous comparison. What more can one say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book but not very intense","review":"I enjoyed this book, as I have Quindlen's other works but I did find this one to be a bit bland. It would have been nice if there had been a bit more suspense or something to grab the attention. Overall, though, it was a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over","review":"I had to read this for book club or I would have never made it past page 40. Nothing happens except for endless paragraphs of torturously detailed descriptions of things I could care less about, which did not advance the story at all. I had no affinity for any of the characters. It felt like a short story written by an earnest high school student that somehow morphed into a full length novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"The characters were the only reason I gave this one star. The plot was dull and many of the \\"twists\\" I found unbelievable. The dark secrets were a bit dated and certainly predictable. Please try again Anna as we know you're a good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character is out of character.","review":"Some books are page turners - you can't put them down. This is a book that I could not pick up. After reading some four chapters, that was it. Ms. QUINDLEN does not prepare us for her ex-con keeping the baby. Way, way out of character. Sure, I read science fiction and enjoy it, and I suspend disbelief in phasers, teleportation, and faster-than-light travel. But people should be real. I will not suspend belief about that. If you want to read about players that change character at the drop of a hat, or drop of a baby, then buy this book. If not - then click to the next offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for the Post-New Age","review":"Jennie Marlow's 'Practical Magic: A Spotted Eagle and Grandfather White Elk Book' is one of my all-time favorite Post-New Age spiritual books.

I've gotten really sick of \\"self-help\\" or \\"spiritual\\" books that just regurgitate the same information over and over again. They only helped me briefly and unsatisfactorally. This is a fresh approach to making lasting changes that really make a difference. One of the things that I love about this book is that the tools are so easy to use. It isn't full of buzzwords and hoopla. It's easy to read and I get something new out of it every time I open it up.

Until I saw the director's cut. To make this short, the DC took out ALL the good music and replaced it with other stuff which didn't even fit the scenes. Secondly, they added the \\"scene titles\\" which literally try to explain what's going on so you don't have to use your brain. In short, the DC killed everything that was unique and interesting about the film and made it into a film for the masses (just to make more money). If you really enjoyed Donnie Darko, don't watch this horrible version of it... go buy the original. And if you haven't seen the original, you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie takes you on a mind bending ride that leads up to an almost mind blowing climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I really did not \\"get\\" this movie. I was very confused by the ending. I rented this movie thinking it was a thriller but its more science fiction, what with the concept of time travel. I felt there were characters in this movie which did not pertain to the main story line and added little to the plot. It took me three days to watch this film. Althought some parts of it were amusing, and interesting, I overall thought it a dull movie and not worth the time or the money I spent to rent it. And watch it TWICE??!!??? I dont think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep? Vague? Brilliant? Pretentious?","review":"I don't know the answer, but I didn't enjoy the DVD. I can find almost anything in a movie that will make me want to watch it again, but honestly, I'd just like to sell my copy of this one. I resent some of these reviews where the people who loved it are calling those of us who didn't stupid for not seeing the brilliance. I'm not stupid and I suspect that the only people who really saw anything deep in this movie were those who were on drugs, or who had very, very active imaginations.The filming and sound are good, the acting was pretty good but as far as plot, humor, empathy or interest in characters - I didn't see much if any and I just couldn't wait for it to end. Boring, depressing, confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated!","review":"I expected more from this movie. I had so many friends tell me that it was unique and original...it was, but it sure wasn't good!

Still the same great movie, but no slip cover, which was kind of a let down, especially from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"More pseudo-intellectuals","review":"I actually liked the movie a lot, but I get the impression that some people (read: stoned teenagers) try to find hidden meanings of things in the movie. I also fear that this was the intention of the director. God I hope not.I think it's an indication of under developed appreciation of art to have to add some sort of logic to things like this movie. Simple style and mood, hints at motivation, and bizarre imagery are fine on there own. They don't all have to tell a story. They don't even have to even represent anything at all.I'd give it 4 and a half stars but I'm going to try to offset the art school kids on this thing so I'll give it 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depression on Steroids","review":"I bought this movie at the recommendation of a friend, and was extremely regretful of doing so. This movie, in my opinion, was dreary, depressing, creepy, and downright lousy. I don't know how anyone, unless they are on drugs, could enjoy this film. This film puts nothing on your mind except depression and death. I personally prefer movies that show the true beauty of life, such as the recently released Big Fish.

The only thing I could think about afterwords was that the writter of this movie wrote himself into a corner with the \\"Frank\\" character and did not have any idea how to explain Frank.The other reviews of this title have made it sound like something an interlectual would love. I currently have an IQ of 120 and I think you would have to be drunk or stoned to find this movie to be signifigant and full of meaning. I would have given this movie only one star, but the untouted appearnce of Maggie Gyllenhall (Jake's real life sister), the star of \\"Secretary\\" is worth at least on additional star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, unclear, and drowned in misery","review":"This movie is dark and unclear. What happened anyway? You have some really miserable characters, some really evil ones who need to get dealt with. The evil they do is just suffered through, without a response. There's some sort of supernatural garbage going on, or maybe there isn't and maybe it is just some insanity. Booga booga. This movie wasn't for me. If you enjoyed it, good for you. I don't know why I'm not giving it just one star. Something about it was appealing, but it was drowned in misery. You like misery?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark and Intriguing Cult Classic In The Making","review":"I rented Donnie Darko because it looked like a colorful horror movie.

I did watch this movie again, because this movie is a \\"make you think\\" movie, but you can even enjoy it without completely grasping the meaning.

I first saw this film on HBO, flipping channels and just expecting another movie. After ten minutes, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I immediately ordered the DVD because I had to watch it again. Yes, be warned, you'll probably have to watch this movie multiple times before you fully grasp it. It's easy to see why this movie didn't go mainstream, but rahter has become somewhat of a cult classic. Jake Gyllenhaal was incredible, especially considering he was only 19 when this was filmed. The rest of the cast was perfect too, which you might not think looking at some of the names.

He gets kudos for reading a couple of familiar and meaningful books but that is all. It is just fantastic how many try to articulate supposed meanings into this film when not even its writer/director knew what the heck he was doing.

Why would you expect there to be a neat and tidy resolution? Has that resolution been made in the real world? As for the references to other movies like \\"Harvey\\" or \\"Evil Dead\\", OF COURSE HES GOING TO USE ELEMENTS OF THOSE MOVIES. Like any great artist, he recognized those who have come before him and knows that art builds upon itself. Where would \\"insert any horror director's name here\\" be without Hitchcock?

It's supposed to be weird and if you like a film that makes you shudder as you're trying to figure it out then, again, this one's for you.

The story is brilliant, although it isn't spoon fed to you. Like events in real life, where connections aren't always so clear, what's really going on in Donnie Darko isn't obvious the first time around. That's what's so great about it! Unless you're one of the many people out there who hate to think, watch this movie!One caveat: I spent nearly 20 minutes in Barnes and Noble trying to find this DVD.

Some of the reviews have given too much away which i think is a shame cause you need to watch it for what it is and leave the analytical thoughts in your head. This kinda reminded me of American beauty in many ways especially the sliding side shots revealing everyone's conclusions at the end, plus the film primarily focuses on two troubled teenagers, very american beauty.All in all excellent film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be afraid of the dark","review":"I admit, when I first read the summaries, I thought \\"Demonic Rabbit vs. Troubled teenager. What the heck?\\" But then a worker at Blockbuster suggested it, so I thought \\"Why not give it a try?\\" Don't let the weird summary fool you. I was spellbound from the first second. The dark moments, creepy special effects, realistic teens, and especially the subtle comedy [hint: the smurf monologue is PRICELESS}- all of this makes Donnie Darko worth it. Jake Gylenhaal is a rising star who will bring more than mysterious good looks to the Hollywood scene. I only have one real comment: Check out the movie. Everyone has to see it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of these thinly veiled remakes","review":"Nowhere near as good as the original. Rent \\"Harvey\\" instead. Personally, I think it's because in \\"Harvey,\\" they don't actually show the bunny. Leaves more to the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever!","review":"I just finished watching this movie and cannot believe that I wasted my time on it. The writers tried to make a story that was believable and it just wasn't - there were so many facets to this dimly lit diamond of a movie that it ended being so vague with so many questions unanswered. Even the ending was \\"out of this world\\" with regard to logic and good movie theme. I bought this movie based upon the rave reviews. But this movie completely failed in every category. Don't waste your money on it. I don't care what the other 800+ viewers wrote praising this movie. It is a \\"crash and burn\\", DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I missed something???","review":"I fell asleep half-way through this movie, which I found just about as interesting as watching paint dry. Music in the movie was pretty good though. A lot of people seem to be raving about the movie here so maybe I'm wrong. Just wasn't for me I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird for my taste","review":"After watching the movie Donnie Crapo, I mean, Darko, it seems more clear to me, why the minds of so many people are totally screwed up. Let's face it, the only reason why this movie deserves at least a two star rating is because of the awesome songs and fascinating musical arrangements. The rest of the film could be accurately filed under \\"Garbage Productions\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Just another boring movie that goth kids will pull-one off to. The pinnacle of pseudo intellectualism and kids who beg their parents to take them to Hot Topic, then pretend like they don't know them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's a viable alternative","review":"If you're even thinking about buying this movie, have the clerk take you out back and give you a savage beating after taking your money. That way, you won't have to sit through this and the pain only be momentary.Trust me, I know this is better than the alternative.And if you're renting it, well, you're just asking for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the ORIGINAL Theatrical Release of this film","review":"Donnie Darko is an excellent movie in the original theatrical release. It has some ambiguous imagery and plot twists that engage the viewer and will cause discussion after watching the movie the first time. After a second (or even third) viewing, you will understand nuances missed the first time around.The director's cut adds unnecessary material that breaks the flow of the story and detracts significantly from most viewers' final impression of the movie and what it was about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleepwalking teen.","review":"Donnie Darko is one of those films you will either love or hate. I sort of love this movie, I saw it over a month ago and still can't get this dark comedy out of my head. Jake Gyllenhaal tends to overact sometimes but overall, his performance as the title character is quite engaging. His sister Maggie Gyllenhaal also stars, she is such a powerful and intense actress. Even Patrick Swayze is a marvel, probably his finest performance of his short, amazing career. The premise is really outrageous but Donnie Darko will leave you scratching your head and that's a good thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT HIGH DEFINITION!!!!","review":"this is for those curious about the blu ray edition, first off, i love this movie and i owned the previous blu ray edition which was not in high defintion either so when i read about this and heard it actually was to be converted in true high definition this time, i was stoked and shelled out the mere $16 just to again find out its the exact same disc used as the previous \\"blu ray\\" edition. Sadly the only thing new to this package is the digital copy and a standard dvd copy...i wish i would have just kept my older copy, at least it had a cooler cover design"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult favorite is a hit-and-miss affair","review":"DONNIE DARKO(USA - 2001)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalA lonely high school student (Jake Gyllenhaal) is beset by visions which portend either a mental breakdown or the End of the World...Richard Kelly's debut film aims for cult status at every level but fails to fly off the screen. Though a fine actor, Gyllenhaal is basically miscast, and Kelly's style is too laidback to make much of an impact. Cult favorite James Duval (a regular in Gregg Araki's outrageous movies) makes a cameo appearance as the object of Gyllenhaal's strange 'visions'. Fine use of the wide Panavision frame.A re-edited director's cut was subsequently released on home video."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those movies to watch over and over again!","review":"During a year i watch at least over 600 movies a year since it is part of my job. When i first rented Donnie Darko i wasn't sure what to expect. I loved it from beginning to end and went out to purchase the DVD the next day. Even though it was pricey at $.. when it was first released it was a good buy. The DVD is packed with bonus features such as a couple of commentaries, many deleted and extended scenes, trailer, still galleries, etc.Where to begin on just how good this movie is? I'm not quite sure where to begin. The story itself is very original and enagaging. The cast is perfect and there is some marvelous acting throughout the picture. The visuals are simply marvelous, it is a treat for the eyes. The soundtrack is also quite excellent from 1980's pop tunes to droning ambience.This is one movie in which you notice something different every time you watch. I've already watched it at least 10 times and that is incredibly rare for me to do that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good God, where to begin...","review":"Donnie Darko is my absolute unquestioned movie of the year. I honestly do not believe that I have seen a more incredible movie in my lifetime. The acting was superb, the cast was wonderful, the plot was incredible, and it all came together to create what will no doubt be a cult classic forever. If you have any doubts about this movie, I can guarantee you, they will be erased upon viewing it. This movie is as close to perfect as you can get. Unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just wasn't that good...","review":"I'm sure there are many attempts on the internet to figure out all the inner workings of this film, but i couldnt help but wonder whether the film itself knew what it was talking about. Sure, you had weird rabbits, numbers, time travel... but with all of these details and elaborate connections, we never really get a sense of the heart of the movie - only a glimpse at a glitch in time which results in a boy choosing to die when he has the chance. This movie promises to be something big and intreguing, but it never tells us why. All we are left with is the green rabbit, \\"cellar door,\\" and perhaps a vague impression that Donnie doesnt think we're alone. So what? It seems to me that ll the hype surrounding this movie is an attempt to find completion in the mediocre ending.If you are looking for a serious thought provoking, time travel movie, check out Terry Gilliams \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Objective Review","review":"95% of the people reviewing this movie are either drooling over it to put themselves above the fray or bashing it to put themselves above the fray. Ignore those people.Donnie Darko is a movie about the alienating and contradictory forces that act upon people in our modern world. Though many would write it off as a teen angst movie because the protagonist is a high school student, the movie shows that the same forces which alienate teenagers are acting on the adults and authority figures as well. That said, many of the people giving this movie five-star ratings are not worth listening to either. Here's the deal:Excellent plot, acting, cinematography, dialogue, and musical score.That's all I had to say. I figured this movie could use an endorsement from somebody who isn't crusading against \\"hollywood crap\\" or bashing this movie as \\"pretentious teen drama.\\" I like movies, and I like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD dudd","review":"No good, cannot get it to run in OZ.

No deja nada a medias.Yo la recomiendo bastante, esta subtitulada al español."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's cut is NOT as good as studio release","review":"I know, I know. It's hard to believe, but it's true. The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is TERRIBLE compared to the studio release. The way the film is pieced together is not nearly as effective as the original, nor were the director's choices in terms of soundtrack. Please, if you are going to buy this film for a Donnie Darko fanatic, buy them the studio release instead.By the way, before you slam my review, please know that I am a devotee of Donnie Darko. I've seen it several times at midnight screenings at Two Boots Theater in Alphabet City (in NYC, baby!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me crazy....","review":"I like the first cut better than the Director's cut. Don't get me wrong I like them both, but I watch the original DVD more than this one. Just my personal choice. It's a great movie either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jake is King","review":"I loved \\"Donnie Darko\\". I saw it on a movie channel on TV a few months ago, and i absoultely loved it. i'm into these kinds of weird, not fully advertised strange movies, so i throughly enjoyed watching it. i mean, the way that Jake Gyllenhaal played such a different character than what i've seen him do, it was great to see the diversity. i reccommend this movie to all the freaks of the world who don't mind a little creepiness in their lives every once in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Innovative, and Thought Provoking","review":"Donnie Darko is one of those rare movies with something for everyone that still manages to be completely dark.As you watch Donnies estranged version of life unfolding, you become increasingly troubled by just how screwed up he probably is, the damage he's capable of doing, and the twisted way everything he says makes sense.Generally its a movie that will keep you thinking- shallow movie goers will probably think of it as too confusing or that its posing as something more than it is. The interesting thing about the story is that the more you look into it, the less you see these things, and the more you realize the paradox of the story. It will leave you with many a question. Most of all- as the tragically redone version of Mad World plays- you'll be asking \\"Why?\\"Is Donnie a tragic hero? A messed up teen? Did any of it really happen to begin with? And what in the world is going on, anyway? Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"The first time I watched this movie was about a year ago, my brother was a big fan of it, and recommended it to me. Now, after about 4 other times of watching it, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. As has been said before on hundreds of reviews Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor, I cannot imagine anyone playing Donnie any better than him. This movie has great dialogue, very realistic in how awkward some of the conversations are, and hilarious at times, while just weird at other times. It makes me mad at the reviews who get on here just to bash it, and say stuff about how it will be for kids who wear black clothes and get their parents to drive them to the hot topic, yeah well if that's true than how come the biggest audience this has is probably college students? Just because you did not understand it, and think you're smart does not mean you have to bash the movie.Anyway, great movie, watch it if you get a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice mental exercise for geeks","review":"I watched the director's cut version twice and still couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie. Only after I went through the commentary, did everything (except for one thing) make sense. I doubt ANYONE could really get the story after one viewing or without the help of the commentary or the info on the internet. If the audience doesn't \\"get it\\" by watching the movie alone, I say it is a failure on the film maker's part.That said, I was intrigued by it. I guess the challenge of figuring it out is what attracts geeks (I consider myself one) everywhere to this movie. When you finally \\"get it\\", it becomes a wonderful movie. Just one thing that still doesn't make sense though, when the jet engine (the Artifact) appears in the primary universe at the end of the movie, doesn't it make it a Tangent universe? Doesn't the clock start ticking again, only this time, it wouldn't be Donnie who saves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Blu-Ray transfer","review":"I love this movie and would give it 5 stars. But the Blu-ray version is really bad. They didn't even make the special features in HD. The movie looks really bad. You can tell the difference by looking at the previews in the disc and then watching the movie. I am really disappointed in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko","review":"What's NOT to like about it? For me, this DC is far better than the original movie. Some scenes cut from the original are quite simple, but still, very emotional and should have never left the movie in the first place. They provide more depth to the movie and its characters. The soundtrack is just the way the director had originally intended, and they also had more time to work with the special effects.And well, yes, the original movie is far more \\"open\\" to interpretation, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. As for me, I liked to know what the director's idea for what was behind the events that happened in the movie was.One thing is clear for me: The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone time-warp movie","review":"Donnie Darko is another time-warp movie. There's some originality to the plot, but the overall idea is not too original, or particularly coherent. This is another example of a movie made by drug addicts who put their crazed minds on screen, to pollute the American general public. Stupid movie with terrible acting. Avoid. You won't get anything interesting; only to make the drug addict filmmakers and their souless studio executive backers richer so they could buy more illicit drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Much!?!","review":"I've seen my I've seen my fare share of Horror, Sci-Fi, Suspense, etc. & I can honestly say I was mentally bored with this movie. The kid that played Donnie was not a believable character. The only time I saw \\"talent\\" was the scenes when he was hypnotized. Other than that the only good thing about the movie was not the remake, but the fact they used mad world, a Tears for Fears classic song, was good enough to bother watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"I never received this product from the Vendor.

I had high expectations for this film, as it came highly recommended by friends of mine who ordinarily have good taste! I thought it was slow, cliched, with underdeveloped, smarmy characters.

Rarely is so much emotion and passion caught in one place. But this does it. Discussions of God, loneliness, time travel, insanity, destiny, fate, love, hate, fear, meaning, purpose, death, life.. It's all here. In one of the most mysterious movies ever created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius lies in time travel","review":"When I first saw this movie, I had no idea the magnitude of the film. I couldn't appreciate the subtleties in its metaphors or the amazing art direction or even the great writing.After seeing it a few times now, I see something new every time, it's one of those movies that you enjoy seeing each time just because it strikes a certain chord within you.If you like macabre films that make you question the meaning of existence and space and time, by all means watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't people see the obvious. !!!WARNING: SPOILER!!!","review":"WARNING: DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE. IT IS NOT WORTH IT TO RUIN THIS MOVIE BY READING THIS REVIEW. This movie is obviously misunderstood by some of the lower life forms out there. This movie will draw you in and keep you interested if you have the ability to follow complex stories. You have a right not to like this movie. But when I watch this movie I see the story of a person who fell in love, and when the choice was presented before him that he could go on living or sacrifice himself to save the person he loved. Donnie chose to sacrifice himself. The story is one of true love. He sacrifices himself for no honor. The girl he loves does not even remember him after the act. This is the story of a true superhero who sacrifices all for the one he loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donnie Darko - Are you kidding me(?)","review":"I have nothing to say except I just wanted to own this movie. Who has not seen or at the very least heard of the movie Donnie Darko. This will definitely end up a cult classic. I am glad to have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donnie's Wild Ride","review":"Donnie Darko is an extremely original and thought provoking film. It's a wild ride through the teenage mind of Donnie Darko.Donnie's ride begins when he is visited by a rather large and scary rabbit who predicts the world will end in a matter of days. The same night his room is obliterated when an airplane engine comes crashing through the roof. This sets in motion a chain of events that lead the already troubled youth to become obsessed with apocalyptic visions, time travel and the nature of reality.Is he delusional or a visionary? What is the nature of reality and time? How do we fit into the universe? All of these things are part of the sometimes strange, sometimes funny world of the denizens of Darko's universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected it to be!","review":"I'll give Donnie Darkko credit for his character's challenge to the status quo of school, family and friends. There's even some humor in it. Then there's his interesting ideas about time travel but after that his character becomes such a s*** head and the movie takes a dive. You're better off renting it, rather than owing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"misunderstood","review":"While looking through these numerous reviews, it's hard to separate the people who like the movie because they think it's cool-looking and those who actually understand it, specifically the ending. Even if you do get the ending, it only deserves four stars. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with four stars. But there really aren't any original ideas. Think of it as a remake of the New Testament. Remakes can be very good, as this one is, but they're simply not original. So if you're looking for a ground-breaking, exceptional piece of cinema this will probably fool you into thinking it is. For everyone else who simply want a good movie different from your standard fare, look no further. To simplify it even further,unless you're searching for the best movie ever, see this one. If you don't get it the first few times you probably never will so have someone explain it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't understand it...watch it again","review":"Aaaaaamazing.

They should call it Donnie Dull. Sure the acting was good. The storyline was offbeat as well, but a good portion of it just did not keep me interested. I am personally getting pretty tired of movies where most of the characters are depressing. There were afew laughs but if I want laughs I will just watch the Marx Brothers. I doubt if I will recomend this to anyone. I kept looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end.

I can't believe I actually sat through this whole movie without picking up my television and throwing it to the ground. There are so many holes and continuity problems in this script.. not to mention the fact that from a linguistic standpoint, the script changes the definitions of so many words, sometimes mid-movie - to serve its own pointlessness. If you are a 16 year old bi polar, you may like this film... if you are a 23 year old college grad, pass this one up. This script is what would happen if Jessica Simpson took a philosophy class and wrote a script on what she thought the class meant."},{"rating":"1","title":"tries too hard","review":"I gave this away to a sophomore in college. they hated it as I did, but they gave it to another person who loved it..go figure. Not my thing...I felt myself rolling my eyes and thinking \\"oh, brother\\" or \\"give me a break\\" the whole time. I like symbolism movies that make you think, but it seemed this one just tried to hard only to be that, and not enough at trying to be a good movie, too.

First off, the director somehow manages to get all the actors to be on the same page, for wry, real, fun portrayals. It's hard to describe, but it's not the sort of thing anyone in hollywood is fresh enough to put out right now.And from that fulcrum extends a movie that has sci-fi, horror, and surreality, and coming of age, but never loses itself in pomposity or ridiculousness.

Also, I noticed that some people who say they like the movie like it for its apparent \\"theoretical\\" significance, but don't be fooled. The people I know who have said this are actually just trying to sound smart which is obvious due to the fact that this movie is in no way theoretical.

There's not a lot going on.

I am disappointed that the Blu-Ray release does not have the longer version on it, which I feel is a much more complete movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THE THEATRICAL VERSION!!","review":"Had I have read a RECENT review about how horribly Richard Kelly butchered his beautiful theatrical version on this RECENT Director's Cut release, I would NOT have bought THIS DVD.IT DOESN'T EVEN START THE SAME!!! Instead of Echo and the Bunnymen, it's INXS (INXS was a great band, but \\"Killing Moon\\" set the pace in the original) The added scenes tried way too hard to explain the events, making the Director's Cut more frustrating to enjoy.Donnie Darko is a SPECTACULAR movie! Get the THEATRICAL version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear director -- what were you thinking?","review":"As a devoted fan of the theatrical release, I was deeply disappointed with the Directors Cut. The new footage and assorted changes add nothing substantive or interesting and the attempt to \\"explain all\\" reveals that the director himself does not understand what made the original one of the great cult movies in recent years -- that incredible mind-blow at the end of the movie, with only a clue as to what you just witnessed. With all the hitting you over the head with the \\"meaning behind the story\\", the wonderment was completey ruined.So, if you've never seen Donnie Darko before, do yourself a huge favor and steer clear of this version and get the theatical release. If you have seen it already, don't waste your money on it either, since you will be bummed out by what the director has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"inventive? yes. a masterpiece? no.","review":"I was curious to see what everyone was raving about, so I decided to give it a whirl. One can't catogorize this movie; there are so many elements in it. Teenage 80's, scifi, etc. But I would say this is more of a - put the mystery together type of movie. I give it credit for being original, but i can't help but wonder from beginning to end, \\"when is this gonna end?\\" My girlfriend totally hated this movie. It spread itself thin trying to put every genre together. There were quite a few funny parts though - one being a funny smurf conversation.Sure, i understand what's going on. But, you should rent this one first, cause it's not for everyone. Along the same lines as this is muholland drive, which is far better. Same with final destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW this movie is a GEM","review":"I expected to see a good movie with the all star star cast. This was better than I could of expected. It really hit the spot. AWESOME, ORIGINAL, GROUNDBREAKING, Prettymuch AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donnie Darko Director's Cut","review":"An easy version of the movie well worth watching. This version cuts the gore that is really meaningless. The directors cut is the one to get and enjoy. The music is wonderful as well. Stays with you. Movie insights to read the book. Well acted by all. A look at life from a tender aspect, this topsy turvy movie is reality meeting reality head on. Jake Gyllenhaal's dark personality shows through again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Director's Cut","review":"This includes only the director's cut, not both the standard and director's cuts. I assumed it included both. What's the problem? The music is different on many scenes.

I liked that it was different and challenging. A movie like this just shows you that there are new and fresh ideas out there if Hollywood would just stop making sequel after sequel and rehashing of old TV shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"**","review":"I haven't been as disappointed with a film people have raved about since THE DOOM GENERATION. THE DOOM GENERATION was a piece of junk from beginning to end, while DONNIE DARKO does have some witty dialogue and some great acting. But overall it just did not remotely live up to the raves. A lot of the movie is terribly contrived. If you raved about this film and haven't seen THE DOOM GENERATION, you probably should. That's an inverted recommendation, I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Slow and Pretentious","review":"Hard as it is to break from the pack, I have to admit I found this cross between Back To The Future and a Dawson's Creek that takes itself way too seriously to be highly overrated. Acting like it invented the satirical look at new-age philosophy and sudden surrealist imagery, the twist at the end makes it look like Donnie was suffering from a teenage martyrdom fantasy, which is hardly worth the price of a DVD. Go rent My Own Private Idaho if you want at least a mildly less tight-assed (no pun intended) film of hot young actors coming to hallucinatory grips with the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darko Shmarko","review":"I have heard A LOT about this movie, in that it will blow my mind, it's like nothing you've ever seen, etc. etc. That's not quite true, I've seen OTHER bad movies also. If you've seen REAL movies of this ilk, like Jacobs Ladder or 12 Monkeys, you'll think of Donnie Darko as a teen rip off... how's that for a mental image?? This same story has also been used countless times on Serlings Twilight Zone (minus the terrible acting).Nothing about this movie was really worth watching, the pacing, performances, dialogue... nothing. Even the much belly-whooed \\"Rabbit\\" lost it's charm after the second appearance. The two stars are for the lead (Darko was decent) and the 2 discs have a lot of info (sadly they are ABOUT this MOVIE). Barrymore consisted of nothing more than dead weight and Swayze was even worse. Take my advice; Don't always believe the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie-noir Americana.","review":"I had never seen this movie in its entirity, so I had to get it and there were no disappointments, American movie noir at its best. I also got the soudtrack which I would not recommend unless you like to park your mind in a musical loop, most of the tracks sound alike except for the two with great lirics describing donnie's revolving threshold between reality and?You write up the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Psychological Thriller","review":"One of the best Psycho Thrillers I've ever seen. You have to see it twice....just get's better and better every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"why Donnie Darko is the best movie you've ever seen.","review":"Ok look. Im gonna cut straight to the chase ok, Im not gonna go into all of this crap on why it is or isnt good because of 1 boched second of the film ok. Look! Donnie Darko is a great movie and deserves a ton of credit. Richard Kelly is 26 and this is his first film. it's also the first film iv'e seen that accually made me think when it was over. All of the depth he put into this masterpiece took so much time and effort it's mind boggling. Im not gonna say, \\"Hey it's his first movie, go see it to cut him some slack.\\" Im saying go see it because it will blow your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all as cracked up to be","review":"I rented this film recently because of all the \\"cult hype\\" I had heard regarding this feature. I was disappointed to say the least. The actors really carry this film, doing their best with what little plot there is to it. Some might say that I just didn't get the film, but I think the weaknesses, especially the expected ending, support my argument. Several scenes were just over the top in a way that didn't appear realistic. It just seemed like a film that promised a lot, but couldn't deliver. Did this film make me think? Sure, it made me think that this film really didn't have a whole lot going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible packaging.","review":"Let me just start off by saying I love this movie. I rented it a week ago and now I want to buy it. The thing is, when I got the movie the discs were out of the slots and sliding around the case. I checked and they were a little scratched. I am sending it back for a new copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GREAT CLASSIC HERE.","review":"This movie has a ... long drawn out ending,that makes me really despise it.i won't give it away,but up until that point i found it mildly interesting,and kinda clever.and then it truly drops the ball at the end,Thumbs down big time.The director never explains this glaring plot point,awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and bad. A slow discussion piece","review":"I can't say I loved, or even liked this movie right after I saw it. In my book it committed the cardinal sin of movies and dragged. Right in the middle it just seemed to be going slower than a dead snail on a salted sidewalk. It was extremely creative and imaginative, and defiantly one of those movies you will be discussing with friends after seeing it. The end really threw me. I didn't see it coming at all. Worth seeing, but not worth owning. And if you made it to the end, I would defiantly watch parts of it with the commentary on. It was really worth it to hear the makers of the film talk about their work, especial the last few scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I notice that some people rated this convoluted mess of a movie highly. WHY> Maby it is an age thing. I am an adult older american. Maby for some reason I could not fathom young people like this mess.It was a waste of money. A film that could have said everything it wanted to say in one half hour. The rest is puff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just dont get it","review":"Just cuz a movie is wierd and twisted doesnt mean it is necessarily good. I love twisted movies - that have a point. Whats the point of this movie? All my family and friends who say they love this movie cant even explain it to me. Its so good cuz of the cast. Oooo its so good cuz that bunny is so crazy. The colors are so cool. The soundtrack is really good. Thats all fine but none of that matters if the movie doesnt make sense. Is there some big statement about the state of the world? An observation about the power of love? Something about white american surburbia? Time travel? Schizophrenia? I dont get it. The whole movie is a just a countdown and then jake goes back and doesnt talk to the bunny so he dies. big deal. Events are altared. Wow. There s never been a movie about time travel where events in time are changed. Someone please explain this mess to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated movie of the year","review":"Like a lot of other suckers who bought this movie, I thought it would be a cool, atmospheric horror film with some sort of monster bunny rabbit. Needless to say, I was dead wrong. This is a bad movie from beginning to end, one that tries to be artsy by providing a convoluted and incoherent plot about a depressed high school kid. The bunny rabbit turns out to be some mask, not a real demon or anything, and the horror elements are very poorly handled.Most of all, I found this movie to be BORING. But like a lot of boring, overrated films (such as IN THE BEDROOM or BREAKING THE WAVES or, dare I say it, SPIDERMAN) this movie has managed to trick a lot of people into thinking it has worth. Save your hard-earned dollars and buy one of these great films instead:THE STEPFORD WIVESVOLCANO HIGHTHE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLYEQUILIBRIUMUNDISPUTEDJACOB'S LADDERNIGHT OF THE HUNTER w/ Robert MitchumKEOMAIf you haven't seen these movies, check them out. You will thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imeanlikeok","review":"How you relate to this film probably depends on your proximity to California, judging by the ten minutes of space cadet commentary I listened to in order to find out what on earth happened at the end of this DVD (still none the wiser.) The afore-mentioned state is either airhead central or the Zen capitol of the world (nay universe) but I'm keeping mum. Despite the fact she never cooks.Kudos to the producers for fooling me into thinking this was a big budget disaster, rather than a small budget one. Down to the photography, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donnie Darko review","review":"I chose 1 star because it didn't play right. Towards te end of the directors cut it started skipping and the theatrical version didn't play at all ok blue ray. I would recommend someone to rather go buy this DVD at target or best buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review for Donnie Darko","review":"When I first rented this film, as with some I have never heard of, I chose it based on the synopsis on the back. What I saw was a mix of horror, comedy, drama, and science fiction. I had to watch it a few times, not just to fully understand what the movie's message was, but because it was just that good. If you're in the mood for an entertaining film that causes you to think without being pretentious, pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting reflection about life and death","review":"This movie is an interesting and provocative reflection about death and the role of death in our life. The actors go well and the script is well written. You can't predict what's going to happen in the next moment. This movie uses a non traditional form of story telling (I would say similar to David Lynch's style) trying to reach the unconcious.The reason I like this movie is because it has a point (I won't say what it is). And after my initial sadness of thinking of my own mortality, the movie actually made me feel better about myself and death. This is not just some weird movie that appeals to the wanna-bes of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The question isn't whether or not the movie's good, it's whether or not to watch the director's cut or the original","review":"Donnie Darko is a very good movie. Yeah it gets a little to complicated for itself at times, but it's entertaining the entire way through. A very good film with a very good cast. Almost nothing wrong with it. But...The Director's Cut: Alright, this version of the film has been criticized by many fans and critics. Often seen as making the film, simple and cheap. I myself do not enjoy it quite as much as the original, for the above reasons. But by no means does the Director's Cut make it a bad movie. I mean heck, I own it. The specials on the dvd are also pretty good.I still suggest to you that you watch the original first, but if you don't, I wouldn't worry about it. The whole, \\"The Director's Cut is the Worst movie Ever\\", isn't true. I hope you enjoy this very good movie.Rating: 4 StarsI hope this was helpful, thanks for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"I thought that the original release of donie darko was the best movie I've ever seen, and I was looking foward to the directors cut, but once I saw it I was very disapointed to see how badly he butchered this fantastic film. Many of the key scenes were alterd, ruining some of the best moments in the film, and the eye ball thing that was added before incounters with frank was just plain retarded. Also this version was way too dumbed down, the showing of portions of the book as well as the added scene in the end with grandma death, told far too much. The original release really made you think, and took several veiwing for you to truely grasp everything, but this version lays everything out for you, turning one of the most complex movies I've seen into just your average ordinary run of the mill film. If you havent seen donnie darko yet go out and buy the original, and if you already own the original, this dvd will just disapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can be watched more than once","review":"I love this movie. I have watched more than once because there is always new findings each time. Everytime I finish watch this movie, I feel like I missed something.This movie make you think and feel like there is more than what you see in the movie as if it can be happened for real. I even went to website to see if there is somehing more to find about this movie. I'm personally big fun of Jake and I think he has this charisma that makes you think there is something deeper than what you see. This is definitely one of my collection movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"cellardoor","review":"Thought provoking and complex, this movie refreshed me after so many bad teen flicks. Donnie Darko not only scares you but he entrapes you in his world of bunnies and time travel. The acting is excellent, allowing you to find yourself in each character and making you become invested in everyones individual story. The fact that it did not win an oscar, shows that there is something deeply wrong with the film industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same music","review":"I much prefer the original. The music selection is a lot different and for me the music in the original set the tone. Most upsetting is the abscence The Church's song at the Halloween party.

A hodgepodge of genres, it leaves you unable to verbalize your feelings about the full spectrum of sensory stimulation that you just sat through...add the fact that it didnt even MAKE it to most theaters, and you begin to get very cynical about the way Hollywood makes movies these days.Folks, this is worth 10 times what it costs.

Listening to the director's commentary, he credits a Twilight Zone episode as perhaps having inspired him. The episode mentioned is \\"Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.\\" While there is something to this comparison, the episode that \\"Donnie Darko\\" is virtually a twisted rip-off of is is a rather obscure episode written by Earl Hamner of \\"The Waltons\\" fame. The episode is called \\"Ring-a-Ding Girl\\" and is, in essence, the entire story of \\"Donnie Darko\\" told under half-an-hour, in a much more touching manner. And yes, there is even a jet crash in it and the ultimate sacrifice. But - watch the TZ episode and see for yourself. Just like \\"The Sixth Sense\\" was lifted from an old \\"Thriller\\" episode....alas, there is nothing new under the sun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and tragic.","review":"When I saw the film previews I had no idea of what a good film this actually was. I thought it was just going to be some silliness trying to pass itself off as grand indie art. The thing is, this film really IS grand indie art! I was quite shocked by the ways in which this film deviates from the normal formulaic storyline every other Hollywood movie falls into.This is a film that can't be easily described, certainly not without ruining it. I think that this film deserves at least one viewing, perhaps more. Its definitely the kind of film you need to reserve discussion time for.I am eagerly awaiting the Director's Cut to be released in theatres!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Film, AWFUL Blu-Ray Transfer","review":"Man, I've loved this movie ever since word spread about it being a must-see right after it came out on DVD. Fox really screwed the pooch on the transfer, it looks like a muddy VHS tape straight from the 80s where this story takes place. I seriously hope they're not trying for another double dip as it got on DVD, because as much as I love Richard Kelly, I simply will not be taken advantage of again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not brilliant","review":"I bought this based on the reviews you have read below mine. What a disappointment.Convoluted and complex, it leaves the viewer confused and dissatisfied. What is the point of the phone number on his arm, what does Drew Barrymore's character add to the story? Maybe I am missing the finer points of the intricate plotline, but then again, the key feeling I felt at the end was one of apathy... I did not particularly care.The ending is obvious, and not a surprise. Granted this is better than Final Destination, but if that is the benchmark, then we can all find better things to do in 'approximately 98 minutes.'One to watch if you must... not buy. Avoid, unless you are an undying fan of 'Sixth Sense' in which case I would redirect you to the black and white classic, 'Dead of Night' which is infinitely superior to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Donnie Darko is garbage :o(","review":"I don't normally purchase DVDs until I have at least viewed them once. Since I have heard nothing but good about Donnie Darko I thought I would give it a try.This movie was very hard to sit through. The plot was retarded. I was kind of skeptical about the plot anyway since on the back of the box it mentions something about Donnie Darko hallucinating and seeing a walking talking bunny rabbit.Donnie Darko did not keep my interest, however I did reluctantly watch the entire movie- only out of curiousity to see how much more stupid the movie could get.I don't have a clue on how this movie got so many five star reviews.

I was very excited about giving this toy to my six-year-old for Christmas. We are on day five now, and we have yet to get the thing to make a car. The crayons do not melt correctly, so we even tried chopping them into tiny pieces prior to melting. Still no car. I have always trusted the name Crayola before, but I will certainly thing twice before buying again. This was a total disappointment for my entire family.

Neither units work. We have yet to get one car made. The units keep locking, even when you're not using the machine! The lights indicating each stage of the process did not work, so we had to just watch the time and perform the pouring and mold stage without being alerted. When you finally got the car out of the mold it cracked all up trying to get the car on the chasis. This product needs to be recalled!I've never been so disappointed in a toy in my life!

MS Paint probably works better than this junk. Pen does not work properly, you have to really press the pen hard on the surface to make it work and even then it works with a delay. You press it hard, after a few seconds something appears on the screen that might resemble what you actually intended to write. Maybe for drawing it might work if you press it hard but if you want to write with it forget it. Software that comes with it is clumsy and too simplistic, saving your work doesn't work most of the time and even if it did you are saving it on a pad that only works with their software, you can not save it on MSWord for example. My advice is, spend a little more and get something that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I confirm other negative reviews","review":"As others mentioned, the software is positively antique.

And after a year of owning it, I cracked the pen from all the use I got out of it.

I had some pressure problems in Photoshop, but I fixed it soon enough. Then out of the blue, it stopped working! I tried everything.My brother bought a computer afterwards. Windows 7 didn't fix anything. I put the tablet away. A few months later I bought an iMac, and I tried there too. Nothing worked! The light just blinks and it does nothing else.

At $50 the price is not out of reach for most people and it is a great tool.What I like:Set up was easy, it was basically plug and play for me - I didn't need the installation disk or even to read the directions. I just put batteries in and away I went.The pen and mouse are sensitive and work really well. I was concerned they wouldn't be as responsive as I wanted for my more intricate drawings, but they stood the test.The tablet surface itself is a good size, not to small but not to big either.Works with any program any application, just like a regular mouse would.The only complaint I think I might have is that the tablet is not also wireless. But this is a minor thing and does not all interfere with my enjoyment of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the money!","review":"I found this product to be outstanding for the money. I've never owned a graphics tablet before and I'm glad I bought this one first. Like some of the other reviews state, the pen feels a little cheap. I also had to change the battery in the pen out of the box and I would recommend this to anyone who buys this product. The pressure sensitivity works pretty well although the nib on the pen tends to be a bit sticky if you don't apply pressure just right. I would recommend this tablet to anyone buying a graphics tablet for the first time. If I were a professional graphics designer I would probably go with a more expensive Wacom tablet.

I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers. No change. I looked up the website for the tablet and they had a driver for Vista. So, I installed that. The mouse started working and the pen now only works in things like GIMP and Paint. Which I guess is alright, considering that's what I was going to use the pen for anyway, but it was kind of cool to use just the pen to do all the mouse functions.I have glitches with my mouse from time to time still. The pointer drags across the screen without the mouse moving a bit. Or it stops working altogether and I have to restart the computer.

I thought I'd have to buy another tablet because it did this for about a day or so, but started working with my Photoshop and SAI again. So when you have to change the batteries be careful and keep trying to make it work for awhile it might come around. Overall for the price it's an awesome tablet. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I had briefly used a professional Wacom and of course this one can't compare. BUT it's good enough for me. I am not a graphic artist so I don't need anything too high-tech and this one is enough for me to use graphic design software for basic hobby-related designing. One minor annoying thing I find is when the battery begins to run out the pen will stop working so I have to remove the battery and put it back so that it can still work. Or maybe it is just the battery that's the problem (I have been using it for about 2 months and still using the batteries it came with but on the second one - I don't use the mouse at all).

The review was prompted by its untimely death - it can no longer be recognized correctly by any computer. So, here are some other details:+ It is a pen+tablet, and it works for that, on a basic level.+ Standard AAA battery in the pen- The pentip is not securely attached inside the pen, kind of wobbling around a bit, so it is difficult to properly and precisely control its placement and pressure.- The tablet sometimes fails to properly track the pen when it's moving.- The tablet randomly loses the ability to detect the pen at all, requiring that a button on the pen be pressed to re-establish the connection to the tablet.- It evidently may be prone to simply dying after a few years of very infrequent use.It's a Harbor-Freight-grade of product - something to get if you need a cheap solution that'll work for one or two tasks, but just don't expect much more than that out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Mac OS","review":"After installing the tablet drivers for OS X 10.6, (this process itself didn't instill much confidence) the tablet failed to work.

I got a wacom bamboo and it worked immediately upon plugging it in.You'd think due to the large amount of gfx artists on macs, that they'd really nail down Mac OS support.One more note: the mouse provided with the tablet is cheap... super cheap.

For anyone who has never used one, this is a fairly simple one to use. Very light weight and small, about as big as a lap top though the drawing space is just a little bigger than a piece of paper. The drawing stylus is best since the mouse, while really small, still takes up a fair amount of space on the tablet. I'd recommend this tablet for anyone who has never had one before and wants something simple to use.

The Wacom tablets are the standard of the industry for good reason, and even their lower priced offerings have the same wonderful touch and control as the more expensive versions.This tablet does work as stated, it will get the job done, and would be fine for a child to use, but the pen action is not as precise as Wacom's, the tablet has a few spots which are slightly dead (causes the pen to \\"jump\\" to a different spot on the screen), and the mouse is too lightweight and small to be comfortable for daily use.If you are thinking of buying this, do yourself a favor and look at what Wacom offers, even their cheapest tablet will outperform this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chintsy - Poor support","review":"If you're serious about using a tablet, do NOT buy this one.NONE of Genius's tablets support multiple monitors. They say it is a \\"licensing\\" issue. Yeah, right.Overall, this does have a cheap feel to it, but it is inexpensive. But the mouse is smaller than a standard mouse, so I don't plan to use it. The biggest problem is that the stylus only works on the primary monitor, and anyone with multiple monitors will tell you that they don't EDIT on that one because of all the O/S stuff on that monitor.Besides, you can't use the included software (like Annotate on Word), unless of course you want to do EVERYTHING on your main monitor.If they had mentioned on the product specifications that it only works on one monitor, I would not have bought it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"great at first","review":"this was so great in the beginning, but after 1 month, it malfunctioned! it wouldnt work on my computer and when it did work (for about 30 minutes) the stupid thing wouldnt click anything! its a piece of junk, save ur money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with CS4 AND Vista 64 bit!","review":"I bought this item to use on a Vista 64 system with 8gb ram.

The only drawback for me is to remember the pressure sensitive tip plays a role in this device all the time. Once I had set my parameters for this in the above mentioned programs it worked great.

The mouse that it came with is pretty useless because I'm used to the way my old mouse works for some things, but I didn't buy the product for the mouse so that doesn't really matter to me.The buttons on the pen itself are a bit \\"sticky\\" but since actual clicking is done with tapping I don't mind so much, it's just that sometimes when you go to trigger scrolling, the button won't actually click down, but since scrolling and right-clicking is not the purpose of the product it bothers me very little.Oh, and remember to change the battery when you get it, the pre-installed battery is already dead.Overall I give this product four stars, because even though it has a couple of kinks it gets the job done and overall fulfills what is looked for in a pen tablet for the price that it is at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price if this is your first.","review":"I purchased one of these with no clue how a drawing tablet really had worked.

Wacom tablets have a better feel.If you wondering what programs I have ran the genius mousepen under they are:Photoshop cs2, cs3Adobe Flash cs2, cs3Fireworks cs3Corel Painter 8All these programs work great with the tablet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the Family!! Nice Large Work Area!","review":"This is absolutely the best thing I have recently purchased for the PC! It has an nice large working area surface so it is easy to use. Previously, I had a Wacom Bamboo FUN tablet which works great but the working are was absolutely tiny. Not this! I have 4 kids, ranging from 3 to 13 and eacah one loves drawing, writing, and playing with this tablet! They could spend hours playing with it if I let them! They also use it for playing games online, doing schoolwork, and I use it for editing photos, correcting/adjusting papers, and it is absolutely awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase","review":"This is the first tablet I've had and I love it.

So I am going to return it to Amazon and let them deal with Genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mouse has no purpose!","review":"What I expected was: a tablet that has a pen, and a wireless mouse that is usable as a plain old mouse. Well, what this includes is: a tablet that uses either a pen or that mouse. The mouse is *not* usable off of that tablet. The mouse and the pen are interchangeable as a method to position the pointer on the pad.This is idiotic. I returned it immediately and got another product:Wacom Bamboo Pen Tablet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius MousePen 8X6 Graphic Tablet for Home and Office","review":"This product does not work properly.It says on the box \\"Certified for Windows Vista\\", but the true is, it only works with windows vista.The driver don't even run on windows xp.

You have got to be kidding! They have not figured out that Vista is a factor in the market. The tablet works with Vista......but had to ferret out the problems myself as tech support was incapable of offering any suggestion. In addition, the software shipped with the product will not work with Vista and the only response I got was \\"have to check with Taiwan\\"......and Taiwan must not have e-mail connection to their own U.S. offices...as there has been no follow-up of any kind. Buy from these people at your own peril........they have shown incompetence and no interest in supporting what they sell. Don't buy this unless you want to be totally on your own. Disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"D.O.A.","review":"I so wanted this product to work and purchased this at Amazon's $39.00 special price. However, it was Dead on Arrival (DOA). I'm very computer savvy but couldn't get this thing to do a single thing. Even tried changing the battery in the pen . . . nothing. I have no doubt that it may be working for others. I think I'll spend the money and get what you pay for in a higher end product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius is a genius","review":"Thanks to a previous review on this graphic tablet, I was able to set up with only a minimum of confusion. Had it not been for subject review, I would have given up before I could make the tablet usable. The instruction manual that comes with the Genius is not user friendly. Once I had it set up it works great and saves my wrist from a lot of pain when editing multiple old photos which I have been digitizing to create a DVD of a family history of my parents. Much more practical for the casual user than the higher priced tablets. So... if you purchase the Genius, be sure to check out the earlier review that outlines how to set it up, print it out and keep it to use when you receive your tablet from Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"This is by far the worst tablet I've ever used. It may be the cheapest tablet out there, but your money is much better off spent on a better brand.Every 10-20 seconds or so, the cursor will freeze for about one second. This is a very annoying, and completely interrupts any action you are currently doing.The pen feels really cheap, and the tip is incredibly flimsy.The cursor will move when the pen is tilted. For example, when the pen is held at 90 angle to the tablet, the cursor will be in one spot, but if you tilt the pen to a 45 angle while keeping the tip in exactly the same place, the cursor will move. This makes tracing pictures next to impossible.It does not support dual monitors, so the tablet is stretched out over both screens, making it very frustrating to use.Whenever I try to use this tablet (and I've tried many times), it's always a constant battle just to make it work. You shouldn't have to fight your tablet. Save your money for a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This pen tablet is worthless. For the first couple of days, it seemed to run fine, and there were hardly any problems. The mouse shuts off after awhile when it isn't in use and I would have to click on the pen to get it to work. No big deal. That's how it saves battery power. ...Or so I thought. After about a week of use, the tablet would shut down permanently and I was forced to constantly restart the PC in order to get it working. That only temporarily solved the problem. Now, whenever It stops working, all I can do is restart the whole system. This thing is trash. Avoid it at all costs unless you're looking for a nice wide paper weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"adictive!","review":"I was drawing for a long time and I thought i should try a tablet.

I recommend this to any artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I don't see any reason why you would need to spend more money to get a Wacom or more expensive tablet. This thing works beautifully and does everything I could ever use it for.I use it mostly for Photoshop - touching up pictures and drawing. It's great as a mouse replacement also - more control and sensitivity.The only reason I don't use this instead of a mouse is because it's a bit more difficult to switch back and forth between the pen and the keyboard than the mouse and the keyboard. It only takes a second longer, but it can get kind of annoying.Don't spend more money than you have to and don't let this price fool you. The tablet is good, the included software is good, and you don't need anything nicer or more expensive than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first tablet at a very decent price!","review":"I've had this tablet for about 3yr now. I got it for x-mas one year. I was so excited to try it out since I do a lot of work in PS. It was easy to install and use. The thing that annoyed me to no end was the fact that it wouldn't let me calibrate it to my computer screen it has a setting to do just that, but it malfunctioned on me. As I said, I've had it for about 3yr and am very happy to have it as my first tablet. Recently, it decided it didn't want to work with PS anymore, but works okay with paint. It then decided to only work as long as I just wanted to use it as a mouse. This thing has lived longer than expected and done it's job beautifully. If you're looking for a great little tablet that'll give you something to practice with and see if a tablet is right for you without spending a lot, this is it! I enjoyed working with it when it was alive, now I can graduate to another one to continue my skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK for the money","review":"2 years later still working.

I called up the support team, and although it was a real pain in the ass to talk to someone, the representative was really helpful. Eventually I got a free replacement, and I was over the moon. I got to draw again!Unfortunately, that's not the end of the story. Before long, the new tablet crapped out on me, and I was forced to go through the process again. This time I felt that I had to be the one at fault, and asked what could have caused this. The representative was still happy to replace it, but was very unwilling to help troubleshoot.This time I treated my tablet like a vial of nitroglycerin. The amount of care and caution was ridiculous, and yet I got maybe 4 months out of it before having to get the replacement I'm using now.What the hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius Mousepen is a Great Tool","review":"We purchased this Mousepen for to use when creating artwork on Paint Shop Pro.

I downloaded updated drivers from the genius sit and purchased new fresh batteries. Not knowing how long it may have been setting on the shelf before I received it. It would be nice if the Pen and mouse had and L E D light to let you know they have power. The manual isn't very good seems just as I get to the last few steps and go to the next page They change the language to one I am not fluent in. I'll have to try a different vendor. Have to admit I find Windows often requires installing, un installing and re installing several times is usually required to get things to work. Would also be nice if the battery loaded more like a flash light. unscrew the end and drop in the batteries. The battery holder in the pen is quite flimsy and not easy to replace the battery"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!!!","review":"I find that this tablet is both affordable and user friendly.

It works great, was easy to set up and it was ready to go right away. The pen is very senistive and easy to use. It is a little bit of an adjustment for me to use the pen verses years of using the traditional mouse, but I can do more things with the pen then I ever could with a mouse.

I could find no way to contact them and express my displeasure. I would say no to buying another Genius brand tablet, and I suggest to anyone that a Wacom brand tablet (at http://www.wacom.com) seems like a better investment.

The software is a throwback to the 90's, the mouse wheel does not spin, the pen movement is jerky and erratic, so much so that even drawing something as easy as a smiley turned out to be a daunting task. The manuals where also written by someone who obviously doesn't have a command of English. I work in IT and usually have more patience with gadgets than most folks, but this one was packed up and ready to be sent back in all of 2 hours.

But on a Vista, the system reconfigures perfectly for it.Wacom has better quality tablets, but the size and features on the Genius beats it hands down with the price.

I am working on a comic, so being able to go straight from sketching to final outlines is a huge convenience. And the lines I make feel incredibly natural as well.

It seemed to work ok but the volume was never very good. I only set up 6 of the 8 speakers and 20 minutes into playing it stopped working - I assume it went into protection mode - and all I'm left with is a blinking standby light. I can turn it on but then it stops right away again. Did some research and this is nothing new - it doesn't seem well equipped to handle more than 2 speakers with anything over a moderate volume. Looks like the 7812 voltage regular is the culprit. I'm hoping they will take it back without much hassle because it is useless at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPDATE - Not so great after all","review":"UPDATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:Bringing this one down from 5 to 2 stars due to constant reliability issues. I have had this receiver for under a year, and it is used very sparingly. 3 months since I bought it, all sound stopped one day. Took it in for a warranty repair, came back after 3 weeks with a part replaced. 8 more months, and we are back to square one but with a different problem - now it turns off automatically within 2 seconds of starting up. Back to the service center. Seems like there are some pretty unreliable parts in this receiver for the sparing use it is getting.Original Review:Great quality, sound, easy to set up.Bought this just a few days ago to drive my multi-room speaker system setup. Used banana plugs (purchased separately) for the speaker wires to easily connect in a restricted closet space. Worked flawlessly with great sound in all rooms, using am, fm and (external) cd inputs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad luck","review":"I order a review on July 29, 2011. I got it on Aug 7.

Now I don't need extreme clarity of sound when I listen to music, but whenever I turn the volume over 40 this piece of junk shuts down and I have to reset the standby button, turn the volume down and wait about a minute for it to turn back on.

Plugged it in and it will play 20 minutes before cutting off, even at moderately low volume. Have since read other reviews that describe the same problem. Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, it is not really four channels but two channels with two pairs of speaker outputs on each channel. I bought it because I needed to drive 4 sets of 8 ohm speakers. This receiver will not do that. And even before it cuts off, the sound quality is terrible. I have had a couple of audiophile friends listen to it, and they both agree that it is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound, just what I wanted","review":"This unit solved several needs for us. It powers 4 sets of speakers in different rooms PLUS a woofer and provides simultaneous sound from the radio stations and TV as well.

It looked great and cleaned my cloudy water very quickly. I saw him trying to climb it, but it was too steep. He also has a basking rock that he uses, so I figured the filter was too steep for basking, but he can use his own rock anyway. This morning I came out because I heard a bunch of noise from his tank. I walked into the room and he had fallen from the filter and was floating in the water, on his back, with his arms and legs outstretched not moving at all. Thank God he was just shocked and seems ok, but this filter is just too difficult and steep for smaller turtles. He's about 6\\". Buyer beware. I thought I lost my little guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for fish or anything that poops","review":"I was so stoked to get this filter for my future newt. Figured id test it on a few fish first. First few days were fantastic but now th3 water is xloudy and intake holes dont do anything. I watch food, plant matter and feces just float past. What a waste. I would have snt this back if i had the box. I'm highly disappointed. It probably has something to do with the fact that the pump is so small. I really don't understand why they would make such a small pump for such a large filter unit there's no way that this filter could possibly filter unit for 55 gallons of water when it can barely keep a 10 gallon tank clean which is only filled halfway so don't waste your money too little more research and buy a better filter this 1 is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks pretty, but does not filter well","review":"I bought this filter about 3 mths ago.

Just not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive, nice waterfall, but pump quit after a month","review":"I bought this as an additional filter/habitat enhancer for my Eastern Painted turtle. We were going on vacation, and I didn't want the person checking on Franklin to have to change out the water, and I thought that an additional filter would help with that. Unfortunately, the filter quit while we were on vacation. Fortunately turtles do okay in murky water (their natural habitat) and the four feeder fish don't seem the worse for it, either. Also, little pieces of plastic keep falling off of the inside when I rinse it out during the tank cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Keeps my 110 Gallon tank crystal clear.

We have a tub of water placed in the tank and it works great except the filters will get clogged with the substract that Spike throws in the tub and the water will stop flowing into the hole were the pump is. Cleaning the filters worked. It looks nice and is perfect for what we wanted. It has a nice spot on top he can lounge if he wants to. It works with just a few inches of water. I would recommend it to anyone. It was also a good price and bigger than we thought but works perfect in the corner of the tub.

Until we installed it! Unfortunately With our 40 Breeder tank the side with the filter insert is just high enough for my girl to escape!!! so I sealed the hole with cardboard until I get some plastic. Another small problem I had with it was it has a maximum water limit that makes it too low for me to use my heater and a little low for my girl to swim (she's big) so I propped it up on one of the 89 cent stepping stones from the hardware store and now it is perfect!It was also VERY easy to install!

A couple of days later it wasn't running smooth again and the water was murky. I also noticed that my turtle could not get onto the basking platform because it was too steep and narrow and she fell backwards into the water trying to climb up. In the end, the filter is good only for looks and I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Filter, Works Well and Looks Good!","review":"This is working as the only filter in a 55 gallon tank housing an adult Reeves turtle.

The first 125 pages or so are pretty absorbing. Then it takes a dive. More and more of the same maddeningly slow-moving journal entries, mostly describing the greenery (though I did like Graham). You think it's going to get back up to speed or at least offer more than the narrator continuing to mourn lost love, lost friendship, lost parents -- but even when things actually begin to happen around page 221, it's not nearly as interesting as the first part of the book. A wasted opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a book by its title","review":"Silly title, absorbing novel. I was disappointed by the ending - it was unmemorable, which is why I don't now recall what it was - but I was impressed with the structure of the work, the imagination, and the subtle political message (something like \\"Don't let global warming destroy our world!\\").

Wells. He decides to go to the future to seek a cure.Unfortunately the writing style to this book was excrutiatingly boring, written in the first person. The narrator (the man with the incurable disease) jumps from concept to concept, without anything interesting to say. There is virtually no action. When he gets to the future, everything is destroyed and you keep waiting for him to encounter people, which never seems to happen. I found H.G. Wells Time Machine to be vastly more interesting and that was written over 100 years ago.Many other readers have given this book very high marks for writing and I wonder how they can? I know I kept finding myself skipping over a lot of paragraphs throughout the book and had to fight with myself to keep from just jumping to the back of the book and reading the end so I could get on with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but slow and over-romantic","review":"I liked the idea, the main character and it's adventures.

Instead it crawls in boredom and I cought myself skipping paragraph after paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but poorly thought out","review":"Though I was impressed by Wright's prose, I thought the plot he devised from the premise was both disappointing and weak. He writes from the environmentalist- pessimist's point-of-view about the future; humanity has fallen victim to itself in what is a thinly-veiled analysis of the failings of Britain in the 1990s, yet the assumptions that he bases his future on contradict themselves. Moreover, the outcome is a predictable one. He paints himself into a corner that is fairly evident by the middle of the novel, which was sad to see given the inspiring potential of his premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but too much time spent on the romance of it all","review":"The space wasted with the romance angle would have been better used as room for more imaginative writing. I enjoyed the creative effort towards the outlook of the future, but found myself dreading the romance. It seemed to go on and on and on. I know the title should have warned me; I was expecting a smaller portion than I received and was full before I finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Although the premise is interesting, Wright did not do justice to his own idea. The story is slow-moving and totally unbelievable. It's as if the author knew the outcome of his novel and had to go back and fill in the blanks, regardless of how senseless this makes the story seem. Furthermore, the character's (or is it the author's?) machismo is displayed on about every other page, and this rapidly becomes irritating. I regretted that I had spent the money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live and Loud!","review":"A great live album from a great live band. I also prefer this one to 72's Made in Japan.

(although Fleming has much more class)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book in the Series","review":"If you enjoyed Casino Royale, then you will also like the next book in the series, Live and Let Die. I don't know what it was, but I think it is just a little less enjoyable than the first book. The reason being the way that Ian writes for the black characters, it is some times hard to read and understand what they are saying. Trying to get the accent of what all black people talk like, according to him, makes some of the lines unreadable. Such as, it will say something like 'I dun no bot dis bose' but worse.Anyway, still a good story overall, but almost completely different from the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"Bond becomes more interested in Mr. Big, head of a voodoo operation in the Carribean, after he learns that he is working for SMERSH. He sees an opportunity to exact a bit of payback for the events of the previous book. It seems that Mr. Big may have found the pirate treasure of Captain Henry Morgan, and is using that for operational purposes.He also gets to work with Felix Leiter, from the CIA. Mr. Big has a fortune teller that is a true psychic, named Solitaire. A beautiful girl, she works out what the two agents are up to, and they end up captured. Eventually they escape, and as Solitaire is a beautiful girl, Bond takes her too.Felix Leiter is severely mauled by a shark.That is not the finale, as Bond and Solitaire are captured again, and dragged behind a boat, designed to slowly bleed to death as coral and other sea things cut them. The bad guys wouldn't be sad if blood attracted sharks to eat 'em, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Movie!","review":"The last James Bond to come even CLOSE to Ian Fleming was Thunderball. Ever since, the only thing in common with the Fleming novel's was the title. Readers of Live and Let Die will scratch their heads and wonder WHY Bond doesn't run across the heads of alligators. A good description of 50's Harlem, and how close friends Bond and Leiter are is revealed.There are several story-lines in this book that carried over to the Bond movies. Bond and Soliatire being dragged through the ocean is duplicated in For Your Eyes Only. Leiter being eaten by a shark, and Bond's retaliation is duplicated in License Renewed. Each Bond novel refers to the previous one. Leiter refers to Casino Royale. Live And Let Die is referred to in ? You need to read that one! Moonraker."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Bond Story","review":"I just started reading the James Bond books and started with Casino Royale, which wasn't a really great book. I described it as an apprentice effort in my review. That brings me to 'Live and Let Die' which felt like Ian Fleming really getting his legs under him.In this book, Bond finds himself trying to stop money laundering from an ancient shipwreck. The story takes him from New York to Florida to Jamaica. This time Fleming is able to control the tempo of the novel with his use of tempo, description, and characterization.Fleming built a more credible universe, one populated by a real villain that was much more sinister and had a motive for trying to destroy James Bond.A highlight for me was the building of the tension that led up to the first meeting between Bond and Mr. Big. While there were still some points where the writing could have been more complete, this was a much more solid effort by Fleming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond seems, well, a little dim","review":"I was never much of a Bond fan until the latest Daniel Craig films. I read all the books as a teenager in the late 1960s, and my memory tells me that they were OK. I decided to give them another try and I am finding them tough going.Casino Royale was interesting because of the casino - I am not a gambler but the details lent real depth to the story.Live and Let Die just seems moronic, in both characterization and plot. The racial overtones are constantly jarring, and Bond seems to always be behind the curve, reacting instead of attacking. He isn't portrayed as shrewd, savvy and alert, but more like a dim thug who shrugs off the warning signs of impending harm and then has to suffer because of it.I will try a few more, and if Bond remains a dim thug, I will abandon the effort and re-read Robert A Parker's most excellent Spenser books for a third time ... at least Spenser is a literate thug.John DaviesSpokane WA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Bond story","review":"As a longtime Bond movie fan, I've finally gotten around to reading the original novels and have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts","review":"I think that this book was really very good. The characters kept me interested in reading more because they didn't seem fictional at all.

Anyway, its good, watch it, the worst that can happen is you'll hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best NGE set out there","review":"Physical appearance: Beautifully and simply packaged, without a lot of fluff. Bright silver box and six slim DVD cases, with well-reproduced artwork on all. Five to six episodes on each disk, with synopsis of each on the back of the dvd case.Series: This is a thinking-person's anime. It starts out as an average giant-robot, shoot-'em-up series, then gradually gets deeper as more about the characters and the situation they find themselves in is revealed. The characters are well-thought out, each with their own motivations and psychological quirks. A lot is left to conjecture and speculation - not everything is laid out, even in the last episodes. It allows the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions about the intent of the series creator.NGE is rated TV-14 for good reason. There are adult situations included, and younger viewers likely wouldn't follow the complex psychological twists used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the Evangelion DVD box set!","review":"It's the whole series... (no movies...

They had musis videos and interviews and making of's....THE REASON I GOT THIS:I got it because the original American DVD release was low quality. This is High quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent before you buy","review":"People I got sucked into buying this collection last year because everyone said Neon Genesis Eva was the best anime period...so I bought it cold...with out even seeing it first.To put it simply, the animation, initial character development, and general overal concept are great. But the characters and story really never go anywhere. The first half of the collection is solid but you get bored with them trying to overcomplicate the plot. I love a complex story but by the end of the series you really could care less what happens to any of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey, but good","review":"Despite what one of the other reviewers said, this DOES NOT COME WITH THE MOVIE. It comes with the director's cut episodes and the DVD extras, but no more.I wouldn't spend over $55 dolars on this though, if you don't want the extras, the Platinum collection can be had relatively cheaply, and the Platinum Perfect is still around if you have the cash.Another thing is that one of the disc holders inside had some molding issues and made a hairline scratch around one of my discs. Everything played OK, but this is something to watch out for."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Response to \\"Close, but no Cigar but which Cigar do you want to Light?\\"","review":"In light of new evidence, I take back everything I ever said about this Series.Apparently, the end result is just because the Producers, Writers, and Director had no actual communication with each other, leading to a disjointed mess.I am no longer able to accept the flaws in the Plot Narrative as \\"artistic\\" license, instead of just being shodding craftsmanship and disfocused writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"Starters, I don't much care for special features. This set was perfect for me because of that. The thin cases save lots of room on the shelf, has all the episodes plus 4 director's cut episodes. The only problem I have with this is when you are watching it with subtitles, they don't have those fun facts pop up like when you watch it on the computer. I like those. Other than that it's perfect, good picture quality, actually really good picture quality, good sound, great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Budget awesomeness with a side of cool","review":"I've been an Eva junkie since 2001. However, as a poor high school student (at the time) I could not afford the original boxset. What is an Eva head gotta do to watch the rest of the series (as buying the first 4 DVD's left me broke)? That is ofcourse to pirate them.No.....don't pirate anime. It was wrong of me at the time, but now anybody can plop down $45 and get this pinnacle anime series without the need to download it illegally. With these thin packs you: save space, get great eye candy, get 5.1 surround sound, and you get the satisfaction of owning there series.I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good philosophical argument, mech anime, or fans of Shakespearian tragedies. People who are more into pokemon or Naruto may find this anime a bit too boring (as it is a mature anime), but $40 is worth a shot.Rei Ayanami is teh awesomeness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is an anime series worth wathching at least once.

First of all, it's Neon Genesis Evangelion, a modern masterpiece through and through. (...)With digitally cleaned up video and a kick-butt Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track (sorry, I don't much care for dubbed anime), this is the best presentation of Neon Genesis Evangelion ever. PLUS - we get the director's cuts of episodes 21-24!Personally, I don't think it is a major factor to lose the audio commentaries and brief featurettes that were part and parcel of the initial Platinum Edition release, especially since this slimpak release has such an affordable price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the Standard Fan","review":"This box set is good for people who love the series but don't have the funds to buy the perfect collection or to buy the Platinum Collection DVDs individually.

The discs are excellent quality, and the remastering of the old animation looks great. The story itself is very good until the last few episodes, that's why this collection gets only 4 stars. I'm sorry to all the die hard fans, but that last episode just plain sucks. Luckily, there is a movie called \\"End of Evangelion\\" that actually provides a decent ending to the series.

The close of the story is something like a statement of life...Life is... what you make of it...Plain and simple...For overall anime quality, I like it.For overall delivery, the message was clear to those looking for the message.For overall story, it has a definite apocalyptic/rainbow at the end of the tunnel feel (Though like a rainbow you only see it but can't touch it).I would buy it again if I lost my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Dvd set","review":"This set has all the episodes of the superb Neon Genesis Eva series and also has four directors cut.

Now I am ashamed. I recently used their obviously out sourced support team to try to change my number when I moved. So far I have been given 5 (FIVE)numbers (none work) and a lot of mis information. I was willing to accept roaming if nothing else worked. I have roaming on my phone now and I get a message saying the local carrier cannot accept my call. 6 months ago at the same location everything worked fine.The only reason I gave them one star was there was nothing lower available.

The narrator Timothy reminicences on his relationship with Jasper, a much older lover, over a dinner with his best friend Dominic. There is scarcely a page where being gay is not part of the narration but this is not an erotic New York gay encounter but a moving and very poignant account of a far from perfect relationship over a period of 18 years. Coe's semi-autobiographical account is slowly revealed and while the style sometimes left me on the sidelines this novel I am sure would have received more accolades had the author not died so soon after publication. AIDS novels were at their peak at this time but if you want to read one this account would be in the top drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced \\"wit\\" sinks hackneyed AIDS plot","review":"Coe's characters are shallow and immature. They might annoy you even if they were well-written, but they are not. Coe has no ear for dialogue--no one in real life says \\"honey\\" in three consecutive sentences. Worse, he constantly digresses into asides which are neither as witty or insightful as he thought they were. A much better novel dealing with some of the same themes is Gary Indiana's \\"Gone Tomorrow.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cookbook","review":"At the beginning of the year, I bought several cookbooks geared towards healthy cooking. THIS is my favorite. I've tried a variety of recipes from the book and they have been good to great. I haven't tried one I thought was lousy or just-ok. I was especially impressed by two cakes in this book. They are delicious! Yesterday I tried a chicken dish that prompts me to write this today. It was SO good.Also,it lists the exchanges and offers alternatives for sugar and fat which are helpful to someone like me that doesn't mind using regular sugar and whole eggs in cooking. However, the same recipe could be used by someone that wants to use artificial sweetener and egg substitutes.I'm going to buy volume 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only resource you need in your kitchen","review":"This is a great product.

I never use this cookbook at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"newbies to healthy cooking MIGHT find the book helpful","review":"This book and the second volume were two of the first books I purchased when I first decided to make cooking healthy part of my daily life. They are very simple, and for a person with practically no kitchen experience, much less experience with healthy cooking, these books may make a decent primer.However, she does call for a LOT of processed foods. The sodium content in most of the dishes is insane. Many of the recipes are so basic that even the inexperienced cook might feel insulted that they were included in the volume. There are at best a half dozen recipes in volume 1, and NONE in volume 2 that I currently use. My need for healthy cooking goes far beyond what little she offers.Unless you are a brand new cook with limited resources who just wants to get your feet wet with healthy cooking, I would recommend against purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Place to Start","review":"This is a practical book for people who want to start eating healthy, but may be overwhelmed by \\"healthfood\\" cookbooks. The recipes use a good mix of pantry staples and fresh ingredients, so you can keep the convenience of canned and frozen food while getting used to actually consuming fresh produce. The menus are realistic for normal everyday meals. The recipes are simple, but the procedures are not always the most efficient ways for cooking the meal (You end up using more pots or bowls than necessary). So far I have frozen the chili, the meatballs, and the chicken nuggets (fully cooked), and they have been lifesavers when I need a quick meal. I have also enjoyed the many Mexican entrees included, especially the Mexican Chicken Casserole."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Cookbook Series Ever!!!","review":"I have used Brenda's Quick and Healthy Cookbooks Volume I and II in my nutrition clinic for the past 7 years.

I thought it might be interesting to read about the history of Poland, so I picked up this book. But I don't think I made it even halfway through this book.I agree with the previous reviewer who said that this book would be good for a research, but not for someone who wants to read for pleasure. This book is not written for that. Even though I enjoy history, I still found myself overwhelmed and bored. The author throws way too many facts to you all at once. I also found the author's writing style to be dry and much too wordy. When I read a book like this I am interested in the who, what, when, where, and why. This book gives the reader only the what.If you are looking for a much more reader-friendly book on the history of Poland, I recommend \\"A Traveler's History of Poland.\\" rather than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great wall scroll!","review":"This is really a great wall scroll, it is a lot larger then i expected and the detail is great!

With a digital camera I no longer wait for the \\"best\\" shot and instead just take photos at will, knowing I can edit and delete anything I don't like at no cost.

Still, I'm a Donovan junkie and I got the disc and I do have it in my car. It's a good place for your copy too, should you decide to buy it.

Why not use photographs liberally to SHOW what you mean rather than just describe it.Contrast this book with Harold Harb's new book \\"Anyone can be an expert skier\\", or Warren Witherall's \\"The Athletic Skier\\" and you'll know what I mean.Second, and this might be trivial to a lot of people, but I thought the font was horrible. Why use a helvitica font when you could use a times roman font? It is MUCH harder to read.

I have given this work one star because anything less is unavailable but to be frank, the book is absolutely terrible. Telling a single story from three differing points of view works well for William Faulkner but not for Rackham as all three voices sound very male and very much the same. The book contains very explicit and bizarre sexual situations and if you have any respect for Dickens at all, you'll feel like you need a shower afterwards.

The images like \\"now from the unbuttoned corner moving out\\" and \\"recurring wave of arrival\\" are vividly childlike and nostalgic but also remind me of nothing I have encountered before. Ashberry's images sometimes bang against each other like the organized chaos of bumper cars. If you find yourself lost, keep reading and re-reading, no one needs to point out subtlety.

Ward's recent book, Between the Lines. The book offers a series of glimpses into the very violent, and often criminal world of the civil war within the American War of Independence.Thus, Ward looks at the various gangs of outlaws, sometimes affiliated with one side or the other, sometimes out only for personal gain, who raided the civilians between the British and Contintental Armies.While the book gives a good overview, Ward does not really attempt to understasnd his topic, there is little interpretation here. Likewise, he does not look at what was happening on the frontier, or at privateering.Finally, while Between the Lines will make a good read for anyone, Ward is a very strong narrative writer, it will be most beneficial to new students of the War of Independence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Year delivers","review":"Debbie Ford has once again proved that she has what it takes to inspire us to the best year of our life.

I very much enjoy reading outdoor adventure books such as Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk In the Woods\\" and Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\". Both excellent and well written stories.I picked up this book with similar expectations. I was very dissapointed to say the least. The story was redundent, not well written and extremely self-indulgent. Another problem I had with this book was the constant projection of thoughts and feelings onto her husband and children. Instead of telling a compelling story of long distance hiking with her familiy, friends and llamas, the author tries too hard to create a platform for her contrived introspection. She ends up portraying herself as very narcissistic.My recommendation: Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I looked forward to the delivery of this book, but was sorely disappointed when it finally arrived. Both my husband and I--avid travelers, backpackers, and outdoorspeople--were annoyed with the amount of time Cindy Ross spends complaining about the trail conditions and her husband's lack of affection for her. In addition, this book is repetitive and at times poorly written.The story itself is an interesting one, but too much time is spent psychoanalyzing--and, even worse, complaining--about other people's feelings, actions, etc. We came away from the book feeling as if Ross felt that she was above others, that everyone else's opinions and feelings--like Todd's, on the trail; and Bob's at times; and her relatives who hike with them for a short time--were not as important as her own.In short, this book disappointed us from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing... buy the originals instead.","review":"Growing up in England in the 80's and having bought all the 12\\" versions of these tracks, I was looking forward to obtaining a CD version.

Sometimes, I'm feeling a little too silly to wanna \\"Rise Above\\" or have a \\"Nervous Breakdown.\\" This is why I love this cd. Next to Blink, this is probably the best pop-punk band. I can't explain what sets this apart form the others. For one there is rapping. Honestly, his rap skills aren't that great, but that's easy to overlook. These guys know how to write hooks. \\"Wasted\\" is my favorite track. As much as this song celebrates getting drunk and having drunk fun, it's got a rather sad, alcoholic undertone. \\"Playmate Of The Year\\" refers to um, a certain magazine that men love.

No matter what mood you're in, you'll be dancing around the room as soon as you pop in ZH's new CD. With the same awesome guitar that made \\"Waste Of Mind\\" a hit, and more vocals from Ali (listen to 'The Hell That Is My Life'), this album is pure caffeine. And once again, they've managed to throw in different styles to mix it up. 'Livin' Libido Loco' is almost as addicting as the title track and 'Wasted', with it's sultry latino vibe. Of course this album isn't exactly the same as \\"Waste Of Mind\\" or \\"The Yellow\\", but with each album, the band is gaining more fans and having more fun. If you ever have the chance to see these guys live, TAKE IT! Just watch out for Justin's stagediving. He landed on my head at the ZH/Wheatus show last month."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid follow up","review":"This album is tight, the songs are well written and well produced.

It has more the flavor of Blink 182 or something. Theres not enough funk, too much punk. Zebrahead is composed of two singers, the rapper and the singer.

This might have been more entertaining if the authors had stuck with one segment and worked through it. The action is nonexsistent, extended over nearly one hundred years and broken up into 20-25 page chapters for each time period. The characters are few, two-dimensional, and unsympathetic. Plotlines are too many and undeveloped, (none of the aliens stick around for more than a few pages, nothing is taken to any kind of a logical conclusion.)

The styles of Windwood, Capaldi, Mason, and Wood certainly blend quite nicely together. There are a few songs(here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush, Withering Tree, Walkin In The Wind) which drag a bit. There are some surprises as Medicated Goo is a funky delight and Pearly Queen is dark and spooky. However, the many classic numbers from Low Spark Of Hi Heeled Boys, John Barley Corn, and the early days make it a nice buy for those seeking a fairly deep smattering from this classic rock band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered?","review":"It is unclear whether this is a remastered CD or not. If it was remastered, it was done in a closet with the door closed and lights off. If it was not remastered, then why not?

(Although I thought the last episode of season 1 was a bit of a dud--but I forgave it--they must have been tired.

What a HUGE difference. The cookies made using the Elastomoule pan were perfect - looked like they came from a French bakery. The cookies made using this pan were hard to get out of the mold - even though I thoroughly buttered as suggested. They also had a very brown look to them. In fairness, they did taste the same but they sure didn't look anywhere near as good. I do NOT like this pan and plan on trying to sell it and purchase another Elastomoule pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality pan","review":"I've used this pan two times already and am very pleased with its performance. It is very sturdy and, even though it is not non-stick, it releases the cookies easily when properly greased. Cleanup is effortless - stick-on particles come off after a little soak. Just wipe, rinse, towel-dry and it's ready to go again. This pan makes 12 cookies, which is enough for up to 4 people.

The last 30-pages of this novel changed my opinion of the entire book. Although well-written, I saw the first part of the novel as a rehash of an obsession theme reminiscent of The End of the Affair or Lolita. The powerful ending made me completely rethink the entire novel and I found myself refelcting on the book long after I finished it.

As the mandatory subject for one of my term papers, I suffered through Billy Budd for an entire semester. By the end of the book, my classmates and I had yet to find a plot anywhere. We believed there had to be a hidden plot somehwere: Billy and Claggart were brothers, the captain was the father, and the Dansker fit into the family tree somewhere. Alas, no. My advice: do not, under any circumstances, read this book unless forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever read","review":"This is the worst book ever written. Herman Melville wrote this book and then hid it himself because he was so ashamed of its lack of plot, tangled metaphors, idiotic characters, and ridiculously slow pacing. At the 'high point' of the book, when Billy Budd is hung, the reader feels only a wonderful sense of relief and a profound sense of joy in the knowladge that the book will be over soon. I would advise you not to waste your money on this book unless perhaps there is a national toilet paper shortage"},{"rating":"1","title":"very wordy despite the length","review":"Billy Budd, a story set in the sea is said to be one of the best short books of all time. The truth, is that the number of pages has no reflection on the length of this very hard to get through story of jealousy. I am inclined to say that for those of you who are forced to read this as I was, should seriously consider buying cliff notes and renting the movie. My candid opinion is this: Billy Budd is just a mess of words thrown together and it is a shame it had to be written by the same author of the classic Moby Dick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book ever written.","review":"Despite the decent storyline behind all of the wordiness, Billy Budd is a complete waste of time. Because of the complex symbolism (which Melville obviously tried entirely too hard to create), a book that should take a few hours to read turns into a fall into an abyss of three weeks full of confusion and frustration. If you're looking for something to put you to sleep, as it did to me several times, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book filled with action and less wordiness, I would advise you to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy \\"Dud\\"","review":"After taking three weeks to read this hundred or so page book, I was perplexed. The whole book does not have a plot. Melville's development of character is horrendous. He made it as if readers are supposed to already know who Billy Budd or John Claggart is. If it were not for the Cliff Notes, perhaps, no not perhaps, no one would understand what in the world is going on. The book is not in depth enough. THANK HEAVENS there is not a Billy Budd 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better hire a translater for this one...","review":"Because it was written as if it were from another planet. It must have had a decent moral in it, but you'd need someone who reads these for a living to tell you. You can tell a book is hard to read when even the cliffs notes make no sense! I'm sure that it had a good story, but I couldn't find it. Unless you can understand this stuff, I wouldn't suggest it. If you want to read it, I can only say, good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another so called 'classic'","review":"This is the hardest eighty pages I've ever read in my life. It's practically written in it's own language. A good concept hides behind this book. Unfortunately, the plane blows up in the hanger before it even gets to the runway.

This is a woman who appreciates good literature told us \\"anyone who likes this book is crazy and should be shot.\\" needless to say I can't stand it.

Perhaps ten pages actually pertained to the plot of \\"Billy Budd,\\" while the rest of seventy pages were about useless thoughts, perceptions, and historical tie-ins that did not benefit from the story at all. The story was barely about the character of Billy Budd, and was more like a soapbox for the author. This is not worth the time. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's beneath the surface here?","review":"Besides Moby Dick, none of Melville's works have been dissected and debated as thoroughly as this story, and for good reason. Although this is a forum for review and not debate, I would still like to pose a challenge to prospective readers: There is a real/mythical (depending on your point of view) event being rewritten here, with 19th century sensibilities and textures.

However, I agree with his or her criticism of Johnson's work. The \\"case against naturalism\\" that is advanced here is an attack on empiricism and critical inquiry on the basis of renovated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist discourse. We are met with claims that normative propositions should not be subjected to critical empirical scrutiny or scientific evaluation, because what is may not be necessarily what ought to be. Fine, but as a social scientist, I require a higher standard of proof. While Johnson does argue his specific case well,I am not convinced that a return to a neo- scholastic worldview is anything more than highly bounded reason or logic based on skewed syllogisms and stacked heuristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no Santa Claus.","review":"Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them.

I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming.

J. Simpson trial (in the end, he didn't.) Consequently, he thought quite a lot about the nature of truth as it is seen by lawyers and by scientists. In law, the opposing sides approach a trial by collecting all the evidence that will be used in the trial, and exchanging it in discovery proceedings. At a certain point, the stream of evidence is cut off, and this finite body of information is used to reach an absolute, final verdict (truth-telling.) In science, to the contrary, the stream of evidence is never cut off, never ends, and no one ever reaches a final, absolute, unmodifiable truth. This distinction Johnson fails to understand (or at least chooses to gloss over.) He is committed to lawyer's truth and has no interest in scientific truth. That is the trouble with this book and, indeed, all of Johnson's pseudoscientific writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praetorius","review":"Folie Douce (Sweet Folly) gets to the heart of the bouncy court dances of the Renaissance.

I thought I could rely on that famous Japanese quality but now that everything is made in China, I guess not. I think all-in-ones are great space savers and clutter avoiders, but if you get one you sort of have to live in fear of taking the entire thing in for one component failure, and that is what has now happened.I agree with everyone who said the delay between switching channels is annoying.

I have tried connecting it to my cable box with 2 different HDMI cables, and connecting it to two different computers with a DVI to HDMI cable.The same thing happened each time, so I don't think it was the cable or the source of the HDMI input that had any problems.So basically I'm stuck watching it with component video, which does not look very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!

Believe it or not I prefer this CD to the the Band of Gypsies even though I love Jimi Hendrix."},{"rating":"1","title":"People need to hear alblum\\"Them Changes\\" from 1970's","review":"I liked \\"Them Changes\\" that i bought in the 70's and would like to get a cd of the alblum. The new stuff is ok but my record alblum of Buddy is why i like his music it is honest and original. I would like a copy of remake on this alblum only."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Song of the Cardinal","review":"I read this book when I was young and it bored me. Now as a senior citizen, I have been feeding the cardinals who live in my yard and I just love this book. Gene Stratton Porter is a very descriptive writer so you feel like you are seeing what she saw. I wish they would put The Keeper of the Bees on Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as impressing as her other works","review":"I love all of Gene Stratton-Porter's works. They are all wonderfull. The first story I read of hers was A Girl of the Limberlost. Since then I have had very high standards for her books. I read this book with those standards in mind. I must say that it didn't have the same quality that I found in other books. I do not wish to put anyone off buying this book, because none of her books aren't worth the time to read. If you do wish to get to know Mrs. Stratton-Porter's writtings I sugest you do so with a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song of the Cardinal","review":"This is a copy of the original since the copyright has expired. It didn't hold my family's interest very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astrology, truly and simply, revealed!","review":"I have been sifting through the reams of information books available on this amazing subject and have found many books leave points hazy or just untouched. Paul Fenton-Smith has done in a succinct and yet extremely informative book what many others have failed to do miserably. I can now step forward along my path of astrology apprenticeship with so much information and clarity, it has scared even me. WHether you are a newcomer or experienced interpreter, this book will have a profound effect on your current knowledge and your practice methods. A must read for anyone interested in this complex subject. Absolutely Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great third book in the \\"Warlord\\" series","review":"\\"The Warlord\\" is the best of the three books about the Remmington family; however, \\"The Scoundrel\\" has its own charming, witty dialogue and characters. The main character, the Duke, is the descendent of the two main characters in \\"Warlord\\". The Duke follows his ancestress, Tess, in possessing a physical fidget that reveals he is lying. Tess twists her hair when she lies, but I could not find out [from the book] what he does. This book is a good read, and certainly worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but I handed it in at the used book store quickly","review":"I enjoyed Warlord and have re-read it and her other book about the Warlord's brother several times. This was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"the book caught my interest right at the begining and rarly let it slip, I love that in books, but I really want to know why there isn't more out there from this wonderful author. PLEASE, give this book a chance, I doubt you will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sterile, clinical presentation, indeed","review":"Published in 1988, this is fundamentally a textbook-like tome with little direct application to the daily joys and trials of marriage and family life. It is well footnoted and indexed, though marriage and divorce are fundamentally seen as \\"choices\\" and there are no index entries for \\"vows,\\" \\"commitment,\\" or \\"fun.\\"There is no heart to this book and no information useful for the establishment of a healthy marriage and no information for correction in times of difficulty. (It may never have occurred to the authors that married folks have far more sex than the unmarried.) All in all, quite sterile--somewhere between an anatomy/physiology text and veterinarian studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book arrived late","review":"I paid for expedited shipping and the book did not arrive on time as promised. The condition was good, but be prepared to wait on your order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as interesting as one would think","review":"The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very useful and redundant","review":"As a practitioner, I did not find this book very useful. All the author did was copy and paste a bunch of cases into one book and organize them into specific categories, cases that can be found on your own in many free and on-line databases. It might be a good reference for faculty (or friends/colleagues of the author who will require graduate students to read it), but its practical value is minimal. If you must have this book, as an alternative I suggest printing off the table of contents and index and then use them as a guide for printing off cases on-line when you need them.If you do encounter legal issues on a regular basis, I strongly recommend Kaplin and Lee's Law of Higher Education book as a method for giving you the background you need and its use as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"The write up I read on this movie made it sound so funny, it was not only stupid it was very sad."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(i(!0),a(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(i(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",N,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-58dc2ce2"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/7.md","filePath":"guide/7.md"}'),j={name:"guide/7.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
