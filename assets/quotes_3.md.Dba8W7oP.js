It's arguable that he has better CDs out -- his Global Underground CD rocks, and the Cream CDs rule -- but Tranceport is destined to be that one CD which any fan of Oakenfold, or trance in general, must have!

Listening to this album was like drinking Cognac then going down to Budweiser with every other album: it simply shreads all other trance. However, although extremely dynamic, the album does not take you on a \\"journey\\" so to speak as so much other progressive trance can, so there is no overall feeling other than it being a great album. I personally went out and found three of the tracks so I would have them in my DJ collection because they were rare (although I don't understand why), and could see extreme club play somewhere near the end of a set. Defenitely buy this before any other Oakenfold album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Paul Oakenfold's Best","review":"I was very impressed when I purchased this album. I hadn't heard much Paul Oakenfold before even though I've been into trance for about two years now. I believe that this is possibly Oakenfold's best work, when he was at the epitome of his experience and just before he started inmeshing himself to American standards of pop-rap culture. Such a diverse compilation of tracks are included in this cd, opening with a very dreamy and mind-sizzling track by The Dream Traveler. The songs throughout the whole cd should keep you hooked, never letting you down, keeping you going the whole way through. The reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it wasn't quite to that level for me. I loved most all of the songs but it didn't scream \\"I deserve 5 stars on Amazon.com!\\" to me. If you are a trance freak and you don't have this album, you should be ashamed! Get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a long drive","review":"Good album.

I found it to be an excellent reference source on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"I enjoyed reading this book as it provided some of the science behind photovoltaics as well as some advice on how to assemble your own home-made unit!While the book goes into some of physics behind all things related to solar energy (e.g. semiconductor physics, energy storage considerations, some basic circuitry, etc.), it's not so ridiculously technical that it becomes a cure for insomnia or a college textbook.I think I learned a lot from this book, and I personally can't wait to do one of these PV solutions on my own and do my best to be greener"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was a bit disappointing, yet there is value.....","review":"I just received this book.

It gives the basic physics for the solar cell, the way they have been used in society now, and offer projected future uses of the same.If however, you actually wanted serious practical info, possibly building your own system, possibly going into a home Grid-Tie system, or other ideas with a little bit more technical and useful data, this book isn't it even though the name \\"Practical Photovoltaics\\" sound as if you would."},{"rating":"1","title":"devon cream","review":"the product came part liquid, but a little gentle stirring made it whole again.

Additionally a large number of the birds they list are not found in the Eastern Region..this is hard for me to understand...why would bird experts create a book over half full of birds that do NOT live in the Eastern Region? I live in Virginia, and when looking up a bird I see at my feeder, after stuggling with the book, find a bird that looks similar only to realize it only found in South America or Washington State..oops must not be my bird...maybe it is great if you are advanced and want to know what other birds might look like the one you are looking for, but for me..no thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"a high quality release from BR","review":"In my eyes, bad religion can do just about no wrong, and stranger than fiction is no exception to this rule. For some reason this album got a lot of flack from \\"hardcore\\" br fans, but I don't know why. It sounds fairly similar to against the grain and a little from no control. They prove that they have all the energy of any punk band with songs like \\"incomplete\\", \\"leave mine to me\\", and the title track \\"stranger than ficiton\\". They also prove that they can mellow out and not lose their sound with tracks like \\"infected\\" and \\"slumber\\". a worthy release for any BR fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid stuff","review":"I was really disappointed after the first listen of Stranger Than Fiction. The only track that stuck out was 'The Handshake', which just rocks no matter how you look (listen) at it. After a couple more listens though, I realized this is a typical solid Bad Religion album. The album opens up with 'Incomplete' and 'Leave Mine to Me', two quick ones that get better with each listen. The title track sounds unusually spunky, but it's not bad. 'The Handshake' strikes me as the best track on the album, but 'Better Off Dead,' 'Infected,' and 'Individual' are not far behind. Overall, a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"lyrically great, musically unbad religion","review":"Dont get me wrong, maybe its because I started out with suffer and no control and the earlier stuff, but when I hear this cd I say to myself \\"who are you and what have you done with Bad Religion?\\" get it, its good, its just not BR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as I remember","review":"Love this album and always will. I heard this for the first time when I was in the 9th grade and a friends older brother turned it on one day. 'Infected' and '21st Century' are two of my favorite songs, but who doesn't love the Tim Armstrong guest vocals on 'Television'? In a world where most 'music' is auto tuned and scratching records, Bad Religion reminds us all that there is victory in real instruments and feelings. Listen to this album all the way through and tell me you don't feel it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great follow up to recipe for hate","review":"Great follow up album to recipe for hate.

Read the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of BR's best","review":"Bad Religion's Stranger Than Fiction is one of the best punk rock albums you could ever find. First off, you've got the best lyric writers combination: Greg Graffin and Brett Burewitz. Second, the music is well done. Third, BR rocks and is a great source of knowledge and social and enviromental awareness. The best songs in this album are Stranger Than Fiction, Incomplete, The Handshake, 21st Century Digital Boy (a little different from last time's edition), Hooray For Me..., Infected, Marked, Inner Logic, and well, every single one. If you're new to BR, this is the best way to start. If you like BR already, why are you reading this? Go ahead, be confident and buy the freaking CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually I give this 5 stars","review":"I always look at the negative reviews first, so if you are reading this, then I assume that you do the same.I judge a music album by 3 criteria....does it blow my hair back the first few times I listen to it?, do I skip tracks, or listen to the album through?, and can it stand the test of time?The first time I heard this album was 13 years ago. I was 14 at the time. It totally blew my hair back, and I couldnt stop listening to it. No tracks were skipped (ok, maybe just \`television\`)13 years later, and probably about 80 other \`\`punk\`\` albums owned and thouroughly listened to, I have not gotten tired of this album. This is in my top 5 best punk albums I have ever listened to.Bad religion has MANY other great albums and songs, dont get me wrong, but by the criteria I set above, this album satisfies those requirements.I just love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this album was only fiction","review":"As much as I love Bad Religion, I hate this album. Compared to such classics as How could Hell..., Suffer, No Control, and Against the Grain, Stranger than Fiction is pretty weak. While it may appeal to the fans of Rolling Stone and Newsweek, loyal fans who haven't heard this album will be sorely disappointed. Not only is the tempo slowed down considerably, the songwriting is subpar. While their lyrics are normally enhanced by the large words used by Greg Graffin, on Stranger Than Fiction, they're pretty cumbersome (see the song \\"Tiny Voices\\"). There were high points on this album, but even classic cuts such as Marked and Inner Logic couldn't help but be drowned in a sea of dreck like Hooray for me and the album's title track. I'm writing this after they released The Gray Race and No Substance, which were also pretty weak. It seems to me that Bad Religion is merely going through the motion to produce new albums without much enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"from best to worst","review":"at one point in their careers Bad Religion was the preeminent rock band of the genre. It is for this reason it is so sad that they have slipped this far. Most true fans of the old Bad Religion cannot even listen to this album, or any of the albums since Against the Grain.

It's too bad, because this is a really good album with classic hooks and top notch guitar playing. Britny Fox has the reputation of being a super cheesy glam band, but this album with new lead singer Tommy Paris is straight ahead rock without the glammier stylings of the debut album.

Then later I found out about \\"Van Helsing\\" the video game and coincidently my friend had it for his ps2 and I watched him play it and these people where geting there bodys beaten, and they came out with out a drop of blood, And I thought the music wuz crapy and also the concept was the worst thing about it.

He didn't even give a decent review! Now, I haven't seen the movie yet, but i think the game is very good. Plenty of action, lots of weapons and monster types, great graphics, sound, and music. It is somewhat short - I beat it on 'easy' mode in roughly 6 hours - but it has replayability. There's a special area with timed challenges that will net you funny cheats like Big Head mode and giant swords, and a secret weapon upon completing them all. You can also find cheats/eggs behind little hidden doors throughout the game. Also, some people have marked this as a Devil May Cry clone, though not in a bad way.I'd give it a 4/5. But give it a rental first, just in case. I didn't before I bought the game but thankfully its worth the money to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Monster Killer, Not Murderer...","review":"What an incredible game. In fact, this game BUILDS on the film. I have never played a movie licensed game that expounded this much on a story. The intro with Jekyll and Hyde is great, and so are all the cutscenes therafter. Anyways, this game also has incredible gameplay, addictive and entertaining, along with graphics that are very smooth, and some of the best I have seen.Definately buy this.PSNot reccomended for Pre Teens due to violence and some creepy sequences involving vampires, werewolves and other creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Challenging","review":"Even though the movie has slightly grown on me, it is still a horrible movie due to not having a plot and bad CGI effects. I stumbled upon the PS2 game a few years ago at a dollar store for only five dollars, so I thought I would give it a try. Surprisingly, the game is better written than the actually movie. Unlike most movie tie-in games, Van Helsing is actually challenging. Overall, I had fun playing the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van.....NO","review":"This game was too easy overall, the puzzles were too easy, and the bosses were too easy to beat. When I had beaten it was like \\"is that it?\\" At the end I thought I was going to be able to fight Dracula as the werewolf like he did in the movie but I was sadly disappointed. It only took about 3 hours too beat.

IF YOU LIKE THE DEVIL MAY CRY SERIES, BUY THIS, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Clean Fun","review":"Van Helsing is a good clean fun video game, in the spirit of the Devil May Cry series. Like that game's hero Dante, Van Helsing battles demonic creatures, wielding deadly and funky weapons with style and substance. The game follows the movie very well, mimicking the film's important plot point, even though they are ludicrous. The game does show a few small gliches involving graphics and voice overs, which takes away from the game a little. The scenery and graphics in general are good. The Transylvanian background is depicted beautifully. I found myself admiring these scenes as I walked throughout the levels often being caught off gaurd by monsters who did not care for my admiration. Van Helsing does not break any barriers in video gaming, but is simply good clean fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"WONDERFUL TO LOOK AT DELIGHTFUL TO HOLD, BUT IF IT BREAKS...","review":"we don't want to know. These glasses are way to fragile for practical use. There were a number of reviews where they were broken on arrival. Mine arrived alright and seem to be fine for coffee but do not use them with ice. One ice cube will break the inner glass and you will not know it while drinking as the very thin inner glass and the drink fall into the remainder of the glass. You could easily swallow some glass. You do not realize the inner glass is broken until you swallow some glass or finish your drink and see liquid still in the space between the broken part of your glass and the outer wall.I wrote the Bodum Company explaining the situation but got no response.

When they arrived, one glass in each set was broken. The packaging on these things is pretty bad.On the flip side, it was pretty easy to have another sent out, and since it was one glass from each set, they sent me out two new sets for free. Which means I got a free set!I will say that I still get condensation. I see that others don't have a problem with that...but I did. When it happens, it obscures the attractiveness of the glasses.As for dishwasher safe aspects, I wouldn't know. After reading the reviews I just handwash them. Not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice but very breakable","review":"I have ordered several sets of these glasses. Living in Florida and liking cold drinks means that you have to live with sweaty glasses. Well I tried these and they work great.They are far superior to plastic, but there is one drawback. They will break if you put ice in them from the ice dispenser in the door of the frig. It won't happen all the time, but it will happen. The cubes comes out pretty hard and slam into the bottom of the glass cracking it. The trick is to use the crushed ice setting and they will work like a champ. The look is pretty interesting with the liquid suspended in the glass. Try them, but be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service Bad Item..???????","review":"I have purchased these glasses since they first came out on the market. They work well here in the Mid-West to help keep items cold in the summer or hot in the winter. Bodum added a new feature to the bottom of the glasses. This little piece of silicon is suppose to keep even more of the condensation from the outside of the glass. The problem was the bottom of the inner glass was thinner and broke. BOO...I was not pleased when Bodum would not address any discussion about replacing the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful glass but seriously high maintenance","review":"We purchased 4 glasses at Christmas. They keep liquids cold and hot. They are nice to look at, and we still have one left a month later that isn't chipped or cracked. After the first glass cracked we made insane efforts to be as delicate as possible with the remaining 3. I would wash them carefully by hand making sure not to bang them into anything and let them air dry. The next time we would go to use the glass it would have a crack in it. We are still scratching are heads as to why the cracks happened and what we could have possibly done differently to prevent it. These are just way too fragile, and that is just about over $70 straight to the recycling bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully Useless","review":"These glasses are a prime example of design over function (and a woeful example of the state of quality control these days).They are elegant but one of mine broke the first time I dropped an ice cube into it. Who wants a glass that can't withstand an ice cube?If you must own one I recommend using it only for hot drinks, for which they are ideal, but then you still must be careful while washing it, while putting it away, while taking it out, while setting it down, etc.In my opinion they are simply too fragile for use, and too expensive to be considered disposable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply lovely","review":"The glasses are beautiful to look at and a pleasure to hold. There is no problem with condensation, even in the humid southern heat.Complaints about their fragility are a bit confusing. I would never dream of dropping ice cubes directly into nice crystal, and I would not drop ice cubes directly into these glasses either; they are not Wal-Mart tumblers, and should not be treated as such. That said, mine regularly go through the normal cycle in the dishwasher with no problems. I purchased them (8 in all) several months ago, have not lost even one due to breakage, and take great pleasure in using them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, but more sturdy than they appear","review":"I read all the reviews and had to put my two cents in. These glasses are quite sturdy, don't feel like a Christmas ornament like someone said, and are very beautiful. They are somewhat costly and need to be handled with care, so I wouldn't recommend dropping ice in them while dry. However, if the inner glass broke you would definitely notice. All you would need to do is look at the tumbler to see that the inner glass is broken and the liquid has spilled into the outer glass. There is no way you would be in danger of swallowing glass. I give them four stars only because I did notice a very slight condensation when the glass was full of icy liquid, and for 10 dollars a piece I don't think there should be any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Horrible product","review":"While I love the idea of insulated glassware, these may be the most fragile glasses I have ever owned.

I use them every night with theFORLIFE Brew-in-Mug Extra-Fine Tea Infuser with Lid, which fits perfectly.The main advantage is that they keep the tea piping hot for as long as it takes to drink it. That makes a huge difference in my enjoyment of the tea--it just isn't the same from a regular cup. It's also nice that they don't sweat or make puddles under the glass, and that the outside stays comfortable to hold no matter how hot the tea is.They do break easily. I'm on my second set in about two years, having broken two glasses, at different times, by knocking them over on the counter. I put them in the dishwasher, although I'm careful not to place them too close to other glasses and cups.Sooner or later they will probably get broken, and when that happens I'll buy another set.

The 2nd one broke about 3 weeks later. She filled the glass with soda, put 2 ice cubes in gently. 5 minutes later, she notices a hole in the bottom, and some loose glass. A glass you cant use with ice cubes? What a crappy design.I wouldnt want to be the one who has a guest over and they drink some glass.

I gave them to my boyfriend (along with alot of other items) for the holidays. We read the instructions about putting ice in, to be careful. I was relaxing using one glass for my tea. It was so fascinating and I really enjoyed the glass. As I was relaxing I heard him getting out ice from the fridge. He very carefully put an ice cube in the glass, then he slowly put another one in, as it slipped from his hand it landed with a clink on the cube already in the glass, crack, there went the glass. Very upsetting for both him and me.

The shape is lovely but I don't know if it would stay well in the hand if the glass were larger or heavier due to the curve back 'inwards' at the top.Wonderful insulation properties, use for hot or cold and no problems with rings on surfaces or condensation."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and functional","review":"I have the tumbler size of these glasses and love them.

I sent them back for replacement and when they arrived another glass was broken during shipment. I cannot blame it entirely on the design of the glasses, since they were poorly packed. The second shipment was sitting on the bottom of the box with no cushioning. Amazon is refusing to replace them after the second damaged shipment, but is refunding the purchase price. I must say I am very disappointed. My advice is to save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"fragile glassware","review":"These glasses are very attractive, insulate beverages well, and I really like handling them.

It's very sticky (no matter how much you loosen the pan handles) so it's useless for panning and tilting. In addition, the head adds a lot of weight to the legs. If you've already bought one (like I did), I suggest dumping the useless head and buying another. The hook for the stone bag has already broken off -- and here's the kicker -- I've NEVER used it!

Even his brother Donnie Wahlberg's production on here can't save this album--they sound like New Kids song rejects on here that didn't make the great \\"Step by Step\\".

Unlike earlier trunking scanners, the 245 allows you to \\"trunk\\" multiple systems at once and scan conventional frequencies all at the same time!

Adrian is just a big bully who does not know how to treat a submissive!!! To me, there was no plot, just one big bully session after another.

His \\"me--macho, you--Jane\\" bit really hit all the wrong nerves with me. She was a sucessful woman with her own business, but of course being over weight meant she had no self-control or dignity, so here comes super Adrian to take over her life and give her self-control and dignity. I enjoy a good BDSM book with male Doms, but I repeat, Adrian is just a big bully. I finished reading the book hoping it would get better. But to the very end, it ran along the same line.

When I listened to them they sounded like a whooole different, harder band (comparing to 14:59). It definetly impressed me.

Sugar Ray knows how to play loud. Without a doubt they are one of the most underrated bands in the USA. Floored is not quite as powerful as their old album, Lemonade & Brownies, but it still packs a punch. I mean, everyone should have known what to expect from these guys. They were not portrayed as backstreet boy type people when they were in that \\"Fathers day\\" movie with Billy Crystal and Robin Williams a couple years back. Far from it, in fact.

I like the groove in it. \\"Breathe\\" is also good, but to me its not that much different than \\"RPM\\". The rest of the songs are crap. \\"Stand and Deliver\\" is a horrible cover of an old Adam Ant song. The rest is all speed/thrash metal, which is a horrible style anyway. There is no skill or beauty on this album. Thats to be expected though when you play speed metal. But the main problem here is that these guys can't even play it good, and when they do, it sounds like someone else. If you are the type of person that just wants something to mosh to and doesn't care about the musical value then this album would be for you. Other than that its nothing but complete CRAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame except for Fly and one cover song!","review":"They do a nice cover and Fly is an incredible hit, but you might just want to buy that single.

Luckily I like metal or I would of given this cd a lower rating. My favorites are Fly, the offensive American Pig, RPM, and the funny yet disturbing Cash. I liked this cd and you will too. But don't buy this for Fly. By it if you like rock bands such as Metallica, Korn, or P.O.D. The language is sometimes extremely explicit, especcialy in Cash. If you are mad and need to let it all out, listen to High Anxiety. If you are in a relaxed mood listen to Fly. If you want a good, fast paced time, listen to Cash or Speed Home California.

I have read the other reviews of this album and found most people to either hate the sappy stuff, or hate the heavy stuff, But I really enjoyed both. One minute you could listen to crashing drums and heavy gutair riffs the next to a sweet harmony. I have to say that these 5 guys have had more then their 15 minutes of fame, and I hope they continue to test their abilities as musicians and try every angle they can.

This album is terrible and devoid of any rhythm or songwriting skills. It's like having your head hit with a hammer for 40 minutes (but not in time). However, \\"Fly\\" IS one of the greatest singles of the '90s; selling this CD on the strength of that song is one of the greatest hoaxes perpetrated on the public since Bigfoot and the Kennedy assassination.

The album opens with RPM - an amazing, ball-blasting song when it's pumped up - then goes onto Breathe - kind of Nine Inch Nails styles with a live drummer - then Anyone - again, pump it up BAYBEE!! Fly sounds incredibly poppy compared to these 3 opening tracks - even though next to alot of the bubblegum out now it's a bit rougher around the edges. \\"Speed Home California\\", \\"Tap Twist Snap\\" and \\"Invisible\\" are my other favorites on the album - all hard and fast.

Floored is one of these albums. Before the pop hits and swooning young ladies, Ray made some very cool songs about cars, parties and generally raising hell. 'Snap, Twist, Shout'...'Speed Home California' are just two examples. 'Breathe' comes out of the gate swinging for the fences...after 'Fly', you'd never guess they did 'Breathe'.

The band who had the soft-pop smash hit 'every morning' had, two years earlier, been some shirtless tough guys going around bashing people to prove their masculinity.But the good points of this disc are a reminder of how good rap-rock could be, the sheer energy making this style so appealing... when it's played right! Like it is about half the time here. The other half is Sugar Ray are trying their hand half-baked joke songs that completely stink, unless you think a band's coolness is measured by how many expletives they can fit into one sentence.By the way, I think Limp Bizkit kind of imitated these guys a fair bit, especially around the time of the 'Break Stuff' period, for what it's worth"},{"rating":"1","title":"An extreme disapointment.","review":"When I first heard the song fly on the radio, i really liked it.

Kind of like frivolous musicals, into which territory this film veers.If you like the more realistic worlds uniquely created in the films of Merchant, Ivory & Jhabvala, you will probably enjoy Stilman's films, despite the fact that their respective worlds are quite different.Anyway, if you can suspend your disbelief and accept a high degree of pretentiousness in the odd characters, you are in for a funny, enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damsels delights!","review":"Damsels in Distress was a delightful look at the opportunity college affords for self reinvention.

But the screenplay made it well worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dollar rental at Red Box is fair price","review":"Whit fans will have to see this and then will immediately dismiss it as his worst film. Some will wade through the dreck desperately trying to justify the 14 year wait while others will sigh and re-watch Metropolitan, Last Days of Disco or my personal favorite Barcelona. Hyperbole and dancing have got the best of Whit this time. On the bright side Greta Gerwig is crazy sexy cool as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was...","review":"so boring.

Number one, it saves a lot of deskspace. Second, it is cheaper than most flat bed scanners. And you get technical support from the same company, if needed.You won't get high quality scans with this product though. There are noticeable vertical or horizontal lines that show up in the scanned image (depending whether you were scanning portrait or landscape) even when scanned in the highest possible resolution. Most of the lines can be retouched with good photo editing software like Photoshop 4.0 or above, but are still noticeable after printing.In conclusion; buy this for the convenience and space saving benefits. If you are planning on getting proffesional results, use a flatbed scanner. If you're just scanning snapshots to send via email to relatives and friends, than this is probably the most economical choice for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I got this CD after listening to the Welcome Interstate Managers CD, and found it a little below rudimentary.

I also wanted something that didn't require the removal of the front wheel, and this also fit the bill. I was a little skeptical at first because the main mount seems a bit flimsy, but when you lock it down, it works and my bikes remain motionless, even with my bikes which are all 61cm road bikes. The Thule locks are easy to install and provide a small level of protection for when you really need to leave your bike- as with any of the bike rack locks, I wouldn't leave an expensive bike unattended for too long because the locks probably wouldn't slow down a bike thief too much.I'd definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a rack, especially for those with factory racks with crossbars that this unit will fit. It will save you about $300 in additional hardware."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 months later and still going.","review":"These bike racks are great. They're easy to install and use.

Avoided the additonal cost and hassle of buying and installing adaptors or Thule crossbars. I got two of them and they were very secure and stable holding an older heavier bike with a child seat. Very easy to install and load/ unload bikes for a roof rack. This does not come with the locks, that will cost you extra if you want them.

There is a distinct lack of personality behind this conducting, it sounds like Jarvi is beating time only. No emotional surges, no real festivities in the \\"Nocturnes\\".

More than almost any other author, Ketchum gives you a very real sense of what it was like to be a soldier in the revolution. In this he has gotten even better than in \\"Decisive Day\\", his book on Bunker Hill. The major players are very well characterized and the book as a whole reads like a page-turner. As to shortcomings, I would have liked about five or six more maps to give a better sense of place. The few maps included are not quite enough. Also I would have liked to see a short epilogue telling us what happened to the people Mr. Ketchum's skilful prose has brought to life for us.

The cutting blade appeared tobe the same as the one I took out, but when I put it in I noticed that the mounting hole in the center was slightly larger than the one I took out, thus making the blade sit lopsided when installed. The shaver also seemed louder than before and the shave closness was as bad as the old one. $23 wasted. I'll bet these new parts are not made by Remington!The speed of shipping however was good.Don't waste your time & money on these parts.

I remember how this CD didn't even make a blip on the radar screen in 1993, other than for those people who truly know good music. Like many of you, I feel that Neil Finn could sing the ingredients from a box of cookies and make it sound tuneful. All Crowded House albums have many samples of why Neil is a songwriting god, and this one is no exception: \\"Nails in My Feet,\\" \\"Fingers of Love,\\" and the positively captivating \\"Walking on the Spot.\\" If you ever see this in a used CD store, you owe it to your soul to pick it up; heaven awaits!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this album should absolutely positively be rereleased...","review":"Wow-- one day, many years ago, listening to small radio station in Pittsburgh, heard \\"pineapple head\\". called the station, knew it was Crowded House, but which album?

It'd be a waste of time to list the great songs on this album. CH usually has one song that doesn't make the mark - and w/this one it would be \\"Pineapple Head\\".But listening to the arrangement and production of the songs, it certainly showcases Neil Finn's songwriting abilities. It's no wonder that artists like Shawn Colvin cover his material (in concert) on a regular basis.'Together Alone' might be out of print, but I suggest you look for it and purchase it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"All is Great","review":"Received the CD quickly and it is as stated. Alll worked well. And music is great. Very good experience all-around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly out of print!","review":"I 'quite' like Crowded House. Their melodies are great, and it's all very finely crafted. However it all gets a bit bland after a while. However Together Alone is one I can come back to.

It deserves a great deal more recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find it","review":"If you do not have this album put all of your energy into aquiring it.

After-all this is only a mic; there is no headset which might make it worth the purchase. The mic boom is flimsy and can not even stay in position without scotch tape.

His new album is better than his first, although I had to listen to it a second time because their new guitarist gives them an edge they never had before (I like it). I'll Be (although a minor hit in Chicago (hello, USA?)) is a great ballad that nobody's heard of. Cleveland Park should be a smash. And half of the other songs beat almost anything out today.

Every song on the CD tells a story that never fails to reach out and touch the listener. Like many others, I discovered Edwin through the hit song \\"I'll Be\\" (included on the album) and became a fan because of the quality of his lyrics and music. I've listened to every album Edwin McCain has put out and have yet to find one that I didn't like, but this one stands out head and shoulders above the rest. The lyrics of this album have an amazing thought provoking quality to them that really shows off his talent and makes you marvel at what a well written phrase can do. It went a long way toward teaching me how much depth good writing really has and how much possibility there is in the written word.Oh, by the way, don't miss the hidden track at the end of The Holy City.

The only bad news is that it would of been nice to see more examples of how the everyday person could find safe uses for the product in there own home, since most of us are not medical practitioners. Don't get me wrong, there are a few good examples of practical uses (including using it as a mouth-wash, toothpaste or to snort as a sinus cleanser), but if you think he is going to recommend using it orally, he won't.

I wanted to learn more about the possibility of using hydrogen peroxide orally to treat various health issues. My first feeling about the book was that it is overpriced at $18. Perhaps if I spent $10 or less for the book I would not have felt as \\"ripped-off\\". The book could have been much better organized. I did not find many of the numerous case histories provided very informative. I was surprised that there was not very much information about using hydrogen peroxide orally, mostly through IV.

Some good ideas are put to bad use due to the filmmakers decision to try and twist the plot a few times near the ending which just makes the viewer wonder, \\"okay, what's the point?\\" One of said twists really stretches the boundaries of the parameters of the plot itself, making the film kind of implode on itself in the end. There is some talent at work here, for MY LITTLE EYE is not a bad horror movie, nor is it really that good, but with some tweaking of the key elements it could've been a great little independent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring after all","review":"Well it's like big brother but with actors and (not good actors actually) The twist is really twisted making this \\"movie\\" looking like a joke.

The plot, typical horror movie style, kinda interesting. The acting, not oscar worthy but not completely awful... What was missing was a good script... The character development was non existant. In the in I didn't care if anyone died, I just wanted the movie to be over. The only character that had any substance was a jerk and therefore you didn't like him. I actually found myself rooting for the guy because he was the only one real. Now I won't go into the unusal film shots, cutting back in forth, the night shots. I found those annoying but I understand the 'art' behind them. But the screen writer for this needs to go back to Scriptwriting 101 and reread the section on character development....

It's dull and not in the least bit frightening. There are plot holes you could drive a bus through. Often it simply doesn't make sense. The characters are so similar they are interchangeable (male and female!). The director seems to believe that it works better without music (it doesn't) and then tries to spice up the boring deaths and sex with truly dreadful noise. Worst of all is the script, which is cliched and laboured.

It's movies like this that make researching films on the internet all the worth while.This is an atmospheric, creepy, and effective movie! The less said about this spookfest the better. It has a \\"Big Brother\\" (as in the TV show) element to it, except the contestants must stay in the house for 6 months without leaving (except to go out front), and some of the guests have secrets in their past that began to play out in front of them.The filming, direction, and cinematogrophy of \\"My Little Eye\\" are all superb. The angles, split screens, sound effects, and night vision cameras all serve to build up a tense but satisfying conclusion.

The story is well written and easy to follow--even with all the different characters and subplots. The story involves some very deep issues which some authors may not cover quite as well as Shay does. The characters are very real, likeable, compassionate and understanding even with the issues they are faced with. Although I loved Tucker and Beth, Margo and Linc's story was my favorite--having to work through some serious issues to be together, but being able to depend on their love through it all is great.Although it is not tied to this book, if you haven't read \\"Promises to Keep\\" you should--it is a wonderful book too and Shay also tackles some serious current issues with her great writing skills.Keep it up K.

It IS NOT a how to quilt manual, rather a volume that traces Florida quilts and their makers through the history of the state. It begins with the quilts of early America and ends in 1988. The color plates are lovely and particularly clear for photographs taken before the advent of the digital age. There are black and white vintage photos of early quiltmakers scattered throughout the book. I bought this book for my personal library because I wanted to see how quiltmaking in Florida changed over this period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pocket sized - content that is","review":"I was very disappointed with this edition. I had seen some of the older Virgin guides and was impressed with their hipness and reviews of places that aren't mentioned in the standard guidebooks.This pocket edition is very small (maybe 2/3rds the height of a standard paperback and less than one inch thick), consequently the listings are, shall we say, sparsely worded. Even the longer \\"reviews\\" are only one or two sentences.Beware also that this book includes only places to eat, drink and shop. The hotel section is laughable - only a few pages long and one sentence per hotel. Hardly enough info on which to base a decision.That's the overall problem with this book - it might contain the same number of individual listings as the larger version, but they decided to rip out the content (text) in order to make it fit into the pocket size.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"New York in your pocket","review":"The best thing about this book is it's size it fits handilly in your pocket.

My only gripe with the bag is the wet storage compartment, which you use to store sneakers, flip flops, a wet towel, ect. When using that compartment the items in that compartment are stored in the main compartment of the bag as a result you loose 75% of the storage space of the bag. I think if the bag was a little bit longer and taller it wouldnt have such an impact but as it is I loose a lot of space."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I bought this bag about a year ago now and it is still going strong!

However, it is not hot swap-able with the few motherboards that I have tried it on. If you use it for data recovery, you will also find getting the drives into and out of it a little more complicated than necessary.Also: FLAG FLAG! This drive will not work unless the key is turned on! I spent a lot of time checking it because I thought that is was faulty, cracked it open to look and see if it is straight through wiring and found that its power is routed through a switch that is attached to the key. Turning the key makes it work. All the more hassle because you cannot just leave it unlocked and swap drives. DO NOT LOSE THE KEY. On my drive, I will eventually end up rewiring it so that it will not require the key, and you may desire to do the same.

In this book, he severely mocks the Book of Genesis, a very stupid thing to do. Even if one does not believe the narratives of Genesis, its antiquity and terse language (in the original Hebrew) demand respect. Campbell's analysis of Greek myth (more like a pointless exercise in free association) is devoid of understanding. He never grasped that Greek \\"myth\\" is not myth at all but rather the history of the human race told from the Greeks' unique religious standpoint. For real understanding, I recommend THE PARTHENON CODE: MANKIND'S HISTORY IN MARBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Passion of the Western Soul","review":"I cannot overrate the depth & breadth of Campbell's insights.This book is at once visionary and scholarly, passionate and detached:in sum, it reveals the powerful (under)currents that helped to shape our minds and hearts into what we are.

A year ago we bought a standard tire-drive trainer - 1) it required changing out the standard knobby tire for a bald tire, and 2) it is still LOUD. A few weeks ago I bought the Minoura 850 rim-drive trainer - 1) it is quiet, and 2) there's no need to change to a bald tire. Also, as opposed to my original tire-drive trainer, the bike doesn't rock side to side, as more force is exerted, when using the rim-drive trainer. The rim-drive Minoura provides plenty of resistance for a solid workout, and it takes, literally, less than 10 seconds to pop my bike out of or in to the setup. That is the entire idea: to be able to use the bicycle as a stationary bike when the weather is bad or it is too dark to ride safely, but to be able to go biking outside whenever possible. And, the price is extremely competitive. I went to a couple of bike shops before deciding to go with the rim-drive - in short, I'm very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"Watch a DVD, or watch the news, or simply listen to some music while you ride your bike.

Here we have Christopher Reeve, Judd Hirsch (TV's TAXI) and Donald PLeasance as very poor stand ins for Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Charles Bronson. Probably part of this is that I slogged my way through the three hour version, each 90 minute part has a different director which probably didn't help matters. Part 1 is directed by Paul Wendkos and Part 2 by Jud Taylor. If you absolutely must watch this then try and find the 90 minute edited version. Don't torture yourself like I did.

On the fourth day, when I got home, I saw her chewing on the little ball-like bulge, which she had handily chewed off of the rubber \\"rope\\". I worry that she would be able to chew off other pieces, and that she could choke on a lump of rubber that size, so I haven't used the product since then. Too bad, because it seemed neat.

Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy. I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.

There is a problem to solve, and the reward is food - what could be better for a Lab? The problem is that she is a chewer, and though she did figure out pretty readily how to get the food out, she was way more interested in chewing on the rope. When I removed the rope - which also made it way easier to get the food out - she then thought it would be more gratifying to chew her way to the food, rather than rise to the intellectual challenge of tipping the bottle and dispensing a treat.And oh yes, this thing is loud when it hits the floor or cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Pretty durable, considering all she wants to do is chew it and it's not intended as a chew toy - but she has only spent maybe two hours with it total."},{"rating":"1","title":"scared dog!","review":"A friend with a golden retriever reported that he adored this item, so I thought I would try it, as many of her suggestions have met with my own dog's approval. But not this one! Despite the alluring scent of treats inside, he found the bottle too big for his comfort, and would back away from it. He is a coton de tulear, weighing about 15 pounds, and I bought the size for small dogs. The plastic bottle apparently still was too big for his comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great toy for chewers","review":"I think my dog was just too smart for this toy. I purchased one of the larger ones with the rubber rope. After 5 minutes of frustration in trying to get the treats out, my dog chewed through the rubber rope so that she could just empty the treats out the hole. It was a waste of money for my dog to try out. With the fabric-type rope, the toy might have lasted longer for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rope chewed in less than an hour","review":"Was excited about this tough toy, but gave it to our 96 lb puppy who tore the rope apart in less than an hour.

The \\"bottle\\" part is hard plastic and very loud when bounced around. The knot on the rope (when we still had a rope) fit too tightly into the opening making getting treats out of the bottle close to impossible. I had hoped this would be one of those toys to occupy her a bit more.

Not worth the money","review":"I bought one of these last year for my pittie mix who was less than a year old, he LOVED it at first and had a great time throwing, kicking and rolling it all over the floor to get to the treats. Then he started holding the jug down with his paws and puling up on the \\"rope,\\" which didn't take long to tear in half. I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea. He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces - thank goodness he didn't swallow any! So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong. He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp.

She's easily bored, extremely destructive & likes puzzles. This looked perfect. It takes a bit of work to get food out so I knew this would occupy her for a while. The screw-on lid at the bottom of the jug was virtually seamless and very tight. When I ran my fingers over the seam before giving it to her I could barely feel it.I gave it to her at 8am before I went to work. I came home for lunch at 11:30 and she had COMPLETELY destroyed it! She located the seam and, somehow, wedged her teeth into it, worked her way around the circumference and pried the lid loose. She then chewed the lip off of the jug all the way around so the lid cannot be put back on it.

I am very happy with this toy and recommend it for anyone with a bully breed. Although my bully chews on the jar, it's just big enough that he can not get a good grip so he hasn't been able to chew through it and luckily he isn't interested in chewing the rope apart (yet).It didn't take him long to figure out how to get treats out and this is his favorite toy. You can vary the size of the treats so that some come out easier than others. I take it away from him once the food is out because if it is empty he will try to chew it up like his other toys. But as long as there is treats inside he will be focused on getting them out rather than destroying the toy itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"very sturdy good toy","review":"This is a great toy my pup can work at, but the only reason it isn't a 5 star is because the bottle is loud when he drops it.

The thing is great--most of them are way too easy and dispense the food too quickly. This one is perfect because it is a little bit more challenging, and there are ways to make it harder such as adding pieces into the jug to block the food from being dispensed (like a golf ball). Also, the bottom screws off so it is easy to load in the food. Many food cubes you have to load the food in little by little which is annoying when you are trying to feed your dog his entire meal in a puzzle cube~! I highly recommend this one ( i have 2 other puzzle cubes and this is by far the best)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tug-A-Jug Treat Toy","review":"Dogs like it, which is probably the main point.

I wanted to give her something to stimulate her mind, so she didn't get too bored while I was away. I received many recommendations on this toy, and read many great reviews. Here are my issues with it.1) My dog may only be 16 lbs., but she's an extreme chewer. The product says it's durable, but it's not. She almost had it chewed through by day one.2) Apparently, my dog is a genius. She figured out how to dispense the treats, just not the way they're supposed to be dispensed. She unraveled the rope. Pulled it out and dumped the treats out. Now, the toy is useless.I think it would be a great toy for a dog that doesn't like to chew and can't figure out a work around to dispensing the treats. For extreme chewers, and smart dogs, it's not durable or stimulating enough for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for powerful chewers!","review":"I bought two of these for my 16 month black lab and my 3 year old Golden Retriever.

When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever. It is loud and dangerous. The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily bruise you and your dog and break everything in the house. In addition, because I have hard wood floors, the loud bang of the hard plastic against the floor was unbearable. Lastly, in the two days I allowed her to play with it, the rope became frayed and I kept finding pieces of string in her mouth. I definitely do not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be stronger","review":"I have two boxers, male and female.

The tug-a-jug can be a dangerous toy being made out of very hard plastic almost as hard as glass. If one dog is swinging it, it can injure another animal standing by. It also can do damage to furniture, walls, etc. I purchased the large size. Today my dog found it after not using it for a very long time and was playing with it and cracked and broke the whole end off leaving sharp plastic edges. Luckily I noticed it right away or my dog could have ingested that!

It keeps both of our dogs (1 silky terrier, 1 boston terrier) busy, and actually keeps my boston's farting problem at bay (I'm serious). The only downside is the plastic top that you have to screw off/on to put food into it is NOT durable. I called customer service and they sent me a new one, but they sounded surprised because the tug-a-jug is apparently made of ballistic plastic (I don't even know what that means).

I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good.

Her dry food works just fine and from what we have seen, she even prefers it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larger than I though","review":"Bought this for a weiner dog mixed with a pure bred mutt, it is huge.

She can barely get her mouth around it, just enough to tip it on end to help get the treats out. She destroys ropes and plush toys but this is holding up. The treats keep her occupied. It's super easy to fill. Kong wobbler barely holds one cup kibble and i have a hard tine filling due to cross threading. the small Could probably hold 2 cups kibble. I put in one cup for meals. Helps keep her occupied around 30 mins. She got bored with kong, she like the rope on this. I bought it half price at a discount store on a whim, couldn't be happier. Well worth the full amazon price. Of course, depends on your dog ymmv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can be a toy and obedience training","review":"My Miniature Pinscher eats like she's a vacuum.

When I was browsing the dog toys, I thought this would be a one and I was not mistaken. My dog passes a lot of time playing with it. The only bad thing I see, is that the part of the screww is a little weak. I had to buy a new one, because the first one broke from that part and all the treats fell out of it.

It keeps our Pit/Lab mix busy and gets her thinking which let me tell you is amazing since she's quite \\"thick\\" in the head... I've found a few smaller sized treats at Petco and put a handful in at a time. Make sure to put different sized treats in it too or else the dog will dump them all out and then fill up way too fast.

The sides of the bottle are too deep to really dispense without having to tip the bottle, so she got a little frustrated trying to get the treats out. She ended up bringing the toy to people to get the treat out for her. Well, she got tired of that and just decided to eat the rope off. I was really excited to get this toy too, she needs mind games to keep her busy. This one just doesn't hold up. Totally not worth the $20 I wasted. I'm sticking to Kong and West Paw toys from now on.

She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough. When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour. At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber \\"pull\\" was already in pieces.

This is it, I put a hand full of training treats in it, and it keeps him occupied for over an hour.

He's the kind of dog who when bored and/or anxious tends to chew on his tail and paws, so this is a welcome distraction. I offer it about once a week. I used to leave his toys laying around in his dog bed or crate, but found that he loses interest so I tend to rotate offering 2 or 3 toys every few days. Any small treat works well, as long as it's not his usual dog food. I thought it was a little expensive, but it's durable, easy to instill the treats, and challenging enough to keep him busy for at least a half an hour, but not so hard that he loses interest. I'll try to attach a 45 second video of him playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs love it, but...","review":"Our dogs (30lb and 40lb Corgi/border collie mixes) love it, it's about the right level of difficulty.It was evident pretty quickly, though, that as soon as our bigger dog figured out how to sink his teeth into the plastic enough to pick it up from the bottom and bash it against things to shake the contents out that it was going to have a rough life, and so it's proven.After a couple months of fairly regular use, the body of the jug has split all the way down from the mouth to the bottom cap on two sides. It still works, but the pieces are only held together by the bottom cap and the rubber ball at the mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tug-a-jug gets my dog's approval","review":"I bought this for my one year old sheltie for Christmas and he LOVES it.

Only the Chiweenie can get the food out of this toy---which is a good thing really because he is the only one with a weight problem. He is also the youngest and the one most likely to get into trouble when left at home alone. He drags this toy around by the hard rubber ball part, then lays it flat on the floor, pushing and pulling the rubber rope until he empties it. The other dogs just watch, but never attempt it themselves. It is easy to refill except I struggle sometimes with lining up the grooves on the screw-on lid. It washes well in the dishwasher. I recommend this toy for every dog, but many dogs will need a little occupational therapy to learn how to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Dogs completely ignore it.","review":"I purchased this for my dogs.

Some dogs love it, some dogs ignore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dogs LOVE this toy!","review":"I bought this toy for my puppies in hopes of finding a toy that would last longer than a day.

This is a wonderful alternative to the Buster Cube.

No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him. He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that.

He would get all the treats out of the KONG so I decided to get him another toy to keep him occupied when I was away. The first few days he attempted to get the treats out of the busy buddy were not successful. He would sniff, push, sniff, push. The hard plastic made a lot of NOISE. Sometimes Juneau would drop the KONG down a flight of stairs to get the treat. I didn't mind the rubber KONG bouncing around. But imagine hard plastic hitting my hardwood and marble floors!After a week of use, I had trouble getting the cap back on. I found myself being the Busy Buddy, trying to get the cap to stay on!

It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions. I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy. They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought. AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes.

I bought it because i thought it'd be a good distraction to keep her entertained and less anxious when i leave, but now i'm afraid it'd be inducing aggression and causing harm if ingested.

We now serve Wendy all her dinners in the Tug-a-Jug. At first she was quite frustrated but we mixed some small kibble with the regular size and she was rewarded enough to keep working on it. Now we simply toss in a couple handfuls of kibble screw the top back on and dinner lasts 15-20 minutes instead of the 2 minute bowl feast. Some reviewers didn't like the plastic rope in this newer version, but I find it cleans up easier and does not become frayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic toy for a smart energetic dog","review":"We love this toy, and it is one of 2 that have even survived our toy destroying mutt.

They didn't seem to be too worried about the size once they realized treats were inside of it and it is a toy that they can grow into! If you have a smaller breed of dog, I would recommend getting the smaller size. I tried using larger treats at first (size of large breed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it. Now they have mastered it so well that I am going to have to resort to the larger treat sizes! It keeps them busy for about 30-45 minutes at a time! Overall, very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but too hard in practice!","review":"My dog is very smart, he got the idea of what he needed to do real quickly but it's just to hard for the treats to come out of the jar, even when we help him... the rope pretty much closes the jar hole and the treats wont come out. This toy made my puppy real nervous and unfortunately I'm returning it, even though I was super excited about it! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really interested","review":"Our two dogs are not really interested in this toy, it has pretty much sat in their toy box since we bought it for them.

My Lab loves it and it has held up to her power chewing. Once she figured it out I've had to use larger treats to keep her busier longer. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This toy is one of the best I found. I put their food in it, and they went crazy trying to get it out. They are both pretty smart labs and figured out how to manipulate the toy to get the food pretty quickly, so I had to buy some treats that were bigger and harder to get out. The only problem I've encountered is that one of the ropes fell apart. I bought a new rope (rather than a whole new tug-a-jug), however the new rope is thicker and makes it near impossible to get anything out- neither dog gets anything from it regularly enough so they get fed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boomer's New Toy","review":"I have a 13 week old Goldendoodle who is fiesty and playful. We have several interactive toys and this is one of Boomer's favorite! We use it all the time but lately my husband who takes care of him in the early morning has been away so I've been on duty 24/7, after his 5 a.m. potty I fill it up with his kibble and put him back in his crate and it keeps him busy for a while and then he falls back to sleep. It's worth it's weight in gold for us.The bottom unscrews so you can put the treats in from there and the ventilation holes allows for the dogs to get a good whiff of the treats. It's more challenging than the amaze a ball and keeps our puppy busy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every dog","review":"I have 2 Corgis, and also foster for Corgi Rescue. So far none of the four dogs I have had since buying this toy (my 2 plus 2 rescues) have played with it for more than a few minutes. They are all otherwise high energy, playful, food driven dogs.They LOVE Tricky Treat, Buster Cube and MolecuBall so I thought this would be a nice change. Big expensive yawn.

I specifically ordered this product because it showed the jug to have a plastic rope and not an actual rope (my dog loves to tear apart ropes, and I'd had a tug-a-jug that had the plastic rope previously and that was a great product. I'm not sure if they're making it with the plastic rope anymore, but I assumed that since that was what was shown, that's what I'd receive.)

At first she wasn't interested, but once I showed her how it worked, she got down to business. She worked at that toy all day long the first day, thougth she wasn't able to get all the food out. On the second day I gave her the toy, partially filled with kibble and went upstairs. In the 25 minutes she was unsupervised, she got the screw cap off, ate all the kibble, and destroyed the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy but frustrates my dog","review":"This toy keeps our Boston Terrier entertained for a long time. We don't give it to her all the time to keep it new and interesting. It is not easy to get the food out of the toy, which really frustrates her. She'll start barking at it and going at it harder. Other reviewers said their dogs got the hang of it quickly and were able to \\"beat\\" the system, but I don't see that happening with our dog. It is still a bit of randomness with how the food comes out, so what worked for the dog one time, might not the next. You can make it harder or easier depending on the size and shape of food you use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"This product seems to be torturous for my dog. She sees the treats inside, but being such a small dog, even the \\"small\\" sized bottle is too big for her to thrash around and get the treats out. I love how busy it keeps her, but in the end, I have to take a treat or two out for her because she can't do it on her own. Probably better for bigger dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps them entertained.","review":"I bought this a few months ago, and my two puppies are still playing with it. My pups are now about 13-15 pounds, and while they play rough with each other, they aren't too rough on this toy. I know a lot of people mentioned their dogs chew right through the rope, but this was not the case in our house, which I was glad to see. They seem to focus on scratching at the purple spiked piece and don't do much flailing around by the rope, so that could be why.One of the dogs figured out how to use it right away, although it took her a couple of weeks to get a little more aggressive with it. It took the other one almost a month to not be afraid of it! It never fails, though, when they go for their toy box, this is the toy they pull out and play with for a good 20 minutes. I have no complaint about the quality of the product, and it keeps my dogs happy and entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea... my dogs are not interested.","review":"I don't know. Maybe I'm just not putting the right \\"yummy goodness\\" inside. This toy, though durable and a novel idea, doesn't hold either of my dogs' interest. Not even our beagle (who tells everyone she's STARVING and we NEVER feed her... EVER!) seems to be interested in this for any length of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a Kong....","review":"The package says that this is supposed to be practically break-proof, which I thought was perfect for my year-old Beauceron who is a pretty aggressive chewer. Finally! A toy that would make his brain work and keep him occupied.Three uses. First one he very quickly discovered how to get the treats right out. Second, he learned how to get the screw-off bottom to come off of the jug. Third time - he chewed the plastic to bits by the time I got it away from him - and he was in the same room with me!I'm a dog trainer and only recommend high-endurance products for my clients. This didn't even come *close* to meeting my expectations! Total disappointment. Will not buy another 'Premier' Busy Buddy toy for my chewer!At almost 3 years old, we still rely on the blue K9 Kongs, Holey Moley, and Everlast Treat balls to stand up to his strong jaws and chew drive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for aggressive chewers","review":"Our one year old westie can chew up almost anything. I've spent lots of money on toys that were made for aggressive chewers, and were destroyed 20 minutes later. This treat dispenser is great.

I was going to return it, but was in the middle of a move, so now I'm stuck with it, and it never gets used. I suppose if I can somehow untie the rope, unbraid it, remove a section, rebraid it, and retie it, it may work...but as you can see that sounds like an awful lot of work, for something that should have been designed better from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog loses interest","review":"The design of this dog toy is such that it is too difficult for my lab to get the treats out and she loses interest in even trying.

I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it. This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart. However, he may be too smart. Gave it to my dog tonight. It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied. I walked away to leave him to his work. 10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle. He cheated.

It can take her up to a half hour to eat a meal instead of two minutes.I've given her food a couple of times without the bottle, but she prefers the bottle now.Updated section!As she become a strong chewer, it's fairly easy for my dog to chew off the bottom part that's screwed on.

Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).First, my dog took to chewing the jug. She saw the treats and would hit at the jug. She also chewed on the grip and bone. In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it. She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her. Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL. In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all. She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Parish","review":"Parish does it again.I've been a big fan of Jim Parish's cinematic oeuvre of literature for 20 years.

I actually missed this release by Dee Dee when it came out, but spotted it recently while browsing a local music shop. I picked it up straight away and anticipated listening to it with great expectations!I have to say that I was highly underwhelmed by the recording. I'm actually surprised to read in other reviews here that she lived in France for 20 plus years since one of the things I couldn't get by was what I though was a really horrible singing style with the French language.

I have some music by Edith Piaf, and Joni James, and Nana Mouskouri (sp) and other \\"international\\" vocalists, but I don't believe that Ms Bridgewater pales in comparison. Some of these songs I know, or I think I recognize, and she certainly gives them her own style, so if you are only familiar with one artist's take all your life, this album may have difficult moments for you. It's a pity that amazon doesn't have the click to listen buttons for this album.

The original starred Billy Lee and Cordell Hickman as the two young boys and I believe it may have even been voted the best piture of 1940. Easily worthy of five stars.

My personal favorite is \\"Vrbana Bridge\\", a tragic tale about two lovers who suffer the loss of one another during the Bosnian War.

First off, the case was only partially covered with a cheap, crinkly shrinkwrap that appeared to have been heated too long. Then, upon opening the case, I discovered that there was only a single disk, not 3 as described. The disk itself looked like it had been burned and labeled in someone's garage. Finally, upon inserting the disk, I was dismayed to see that what I had purchased was not even close to being a documentary, merely recordings of some fringe talk shows.All in all, there is nothing professional about this DVD.

It's a pity it is misrepresented by its sensationalist title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Quality Production","review":"This production is presented on one disc, not the three in the Amazon.com advertisement.

These cuts were recorded during 2006-07 with the assistance of producer Don Was. There's only one song here I don't like at all. But tunes that managed to sort of catch me off guard were Sweet's \\"Little Willy\\", Marshall Tucker Band's \\"Can't You See\\", the smoking Romantics cover - \\"What I Like About You\\" {killer harmonica - they're playing this on their current summer tour}, the Stone's stellar \\"Dead Flowers\\" and Jim Croce's \\"Don't Mess Around With Jim\\".

Poison has been notorious for their re-release / re-working of the same old material with all of their live albums, greatest hits albums, etc., and they have put out very little new material in the past decade. When they have put out new material, it is often what I would consider sub-par (i.e., the new part of \\"Power to the People\\" and all of \\"Hollyweird\\"). On the heels of all of these disappointments comes this album--a cover album--in which there really isn't any inspiration or innovation in the re-makes of these songs. Honestly, I think that Poison has lost its edge, and I feel as though they are taking advantage of their fan-base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put some effort in!!","review":"To me, this is just laziness.

That's why I was surprised to find this 500ft spool of 14ga cable for such a reasonable price.Last year I used this cable to wire a surround system in my family room and it has worked perfectly. The cable is very flexible and has a marking for every 1' of length, so it's easy to tell how much you've pulled. (The mark isn't just a tick, it actually has the number of feet printed.) It has a low-friction shielding so it's easy to pull and an internal rip-cord helps remove the shielding when you're tying this into speakers.This is 14ga wire, which was perfect for my usage. Anything smaller starts to impact sound quality on longer runs, and larger wire is a pain to work with for some connectors and speakers.Overall, I would highly recommend this cable.

This is a book not about God's love, but about man's gloriousness. It would fit well among the writings of the Age of Enlightenment, except for its bad scholarship. Particulars about the author's misinterpretation of the above books abound in reviews by other sensible readers, so I shall spare you... Readers who give this book more than one star fascinate me.

Whether you agree with Hunt or not, this is just a poorly researched, poorly written book.Edit: Here is a link to James White's critique I mentioned pointing out many of the errors, including this misquotations of Spurgeon. My point is simply that the book is poorly researched. That is an objective reality. I've read far better critiques of Calvinism. This is just a bad book.

Even basic tenants of Calvinism are misunderstood or not understood at all. The worst part of the whole thing is that those who are yet babes in need of milk will take this curdled milk as food. When one compares this suppossed refutation of Calvinism with Calvin's Institutes, Augustine's City of God, or Berkhof's Systematic Theology, he will notice a few glaring differences: A lack of basic logic, no viable alternative, no biblical quotes, a complete lack of understanding of the precepts of Calvinism, and finally no real understanding of the totality of scripture.

All Hunt does in this book is destroy his \\"moderate calvinism\\" which is really not Calvinism at all, Hunt is an Arminian. I hope that there will soon be a book to come out from the reformed position to respond to Hunt's book, such as Geisler's Chosen but Free, and then James White coming along and destroying CBF.

He views free-will and sovereignty as polar opposites. The more sovereignty exerted, the less room for free will there is. It's tragic, but oh so common when stuff like this gets into print. The reason is that he equates God's sovereignty with the type of sovereignty that man has the capacity to exert. With man, they would be polar opposites, but God's sovereignty is so much larger and greater than what we can exert that there is room for free-will to operate within the spectrum of God's sovereignty.

Hunt should not even be called a \\"moderate Calvinist\\" because to attach Calvin's name to Hunt's theology is a poor example of Calvinism at all.

If they want their man-centered, cross denying, heretical theology, they may have it. Only those who have not studied God's Word at all will delight in this book. I would like to recommend my book, GOD CHOSE TO SAVE as a direct rebuke (and a simple one at that) of Hunt's tripe. As Spurgeon once said, Calvinism is just a short hand for the Gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made my friend a Calvinist...","review":"...and honestly, I have held back from reading A Woman Rides the Beast (Hunt's treatise against the Roman Catholic Church) fearing that it might convince me to submit to the Pope - 'cuz man, if he represents the Roman Church as poorly as he does the Calvinists, then it is likely that they believe exactly opposite what he says and are correct after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"My stomach was eating itself from the inside out.","review":"I never made it past the second chapter. By that time, Hunt had already claimed that Spurgeon denied limited atonement and claimed that John Bunyan was not a Calvinist. Now, if you can call a man who said that \\"Calvinism is the Gospel\\" non-Calvinist, and a man who unapologetically embraced not just Calvinism, but good old, supralapsarian 'high-Calvinism,' then how in the world can I trust your interpretations of Scripture? Anyone who wants to understand the subject, read \\"Why I am not a Calvinist\\" for the Arminian view, and then read \\"The Justification of God\\" or \\"The Pleasures of God\\" or \\"The Doctrines of Grace.\\" These are much better books and are not the polemical, ad-hominem riddled mess found in this book.I only gave it a star because the review thing made me, plus the cover picture was kind of cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those seeking personal growth.","review":"I purchased this book because a friend of mine recommended it to me, and it became a \\"must read\\" for me (must read again and again and again).

It started off a bit confusing and I wasn't really sure what direction it was headed....however, the book has given me a number of great moments of perspective.

One finds erotica from primarily 3-4 sources: an anonymous book and several collections. While the plates have Taschen's standard quality, the limited perspective of these few artists fails to deliver anything resembling a true overview of erotica in the 20th century (something obviously very much implied in the title). In the same fashion, with such a limit on content, the brief text fails to do the same. While one may applaud the preservation of these works and the fact that Taschen has made them available to all at a more than reasonable price, anyone expecting to find a full or even reasonable overview will be sorely disappointed. I found this book to be a low-tide watermark among Taschen publications and the only book of theirs that I own that I actually regret purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty pictures by any other name","review":"This series is supposedly a study of erotica through the ages. It is nothing more than a compliation of dirty pictures. Save your money. If you want dirty pictures...there are better books.

Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the software","review":"This is a wonderful camera. I purchased it and took it on my long-planned trip through Europe in 2006. Upon return, I downloaded the pictures using the Cyberlink Power Producer software. I worked on the pictures, then saved them until I had time to return and finish my sorting, renaming, etc.When I returned, the pictures were missing. I found a file with the correct extension, but the software wouldn't open it. In spite of several attempts to get Cyberlink to resolve the problem, we were unsuccessful. Their suggestions for resolving the problem were short-sighted and repetitive. I even paid Data Doctors privately to try to find the file.

I bought a JVC video recorder last year and despite it being new it came without most of the accessories offered with it--things you'll probably need such as the cable to connect it to the TV and the one to connect it to the computer. I had to buy each of these for $40 each--they would not ship them, and also had to buy the software that was supposed to come with the camera. after all that, the leads broke and the camera started eating tape. the customer service was useless and I finally just threw it out.

It has served well since I bought it a month ago. The only thing is that battery does not last more than 40 minutes when fully charged and there is no warranty on the battery.

None of my free (i.e. non-copyrighted) books are have such a plethora of scanning errors. Mind you, the print editions are close to flawless (I gave mine away, i.e. had read it several times before).

Another winner!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back!","review":"This is my fifth review of a James Herriot title, and if you've missed my first four reviews because you live in a cave, I presume you've heard of the TV series called All Creatures Great And Small. That was based on the first collection of wonderful tales from a Yorkshire veterinarian, or possibly the first few. More than a decade passed between this book and the one before it, and I believe this was his last original book. At first there is a dip in the quality we've come to expect, but once he gets back into his groove, it's every bit as entertaining as its predecessors, and I hated that it ended.

Another great inspiration from the Edible Garden Series. This is a valuable reference book as it provides the essentials to a successful garden in a format that is consistent and easy to read. It includes a complete encyclopedia of edible flowers with beautifully detailed photos that are good enough to eat! The photos make it easy for the beginner to learn the names of edible flowers and to easily identify all varieties. The author takes great care in listing any poisonious varieties that might be mistaken as edible. This book also contains sections on Planting and Maintenance, and Pest and Disease Control. It's an all-in-one tool. I plan to order the entire Edible Garden series. As soon as I finish one book, I'm hungry for the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and fun book!","review":"A friend asked me to purchase this book for them so that they could read more about it.

But it just never jells.

It simply devours batteries. I just read another review that was really helpful, advising not to use Alkaline batteries with the camera, but I read it too late. Now my camera won't work with any kind of batteries. The battery life got worse and worse (even with batteries right out of the package). And the WORST thing about this is when the battery gets low, the zoom lense freezes while open, so if you can't replace the batteries right away, your lense is completely unprotected. Such a shame, because it takes decent pictures. I'm replacing it with a Canon--with a RECHARGABLE battery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pictures but terrible battery life","review":"I bought this camera to use while hiking and otherwise away from a constant supply of batteries. If you buy this camera, you better bring huge supply of batteries with you. For instants, once in a while I would get maybe 20 or so photos before it shut down, sometimes only 3 or 4 and a couple times it would not start up with store fresh Duracells.

Muse from the UK were barely formed. Showbiz is their first album, released in 1999. Origin of Symmetry was the album not released in the US, so dont' think Arcana is that particular album. It's not. Thirdly, Absolution is their current album. try one of those if you are looking for the popular Muse you've heard on your radio.If you are reading this for a review of Arcana.

I was surprised how well this stacked up to its Hollywood contemporaries and how similar it was in tone. If you enjoy musical comedies from the 1930s, don't hesitate to get this wonderful film. The story and direction were full of energy and wit. Lyubov Orlova would certainly have been a star in America. While comparisons to Jeanette MacDonald aren't off the mark, Orlova also was a terrific comic actress. The supporting actors are also wonderful. So don't be put off by the fact it was made in Stalin's USSR, the communist quotient is really low.The video lost a star because the songs aren't always subtitled (I suspect some of the communist flavor was hidden within in them), also because of the aspect ratio, certain elements are cut off.

Once the case is on it's very difficult to get back off. I had to pry it open with a knife, which is very hard to do without damaging the sansa or the case itself. The belt clip is rather flimsy, so I don't use it at all. While the sansa is cradled perfectly inside so there's no bouncing, there is plenty of room for a lot of dust to get in, making the mp3 player look dirty and dusty, which drives me crazy. Otherwise the case is fine. It doesn't add too much bulk to the player like other cases do. Overall 3 stars, because of the difficulty of removing the case without damaging the sansa and the ability for so much dust to get in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly underrated Stoner rock...Kyuss/Pearl Jam meets Zepplin/hendrix","review":"This is all out funky bluesy stoner rock, with heaps of long groovy riffs. A real 70s influence with that added 90s Grunge Flavour. Highly Underrated and as much as I can say they draw influences from the aforementioned bands they draw their influences from so many places even though they still play only one particular style. The band members all know how to use their instruments in exemplar fashion and you get the feeling they have a special bond with them as if they were born to play them. I could pick on track out like \\"why\\" for example but the entire album is pure brilliance so choosing one track is a nigh impossible task. I implore all rock and metal fans to seek this out as you will not at all be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The fabric used for this blanket is not soft and cuddly like a baby blanket should be.

Its Perfect for my litte monkeys who always manage to crawl over the other gates. I had my first one for 1 month then the little plastic piece under the handle broke. Not from misuse just using it daily. Got a replacement. Had it sitting upright leaning against the wall and it got knocked down. It broke again somthing inside was ratteling and it wouldnnt stay closed at all. I'm so disappointed. It would be perfect if it was durable so I returned it last night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"I HAVE BOUGHT MANY MANY GATES TO KEEP MY DOG IN THE BATHROOM DURING THE DAY AND THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL KEEP HER IN. SHE CANNOT JUMP OVER AND THERE ARE NO SLOTS THAT SHE CAN WIGGLE THRU. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us.","review":"I had high hopes for this gate. We bought it to keep our son from reaching through the bars to tease our cat, but since our doorway has baseboards, he simply reached under it. While I appreciate the unique design, we found it wobbly and difficult to install tightly in the doorway when used as a pressure gate. Oh, and our son also figured out how to raise the latch the first day (he's 20 months). I'm returning it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake we did....","review":"We just got this installed and can't wait to take it down! We had to mount and paint additional hardware at the top of our stairs to accommodate it, making it less than easy to insall. Once up, (several hours due to poor directions) I was eager to swing it open. That part was easy. The challenging part is closing it. You have to line it up (top & bottom) just perfectly with the handle in the up positon in order to close it. This amounted to lining up the top positioner okay, but needed a foot to kick the bottom one into place. You can't just \\"close it\\" and walk away. I can't imagine doing so with an armful of laundry or my 9 month old in my arms. I'm heading out to buy a different type of gate today! It's only redeeming qualities are its esthetics."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Return Allowed???!!!","review":"First, I am upset that there was nothing that described the gate. The see through feature is a sheet of cheap plastic. There's hardware you have to mount. Then if you have floor mounting on the bottom of your wall, you can't place the hardware. Then, the return policy was five days from the day THEY shipped it out. There was definitely NOTHING that told me that when I ordered it.I haven't used it, and I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a few months...","review":"We bought this gate for the top of our stairs. It was more difficult than expected to mount but once it was up it work well for the first few months. My brother and 16 yr old son have rooms in the basement and probably use the gate most. After about 3 months the gate was difficult to align which is required to get it to latch. The rubber feet on the latching side for the pressure mount started to tear off and now the bottom one won't retract when you pull the handle up so you have to kick it to get it in or out of the pressure mount cup on the wall. The gate was replaced with a metal walk thru gate last night, hope we have better luck with this one. We are keeping the gate to use in other doorways without the swing mount feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE","review":"After purchasing a different gate and seeing this one at a friends house I knew we needed it. We have a bi-level home and it is perfect. It keeps our son safte during the day and we can leave it open when he is in bed and go up and down the stairs without a hassle. Best baby purchase yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate","review":"Love these gates I own 3 of these now, great for kids and dogs. I would but again. And I recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"I bought 2 of these and am very happy with them. I have one up using the pressure mounted. That one stays up most of the time and is not moved often. I have the other one installed. It swings like a door and locks into place when closed. That one is opened and closed all the time. I have had no issues with them. I like the fact that she can't climb up them either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy to install, attractive gate","review":"I found this gate VERY easy to install. The directions were quite easy to understand, and attaching this to my door frame took a grand total of 10 minutes. I'm not sure it could have been easier - they even include a paper template so you can position your mark in order to drill properly.This gate is a lot more attractive than the old kind, opens and closes very easily and isn't *too* tall that it can't be climbed over if necessary. I only wish I'd found this sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first...until a few uses later...","review":"My brother in-law bought one of these for his baby. I noticed that the screws were almost ripping out of the wall, I figured it was more than likely because he just drilled the screws into the sheet rock and didn't use the plastic sheetrock pieces that come for the screws. Well, I went ahead and bought it and installed it the right way. It's been 3 months since installation. The damn door never stays put in place, I constantly have to re-adjust it and the stupid screws are still coming off the wall, no matter what I do. I re-adjusted the door, screwed it into the wood this time, and now the door is still loose, never stays in place unless I force it into place. So...beware. Skip this if you can, get a metal door gate instead. Those are much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate","review":"Great Gate especially for the price. Gate was very easy to install. We have it hardware mounted at the bottom of our stairs and it works great...light enough to open with full arms but sturdy enough that when my son beats on it it doesn't move. It is easy to adjust when it is hardware mounted and fits perfect every time. A good thing to know (that I didn't and bought anyway) is that it does come with spacers that can be attached to the wall for uneven walls. There are 2 different widths that can be used and stacked on top of each other. Overall we are very pleased..even my husband who was a little skeptical loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love this gate, couldn't find a better one!","review":"We adore this gate! After alot of research on different types of gates, we chose to get two of these for the top & bottom of our very steep staircase. Our home is historic, and the walls & molding are not very even. The spacers allowed for a perfect fit reguardless. The directions are extremely simple for anyone to follow, who takes the time to read them thoroughly. Neither of my climbers have tried to climb it, they are just as content looking through the clear plastic to see whats going on, on the other side :o) I have no issues with trying to get it to line up right to close, even my 3 year old can close it - so I'm not sure why others had issues with it, maybe just poor installation. The gate will even close if only top or bottom are locked in, also. We have the top gate pressure-mounted and its just as secure as the one that latches at the bottom! Love this gate, highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 1 year","review":"Really liked this gate...while it lasted. We had it for about 1 year and then the internal mechanisms broke and we were not able to fix it. Bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I was kind of worry this gate was not going to be what i wanted since my family has always purchase the rail gates. I didn't want a rail gate i was worry my daughter was going to hurt her self playing in between the rails. I absolutely love it It work perfectly. we put it on the bottom of our second floor stairs. its secure very steady. I would defiantly recommend this gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"works once you get it set up","review":"It took me a little while to align the gait on both sides of the wall so i could screw it in. Very stable once its set up. My 2 year old husky cannot even break it down. Works well to keep my crawling baby from going down the stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this gate","review":"We purchased this gate after trying 3 others that were frustrating and/or dangerous. This gate serves it's purpose very well (to keep a toddler out of our office). It's easy to open and close, but not for baby. See through so baby can see you while you're in the room, and no clumsy bar to trip over when going through the gate. I'd recommend it for anyone who has a room that needs to be closed to small children. We used the screws and attached it to the doorframe, but it can also be a pressure gate, which we did not want, as we go through this door many times a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"Our favorite gate. Pressure mount is strong enough that it doesn't need mounting hardware, easy to put up and take away, light weight, and doesn't look hideous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gate","review":"Awesome gate! We use it in our Center to keep our infants & toddlers safe in the main room. Very handy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pressure mount did not work","review":"We have a first years gate from the 90s and it still works well so when we needed an additional safety gate we chose this one. The pressure mount did not work for us at all and the clear window on the gate seems very flimsy. We returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST. GATE. EVER!!!!","review":"We owned this gate 5 years ago to keep our little girl away from the stairs. I donated it to a thrift store when we were finished with it. BIG mistake. We now have a puppy and I have been looking all over trying to re-buy my gate. I am ecstatic to see it here on amazon and will be purchasing one to keep the puppy contained in the bathroom. I hate that I am buying the same thing twice, but this gate is absolutely perfect. The lack of toe/foot holds prevents any climbing the gate. It always held well at the bottom of the stairs and was easy to remove when need be. Like I said, best gate ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"See-thru gate","review":"I really like this gate. It came with extra wall spacers in case you have thick trim, which was a bonus. Also, my dog loves seeing through the gate, and the gaps on the sides are small enough that he cannot get through or beneath (he is 5 lbs and can get through most gates). The only complaint I have is that when you have it pressure mounted on one side to an uneven wall (i.e. you have thick trim on the bottom and have unscrewed the top part to make it wider, as instructed), you have to occasionally tighten the extender so that the pressure against the wall is still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handle Breaks easily","review":"I LOVE this gate I am however on my sixth one after my 4th child and running a daycare, because the children swing on it. Even as durable as it is MY husband insists on adjusting it too tightly which causes the handle to break off and then the gate is useless. The bonus is if you send the handle into the manufacturer, they will replace the gate. THis gate is by far (after instructions to all the adults, who say DUH) the BEst! IT is the most functional, asthetically pleasing and user friendly gate i have EVER had. I LOVE it and wouldn't be caught without one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Clear Swing Gate","review":"I installed the gate at the top of my stair case (using the hardware mounts, not the pressure mount system). The installation was quick and easy. The gate operates with similar ease. The clear plastic makes the gate more aesthecially pleasing than most other gates and so far seems very sturdy. For the price, this item can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy and easy to install","review":"It has held up against our very active son's desire to explore it ... It is a fair price and seems like it will last long enough for future kids too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive design, flimsy parts - would NOT use at top of stairs","review":"We bought this gate from Babies R Us last month and installed it in our home as a hardware-mounted swing gate. After just a couple of weeks of use, the top plastic hinge snapped off from the wall, leaving only the two screws in the wall. I was surprised by how easily the part broke. We like the design so we have requested a replacement part from the company. Fortunately, we did not install at the top of our stairs - seeing how easily it snapped from the wall, I would not recommend installing the gate at the top of any stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR CLIMBERS","review":"I bought this gate so that my 18 month old could have room time, thinking that it would be impossible for him to climb. I only used it as a pressure-mounted gate and it was easy to put up. However, he managed to scale the side of it and was straddling the gate crying when I checked on him. To the gate's credit, it did not fall under the pressure of his weight, but it does not serve it's purpose - and is not safe - if he can climb it! I am returning it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one for a great value","review":"I researched dozens of safety gates for our new home with wide stairs. This gate has been wonderful, and at a reasonable cost! My adventurous climber cannot get a foot hold on this one, and he loves the clear panels because he can see the action in the entry. Installation was very easy, even with my baseboard, since it includes a kit. I do have to clean the panels because my guy loves to blow on them, but I'd rather clean than worry about him climbing it. The swinging mechanism is easy to operate with one hand, and everyone comments on how attractive it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe and easy to use","review":"We bought this gate, primarily, to keep the dog and cats out of the baby room. My husband mounted this to the door frame and adjusted the gate to fit the door, no problem. It works wonderfully. The dog can sit outside the room and see in and that cats want nothing to do with it. The door is secure and safe. I don't have to worry about our little one climbing it because there are no foot holds, just clear plastic. It opens easily and closes in such a way that is easy for my husband and me but I know that our daughter won't be able to work it open."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and easy","review":"This gate looks nice and was extremely easy to put up. I am only using the pressure mount and not the safety brackets. (I am not using this gate for stairs.) I like the option because it requires only one side of the jamb to be drilled into. This gate can swing in either direction. It requires one hand to open this gate, but is easy to open. <br />"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"We bought this gate a few weeks ago because I am 9 months pregnant and have a large chocolate lab that I do not want going into the baby room. However, I did not want the door to be shut all the time either. So we got this gate because I wanted something I could easily get in and out of without the hassle. This gate is great!! It was really easy to install and it looks great as well because of the clear sidings, it doesn't take away from the room at all. I also have a 2 1/2 year old stepdaughter who has not managed to get in or out of the gate, even with a little push. So I am fully confident that this gate will do the trick. I highly recommend.I only gave four stars because we haven't had the baby yet, but I do not anticipate it getting worse...only better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it broke","review":"I bought this gate and had it harware mounted in my hall. It was easy to install and use, but the adjustment for the width broke in about 5 weeks. Its just 2 screws into chinsy plastic! If they fixed this little flaw it would be a great gate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good value","review":"We use this gate to keep the little one out of the kitchen, away from the back door and the cat food. It works nicely as a pressure mounted gate. We rent our house so I didn't want to have to screw any holes in the walls. It's pretty secure and easy to setup and take down. I give this a 4.5/5 star rating because after being put in place and removed a few times the nobs on the side need to be adjusted to keep the gate tightly in place. It's a minor inconvenience and doesn't detract from the quality of the gate as long as it's installed properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"very sturdy","review":"this is one of many safety gates we've bought over the last 6 years and it's my favorite. Great for the top of the stairs. It secures well into the wall and is easy to open with one hand when you're carrying a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not swing open!","review":"The picture of this gate makes it seem as if it would be easy to get by it using one hand to open and close it. Not true. We are very disappointed. You can't step over it and you can't open it with one hand with a baby in your arms. It is only good for an opening that you don't need to get past easily. But if you put it at the top of your stairs and you're trying to get down the stairs with a child in one arm and one free arm, it is useless. I do not recommend it and can't figure out why it got such good ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses Tension & Then Useless as a Pressure Gate","review":"I bought 2 of these gates the same day. I liked this gate because it is more attractive than the other gates that I have seen. After about a week, one of the gates lost all tension on one side. I realized this after my son fell backwards when pulling on the gate. The store (babiesrus) would not take it back because I didn't have the receipt and didn't have the original box. So I am stuck with a wobbly gate. If I have to use it at all, it is as a deterrant only and I must keep an eye on my son. I would not buy this gate unless they fix the problem with the tension, because I see that I am not the only person who has experienced this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly hard reading for given subject matter.","review":"You might miss the main points of the subject reading only this book. It is comprehensive in scope but lacks insightful explanations so that major concepts don't appear clearly.

I expect more given the high prices of technical books since I paid $52!As a student I certainly disagree with what the instructors who give the book a 5 have to say about the book!

However, it does not quite explain the material as well as some of the other books on the market. Now, if this is your primary text for GD&T application from a design standpoint, immediately file this one in the nearest garbage can and consider: Dimensioning & Tolerancing Handbook by Drake (probably the one to get if you only get one text because it is very comprehensive...even includes stack-up calculations), GD&T Fundamentals by Krulikowski, or Design Dimensioning and Tolerancing by Wilson (this one and the one by Drake are really done with the design application in mind).

This book has become a rare gem. It is very hard to find and probably out of print these days. The high price tag on the paperback edition are understandable for these reasons. What I do not understand, however, is charging almost the same amount for the Kindle edition! The book is seriously no thicker than a pencil!

The T & A was mundane too, something like teens might want to see. The only way a person could enjoy this movie is to be so drunk they don't know what's going on, since I don't drink I didn't enjoy it.

It stays loyal to the comic, as in the characters are all drawn the same way, the plot's the same (unlike the live-action movie;but it's still good), and all the chracters' attitudes are the same. I believe it was directed by Todd McFarlane (creater), so you can see why.

This movie (cartoon) is a perfect portrayal of the comic book series Spawn. It contains the style, the mood, maybe not the same appearances of characters (mostly Cogliastro) but still it is almost exact which is great. And since it is an HBO cartoon, it needs to be an adult cartoon with bad language, violence and animated nudity.

However, elements of that essential Hoeg charm we know and love surface continually throughout the novel. We are continually amazed at that ability of his to disregard reality and to enter his own strange world of twisted time, obsessive compulsives and the Danish social consience. This book takes longer than most to get your teeth into, but it's worth the effort. You finish feeling as if you've just enjoyed a long and fascinating stroll through turn of the century Denmark with a chatty and just a little bit mad child by your side, whispering things and occasionally sending you jolts of misery.

In reality Baker is a so-so athlete who happened to convince the Bakersfield team to let him tag along so he could write this book. I'm not saying the whole book is a lie. But we need to face the facts that Baker is a big star in his mind. He also exaggerated conditions surrounding his medical predicament. He would like to have everyone believe he is a studly athlete.

Cheaper quality than expected, and somewhat difficult to assemble (holes didn't line up appropriately).

I've always gotten expansion packs to go along with every game addition. I don't know why I didn't pay closer attention but I bought this thinking it would play with my Sims 2 collection. It does NOT! So I am very disappointed because I am not sure what the point is of these 'stories' (Life and Pet) are. Why would I want to have to play something that I cannot customize and am limited to when I could buy the full game and play it with the other additions. If you do not know what I am talking about then you do not own any of the Sims2 full-version games - ie, Deluxe or Nightlife, ect. So, I guess if you've never played Sims before or do not have any of the Sims collections (if you do not then how would you know if you like it) so maybe if those are your cases then it might be worth the money.

I can't say enough ...","review":"Beyond the wonderful writing, there is amazing plot, divided loyalties, real emotions, intrigue, always unexpected twists, realistic problems filled with drama. I loved this book as much as Robb's previous 'Owen Archer' novels.The way in which this author manages to convey the thoughts and myriad of motivations behind her characters never ceases to amaze me. Everyone is so real with their own loyalties, and their own interests. Even Owen and Lucie's relationship is made all the more special to this reader because of the true way in which the author conveys their own doubts sometimes about each other, sometimes about themselves. I am enchanted by Wales and Owen's roots there. I'm intrigued by St. David's and the Welsh history of the time.I can't wait to read the next book.

For instance, I follow the instruction for Thousand Island dressing, but make substitutions and end up with a dressing which is fat-free and tastes delicious without the chemical aftertaste of mass-produced big name brands.Of course, there's more to the book than food recipes. It's a great help when you need a cleaning product and can't get to a store or don't want to go.

Mr. Newton, an ordained Minister, attempts to explain the moral teachings behind Masonry. Accurate in most of his explanations, but a bit dry.

A must read for the Masonic collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"I purchased this burner because of the price. When I installed it, it doesn't fit flush with the range top.

These chair pads don't have the annoying ties on the chairs. These pads stay on the chair with no problems and they are very comfortable. The only cosmetic down side is that the rubber backing comes up kindove high where the pad meets the back of the chair so you can see the backing. For me this was a small price to pay for quality and comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"misses the mark","review":"I expected to be thrilled by this novel about neo-Nazis and their attempts to gain power using the spear that pierced the side of Christ, but it was an effort to work my way through this novel. I believe it's focus is too narrow-- it's missing a sense of international intrigue that you would get from a good spy novel, or a sense of awe that you would get from a novel that knows something about the occult. In short, it needed to have opened up a bit more, to have a more global perspective on what are basically earth-shaking events. It doesn't help that some of the action scenes are a bit awkward, either. An adequate time-killer, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song title?","review":"What is the song playing while Anthony is driving Ben? He is talking to the the Doctor'sAshes.

There is no more guess work, its easy, well worth the money. It saves time, and gives moms piece of mind. I do have to say it took several practice times to get it right. You have to have the device positioned in the ear canal. And if you dont, it will give inconsistent reading or say there is no fluid.

Her album is one the best I have ever heard. The people out there are just stupid if you do not cop this. Every track is stupendous. A singer's singer is what she is. I would love to sing backup with her. The reason I know so much about her is because every cd I own has her backing these up.

It's a real album with real music and real lyrics, something sorely missing in today's booyt calling music era.

Lists and lists of all the things the husband should try to remember to do (fine if you have no job or other commitments). His position seems to be that if the husband does ALL the right things for LONG enough, the woman will respond like a puppy dog. I'm sorry, women were born into sin just like men and can be just as rebellious and obstinate as men can. A marriage is a relationship between TWO people and is only as CHRISTIAN as the two individuals in the marriage choose to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only He Knew Review","review":"This book completely allows a man to look at the world-love, marriage, children, relationships-through the eyes of a woman.

Some of the things he did to his wife are on the border of unbelievable. His poor behavior has given him the theory that everything that is wrong in your marriage is YOUR (the man's) fault. Think I'm kidding? I'm not. He says that everything that is wrong in your marriage can be traced back to something you did/didn't do. While it is important to take responsibility for your actions, I think he has taken it too far.Despite this shortcoming, there are quite a few good insights in the book. I would recommend it, but read it with an entire shaker of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!!","review":"Gary Smalley was obviously a horrible husband in the early years of his marriage to a wonderful woman. He later repented, and now he assumes that all women are wonderful and all men are horrible.

However, if you want to have a Godly, fulfilling marriage, try \\"His Needs, Her Needs\\" by Willard Harley"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only He Knew","review":"Gary Smalley has the unique insight gained only by the assistance of the Holy Spirit - to understand the way a woman thinks and responds to her husband's attention or lack thereof. Although the book is primarly written for the man to read - it so struck me with the fact that there is a man who does understand how I feel and what makes me \\"tick\\". I also learned valuable lessons in dealing with my children - helping them to understand why it is vital that we honor and respect one another - preparing them for adulthood - and becoming a Godly spouse. He places the responsiblity of the welfare of the family and condition of the marriage - squarely on the shoulders of the husband - something I've not heard before - but rather, the preception has been it's \\"up to the woman\\".

Among other things I cut back drastically on the amount of time and money spent on hobbies and kept it up for years, like Smalley said. I watch little TV and follow no professional sports. I am home nearly every weekend. Followed his advice and it still wasn't enough. Smalley makes a few good points into the psychology of the female mind but he completely liberates them (no pun intended) from any real responsibility in the relationship. The used copies for under a dollar might be worth it but don't waste any more than that.I am spending more time and money on hobbies again.

It seems to me that most of the bands just mutilated the songs. That's why I was surprised to see that many 4 and 5 star reviews! Also, my one last complaint is that the bands don't always sing the exact same lyrics as the original, yet they include the original lyrics with the CD, so it's kind of hard to sing along with.

Tension builds, anticipation that something is about to happen...but then nothing does. Oh wait, there were about 5 or so moments in the film when \\"something\\" happens -- with all but one just a literal flash on the screen, and then more nothingness. An utter waste of time.

Any chance dudes, really, any chance. Another annoying effect is the digital film fuzzies added as if to suggest you are watching someones old school Kodak home movie shot on film and not the high tech, motion activated, every room in the house digital surveillance system.

I was actually surprised at how good they sounded. So were my neighbors. (They have ordered a pair) The only thing I don't like is the connection - which is a piece of cable with + and - leads coming out off the bottom of the speaker.

I am a huge fan of Mcginly's other work starring Karl Wiedergott \\"The Truth about Juliet\\".

No real characters, just cliche's, absolutely no direction whatsoever, nothing is achieved visually just a bunch of talking heads that fail to convince us of anything else except what fools we were for watching this film.

Because the premise sounded promising and the cast was decent, I gave this title a try. Mistake! BIG MISTAKE! The film is a random compilation of pointless scenes, dwelling on the melodramatic life of Paul Rudd, who because he failed as an actor, wants to kill himself.

There was little S & M but a lot of mingling between nuns and soldiers, and other combinations considered inaccessible and part of fantasies. As with most Taschen books, it was well documented and printed in a high quality fashion. I liked it for the art and also for the historical significance of male-female desire and copulating.

If you can get past the first section (Queen of Hearts) the last two are more entertaining. I found myself actually wanting to find out the mystery behind Terra Viridian's Visions. There isn't really a payoff at the end and a relationship between two characters is never fully explored.

Anyway, if I had it to do all over again, I would've spent that 90 minutes pulling out my toenails. Seriously. Don't bother with this one, unless you are completely drunk and want to watch a stupid comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steaming pile of crap!","review":"[...]. That dude either has some personal interest in this stinkfest, or he doesn't know horror (possibly both).I could compose an endless tirade on how incredibly awful this piece of dung is, but, even that could not prepare the viewer adequately.Leave this one alone, and if you happen to see it in your local video store, point and laugh hysterically at the package as you walk by.A couple of decent boob shots is not worth the cost of the time you'll waste screaming at your television over this one, trust me. It really doesn't even rate the one star that I gave it, but, that's the lowest grade I was allowed to give."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffalo Soldiers The Movie Was Buffalo Chips The Let Down","review":"In a word, the movie stunk. The music stunk. The acting stunk. If it was adapted from the novel, you certainly couldn't tell it. The novel was really a good story. I would suggest buying the book if you're interested in entertainment and buying the DVD if you want to fertilize your garden. P.U.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book - no refund","review":"I ordered this book and got some weird novel with a badger pictured on the front of it instead. I immediately emailed the company that sent it through amazon and after several weeks they finally responded saying they don't know how it happened and found no trace of the premarital counseling book I truly ordered. They said they'd credit my money back but I don't see any credits this month on my credit card statement so that has yet to happen. Hope my marriage doesn't fail as much as this company did since I never got my premarital counseling book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This is the most useless collection of questions in any book I've read intended for engaged or dating couples. The questions are very surface level, very superficial, and an entire waste of time. Who cares which snack food you like or what color carpet you want for your future home? This will not help you decide if the two of you are compatible. These preferences can change over time. This is all in addition to the fact that these questions are written from the perspective of a female, in feminine language, that is flowery and old-fashioned. I can't imagine your average male enjoying this book at all. I expected to find at least one good chapter in this book, but did not. I much prefer \\"Don't You Dare Get Married Until You Read This!\\" and \\"the hard questions: 100 Essential Questions to Ask Before you Say 'I Do.'\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a serious book for relationships","review":"I bought this book in preparing for a more serious relationship.

Get this CD; it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average, not that hot","review":"The scenes in GGW: Girl Power vol.2 are average make out scenes. There is a good club scene with two women having lots of fun. But other than that, many of the scenes are edited short where you do not see all of the girl power action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much ego, not enough art","review":"While I did enjoy several of the images of the final product and process, this film was disappointing. The processes and effects of change in nature are intrinsically interesting, but, in my opinion, this film devoted WAY too much attention to Andy Goldsworthy and not enough to nature and its interaction with his creations. I found myself fast-forwarding at 8x speed through much of the narration to get to the \\"good\\" parts. The quality of the DVD transfer was also mediocre (or maybe the original filming wasn't that good to begin with). There is no comparison to \\"Winged Migration\\" (5 stars)--at least not a favorable one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and full of the worst about art.","review":"What is wrong with nature just the way it is. The work done here is silly and makes a mockery of what nature is all about. It is also rather boring and very very slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good item for middle-aged, stoned people or second year art students","review":"This thing is way too long and renders an interesting artist boring.Far too self-involved and masterbatory. I actually liked A.G.'s work before I saw this movie. Now? Not so much. I just can't deal with people who take themselves that seriously, especially a guy who spends all day arranging twigs.The attempt at creating drama out of a dude stacking rocks is rediculous at best.Just stick to the picture books if you want to continue enjoying this artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor little Andy","review":"This is the most hilariously overrated film I've seen in recent memory. It made me laugh harder than Superbad. And the piles of lavishing praise shown in these reviews take me to an extremely cynical place with the epiphany that Art is truly a minor part of peoples' lives. Even professional film critics (paired with the \\"user comments\\" of gullible civilians like/unlike yours truly) reserve a small window for the seeming \\"fine\\" arts, and whatever cow patty splats at their feet conveniently gets awarded the quota.To be ironic and yet truthful, I highly recommend this film for some of the funniest moments in cinematic history. You will be cheering for Andy's little nature puzzles to collapse by the first quarter-hour, and when they do, it's devilish fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rivers and Tides - boring and pointless","review":"I have watched this a couple of times just to be sure I wasn't missing something. But I have come to realize that this is the worse DVD on art I have seen in a long time. Its pretentious, slow, and just plain boring. Either I was watching something quite different from the other reviewers or they are simply part of the the 'me too' art crowd that thinks they are suppose to find this drival uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art?","review":"Oh man, I just sat through this thing...yes it's beautiful, yes it is 'ART'but listen to this guys explanations of his 'ART' man, man, I don't even know what to say...I guess the other 5 five star reviewers will be glad to tell me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the movie, hated the DVD","review":"I saw this at the local art house and it was a fantastic experience. If you can see this in a theatre, do so. I'm sorry to report that the DVD is garbage. First of all, it's letterboxed, which isn't indicated on the Amazon page or the DVD packaging. But far worse than that is the quality of the transfer. It looks as if it had been dubbed off of VHS tape--low resolution, blurry, and exhibiting a ton of compression artifacts. I can't believe no other reviewers have commented on this. Save your money or buy one of the many books of his amazing work instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable and deeply original art","review":"Whether shown in still photos or film, Goldsworthy's art is stunning. This DVD captures not only the process through which Goldsworthy makes his pieces, but also to what extent the ephemerality of many of his works is part of the art. As in the books of still photographs of his work, the seamlessness in which Goldsworthy integrates graphical and geometric forms into organic settings comes across quite nicely.This DVD came highly recommended from a friend, and I must pass on that recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sweetest thing you'll ever see","review":"A nice, self-effacing guy, with a wonderful sensibility & sensitivity, playing gently with beautiful landscapes. Not flashy or spectacular, but stunning and thought-provoking. Watch it when you want to relax, when you need inspiration, when you need some hope for mankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous DVD transfer","review":"I must agree with one of the previous reviewers. I love the film but the quality of the DVD transfer is terrible. The picture itself is widescreen, but they transferred it in 4:3 format. So if you have a normal 4:3 tv you'll get black bars on top and bottem. If your tv is widescreen, as mine, then you'll get black bars on the sides as well. What kind of moron did they hire to do the DVD transfer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad art ...","review":"I used to be an artist. \\"Work\\" like this is the reason I can't be associated with the scene any more. If there is any value to this movie, it is laughing at the ridiculous prattle of this guy describing his \\"art\\". The scenery is pretty at times. Spoiler Alert! Rugged guy braves the elements and arranges driftwood in a circle -- near another circle (which nature made - very profound). Or rocks. That's the general theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andy Goldsworthy - an amazing inspiration","review":"From the minute this video starts until it is over, the inspiration is endless. This honestly changed my 16 year old boy's view on life. He talks about this at least once a week and tells all of his friends about this artist and how amazing he is. If it can impress a 16 year old THAT much, it has to be good! And it is. Savor it. Digest it. Be inspired. Immerse yourself in it. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"From reviews online and quoted reviews from reputable newspapers I really expected good things from this. However, the film quality was very poor - just about the opposite of \\"high definition\\". The narration was patchy and conveyed little.Best thsat could be said of this was that it is \\"whimsical\\" - that is the most polite way of putting it that I can think of.Sam"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Rivers & Tides","review":"A magnificent collage of Goldworthy's works that present and frame natural objects in a new light. One of only two DVDs I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast for Your Eyes","review":"Andy Goldsworthy is a brilliant installation artist. Most of his works are transient and subtle in their beauty. This documentry, narriated by Goldsworthy, shows the process and some of the beauty of his works. His materials are limited to the natural elements he finds on site, but not limited by his constantly evolving vision, as he manipulates rocks, leaves, drift wood and earth to create amazing art. If you are an artist or appreciate the creative spirit, you will be amazed and pleased by this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous","review":"This DVD is simply marvelous. To be able to watch this master artist at work is a once in a lifetime experience. Everyone should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This is a visually stunning video, but the art is very confusing at first. Impermanent creations made in nature out of ice, driftwood and sheep's wool are time-consuming to create and sometimes seem pointless, but the end results are breathtaking. Perfectly-shaped eggs made of piled stones seem to be the sturdiest of his creations, but the entire processes he goes through to create these images are amazing to watch. How does he think of these things? Incredible!Andy Goldsworthy's discussion of his art is a special glimpse into the mind of an artist, and the video is well-worth watching. Just don't be in a hurry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"The film is a work of art about a great artist. The way the artist captures the personality of each element he works with is magic, there is something more than the intellect at work here. The bigger the screen one has for viewing these wonders the more you will be overwhelmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"nature at its best percieved and moulded through art","review":"A wonderful documentary, insightful and truly beautiful and unique. Andy Goldworthy's work is inspirational and magnificent. An artist who is one with nature and reminds us of the true beauty of the world and shows us how to view the world around us with a wonderful an new perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"An artist unlike any you've ever seen. He creates works with and from nature, and understands that everything has a limited lifetime. He creates beautiful works, even though he knows they are transitory - although his stone walls may last for quite a while. I've seen those walls, and they're quite an amazing thing. If you like unique, individual works of art, you really need to see this video. He may be the most different, and maybe even the most important artist of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real story of the creative process","review":"Just the most beautiful film about a an artist whose canvas and materials are nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal look","review":"The film maker's skill matches the sensitivity of Goldsworthy - - a seamless relationship. I watch this over and over. EVERY time, I see something that startles and wonder how I could have missed it before. In this way, the DVD is an ever renewing source of jolts... the best kind. It has also become something of a barometer of my own ability to SEE, to be in the moment. My tiny TV is in front of windows that look into the forest. I often have layers of nature in front of me, real and virtual. I hope to see another DVD like this in the future. I will be first in line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding documentary!","review":"I have bought another copy of this film before---the second one was for my son who is a nature lover. He also loves to build things from leaves, twigs, rocks, etc. I thought the film would inspire him further, and I'm sure it will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Speaks for Itself","review":"I find it extremely difficult to comment on a work of art that speaks so clearly for itself, and that is precisely how I felt after watching this film. What is left to say? Only that this film moved me in an almost spiritual way. I knew very little about this artist before watching this film, and yet when I heard him describe his work, I felt as if he were speaking to me and me alone. I suspect many people who watch this movie will feel the same way. I don't know of a better definition of great art.Ken Harvey, author of \\"if you were with me everything would be all right\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"The images are astounding and watching the Andy Goldsworthy create is a little bit like reading Genesis (but Goldsworthy has the wisdom to mimic something about nature that is utterly perfect instead of creating creatures \\"in his image!\\"). After watching it I went for a long hike alone and looked at shapes made by water, wind and rock. Godlsworthy seems born with an eye for the miraculous and I felt perhaps this is something that can be learned. Something about watching his creative process unfold leaves one breathless, but also more alive than before, and eager to see and do what one can to be connected with the Earth as much as Goldsworthy is. This is inspiring work and the film makers captured images as well as a glimpse of this great artists soul with a subtle passion that is perfect for the subject matter. I'll watch this one repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic and interesting","review":"a great way to think about the earth, art, and combining your thoughts with nature. watching this is a good idea for younger people in celebration of Earth Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your hard-earned money","review":"These cables are junk, short in Left channel cable fresh out of package-cutting in and out with horrible crackling sound and finally quit altogether.

Lynn Harris novel. I bought it because it was the only African American fiction at the airport I was in at the time. I completely finished the book over the course of my roundtrip flights, so it is definitely a page turner. Light, easy reading to take your mind off things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, okay- not the best, but its worth savouring","review":"This is only my second E. Lynn Harris book, and I must say that the theme of queers in the black church is one that many authors could play with in the near furture a bit more. It's a very compelling and potentially controversial theme- \\"Grade A\\" soil for an earth-shaking novel. His tasty character development shows that this man is a \\"Grade A\\" writer. I love the humor that Harris weaves into the book, especially with the flamboyant and fabulous Skylar. The characters are four-dimensional and the twist are golden- up until the end. I don't think that Harris fumbled the ending, but rather \\"juggled it\\" too much. Other than the \\"unexpected\\" ending- Harris has given a taste worth savouring- Again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Sad...","review":"To put it simply, E. Lynn is capable of doing better than this. I have purchased each of his books and enjoyed them all immensely (except Not a Day Goes By), but this, this was just plain TIRED!!! Everything about this book was lacking. I just didn't like this piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This One!","review":"Having read all of Mr. Harris' prior novels I anxiously awaited this new endeavor. Needless to say, I was quite excited to finally get a copy in my hands. As in his previous works E.LH pleases his readers with a well written story with many strong characters. (There is even a visit from Basil Henderson and Yancey B for Harris' die hard fans). Many of the customer reviews already written on this page tell you what the story is about and they are accurate in their reporting. So I guess I will just tell you that you can't miss with \\"I Say A Little Prayer\\" or any of the other E. Lynn Harris books! A good solid quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those who can DO - those who can't TEACH...E.Lynn, make the writing sabbatical permanent!","review":"I waited for this as if I was a child on Christmas day - and it was so disappointing. The store was a slow start, his characters were boring, his focus was lost (did someone else write this?) and much of what I read seemed like the \\"pc\\" thing to do now that he is teaching. I have been here front row from the very beginning, buying the books as soon as they arrived on the shelf- I should've saved my money on this one, and checked it out from the library, maybe then I wouldn't have been so disappointed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay Not really worth the Wait","review":"Compared to his previous novels I expected a lot more from this one. This book was just okay and the plot really wasn't believable. I've noticed a definite change in his writing style with this novel. I hope he does better with his next novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece - plain and simple!!!","review":"Amazing!!! I Love how E.Lynn Haris keeps his readers up to date on all of his charaters. There is no one he won't touch with this novel. I was truely blessed by this fragile subject matter. \\"Does my love for God go away because I love men?\\" There are so many black men in churches all over the country wondering if God truely loves them. What if I like being BI sexual? Can I still live a life blessed by God? Harris, says yes!! Why not? When you think of all the young people in your church, ask yourself the same question.This was a funny, endearing, supersing, and well thought out piece of life. HOLD ON, and Enjoy the ride!! You won't believe who you'll see along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Much is True?","review":"Even though this novel is pure fiction, it seeks to shed light on lifestyle secrets often hidden behind a cloak of religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as expected","review":"Great book, ELH is a genius with a pen.

Excellent! Excellent! Love the book it is a page turner until the last page. E. Lynn Harris has done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good read","review":"The style is classic E. Lynn Harris. Great cast of characters. It's difficult to put the book down. A wonderful book for your summer reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hesitant to give 5 stars","review":"First and foremost I am a hugh ELH fan. Had this one preordered and could not wait to get it. Its been way too long of a wait! I have to admit that I was disappointed. It was too quick of a read. While it is close to 300 pages, the book itself is small so it felt like 150. And while ELH tackled a topic that is too often swept under the rug, it left me wanting much much more. I could just be needing another Basil and Raymond book, but I was still hungry after reading the last page. It left too many questions open for me. I am still a huge fan though!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, great topic","review":"This is one of my favs by E. Lynn Harris.

Lynn, What Happened to your writing style?","review":"I have ALL of E. Lynn Harris' books and this is the WORST one ever. He flaunted the homosexual lifestyle of his main character in such a way that this book should have NOT been sold in ANY decent book store.He strayed far away from his usual writing style. He should have written this for a trash magazine.I doubt if I purchase any more of his books. This was a waste of my money and time reading. I am really disappointed in him. I thought he had more class than that!Please don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"I read 'The Sandy Bottom Orchestra', by Garrison Keillor and Jenny Lind Nilsson, a few months ago. It's a beautiful, witty book, and very funny. So, as you can imagine, I was delighted to find that there was also a movie version of it, and hastened to get it.What a disappointment! The movie was sappy beyond words--much of the humor was taken out and replaced with bad acting; it was entirely predictable. I was horrified. It seemed impossible to make hash of a book that thoroughly, but the director of 'The Sandy Bottom Orchestra' certainly did.In short: whether you have or have not read the book, do not see this movie. It is cliched and tiresome and it will not be enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Watching and Listening","review":"I enjoyed this immensely!

Tracks that I was impressed with the most were the rocking \\"Going Down\\", the awesome \\"Deep Inside\\", \\"Hold On\\", and the instrumental \\"Believer\\". Basically, just all around good British psychedelic pop. Some might say this CD drones more so than other Sundial releases - still a true keeper, all the way. Should appeal to fans of Spiritualized, Spacemen 3, Ride, My Bloody Valentine and possibly the Creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah blah blah","review":"I know Steve Heller's work and hence I was eager to read this book. But it bored me to tears, and I put it down after reading a couple of repetitive, overly personally detailed chapters. I think anyone who got this book thinking they'd gain real insight into how to become an art director and how to be an effective one will be disappointed. This was a poorly conceptualized book that is full of personal ramblings about various people who have been art directors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earring Review","review":"The earrings got in there in time and were packaged just fine.

I hadn't sharpened them since I bought them and the honing just wasn't doing it anymore. I shopped around and found this item at my local hardware store for TWICE the price, so I bought mine here on Amazon.I agree with one of the other reviewers on the size - they are a little small for full size knives, requiring the user to work just a little bit harder. This is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.This sharpening system got my knives razor sharp - literally. I was able to shave hair from my forearm with my Santoku after sharpening with this product. The kit is well made, with the plastic parts being very thick and durable - I expect it to last a while.Because the base is smooth and flat, I recommend putting it down on something non stick (I used a damp towel) when sharpening larger knives, it helped a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp!","review":"I had a tri-hone \\"like: three stone sharpner years ago and now I have one again.

The Tri-Hone set takes that issue away by putting them all in one easy to work with little dude. This set's design is awesome for the fact the stones are never sit on a surface, so drying excess oil or water off is easy. Each side is clearly marked so it is really hard to get confused. I got to say if you are in the market for a new set of Arkansas sharping stones try these out."},{"rating":"2","title":"no issues, just wish for non-slip base","review":"No issues with the stones. The only thing I would change is putting some kind of rubber on the bottom of the base so it wouldn't move around when sharpening. I guess I'm probably push harder than I should, but a plastic base on a solid surface just is going to slip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier to use than expected","review":"I never really had much faith in my ability to sharpen a knife using stones like the ones contained in this set. I was wrong, however, because it's just not that hard to use a set like this. I was able to sharpen 4 knives in less than hour while watching TV.Buying a quality set like this is the way to go. I have a diamond honing steel, a regular honing steel, and a Magic Fingers set. None of those are really work for sharpening (I know the steels aren't supposed to, but the magic fingers set is). So I would take my knives to a professional about twice a year, which set me back $30/visit. I am going to save a ton of money and lose very little time with this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put an edge on a butter knife.","review":"Or at least close enough. I use this tool to maintain both my professional knives for work and collection at home. I've used it on knives with varying degrees of sharpness and bevel- and all come out razor sharp. As mentioned in the other reviews, the base's grip can be a little dangerous or annoying - however the problem was solved with either a wet towel or a rubber grip mat. I was used to a much larger tri-stone when I received this one, but adapting to the smaller size wasn't such a big deal. Completely satisfied with this product, especially for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they used to be.","review":"The quality of this product has gone down dramatically over the years. I bought this item 24 years ago the first time and it was great. When I got it this time it was only one step above being pure crap!!! The stones were so cheap that they were bumpy on top, and the side edges actually crumbled away somewhat when used. the stones seem fake and manmade like corse porous cement. I guess it's a little better than scraping your knife across a brick. P.S. I also purchsed the 4 sided Dan's whet stone, it was excellent, like night and day. Highly recomend that one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small to be of use","review":"This product reminds me of the 6 inch monoliths from Spinal Tap.

It is big enough for larger blades. I purchased it to sharpen my clipper blades and it worked wonders. It is very easy to use and versatile. Great product. Very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality item","review":"All three stones on the item I received are not flat. Not only are they not level surfaces, the surfaces actually have bumps. This item would destroy a knife edge rather than sharpen it. Yes it is possible to flatten stones but you're better off avoiding this product all together.Also, it comes with only about 1 tablespoon of honing solution. How cheap! Don't buy more from Smith's, make your own, it's easy and you can find instructions online.Overall I suggest you avoid this product. I bought it trying to save money- instead I wasted money. If you're just looking to sharpen knives, take a look at the Spyderco Sharpmaker. Otherwise, if you are looking for something that can sharpen chisels and plane irons as well as knives, I suggest a course/medium DMT diamond stone and a fine Japanese waterstone. More expensive, yes, but you won't be throwing your money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted","review":"I recieved this package 2 days later than I was supposed to, the oil bottle was busted all over the box and I had to throw it away, and two of the stones were chipped!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Still Can't Believe the Price!","review":"As many others have mentioned on here, for the price, you are getting a 5-star product. Sure, there are better sharpening tools out there, but you will pay a lot more for them. The positives about the Smith's tri-stone sharpener are that it is very portable, light, well-built (sturdy/solid), and best of all--it does the job.The only negative thing that I've got to say about this product is that I wish the stone surface were a little larger. It works great for smaller knives, and absolutely perfect for chisels, but it is a little too small for larger chef's knives, santokus, and other large knives.Overall, I love how you get three different stones (fine, medium, and coarse) all in one lightweight, and very portable--not to mention, well built--product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment","review":"My mother got this for me, as a gift, and its amazing.

They were two years old (already). So I called Entirely Pets, explained and was told that they did have six month old product they would ship. They shipped but the mfg date was the same as the two year old bottle I had already received. So either the re-order person or shipping forgot what the issue was.So called Entirely Pets again, they shipped me a label to return both bottles to them.

Our active 12 year old English Setter suddenly started losing it at night--moaning, barking, pacing, scratching the floor while turning in circles. I took him to the vet who told me about canine dementia and recommended a sedative which didn't really help and made him groggy into the next day. It was scary and sad. I felt hopeful when I read the experiences of others, and after giving our dog 2 pills a day, he too had no symptoms by the end of the week. I got a great price here and it arrived quickly.

The code, M630, was the same but they ranged from .021-.035. This minor difference was not detrimental; I'm just saying.Strike 2: Out of the box, the second heaviest string (what would tune to a G on a baritone uke) was unraveled about 4 inches from the end. I just cut it off and strung my uke like normal, since it was still long enough.Strike 3: After playing the strings regularly for only 10 days, I noticed a buzz on one of my lower strings. Sure enough, it had come unraveled at the sixth fret and was rubbing against the metal fret bar.Had these strings been more expensive or bought at a local shop, I would have demanded my money back. Since they were bought on Amazon for only $5, I felt it wasn't worth the hassle. I will never buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT all \\"Crystal\\" or \\"Clear Fluorocarbon\\" strings","review":"These are NOT all \\"Clear Fluorocarbon\\" strings as implied and printed right on the box (picture on Amazon differs from box I got).

I bought my strings at a local store, and they put them on for free, so I'm not going to return them, but in less than 2 weeks the G string at the 2nd fret started to unravel. It's also starting to split and unravel down at the 4th and 5th frets too. I will never buy Martin strings again because of this. I realize that these strings are a little more frail than guitar strings, but honestly, 2 weeks of moderate play? Unfortunately, these have lasted longer than the Aquilas, and that is WITH the unraveling. I went to play one day with the Aquilas on and the whole thing had just shredded about 5-6 inches down the fretboard. Is there any decent baritone uke strings out there???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to get the cheap crap","review":"Thought I would upgrade and get Martins. I have a half a dozen ukes of varying sizes and styles. Purchased 2 sets.Total crap. Buzzing, breaking. The two sets lasted a total of 17 days. Total waste of money.Went down to the local store and got some cheap plastic crap. Have had those on the big banjolele now for 3 months with no trouble at all. Will stick to those."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fast paced thriller","review":"Black Fire by James Kidman was a fast paced and gripping thriller, probably one of the best I read all year. Kidman tells the story in three ways, through the past and the present and the main character's journal. Now a journal may not sound interesting or scary, but hearing this anguished and tortured character's thoughts in his own words, just days after something so traumatic it isn't explained until the end of the book, really got under my skin.The story moves quickly after a few slow chapters that introduce the cast, and I found both the past and the present material intriguing enough that I read this in one sitting. The ending caught me off guard, and I have to admit that I went back to read the book a second time just to see all the clues I missed. It definitely messed with my head a bit!I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best introduction to the Sovereignty of God","review":"RC Jr's writing style is clear and fun. This book presents God's sovereignty over everything in a clear and easy to read format.

Keep in mind this DVD was mastered off a 2nd or 3rd generation VHS tape and the video and audio quality is not first class.

In Faithful the chorus and hook have a lot of soul. In the Corner Common exhibits lyrical dominance and supremacy, making so many words rhyme that your head will spin.

It's actually a beautiful album in that it's not that demanding or complicating a topical level but as you listen to it more and more you get something more and deeper, I would say it appreciates, which is what real hiphop and real lyricists and real music does. It's like Reference Music. As you grow and experience and your perception changes you look at the same things and see(hear) them differently(true timeless art that is) and this album is definitely timeless. If your wondering about the past,present or future of hiphop then check this album out.

Kayne is a good fit but I would like to hear some twist & turns on the production from some other cats. \\"The Corner\\" is another stand out just because of that loop, very crispy.

Not that the Electric Circus was not good but, BE feels much more common don't you think? This album is very solid.

I thought there would be perhaps some more tracks on the final album cut because it was leaked early. However despite this disapointment, this album ranks right up there with the best hip hop has had to offer over the years. Again Common provides his listeners with a wide range of topics that deal with everyday life, and not the fairy tales we see in music videos today. Quite simply Common delivers and hooking up with Kanye West wasn't a bad touch either.

Too many songs bragging about this and that. This album is like a story. It's uplifting, funny, and always intelligent. Common sounds like he is having a conversation with you in some of the songs, while at other times narrating the plight of an African American man of his generation. One of the things that I look for in an album is would I rather just listen to a few songs, or listen to it all the way through. This is the latter.

This occurs when copying from a Video_TS folder... what you have to do when you have only one cd drive (iMac). Customer support was some of the worst i've ever experienced; the whole gamut: bad english, accusing me of trying to violate copyright, short non-sensical solutions: \\"change permissions\\" and then closing the help ticket without resolution. Do yourself a favor a buy a different program. Many people recommend \\"Toast\\", also from Roxio. i am cautiously thinking about trying it.

Toast will handle more dvd authoring formats, but Popcorn 2 has unique portable player file conversions. If you use any portable video player or are thinking of getting one, this program is for you. I have tried some smaller shareware type programs to do compression. However i noticed that POP2 produces sharper, better looking video with its compression. I noticed there is a drop in price for the program, welcome news since we need so many media specific programs now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use but could be better","review":"a fairly simple program to use. i would like to change and add some features.

I have used Toast 5 and 6 and found them both to be well thought out applications. Aside from compressing (and therefore reducing the quality of) video to fit on a 1 hour DVD (unnecessary if you have a dual layer burner) I can't see much you can do with Popcorn that you can't already do with iLife or Toast. It is very frustrating that the .mov, mpeg 4 and other such file formats can only be used when you are transferring to a portable. Dropping those file formats into the program when you want to burn a DVD produces an error message.

This book isn't so much a \\"let's set the record straight for once and for all\\" - it's a recollection of a memories and anecdotes. While I would have preferred something more hard-hitting and decisive, I enjoy any book that deals with this period, especially if it's by someone who was there. You still have to figure in the hidden agendas of people who write memoirs like this but nevertheless, this is still a worthwhile read.

But I am glad I started reading it!I read the stories a few a day. They were very inspiring and thought-provoking! The guys in the stories are not some magical people with halos around their heads. They have their feet planted firmly on the ground. The way the authors have dealt with the psychological and emotional aspects of the characters makes it very pleasurable reading. You are drawn into the narrative.Take Mira Bai's story for instance. I saw the lady saint in a completely different light after reading the story. She is not just an ecstatic singer, but a woman who stood by her convictions despite enormous political, social, economical turmoil around her.Very relevant reading for the times that we are in!

They've hit equilibrium somewhere between longing and whimsy, and have tossed in a bit of the (personally) political to prevent themselves from floating away entirely. If this seems cozy, it definitely is, but it's never too cloying.

I had already seen the film at the show and I liked it a little. The film is not your average. There is alot of campiness and just bland humor. I mean it is not really funny. It is more sick with people getting their fingers chopped off and everything. I was surprised that so many top rate actors starred in this movie like Casey Affleck, Danny DeVito, Neve Campbell, Jamie Lee Curtis and Bette. Overall, a decent movie. It's supposed to be a \\"mystery\\" but only buy if you are a fan of any of these stars or just like campy movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"Not a bad movie. Not the best, but good for a few laughs. Some of the acting is certainly questionable, but all the stars do just fine.Better Midler plays Mona Dearly, a crude, rude, short-tempered know-it-all who's hated by just about everybody in town. When she dies to obvious foul play, just about everybody she knew had a motive. Danny DeVito plays the small-town sheriff who gives it his all to do his job right. DeVito is the bright spot in this movie. Bobby was an endearing character but Casey Affleck, although he does give a lot of effort, is a terrible actor. Everybody else did a fine job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ops Miss Midler","review":"Ok, I so deprest. This Film bringing me down. Miss Midler whats going on with You???? Ok next in German.

It's one of those alternative kind of films you like to see every now and then, just to realise how bizzare it is.There were actually a few laughs included, but you sort of don't know what to think, so you just sit there with a puzzled look on your face. It was good how everyone's stories conflicted so much, and were so biased, that you knew everyone was full of carp.Danny Devito didn't make use of his sense of humour, but SNL's Will Ferrell did, so that wasn't too bad. Casey Affleck was quite irritating but I guess he was meant to be.

The big names chosen for this movie (DeVito, Midler, Curtiss) are not enough to keep \\"Drowning Mona\\" from drowning. The only winner in this movie seems to be the Yugo automobile makers who seem to have created a movie-length advertisement. With only a rare exception EVERYONE in town drives a Yugo. Save your money, don't buy this movie. Rent it only if you are planning on running it for background noise--you won't miss anything by not watching it.

Here we have a movie plot that has big potential to become a great movie: Mona Dearly, a widely hated, rude, piggish, stupid, and annoying lady, drives her car over a cliff. Police suspect foul play, but seems as though everyone's a suspect- too many people hate her. Even her own son and husband.However, the actual movie was horrible. I repeat: Drowning Mona was horrible. Confusing flashbacks combined with mediocre acting and strange turnings of events have made me suffer through more than an hour and a half of wishing the movie was over. And then it didn't even have a good ending. The ending was confusing, unlikely, and left you hanging.Summary? I hated this movie. I don't see how anyone with a morsel of maturity and good sense would enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Bad, Not that Good.","review":"Not as bad as some people have made it out to be but it's not as good as some people had made it. The whole movie is really one very long joke, that has some very funny parts in it. Most of those parts really belongs to Neve Campbell, who steals this movie with her great performace, and William Fincher, who's performace as Mona's dead beat husban had me rolling in my seat. Other than them, Most of the actors realy don't come off that well, and the movie itself stalls about half way in.It's a good rental, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I don't understand what went wrong with this movie. You take a really talented cast a very funny premise and you come up with this. Mona Dearly was hated by all. Everyone has a motive, But it's not that hard to figure out Who really did it. With all of the characters this could have been a lot more fun. The ending is absolutly tacked on as if to say it was reshot later and tacked on to try to save a confusing mess, Which isn't that confusing. All in all Drowning Mona Is not Terrible but a huge dissapointment. The Disc itself has some good extra stuff,but wouldn't it be nice to say that about the film?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that funny","review":"Great cast, somehow not quite either with the material, or the material wasn't for them (probably not for anybody for that matter).

It is not remotely funny and the tired visual jokes only provoke a feeling of embarrassment for the actors involved in this turkey. Unfortunately, I watched this movie one week after viewing Magnolia, another waste of time. These two movies have degraded contemporary film writing and direction more than Ed Wood could have ever done in his lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"edging rapidly for five stars","review":"I didn't expect much when I purchased this. I had just flipped through a very bad movie and put this while debating turning off the DVD. It was funny. It was well done. It was enjoyable. Big one... I was glad I spent the money on it.The style of filming was similar to a documentary on site. After I adjusted to that thought the movie flowed. As stated by others it is dark but not as dark as they could have made it. In the DVD edition they show edited scenes. They could have gone darker and used those scenes and others retaining the comedy. That is the main reason I won't give it a five. It had the potential to be much more than what they produced esp with the actors they had. A second watching is great for catching things you missed.

I do agree with one of the descriptions in an earlier review regarding Casey Affleck's acting. He annoyed the hell out of me.

However, the story which made the book such a delight has been sliced and diced so that the wonder of the story telling has very literally been lost in the translation. I found it very difficult to development any sympathy for the characters that I so loved in the book, which is sad since the first rate actors playing the parts had a very difficult script to work with.

It didn't feel short. It felt long. It was perhaps one of the worst ideas I have ever seen for a zombie movie and I have seen almost all of them. Boring, no emotion, horrible writing, elementary shots, bad acting and even worse makeup. I can see this was made by wannabe movie makers. That is really no excuse for making people think this is a good movie when in it is a bad one. It must be one of their friends trying to help sell this piece of garbage. Two thumbs down and if I could give it a zero stars I would. This makes me want to watch zack snyders dawn of the dead it was so bad. Hope this helps you save your hard earned dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step back to 1959 in rural Virginia","review":"I picked this book from the library's new fiction shelf on a whim, and was very pleasantly surprised. McFarland does an excellent job of bringing the reader into the story - I felt like I had stepped back to 1959 and was experiencing the racial tensions of that time.The characterization is strong, although I finished the book wanting to understand more about the father and the grandfather and all the dynamics in this troubled family. In fact, a sequel with these characters would be a treat - McFarland has by no means plumbed their depths.I had never heard of the shameful school system closings that went on in the early '60s, as described here. The author's afterward explaining that those events and the instigators he used in the book were actual people added punch to an already powerful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a good read!","review":"This is a good book. Although while this is a fictional story the historical facts are quite accurate. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the 1950's and the early starts of the Civil Rights Movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the \\"format\\" for this item...","review":"This very fine film is one of many re-issued by the Warner Archive Collection on a burn-on-demand basis. This means that the DVDs are burned to sell as they are ordered, rather than pressed in large quantities, as most DVDs found in shops are manufactured. Burn-on-demand discs do not have a silvery flip side; they have a purplish or bluish hue.It should also be noted here, for Amazon customers wishing to trade-in this or any of the other Warner Archive Collection DVD titles through Amazon's buy back program, that the purchasing agent located in Hudson, New Hampshire, does not consider burn-on-demand DVDs to be a correct format and will return them to the seller. This, despite their inclusion of a \\"trade-in\\" link on virtually every WAC DVD title listed on the Amazon.com website. Expect any WAC DVD titles to be returned to you, if you attempt to trade them in through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both sides of Bette","review":"As a great fan of Bette Davis, this was the perfect movie.

Doesn' get much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stellar performance!","review":"This is a long awaited movie in DVD format. Bette Davis plays both roles as identical twin sisters with opposite personalities superbly.

It's a must-have in your collection of Bette Davis' films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Fingered Life","review":"Bette did it first here, then did it again in Dead Ringers.

Warner however has stated it will release all of their 3d movies in 3d eventually. When this one gets a proper 3d release I will change this review to a five or four star review. Hopefully; when that happens they will do a better job , than they did on 'dial m for murder'. I saw this in 3d at amovie theatre in 1982 and it looked great! It's a real classic and if you don't have a 3d player and tv then it's worth getting the blu ray. However this should have come out in 3d and 2d because 3d is the way this was shot. It was made that way and deserves a proper 3d release. John Wayne puts in one of his best performances here too. So a five star 3d movie gets a ok 2d blu ray release. When it comes out the way they filmed it I will change this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hondo - a study of a man torn between two worlds","review":"I found this movie too be a good character study for the duke. It made a conserted try at bridging the gap between the white/settlers vs. the native americans/plains indians on how they related on a one to one basis instead of the enmasse scenarios which usually occupy the screen. It made for a more entaining surprise that what was available for the times in the treatment of our native americans. I highly recommend it for its simple format and good character study over any of the fight scenes that were shown. A fine simple approach which is missing from the current lot of movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hondo classic John Wayne, classic western","review":"Hondo ranks among the best of Duke's work and is a classic among classics.

One of John Wayne's best in my opinion. One of my all time favorite westerns. I give it five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes a truly excellent western","review":"This was one of the first Duke films I saw (back in '82 on Cable TV, not in theaters in the 50's) so it shaped my thoughts of him. He gets caught and humbled by the savage indians and he spends some time in the film talking to a little boy (and the kid's mother). But in spite of therse humble elements of story he still remains larger than life as a character and presence. Excellent cinematography too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of John Wayne's greatest...","review":"....If not THE greatest.

If you like his books & you like John Wayne, how could it be wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb western","review":"Hondo is a mighty impressive film. It is that rare western that greatly succeeds on on a technical level, as well as an emotional level.John Wayne and co-star Geraldine Page have amazing chemistry, and child actor Lee Aaker is wonderful and believable as the little boy. (unlike the many phony child actors that were common in the 50s)The story closely follows the Louis L'Amour novel it was based on, and that is a big plus. It's a very mature and complex tale that is handled with confidence and grace by a great cast, crew and director.This wonderful film is yet more proof that John Wayne wasn't just an iconic \\"movie star,\\" but this man was a superb actor in all regards.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Picture Quality from this Blu Ray Version?","review":"Yes, The Movie itself is a great work but the picture quality from this Blu Ray Version shows almost no difference from that of DVD. Personally disappointed in this point very much. it doesn't seem to have the remastered process for this blu ray.

I immediately realized that what he was saying (and what he wrote in this book) is simply rehashing what Jonathan Edwards and John Piper (among others) have been saying. This book reads much like 'Desiring God' by Piper, only it lacks the theological depth and practical application that Dr. Piper presents in his book. Not only that, but Mr. Sjogren does not cite Dr. Piper or Jonathan Edwards in his presentation, when he uses some of the exact phrases and concepts that both have used before. Intellectual honesty = giving credit to whom credit is due.Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this book. Purchase 'Desiring God' by John Piper or 'Religious Affections' by Jonathan Edwards. They are both more original and VERY much more theologically minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Impact","review":"This book made quite an impact on my thinking and living. After reading it, I began to make several changes in my lifestyle that others noticed right away and inquired about. Most affected has been my prayer life which went from a 2 to a 7 on a scale of 10. My attitude towards others in work and study groups changed as I felt I better understood where they were at in their walk with the Lord so was able to more effectively communicate with them.I liked the writing style but was occasionally confused as to which author was writing a particular chapter or section and would find myself going back to check - - as they always were specific when beginning a chapter or first using \\"I\\" - - but I didn't always remember.

At first I thought it would be a great metaphoric reference and explore the curious dimensions of our \\"aspects\\" towards God but then it went into a straight-forward pietistic enjoining that left me feeling like I'd been suckered into it. I will hand to book to someone who doesn't mind that however--all in all an interesting pietistic read but it doesn't do much more than rehash old stuff. Not original as it portends to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The book was not what I expected; very religious discussions and really nothing to do with cats or dogs. Didn't even get past the first chapter, then skimmed through further and said \\"forget it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book is exactly what is wrong with the church today. In this book, these two authors go way outside Scripture and introduce the reader to more psychobable and the devastating philosophy of man. There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end is death. The end of this book is death.We cannot alter Scripture to have it fit our values. We must be transformed by the renewing of our mind.

I love this album more than any other Yanni. I represents such a dramatic change for him but it is a welcome change. I have owned this album for about 3 months and a day does not go by that I don't play it. This album actually helped me get through a 14 hour flight to Japan. I STRONGLY recommend it to all Yanni fans. Tracks 4 and 5 are special favorites for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music can free the soul.","review":"I was introduced to Yanni by my father a few years ago and at first I couldn't get with it. My thinking was to constricted and I was stuck up about the music that I listened to, only rap and R&B. But the more I heard it and listened to it, the more I began to hear more than notes and \\"weirdness.\\" I heard music. Real music for the first time. Music that means something and is something for EVERYBODY...if you are willing to open your mind. \\"If I Could Tell You\\" is just one in a long legacy of beautiful music created by Yanni. Not only does it sooth the soul, it takes you all over the world. I love it! It isn't the usual for an 18 year old but then again I'm a lot more open minded than other people my age. His music has made me more creative and stress-free. Whenever I want to be free, I put on Yanni...because beautiful music can free the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yanni that I like","review":"WOW! He is finally back, back with a bang. Great CD. I am long time Yanni fan and I have almost all of his albums. This one is among the best. I can't belive how can some people say 'compositions really were severely lacking in creativity' or 'nothing new' and such things. Why must Yanni change from CD to CD. Well, this is a change, especially after 'Tribute'. Some will say retro change but I salute it. All the tracks are great. Just listen to 'Midnight Rain', 'With an Orchid', 'Highland' and 'If I Could Tell You'. When I hear those tunes I feel like in heaven. I have this album for a few months now and it doesn't want to leave my CD player. Buy this album, you can't go wrong. Thanks Yanni!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle Orchestration--a Great Listening CD","review":"At first play, like one other reviewer, I thought this might be the \\"leftover\\" music from the Tribute CD, but as I played and replayed this CD, I can only admire the subtle orchestration of this GREAT MUSICAL talent. The tracks are all great, and have a wonderful international flavor, Oriental, Greek, and African. Great use of subtle instrumentation with many keyboard variations. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....","review":"I guess I gave this the one star for disappointed expectations. I at least hoped he MIGHT try to actually play music. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music - stop the singing","review":"Good Yanni music. Too much human voice, though. As artists grow, they seem to reach into areas that they aren't strong in. I think Yanni has reached that point. Several albums back, Aria was great and a lot of people (me included) liked it. Recently, he has been adding more and more female vocals, either exploring that area further or attempting to capture the magic of Aria again. His musical compositions are fantastic. I hope he returns to what he is good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tapped Out ??","review":"I finally purchased this album after hesitating since it's release. And wish I hesitated somemore. Although Yanni still is better than most other musicians on his bad days, this is one of those bad day efforts.His new style seems to be emulating Arkenstone's(another great artist), witch is good, but he still needs more lessons from the master himself. And several times on the album you can tell he wants to revert to old successful themes, that have been used before,on other albums.Yanni has produced many brilliant pieces of work over the years. This album makes me wonder if his creative abilities are all taped out. I hope not for our sakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to basics?","review":"According to Yanni, this album was going to be a back to the bascis album for him. However, for those of us who followed Yanni long before the PBS special that made him a household name,this album is more of the uninspiring droll one hears on the smooth jazz stations. Yanni's early work was characterized by impressive high energy keyboard runs and upbeat tempos. This work gets lumped in with the other smooth jazz jibberish he put out in the late '90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Excitement is Missing!","review":"Yanni has rested in his laurels in this long-awaited album. I didn't find any mystery in the music, just a lot of repitition. He is too laid back and didn't lead me into waiting for the next note-it was predictable. He doesn't bring the orchestra in rises and falling sweeps like in many of his other albums.. I thought \\"The Flame\\" was good, but the mystery he had in \\"Until The Last Minute\\" and the gentle touch he showed in \\"One Man's Dream\\" aren't evident here. It's 'okay music.' Yanni used to be spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"yanni's new album - if i could tell you","review":"yanni's new album - if i could tell you (don't buy this cd!)yanni's new album is nowhere near acceptable. if you are expecting \\"yanni\\" music, you will be greatly disappointed. no soaring melodies here, no interesting rythms or unexpected twists in the music. just a lot of vocal \\"ahhhs\\", electronic drums and hokey sounding keyboards. after three years, he should have, and COULD have, done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it all sounds the same","review":"I was looking forward to the Rhythms of this CD and sadly it all sounds the same. Maybe for intense Yanni Fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with this?","review":"Well, this is a big disappointment to me! Where is Yanni's old dramatic & uplifting style? This new album and his past few re-releases of songs that he has already done, have been a big disappointment! I think the mellowness of this new album has something to do with the split up with Linda Evans! He feels sad, so that's all he can compose! Well, I don't plan on buying anymore Yanni albums in the future! It's a waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Linda Evans Breakup Music","review":"Very disappointed in the album, had to turn it off and play \\"Tribute\\" just to remember why I love Yanni."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"When I bought this cd, I did not know what to expect since Yanni has not made anything new in a while.

He definitly knows how to capture the heart and soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could tell him I would say \\"STOP!\\"","review":"seems like Yanni has finally run out of gas. it was always out there and obvious that Yanni's compositions really were severely lacking in creativity. however many of us missed it because we got distracted by all the instruments and musicians in the band and the stage bravado of Yanni himself. well here stripped of all the theatrics we are treated to one dull and redundant track after another. better suited for elevators than true music fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical Yanni","review":"I looked forward to this new release since it had been a while since we'd heard from Yanni. How disappointing! While the instrumentation was good (not up to usual standards, tho) the music was often interrupted with an irritating voice that sounded like a cross between a witch casting a spell and a cat in heat. I want to hear the music, Yannster, not caterwauling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Gift","review":"I have all of Yanni's works and listen to them all the time. Everyone different from the other. Each containing wonderful input from everyone that is working with him on each piece.I read about why and how this CD came to be, then listened to it. I was speechless. No words could describe the feeling this cd left me with. I felt every note he played and out of all his works never have I truly felt Yanni. Every time I listen to it I get an even deeper closeness to him. To truly feel Yanni and Yanni only. He has truly given of him self in each piece. This is the most wonderful gift any composer can give to their listeners then a true piece of who they are.Yanni doesn't have to speak a single syllable, each note played tells us everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVISIMO!!","review":"This CD is well worth the wait!!!! True, the tracks are not heavily orchestrated as he's returning to his original \\"keyboard only\\" sound but, what superb arrangements! As one reviewer mentioned earlier, it's just another thing to look forward to in his live concerts as we are beautifully surprised by the rearrangements of his music during live performances. My favorite track is \\"With an Orchid\\" and \\"Highland\\" is pretty high on the list as well. Wait.....all of them are outstanding!! Hurry and get your copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"YANNI'S NEW SOUND","review":"Yanni has created a NEW SOUND that even his competitors will find hard to match. Very peaceful music with a soul touching quality. A great cd that will touch something down deep, that is, if you REALLY LISTEN TO IT! Unlike some of the reviews I have read, Yanni has presented a wonderful new type of music. All of his music is GREAT, but this cd has something special and it seems he put his heart and soul into it. I have many of his cd's and think this one is his best by far. RUN DON'T WALK TO BUY IT AND BE PREPARED TO ENJOY WONDERFUL PEACEFUL MUSIC.

From start to finish, the lads hit a groove and stay with it. Perhaps this is the first album where the chemistry of musicians allows something fanciful to happen: the Charlatans make terrific songs that rock hard and also showcase some of the brilliance of guitarist Mark Collins. Though \\"Tellin' Stories\\" is also a great LP, \\"Up To Our Hips\\" is much more nostalgic and from start to end it won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome","review":"I've bought three other Charlatans albums, but it's just not the same. I've had to purchase this cd three times (theft, scratches from overuse). I've played this album a million times. After all this, I still can't figure out why \\"Up To Our Hips\\" is just the coolest album. Melancholic, subdued, heavy, laid-back, insightful . . . ? Sorry, if I can't figure out why I love this album so much, I'm bound to fail when telling others about this gem. This priceless gem.No doubt there are those who will just think this is an OK album, or who who will not like it at all. Whatever. If you're into this album, you know what I'm talking about. From the first few dissonant bass strums on \\"Come In #21\\" to the last refrain of the chorus on \\"Inside Looking Out,\\" this album just floors me. The vocals. The organ. And was there ever cover art that better matched the mood of an album?There aren't enough stars to rate this album, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the depths of personality","review":"This is a watershed study that fostered the development of our contemporary understanding of motivation.

Since then, I've learned not to listen to sales clerks. I'm not sure what I didn't like about it. I guess I had higher expectations after hearing \\"Butterfly Wings\\" and later \\"Golgotha Tenement Blues\\" off \\"The Crow\\" soundtrack. The rest of the songs on here just sounded weak in comparison. As one reviewer mentioned before me, this CD hasn't aged very well, and it's only been about 10 years since it came out. To be fair, I did like the guitar/drums/instrumentals on here, but the lyrics/vocals were kind of lost on me. So, in summary: if you're a MoLG fan, then you'll probably like this CD; but if not, then I'd recommend either borrowing this CD from a friend or downloading some samples first."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOLG","review":"I heard of MOLG through a local radio station in chicago.

A rarity in any genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Don't place faith in human beings...\\"","review":"I haven't heard this CD is quite some time and so while I was digging around through some of my $hit I found it and realized that I used to LOVE this CD...well, the song \\"Butterfly Wings\\" which in my opinion (and seems like quite a few other reviewers) makes this CD. The other songs are great and deeply political, but it's 'Butterfly Wings' that is still the best track here and a HUGE reason to purchase it. Love that song. Sometimes just one track can be worth the $15.00 and 'Butterfly WIngs' is that track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best","review":"I read this book when it was first published.

Here are the things society will think about you. Here is why.\\" It's a wordy, overly-explained story. If the author had let the characters share their experiences and emotions rather than simply listing them, it would read much less like an awkward textbook.

The characters are two-dimensional and unimaginative, and Ms. Martin provides no motivation for their actions or exploration of their emotions.Also, while I usually commend authors for using current social problems to challenge their characters, there were times when I wasn't sure if I was reading a social commentary or a romance. The subplot involving a hate crime was written particularly unrealistically, ... .Being neither a literary nor a romantic success this book fails to provide an reader satisfaction, and should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the egocentric in all of us","review":"Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.Veronica frets about her anonymity amidst her fellow hippopotamuses.

I am an avid Christie fan and have read many of her books but just came across this one recently. She's so prolific, you can read her books, wait a few months, and read them again. As usual, I found this story to be engaging, with a myriad of suspects, and a couple of little twists here and there. I never suspected the who the real killer was. I definitely recommend this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"the solving of an airplane murder soars above the average","review":"When I started this book, I admit that I hoped what would happen is that someone would get killed and then Poirot would somehow solve the mystery before the plane ever touched ground. It would be likeMurder on the Orient Expressexcept ... on an airplane. Which was just two Poirot books ago, which is probably one of the reasons Christie didn't do that. (For an author so prolific, I find her wonderfully creative from book to book in her contexts and twists and even the flow of action.)Instead, the murder takes place on an airplane in plain view of everyone, which narrows quite a bit both the field of potential murderers (tough to have someone stowed away on a plane) and the method. Poirot works through, candidate by candidate, until he reaches a wholly surprising conclusion.I found it engaging, interesting, and the ending was satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book","review":"This book was very good. I liked the plot and the solution. The murderer is very cunning in this book. Christie did well in this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NICELY DONE","review":"Not to say that I found fault with this book, since it was one of her better ones, but I only rate the top 5 or so with 5 stars. This was an entertaining book that lived up to all expectations of Christie. Why was it not one of the top 5? Well, I guess it just didn't quite reach that point of sheer genius (think And Then There Were None!!!).

I haven't read many books by Christie, but I knew this was going to be a good one...And it was. It goes through a female passenger being murdered on a aircraft from Le Pinet, under everyone's noses unnoticed. Poirot is air-sick on the plane and is called upon the investigation. The mystery unfolds page by page, introducing new characters--suspects-- chapter by chapter. There were many varius suspects, and they never narrow down. There was a bit of a twist in the last few chapters of the story, well, for Poirot and another in the last chapter for the readers, yet it makes sense and draws in a nice ending. This is a definite page turner and a great read when you think you're bored, because with Christie's mysteries, you never know what's going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"Its great but I an a serious Agatha fan!

This is just a warning to all those who might make the same mistake as me: don't get this if you want to play Halo online. Fortunately, the let down with this game should be remedied by its predecessor, Halo 2. Of course, the way Microsoft keeps delaying their release date for Halo 2 (it was originally slated to come out in February 2004, now they anticipate Fall of 2004) I probably won't be activating my subscription until about 2010.

The largest character in her life is her father, a forceful, famous, charming, infuriating Jewish cultural figure. He is an emotional presence in several households, and she moves among them, interreacting with loves and lovers of several generations. The novel is touching and moving but also very funny. It's like a play: the characters talk a variety of languages: the grandparents' Yiddish-English, the parents' old-time Jewish socialist English, the young people's New York English of the 1970's. They all sound exactly right. I especially enjoyed revisiting the seventies, which in this version turn out to have been exactly the way I remember but even funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generation Gap","review":"An emotional movie, base on the relationship between the young generation and the old.

I begin by using my CD and booklet \\"Viva la Musica\\" which teaches Spanish through song, but I later use other material along with it.One of my classes uses \\"Spanish in 10 Minutes a Day\\" and enjoys it very much. The students especially like the \\"bilingual pocket pal\\" which they can pull out of the book and carry with them to Mexican restaurants, when traveling or for practice in spare moments. The stickers to put on objects around the house are a big hit also, and the flashcards are very useful. Unlike many books, it doesn't contain verb conjugations or deal with lots of grammar early. That can be an advantage. My students were eager and ready to conjugate verbs by the time we reached that section.I also recommend this book to those who decide to study on their own after a few weeks with a teacher.

Unlike the other reviewers, I found it patronizing and irritating. The basic concept--that by using pictures and a mixture of Spanish and English beginning students can gain confidence--is not necessarily a bad one, but I found myself frustrated by the very limited amount of information actually presented. The book has lots of dull English text, written in a pseudo-sprightly style, with random Spanish words sprinkled over the surface. There is no progression from the beginning of the book to the end. For me, it was a waste of time. In contrast, some of the bilingual storybooks that are now available, have provided me with both the feeling of support beginners need -- and some genuine Spanish. Also, the pictures are awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful for Some; But Not the Best","review":"I found this book to be useful at first, but I later changed to \\"Spanish Made Simple\\" (Jackson, Rubio revised by Nemethy; make sure you get the 2004 edition).

You can tell because they have \\"Mammy Two Shoes,\\" the maid, in many of them at the beginning. She is a supporting character who's face we never see, and she was fazed out after a few years.

Well, Mammy is back in place, but her voice in some of the episodes was re-dubbed to make her sound less stereotypical. And this after Whoopi G. spends 3 minutes telling us that the character is so important to the series that she just can't be left out. Poor Tom and Jerry. Will we ever see the original versions again? Either we see Mammy dropped and re-animated as a white woman, or we see Mammy and have her voice altered (in the 60s she even was redubbed with an Irish accent in some cartoons!).

Accept Tom & Jerry for what they are, don't feel like you have to put racial disclaimers about images that play for 5 seconds in a film. Kids do no notice it, it has no impact on them.

There is a definite effort to broaden their musical style with more explicit keyboard and synth experimentation. Amongst the best songs are the tracks Of Lilies And Remains, a type of spoken poem with nightmarish images over squeaking guitar, nervous drumming and spacious, evocative synths, and Kick In The Eye, a gripping ballad with hypnotically repetitive phrases over an atmospheric rock backing. The up-tempo track In Fear Of Fear has particularly impressive keyboard textures, whilst Hair Of The Dog is a great track with rousing vocals and Muscle In Plastic is a dissonant excursion with an almost funky undertone. Bauhaus is an acquired taste and I find Peter Murphy's solo work more accessible and appealing, but there is no question that they were a very inventive band that extended the boundaries of rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful bauhaus...","review":"the idea of sophomore jynx applies to this album. it think it is thier worst. which is fabulous because every other album they did was a god send. buy this one along with the others. the hair on the dog is a fabulous song. it even has david j screaming which is something you only hear twice, on that song and on the song spiked on sweet f.a., an album by love and rockets. it also features each member doing vocals, except daniel ash speaks backwards...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"I picked up a copy last week and spent most of my time reading it.

This is because Margaret Atwood has successfully extrapolated several existing global scenarios to their inevitable conclusions. The turning point for me was when I read about the spider-goats and realized that this part wasn't fiction. The future is here. Genetic manipulation of animals is occurring, and we all know what's happening with the corporate-controlled genetic engineering of our food supply (or at least we ought to). To my mind, Snowman ends up questioning how it all came to pass, finally realizing that, on all the occasions when (despite de-sensitizing and conditioning by the corporations in control and by the Internet/media) he questioned the morality of proceedings, he could have done something to prevent their outcome. My fear is that many of us will one day find ourselves in the same position."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing and left wanting an actual story","review":"Like others have said, this is mostly back story.

The sun can kill you and, unlike Ray Bradbury's story of the planet that had rain for 7 years and only a few minutes of sunshine, in this book the sun wears a skull and crossbones.Snowman/Jimmy tells the story and he lives in a tree. The Crakers are a species that supposedly save Planet Earth's sad remains. They are automaton people who know no pleasure.

Personally, this novel is her worst - almost as bad as her poetry. Less than half way through, I just didn't care what would happen to the main character and the ending left me without feeling.

The supporting characters are more interesting","review":"Old lady Atwood, I am very disappointed in you for publishing this crap that you call literature. Seriously?

When it works, you don't even noticing while accepting the future she builds.But when it doesn't work, as in this novel, nothing holds together. Sections here are so well done, but the connections to other chapters, to the novel as a whole, are missing. Frankly, I think it's due to the length. The novel seems half complete, as if large swaths of details have been glossed over.That's disappointing. It's not bad. It's only half-baked, I think. I suppose that's a weird review: \\"I didn't like it because I wanted more.\\" But there it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"An unforgettable and frightening story about inequality and the bleak horror of genetic assimilation. It was fabulously constructed, and I couldn't put it down. I particularly enjoyed all the flashbacks to the past.

This book was fabulous!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and unimaginative","review":"As a long term fan of both sci-fi and Attwood, O&C should have been my ideal holiday reading. Instead, it's a real disappointment. The sci-fi elements are predictable and cliched, and the rest shallow and unbelieveable. None of the characters have any depth and their motivations are hazy. We never really learn why Crake destroys the world, nor why Oryx is involved with Jimmy or Crake's project. The minor characters are simply cardboard cutouts. On top of all that, the heavy-handed anti-corporate and global warming messages are simplistic and naive. Why two stars then? Two reasons: the writing is elegant and effortless, and the last page provides a moment of genuine interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oryx and Crake - still in my top ten!","review":"Even after all these years, Oryx and Crake is still one of my all time favorite books!

However, like Robber Bride and Blind Assasin we do have some very disturbing descriptions of child abuse, particualarly as in this case it is presented in language which is much closer to standard erotic literature. The children are beautiful, nothing is painful. Even the adult victim refuses to admit the horror.

The lovely prose is subverted by a much too unsubtle 'warning' about genetic technology that feels overly pedantic.And then there's that warning itself, and all the ideas she uses to demonstrate it.

I am parting ways with Ms Atwood and the publishers and editors who live in fear of her reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, haunting novel -- dystopia to utopia?","review":"This is one of Margaret Atwood's very best works- her sentences are often lyrical and beautiful, yet at other times fraught with fear and impending doom for one of the last of our species. The whole time one is reading it, one tends to think \\"I knew we were messing up when we did that\\", regarding our present day society. The ending was perfect, letting the wonder of life in all it's permutations up to our own interpretation. I wonder if that was one of Atwood's aims, to make us wonder just when we are in a dystopia and when we pass to a utopia and what human qualities we'd sacrifice for that utopia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great read","review":"Man, I love how Margaret Atwood writes. I imaging myself to be a writer, but I don't know that I've ever written a paragraph that could go in one of her books. Could you love someone enough to destroy the world because they betrayed you? An all too possible future of genetic alterations, failed antibiotics, and global destruction is the backdrop for just that question. Read it. You will be depressed, fascinated, and thinking about it for weeks. What more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I'm really becoming a fan of Atwood. This is the third book by her that I've read (I read Handmaid's Tale and The Penelopiad before this one). I may be a sucker for dystopia novels, but I absolutely loved this book. The near-future world that she creates is fascinating and frightening at the same time. My favorite thing about the book is the way it's organized. I love that we don't get a straight-out explanation of what exactly \\"happened\\" to the world in this book until the end. I loved picking up tidbits and hints throughout and speculating on it. It was a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking read. I read it in about 3 days, which is very fast for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From Atwood's Best","review":"A boring, depressing, and condescending piece of work. If Atwood's name wasn't on it it would be lost in the shuffle. The saddest thing is the lack of originality. At least The Handmaid's Tale had that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Kidding","review":"The Plot:Jimmy, a man living in a post-apocalyptic world (and who now calls himself 'Snowman'), creates an accidental gospel for a new race of homo sapien like creatures, while tormented by dreams of his childhood, visions of his disappeared mother, and apparitions of a former lover.Atwood's Take:In an interview about this book, Atwood remarked that scientists and novelist are driven by the same question: what if? I am not certain that all novelists would agree with that statement, but it certainly drives this novel. For Atwood, God and science are interchangeable; one happens to be a three letter word, the other a seven letter word- makes no difference.My Take:The sister and daughter of scientists, Atwood's \\"gallows humor\\" is the main character in this book. She is lying to us. Will you laugh at her joke? Or will you take her tragic nightmare seriously? Or will you do both?I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I concur: This book is a waste of time.","review":"I most certainly agree with a previous reviewer who declared Crake and Oryx a total waste of time. It is a mishmash of pseudoscience and unbelievable scenarios. It is most certainly not a cautionary tale, except to point out that those lacking in knowledge should not attempt to predict the future. Some have found humor in the book, referring to baboon-like mating habits, but the humor is at best junior-high stuff and degrading. The only consistent theme in the book is a making of time sausage: although obviously ca. 100 or more years in the future, people are still taking Polaroids and sending faxes. Except for an apparent advance in genetic engineering, the details of life seem annoyingly like life today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooorrring!","review":"I can't believe that the Gov-Gen, Giller, and Booker selection committees gave this book the attention they did. Clearly, it was a case of Atwood's name being nominated, because this snoozer didn't deserve it. It is Booooring! Condescending in high Atwood style, Oryx and Crake fails to present any characters of interest, or anything of interest. The story is boring, the settings are boring. Classic Atwood. That this dud won acclaim and something like Guy Vanderhaeghe's The Last Crossing was ignored makes a mockery of this year's crop of Lit awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"A premise with promise","review":"I didn't feel as if the promise were kept, however. The story is told in flashbacks by the last human on earth, as he lives among our species's successors. The gentle, peaceful people of the new world resemble Eloi without the Morlocks in the shadows. Unfortunately, happy and peaceful people don't make good drama. There was plenty of dramatic potential in the story that led up to that point: in the actions that ended the human world, in the conspiracy leading to those actions, or in the personality capable of them. Instead, the world ends not with a bang or a whimper, but with a cheerful purring sound.Perhaps personalities with clearer strengths and weaknesses could have carried through the low-key action, or vice versa. I could imagine all the same elements being used to tell a similar story, but one that I'd find a lot more engaging. At least this didn't come across like some do, as a story with no ending. Instead, it seems more like an ending with no story.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate science fiction","review":"This is the first Atwood novel that I have read, although I have heard her name and reputation highly touted, and boy am I disappointed. Her imagination, at least here,is,maybe,worn out?Could it be that she has simply burnt out? I will try something else by her, but I'll get it from the library. Oryx and Crake was a waste of money to buy, and I won't bother to plow through it,it is tedious reading. The writing is average to ordinary here, the vision is adolescent. You would think that with the money and staff that she has she could garner more sophisticated scientific data and put it together more convincingly. The sci-fi here is about the level of a comic book. The story is unfascinating, a poor plot,and the characters are not that interesting.How does stuff like this get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck through it only to realize it was a waste of my time","review":"I've recently been on an Atwood binge. I enjoyed the Blind Assassin and Alias Grace, but The Edible Woman, The Handmaid's Tale, and this, Oryx and Crake, fell far short of what I was expecting. Atwood didn't seem to put much into character development. Crake and Oryx, despite being splayed all over the book cover, are hardly understood. At the end of the book, I was dumbfounded. Why in the heck did Crake do that? Why trust the Crakers to his friend even though he seems to have contempt for his abilities? It would have been more of an enjoyable read had there been more action rather than having the entire book be flashbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull; trite; meaningless","review":"Oryx and Crake is a poorly written, aimless novel. Atwood's writing style is extrememly trite, her characters are flat, and her plot is unimaginative.I am a fan of dystopic novels, but this one failed to engage me in any meaningful way. The main character is unbelievably dull and at no time evinces even a modicum of understanding about his own inane life pre-chaos, the state of affairs post-chaos, or the human condition in general. Unfortunately, the author evinces just as little understanding.The ending of this novel, is, if possible, worse than the rest of it. Why on earth did Jimmy/Snowman do the things he did? The true horror of reading this book is the realization that one day the human race could be in the hands of a half-wit such as him [or by extension, the author].Why is Margaret Atwood praised so highly?

By exploring the god-like role often assumed by the scientific community, Margaret Atwood effectively asks \\"Why is it he feels that some line has been crossed, some boundary transgressed? How much is too much, how far is too far?\\" (p.206, Hardcover Edition).

Note that this is not \\"brave new world\\" respun, but rather a very different future which would (probably) have turned into something very much like \\"brave new world\\" were it not for the personal choices of a few characters (or at least the author hints in this direction). Instead, this is a very different future indeed. This tale of one potential future for mankind was gripping for me largely because it is utterly plausible. The author fills in the details of my daydreams (or nightmares?) that I'd never bothered to think through in detail myself. At time things feel familiar, and the author carefully leaves breadcrumbs from our present society to this not far off future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, contemplative, realistic, frightening?","review":"My favorite genre of fiction in any form is post-apocalyptic, so going in this hit right home. I also like realistic speculative future views, and that part of the story forms the other half of this tale.At times it was intensely creative, while others it featured hard looks at being alone among people versus being truly alone. I liked the dichotomy of the storytelling there.In the end, I very much enjoyed the novel but it also fell just a bit short for me when I compared my earliest expectations of where I felt like the story was leading with where it eventually led. The groundwork was great, but in a way it did too good of a job because Atwood ended up drawing a world where, while the outcome was indeed a horrible side of humanity to even think about, it just seemed inevitable in the circumstances. As a warning for a place we might be heading, I guess it did its job that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never listen to the nightly news the same way again.","review":"The reader is forewarned, as Atwood begins with this quote from Jonathan Swift in Gulliver's Travels: \\"I could perhaps have astonished you with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to relate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style; because my principal design was to inform you, and not to amuse you.\\" Thus, the novel is unlike any that Atwood has written before.Based on actual news clippings that the author has collected in the last few years, this is a futuristic novel about a world created by man's carelessness and greed. A world of cloned animals, extreme makeovers, genetically engineered foods and people, where new diseases pop up faster than new medications and supplements.Atwood's sardonic wit and quick pacing make this novel hard to put down, and leave you thinking about it long after you've put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant narration","review":"This is a book that I could not put down not only because the subject seems eerily familiar. Atwood's portrayla of the near future for some reason seems more probable then most science fiction novels out there. Once again, English language is the star, masterfully utilized. Campbell Scott's delivery is exceptional, I could not think of anyone else who could have read this novel better. A must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and Interesting Tale of the Future","review":"I just finished Margaret Atwood's Oryx and Crake, and it was one of those books I just could not put down. I personally feel this is one of Atwood's best novels (not as good as Handmaid's Tale, but darn close). Her glimpse into the future is not that far-fetched in theory although the details are not realistic -- yet. With technology changing so dramatically and consistently, her future could soon be our future.If you liked Handmaid's Tale, then definitely check this book out. With the right director, this would make a great movie too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated Jimmy!","review":"I am more than a little surprised by the 4 and 5 star reviews. First of all, I loved Blind Assassin and Handmaid's Tale. But when I was reading this book, the \\"feeling\\" wasn't there. To be sure, the \\"Minority Report\\" futuristic world details were interesting, and, imo, the only reason to read this book. But could someone explain why Jimmy was left standing to caretake the world? His life seemed to be a total bore. When he is rambling on about his mother and his various girlfriends I wanted to throw the book across the room. And the coincidence of the epheremal Oryx appearing in his life seemed ridiculous. What purpose does her character serve?Thankfully I got this book at the library, not the bookstore. Give me the Crake diaries and maybe we'll have something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dystopian, an excellent read but a bit ponderous in the beginning","review":"Margaret Atwood is a very accomplished author and this novel shows her excellent command of her craft. It makes for a ripping good read, and leaves many thoughts behind to ruminate. She is in the lead of what is likely to be a long line of future authors to predict that the world will end not with a bang, but with biological tinkering and the unleashing of some man-made plague.I found the first chapters a bit ponderous, but it is worth sticking with them because the pace picks up considerably after about the first quarter of the book, and many of the oblique references become clear.I don't read much fiction, but in this case I'm really pleased I did -- this is a novel I can recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Margaret Atwood is by far my favorite author, and this book exceeds my expectations","review":"Loved this book so much! And it was really great reading it on my kindle. I'm impressed at how much biotech research Atwood must have done to get so much of this right, and so realistic (speaking as a biomed. engineer, I greatly appreciate it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read","review":"Well written and an interesting take on end of the world stories. Not what I expected but if I could get my girlfriend to read it she would probably love it. I simply like the more practical perspective. Again, the author writes in an engaging and entertaining style. Glad I bought it and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I was excited about the comparison between Atwood's lastest book Oryx and Crake, with The Handsmaids Tale, one of my all time favorite books.It took much discipline to actually make it through the book. The story failed to develop the emotional excitement that carried the Handmaid's Tale so suspensefully through to the end. The book was conceived as a whole to Atwood, and I feel like it needed to time to flesh out into a more mature story before it was released. The concept was worthy of more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpectedly Unreal","review":"Totally unrealistic. I'm not talking about the crazy biotechnology. All that is plausible. But the characters are mere shadows of real people. They don't truly love one another. Parents don't care about their children. The closest of friends remain complete mysteries to one another. I'm going to have to re read The Road to remind myself of how people really behave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care about the characters after 150 pages","review":"Really wanted to like this book. After reading 150 pages I still didn't care about the characters. I decided to stop wasting my time and energy on this depressing, uninteresting book.

After all of the hype, I am disappointed by the writing, the story and the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly disappointing","review":"After reading reviews of Oryx and Crake I was eagerly anticipating reading this novel by such a highly acclaimed author. I was stunningly disappointed by the poor quality of this novel. I have read Margaret Atwood's novels in the past and have enjoyed them. Did the reviewers really read this one? The book reads more like a grade school creative writing project. I am truly dumbfounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye-opening satire","review":"If you love satire, you'll love this. Post-apocalypic genre. An exciting way to spend afternoon reading and wondering how quickly our world could collapse on itself....all because of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mindrush!","review":"Atwood is a master of her genre. Her words carve out a world inside a world inside your imagination like a master sculptor carefully defining each sinew of a muscle.She leads you to disappear into a landscape stimulating, erotic and oddly familiar.This book will not make you think. It will redefine your thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh what could have been....","review":"This book had so much potential as Atwood is a very good writer. My main problem with the book was that her near future America could never be even close to true. The characters sit around and watch child pornography, bestiality, torture, suicides, and murders for fun as teenagers. This is a common practice in this America of Atwood's and is considered normal. Can anyone see this ever happening? No way because she ignores all morality, and thus religion, which is a major influence in the world whether the author wants it to be or not. I am not a holy roller, I don't go to church, but I can't see how in a very short time the world would be completely without any religion or morality. This lack of morality or religion happens without a war, plague, alien invasion, etc... it just happened. The characters are pretty much completely unlikeable and so is the country and the world. Please no one give Atwood the bomb because she will use it. lol, I'm joking kind of...."},{"rating":"1","title":"misled","review":"This book is NOT Science Fiction and it is NOT even primarily an apocalyptic novel. Stop calling it either. It is most definitely well written, but it is primarily the story of a man looking back at his life and relationship with his best friend and quasi love interest. That is how it should be billed. If scifi or apocalypse stories are what you are looking for, move on. And as to what it actually is, it's still not that good. Great it was written well. The author knows how to put together a sentence and tie together bland storylines. And it succeeds in being really depressing. Sorry I need more than that. The story is boring, the characters are boring, and the setting is boring. Alternately the author gives far too much depth or far too little. I realize I'm in the minority but I have no idea why all of you like this so much. I found this completely unexciting, non-thought-provoking, unemotional, tepid, and unimaginitive. OVERRATED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I did not care much for this book. I know it has loud praising reviews galore, but for me it just didn't meet the hype. It's not a bad book, it's just not as entertaining as I expected based on the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially trash","review":"Despite the apparently high reputation of this book, it struck this reader as cynical and extremely self-indulgent. Yes, the author surely had fun creating all the far-out science fictiony stuff, but where does that leave the reader? Like Nabokov's puns, it is simply tiresome. NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynical misandry","review":"This book reeks of cynicism and man-hate. The story fails to present a coherent theme, the characters make no sense, and the whole plot rests on the tired trope of the mad scientist as villain. I'll never read Atwood again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even finish reading it","review":"Sorry Ms. Atwood - I still love you (read Handmaid's Tale twice), but I just couldn't make it through Oryx & Crake. Wonderfully written, but the story was just awful. Dark, cynical, devoid of any sense of humanity. What a downer. The nightly news is more uplifting. Perhaps I missed something grand by only making it 2/3rds of the way through -- someone please tell me if I did. Otherwise, life is too short to read something so dull and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apocalyptic Short Story","review":"This a short story, which has then been bulked up with huge amounts of backstory. And the back story was better than the current stuff. I read this because of Margaret's awesome reputation. I will some of her other works because this one didn't grab me, I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atwood has perfected the craft of novel writing","review":"I don't feel I am in any place to review an accomplished writer such as Margaret Atwood, but I can give some first impressions on the book. First of all, if you are already an Atwood fan you'll find all of her trademarks in Oryx and Crake: a subtle underlyig political message, bizarre witty commentaries, multi-dimensional characters, and a facinating story line.If you have not been introduced to Atwood yet, or have not enjoyed her pst novels, I could still see Oryx and Crake as being a good read for you. The story takes place years into the future and, unlike its predecessor A Handmaid's Tale, presents a wide perspective from characters of both genders. This book gives the reader much to think about but is always engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated Emo Dream","review":"Deeply thought challenging subject matter, reading this book enters you into a world of uncomfort, sadness, love, longing, wonder, and endless thoughts of \\"what-if?\\".....

This book isn't a quick fix like most claim to be: it gradually teaches you the grammar of the language without your even knowing it: it has extremely helpful lessons, and is written very well, understanding that you won't pick up the language in one week, but will have to put effort and sacrifice into it.I'll continue my quest for the tape; this book is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no good without the cassette tapes","review":"The authors state that the book is designed to be used with their cassette tapes which correspond to each lesson, or with the assistance of a Turkish speaking teacher.

So the way they presented ramadan is dull, yes is simple to read but at least a little love for the month is not shown. No excitement is like just writing facts with pictures. Does not really make it fun for kids.You don't feel the excitement of ramadan with this instead you get few facts that really does not sound like a child explaining ramadan or the eid. Better books out there in this topic. Make sure is written by a muslim.

My speaker started cutting out and after much frustration I traced it to the connection at the amp. One of the wires inside the plug had just pulled out. When I inspected the wire, I could not believe how inferior it was to what I was used to from other manufacturers. The wire itself is almost impossible to see it's so small, and has absolutely NO shielding. I had never, and never will again buy anything made by Monster. I will also tell everyone I know not to buy Monster. Now I have to completely gut my truck to reroute a \\"real\\" interconnect in the place of this sorry excuse.I have been into car audio for 20 years and can't believe that a \\"known\\" name brand can ship such an inferior product and continue to remain in business."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Love Got to Do With It?","review":"Wong Kar-Wai is possibly the most influential Asian post-modern film maker of the 1990's. His \\"Chungking Express\\" is a true masterpiece of film making, and \\"Happy Together\\" is a visually stunning work that explores the typically depressing topics of love, loss, betrayal and regret in a dystopian setting. The intermingling of languages is fascinating and makes the cinematography more relevant. Symbolism through repetitive images runs rampant through out the film, though one is left wondering what many represent, if anything. A dark film that leaves you wanting more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Personified co-dependency...","review":"Another remarkable story by Kar-wai Wong that depicts two men on a trip to Argentina where they get stranded due to financial difficulties and their turbulent relationship. In their relationship they have acquired a certain dependency upon each other, which seems to be emotionally, financially, and physically draining on them both. Despite this abusive relationship, their co-dependency forces them back together and the circle seems to be sealed forever, until one of men meets another man who has the ability to listen. Happy Together is a film about everything in a relationship except being happy together, which provides an emotionally apprehensive cinematic experience that can be compared to Ingmar Bergman's pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is Disappointing, Not Movie.","review":"I think movie review must be divded into Media and Movie itself, especially DVD. DVD has many features like chapter search, subtitle, etc. And quality of screen vary. In this point, this DVD is VVVEEERY BBBADDD. No understanding of Chinese Language. No Understanding of Director. Most of all its screen quality is worse than back-up VHS tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Viewing","review":"As a gay Asian man, I always anticipate a gay Asian film that steers away from the cliche subjects of pimps and hustlers and young men involved with older men for purely economic reasons. It's refreshing that the two lovers in \\"Happy Together\\" are supposed to be involved with each other for love. The problem with \\"Happy Together\\" is that their love is never depicted. For the duration of the film, the viewer is presented with a melange of arguments, fights, and temporary separations that ultimately lead to the final break-up. What binds this couple when it seems that both men - from beginning to end - loathe each other more so than love? No doubt \\"Happy Together\\" is a finely shot film. However, the lingering question of \\"What the hell?\\" far outweighs the film's glossiness. And when the credits roll, the viewer is left with no sense of a redeeming quality for having sat through this ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the Mood","review":"This movie tries to present deep, complex and intriguing characters but that pretension ends up delivering a flat, tedious and emotionally empty story. The plot focuses the relationship of two gay men, their co-dependence and the everyday struggles they must face, most of them with each other.It coul be interesting if the characters weren\`t so distant and devoid of any life or worthwile qualities. Instead, they turn into shallow, selfish people that only add to a slow and lifeless movie. Director Wong Kar-Wai (\\"Fallen Angels\\", \\"In The Mood For Love\\") delivers some stylish, beautiful images with creative camera angles and an engaging use of lightning, but it doesn\`t help much since the story itself drags on and on and fails to captivate one\`s attention. Some pretty and original details aside, \\"Happy Together\\" is a long, boring and useless waste of film. Disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad","review":"If slow, dull storytelling featuring utterly unfathomably characters who are hell-bent on self-flagellation is your cup of oolong, you'll love this.

He just understands how to chop what he filmed originally and glue it back to an attractive and intriguing movie. Doyle's cinematography and ...'s art direction (sorry, forget his name) were as interesting as usual. One very important thing I've to mention is that I CAN see it in Sydney Australia. So anyone residing in Australia can avoid to buy the expensive PAL version."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a waterfall experience","review":"Won kar wai makes it still worth to believe in cinema as an art. This movie speeks for itself. Its a masterpiece. There's a good director, a blend of great photography actors direction, music, camera, silences. We are faced with a real and pure cinematographic language. And while all this is going on there's also a story beautifull taking place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting movie that is a fine story and visual feast.","review":"I was lucky enough to watch this in Hong Kong right after it's release date. The 95% Cantonese audience loved it but interestingly laughed at very inappropriate times. I am sure that when I laughed they thought I was an idiot. Anyway, the visuals are stunning and I watch the video often just to enjoy the movement and color. I also listen to the soundtrack often as it is chock-full of tango both bad and good. The Frank Zappa tracks are also entertaining. If you get a chance ,read any of several of the directors different explantations of the movie. His reason for making it was apparently and paradoxically (filmed mostly in Argentina) spurred on by the turnover of Hong Kong."},{"rating":"2","title":"!Chevere!","review":"I have calendars with all types of men of color, so don't think I have a Latino fetish or anything.

It was however a bit tedious to put together.Overall a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book detailing a difficult phenomenon","review":"The book explains a condition called anosognosia which brain injured individuals may experience. As the title explains, anosognosia basically describes an unawareness of deficits. Although much has been written about brain injuries, this extremely important facet of the recovery process is rarely addressed. I am brain injured myself and learned more about my own condition from this book than I have learned in all the other seventeen post-morbid years put together. It is written in highly technical language, more for professionals, I'd guess, than the lay person. All the same, I (a lay person) found it great reading and had no trouble understanding its content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly","review":"The only forgivable mistake of this movie was the quasi-Lynch, highly stylized, rippage during the montage/porno scenes, and the general story-line, which, I am sure any other director would have pulled off. Big E.S. did not pull it off, however; rather, he took it, played with it, ran with it, then ultimately farted on it. Farted all over it.The acting was par, a change for a Stanze film. The twist ending was contentious and ill-performed. The audio/visual of this film was the stuff of a first year film student.I can not recommend this in good faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynchian vision","review":"I would, in all honesty, compare this movie to the film's of David Lynch. Very emotional and intense. Wonderful acting by Jason Allen Wolfe. In fact the best independent movie acting I have seen in ages. Drug induced action with excellent character and story detail. The ending was totally unexpected and amazingly twisted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much craft hitched to too small a purpose","review":"A trade press review said \\"Powerfully told, with room for an expansion of the story.\\"\\"Room for expansion\\" is a rather interesting euphemism for a complete failure to deliver on the tacit contract between reader and writer. In exchange for the reader's money, time, and attention, the writer creates and develops issues to hold that attention, then answers the questions and resolves the major issues at the end.Gibson created a handful of intriguing dilemmas. Dramatic conflicts fascinating enough to keep a reader going through less than stellar prose. From time to time, you wonder if it's worth the effort to keep on reading, but the hooks have you hooked.Last sentance -- \\" They waited there, suspended between Heaven and Earth\\" -- flips off the long-suffering reader by resolving / explaining -- nothing.I have not seen this kind of contempt for the consumer since Roman Polanski's brutal hymn to nihilism, \\"Chinatown.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is too different for my taste, I was very disappointed with the instructor and the program.

The only problem I have with it are the screw terminals. Traditionally, screw terminals are attached to a plate with raised corners, and you bend the wire into a hook shape, the raised corners hold the wire, and the screw traps the wire against the corners to form a cup. This switch skipped that. It is really difficult to use this terminal without a crimp on end. You want to crimp the smallest ring onto your wire, then remove the screws, and stick them through the ring when you reattach them.And that loses it a star. You can solder stranded wire into a ring and use it with this terminal, which is what I did since I didn't have a ring or spade handy, but I didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control System is Broken","review":"First of all, I like the product functionality, price, and value. However, when I received my original order, the switch arrived in three pieces, as the plastic housing was broken. I returned to Amazon and received a replacement. This one had both tabs on the faceplace all bent up and turned over. In both cases, the packaging was not damaged, so it is apparent that the faulty switches were shipped in this condition. This company definitely needs to shore up its quality control system and to assure that defective parts are not shipped to the customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine HD Toggle Switch","review":"THis Heavy Duty Toggle Switch should work just fine. Came as described. One thing the descxription was unable to provide to me was dimensions of the actual switch, so this one was slightly larger then the one I was replacing.

You're also paying good money for a scanned copy of a nearly 100-year old work.

I'm just a second year med student with a claculus background. What I'm trying to say is that anyone who wants to can read this book can, and he or she will take a lot away from it if they want.I don't completely understand how this book reduces (or at least attempts to) all of mathematics to logic nor do I understand why it supposedly fails. Maybe if you majored in math or philosophy these things are obvious to you, but it is a fascinating book, and I find it remarkable knowing there are/were human beings that could think in such terms.Buy this book!

Their second US release can brighten any day. The sound is a bit more trippy, kicky fun than Made in the USA. I love the four tracks \\"The Night is Still Young,\\" \\"Happy Sad,\\" \\"Groovy is My Name\\" and \\"Strawberry Sleighride.\\" They will have you singing them long afterwards and bopping along to the music in your mind. The style is still groovy, still full of the unexpected sample or musical find, and still that instantly identifiable but indescribable mix of influences. Think of that party scene in \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\\" Don't you want to be Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly and throw crazy fun parties too? This is the CD she would play. Try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure it's crazy... but what's wrong with that?","review":"I don't understand a word of Japanese, and I love this album. Songs like CDJ and The Night Is Still Young could be dance hits anywhere (and who knows? this being my first exposure to P5, maybe they already are/were!) Also on the CD are some jazzy numbers and a couple of completely wild tracks (the ultra cool 'Good!' and the 8+ minute remix of Peace Music by Saint Etienne) all executed with a smooth polish. Fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, good soundtrack","review":"I saw Pi. They say scientists do their genius work in their twenties, as do mathematicians. Pi is a genius work of a young director in my opinion, with all parts of the film fresh and raw. In any case, the film was great. The youth and learning curve of the director only made it better.This soundtrack reflects a similar mood to the movie. Check out the Gus Gus track, as well as Clint Mansell's admirable beat-riding. Orbital is good as always; the other artists offer new and eye-opening jams for newcomers to electronica.Try to listen to \\"2PiR\\" and not dance! I defy you! And stick around for the rest of it too, you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every single track stands on its own.","review":"I remember watching Pi, being completely submerged in the visuals, then realized, \\"It's going to have an awesome soundtrack!\\" Good soundtrack often well supports scenes in a film, but in this case, it was a crucial part of involving my sensory. The music captures the essence of the character's mental state as well as the atmosphere; dark and rough yet sensitive, busy and raw yet simple. I'm no techno fan, but I dare say there wasn't a single mediocre track in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"As you listen to this, you can see the movie in your head","review":"No other soundtrack I have ever listened to has set the music to its namesake as well as Pi's. First of all, Pi was one of the best films ever made, along with The Crow. SEE IT. Next, I'm no electronica freak. Electronica and I have a sort of love-hate relationship. All in all, I'm not crazy about it, although I kind of like KMFDM(though they're more industrial.) However, this is the one and only solely-electronica album I own, and probably will ever want to own. GREAT ALBUM, YOU MUST GET THIS ALBUM, GET IT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"biginers guide to big beat","review":"This soundtrack serves to expand the reach of the drum and bass movement in the same way the soundtrack to \\"the saint\\" did for electronica.

The pi soundtrack should boost the album sales of all those involved.... and I personaly can't wait to see the movie. Although with a soundtrack this cool, who cares what it's about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MMM...Pi","review":"Unlike most soundtracks, this album manages to seamlessly mix music produced especially for the film with licenced tracks. Whats more the original tracks outshine most of the old stuff on here by a long way. The first three tracks fit together so well you barely notice the joins and the whole first half races by. The second half tales off slightly with only the Clint mansell tracks standing out. This album acts as a good sampler for the artists featured on it and has led to me buying more stuff by Autechre, Aphex Twin and Roni Size. However I would say it should be lisened to before you buy it as most of my friends refuse to be in the same room as it, even though they are electronic music fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific sound track as well as great for driving","review":"Saw the movie - LOVED IT!

I got the record before I saw the movie. The music stands alone, but when you see the film it means so much more to you.

Not the box it comes in, not in the cardboard african \\"drum\\" that the dvd's are in.... but in the packaging of the actual dvd's. They are essentially packaged in an accordian file folder, easily scratched if you're not careful. And they don't have soft lining behind them, basically you're resting the dvd on a piece of cardboard. For what you pay for this, it could be packaged better. I only wanted movies in Blu-Ray, it's the only way I can get 1 1/2 and II. Calling Amazon now, to return. I'll wait for 1 1/2 and II to be released seperately, they will eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accordion file folder case is a disappointment","review":"The 'accordion file folder' disc case is terrible. I bought this version in large part to get the Blu-Ray of Lion King 1.5, which does not appear to be individually available. LK 1.5 is surprisingly entertaining for a Disney sequel. But the case inside the drum.... awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The movies are great! The picture is awesome! The sound in Lion King 1 is 7.1, the other are only 5.1 which may be a drawback for some. The packaging is by far the worst part about this, it is so large and clumsy. The sleeves that hold the discs are a pain, and the box doesn't fit in on my shelf next to my other blurays very nicely. I wish the 3 movies were released seperately so that I could have them in standard bluray cases, but oh well, I guess this will have to do, The movies are so good its worth the extra trouble for me personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"overweighted product","review":"I don't think this product is any better than the last edition (platinum edition) which contains a hardcover book with some sketches that I call it collectible.

This review is reviewing the box set it comes in.The outside of the box is very lovely, with wood-like carving imagery on the outside. But once you open the case it comes in, you are in for a disappointment. The discs are in thin cardboard! There are no cases to hold the discs. You just slide them out of their \\"file\\" type thin cardbard. I can see this set getting very scratched in the near future if you watch these a lot. I only bought this set because I wanted all 3 movies. I suggest everyone wait and buy each separately in a appropriate blu ray case release.

Military literary sketches are often crowded with heroic jargon and feats of super hero performances, whereas, LT Mann's story tells of the heartache and uncertainty a soldier feels while undergoing some of the toughest training in the military. He holds nothing back. Not even the heroic jargon and super hero feats.

Okay, some of it maybe but not all of it. If we're to actually mean what we say about our work then we wouldn't do what we're doing day after day.If at all, it gave me an inside view of the BCT and OCS which I plan to do in early 2011. This isn't the book that will tell you how many push ups and sit ups you need to do or what kind of physical and mental shape you'd need to be in for the BCT.

The Irish group was not as horribly developed, but they still lacked major development. The author's gain was nothing more than two overly simple love stories.

I went down to Lowes and bought the tried and true hand held cheaper unit. It works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap handle does not withstand winding","review":"The handle is not molded as part of the reel rather the reel has a fold up handle which is poorly designed.

While it did what it was supposed to do, it was priced about 3 times what it is priced NOW (in 2010).At the time I felt totally ripped off... paid over $30 for this and expected much much better quality, not cheap plastic. It is made of very flimsy plastic frankly, but yes, you can wrap up an extension cord or two easily in this thing. Not too easy to unroll without dragging it all over the place though either trying to do it by yourself...Now it can be purchased for about 1/3 of the price I paid... basically it is just cheaply made out plastic that will work. I had expected much better quality when I originally purchased it at a much greater price. For roughly $10, it's about worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"handle broken off when it arrived. It can not be used without a handle.

I am still deciding if we should keep it, may just use it to store a cord when not being used...kind of a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Functional Cord Storage Wheel","review":"I bought this reel for a 100' 12/3 gauge low temp extension cord. I wish I'd bought another product, but will keep and use this one. While functional, it is not user friendly. There is no way to hold down the reel while turning the handle and being able to guide the cord onto the reel. It kept moving around whenever I tried to turn the handle. I would not buy this item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fit for outdoor/heavy cords","review":"I got this as a recommendation thru amazon, plus it seemed simple enough. I needed it also for an outdoor cord for my snow blower. The design is not fit for a heavy cord since it is relatively small and the stiffness of the cord tends to catch the sides and top of the reel. This causes it to not unwind easily. I spend 15 minutes just getting the cord out of the wheel because it got loose towards the inside and had to pull it out one halfturn at a time. Such a pain.I recommend getting something with more weight or not bothering with it. These heavy, low temp cords are very stiff so I don't think there are many wheels that can efficiently hold these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good pair for the cord","review":"I bought this in a package deal with a Toro snow thrower and a heavy duty cord.

I have to say I am disappointed in the quality of this reel. The plastic is very flimsy. The rewind handle broke on the first use. Also, the design is poor. When rewinding, there is really no place to place your foot on it to keep it secure on the floor without interfering with the rotation of the reel. I would not recommend this reel to anyone.

The wheel is unstable when winding or unwinding an electric cord. I found it necessary to hold the wheel by putting my foot on the base and awkward to bend over to rewind an extension cord at the same time. Sadly, this device is also poorly made as the winding handle broke off the second time that I used it. Perhaps the cord that I stored on the wheel was too long for the wheel but the cord and the wheel were both recommended by Amazon together. Having said that, users are unlikely to need this device to hold shorter extension cords. In short, don't waste your money on this poor product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm not the greatest","review":"It badley needs some kind of moveable trac to keep the cord from stacking up around one edge or another.

I do not find the material very moving or interesting. Perhaps some better charts or some different musical colors could have been helpful, some of the songs were just pleading for a vibraphone or a horn to add some color. And Gore's thin voice does not strike me as very expressive at all.Perhaps against the 60s singers from her era, this is a good CD.

It's not hard to see that Nash is sympathetic to many of these causes, and clearly this book isn't for folks who prefer to view things in strictly economic terms, but still it is quite well-balanced in tone, and the scholarship is really impressive.

And it is a great deal easier to use than PhotoShow Deluxe 4. Which reminds me of trying to buy a used car. The salesman (in this case Nero) continuously tries to sell you something else. Never mind your concerns about the product you just bought. This product is not user friendly and, for me, failed to save the slide show and since there is no SAVE button... I sent \\"Nerosupport\\" an Email five days ago today. No response at all. The e-mail address used is contained in the manual. Deluxe 4 does not show a list of the music you desire to play and the film strip of the pictures you want to use is so small; I can't make out what is what. There are some great functions... some just don't work.Would have to rate this Nero product a Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nero PhotoShow fun to use, but.....","review":"Nero PhotoShow Deluxe 4 is fun and easy to use, but I didn't find it more useable or having more features than the one I had previously downloaded for free on the Nero site. I had hoped to have a program that I could use to create slide shows and save them on a CD, but that was not the case. They still have to be uploaded to Nero's website and then CD's are available for purchase to viewers who want them. I don't want to have to pay for a photo show that I already purchased a program to create. I would not recommend this program when a program providing the same options can be downloaded for free on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Use Mp3 Audio","review":"I purchased Photoshow 4 Deluxe specifically to put my Mp3 tracks to a slide show. It does not work as advertised. Even after going through support they ran into the same problems and said they would get back to me which they did not. Otherwise it works well if you like the alternate artist music they provide(I do not) Disappointed in their ability to update to fix problems. Even their Photoshow 5 did not fix the problem as I would have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nero PhotoShow Deluxe 4","review":"The program is 5 star BUT I would never purchase a computer direct software download again from Nero. First time I purchased the program on a direct download, most things were complicated but ok. Lost the program when I had to restore my computer. Having purchased extented download coverage I tried, tried and tried to get another download without success. The Nero Company just continue to send me e-mails that never solved the problem but drove this 75 year old man wacko! Finally ordered and paid for the software to be shipped to my home. Thats how great this program performs once you have it in your computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nero Photoshow Delux","review":"The reason I bought this product was to make slide shows to play on my dvd player. When I tried to create the dvd the program would time out over and over. I would waste 2 hours and then it would time out at 96% done. When I asked for help from support I got a three page solution that would take a long time and would only be understood by a technician. I am not happy and would not buy another product from nero. The program itself was great but for the purpose of watching the shows off your pc it was a disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay creal bars","review":"Just found these at my local health food store and thought i'd give it a try.

Warning!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent offering from a little known Bay Area group","review":"Haunted By Waters was a short-lived Bay Area outfit, one I had seen live back around 1994. They blended ethnic and folk elements -- middle eastern, especially -- with rock and prog into a stew that at times echoes Peter Gabriel and Loreena McKennitt. The musicianship is top notch throughout on Like The Dust and the recording quality captures the nuances and breadth of dynamics of the band's electric-acoustic complexion. The individual musicians have long since drifted off to other pursuits, but on this album they made something special. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Supplement","review":"I purchased this as a supplemental workbook for my son's 2nd grade English homeschooling curriculum.

How far are the times of \\"Dune\\"...This novel is based on a paper-thin plot, with an insufficient character development, an excruciatingly slow pace and no particularly interesting \\"galactic\\" order.The main character is unfortunately as cardboard as a Campbellian SF hero and the other characters are not much better.Another main race besides humans, the batrachian-like Gowachin, is described with few details, and thus their behaviour appears most of the time rather inexplicable.The conclusion is as foggy as the whole novel, with lots of subplots still pending (hopefully no sequel is planned).I did like very much Herbert's early work, but this novel is definitely below par, as it does not achieve \\"suspension of disbelief\\". Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable Meanandering Melodrama","review":"This was one of the most annoying pure geek sci-fi books I have ever read. From the improbable setup of having two conflicting cultures existing in an enclosed environment for thousands of years to the total lack of character depth to the handwaving \\"judicial\\" finale. Suspension of disbelief is asking too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herbert has once again proved his genius.","review":"This book puzzled, yet fascinated me at first with its complexity...especially since I did not then know that the first book in this story was \\"Whipping Star\\".However, \\"The Dosadi Experement\\" has become and will continue to be one of my favourites in science fiction stories.Herbert had an unparalleled genius for world building and I treasure his memory.Give yourselves a treat and read both \\"Whipping Star\\" and \\"The Dosadi Experiment\\".You will NOT regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fiction","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise, as it was my first Frank Herbert read outside of the Dune series. I really enjoyed the tale, and like many of his stories, the second half is the best. The Dosadi culture was very intriguing and still keeps me thinking; the Gowachin were also interesting. Herbert's recurring interest in human potential and societal pressures is again pushed to extremes, produces a provocative and entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dosadi - Wow!","review":"This is absolutely my favorite piece of science fiction writing! Everything I have read since (by Herbert, or other authors) has disappointed me on some level. Definately a page-turner! The plot is complex,creative and intriguiging, but more compelling than The Jesus Incident. The characters are well developed (I love the McKie character!), and he includes at least one very strong female character. The writing is tight and keeps you interested in the story line. Herbert does a good job of keeping \\"aliens\\" alien.I am very disappointed to see that it is out of print. It is a much better novel than Dune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find but worth it especially in today��s world","review":"This book is not easy to find, but its appearance in eform is a treasure meant to be read, I don't give five stars, yet like much of Herbert's writing deserves it. Like dune there is no easy way to summerize this book, but like very few others it holds a place of honor in my bookshelf faded, discolored, dog eared, purchased at a used book store and I will never part with it. Definetly worth your time and deep thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"What science fiction should be,","review":"This book is hugely overshadowed by Dune. It was bit confusing the first time I read it, but the universe of Dosadi has some truly original sentient species that more than made up for this. Like all of Herbert's great novels, the Dosadi Experiment is rich both in surface plots and underlying meanings. Anyone who enjoyed the Dune universe should love this book; it is Herbert at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"adorable, but wimpy","review":"This shoe is just as adorable as it is in the photo. What wasn't advertised when I bought them, was that these are basically a driving shoe. You know-- skinny suede sole with nubbies on the bottom. Plus, the weaving is very delicate (which is beautiful). I have been very careful not to wear them anywhere where they would get wet. I even passed my turn in line for a bathroom stall because the floor looked damp. In other words, more cautious than one should have to be with shoes. With all that care, after four wearings, the bottom of one shoe is beginning to wear through the little woven straps of ultra soft leather. If these shoes had the sole of a shoe rather than a slipper, they would be my favorite pair of shoes. Now that they're falling apart, I can't wear them (looks tacky). Outside of a long car, plane, or train trip, I doubt they'll see daylight again.

But Warners' habit of adding more and more extraneous material at the beginning of the discs is getting pretty annoying. This time, it's an intro by Whoopi Goldberg (the same one on all four discs) that, nothing against Whoopi, is a complete waste of time. Who's gonna watch that? When I pop one of these discs in, all I want is to hear \\"Merrily We Roll Along\\" or \\"The Merry-go-round Broke Down.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of them","review":"Probably not one of the favorites out of the volumes thus far. It had a few shorts that really enjoyed in this volume, but still overall it doesnt do for me what the first two did. I enjoyed this for what it was and that's about all. Not a whole lot more than that, less in the way of really stand out shorts. I'm not saying it isnt purchase worthy because i believe it is but only if your a serious Looney Tunes collector and what to have all the collections that have been released so far. Just a bit above average in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Looney Laughs","review":"I'm glad I purchased this collection because I needed a good laugh.

More Looney Tunes on DVD!","review":"I bought this DVD last week and I enjoyed it as I am a fan of these characters! All My life I have loved cartoons, but I only enjoyed Disney. However, as I grew older I learned to love other cartoons and fortunately the Looney Tunes are one of them! One thing however that I feel that was not necessary was all those introductions on each disc with Whoopi Goldberg about the sterytopes.

And, since I have declared them as art they must now be looked at as such.I just can't wait til WB releases \\"Bugs Nips the Nips\\" and just a word of advice to Warner Brothers; you'd be much better off using either Leonard Maltin or Robert Osbourne (from TCM) as the host!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noteables that are still absent...","review":"Can someone please explain how Blacque Jacques Shellacque and 'Operation: Rabbit' don't make the cut for three volumes of four-CD sets?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looney Tunes & WB (I want more & more DVDs...like this)","review":"Excellent!Better than vol.1 & 2!Can't wait for Volume 4(I hope WB will release 2 volumes per year, because the Looney Tunes complete collection is over 700 shorts!!!--->10 sets of 4 DVDs with 60 shorts...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose Whoopi!","review":"I've always loved these cartoons, so I'd give the 'toons themselves 5 stars.

When I saw the postings here, I went back and listened to what she was ranting about. All I can say is thank goodness for the PC thought police for keeping us all on the path.

Please Warner lets leave the politics out of these releases. Face it if people dont like these cartoons they are not going to buy them.

Stop wasting my disc space, Whoopi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible the worst in the series...","review":"For my money it's a toss-up between volume 3 and volume 5 as to which is the worst in this series. This set has a fairly good Bugs disc, but even that has a few mediocre cartoons on it (Hare Remover, The Wabbit Who Came to Supper). I have no use for much of the second disc except for the last 4 or 5 cartoons, and the first half of the third disc contains clunkers that didn't even make me smile, let alone laugh. The fourth disc is much, much better, but still has a few snoozers on it. There are some great cartoons on here that are not available elsewhere as there was no Spotlight Collection that year so this is still a must-buy for Looney Tunes Lovers, but I wouldn't touch it until you've bought Golden Collections 1, 2, 4, and 6 first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Brothers Murder Looney Tunes Classics!","review":"The release of 'Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 3' is completely ruined by the ungodly addition of a politically correct statement by the super-hag Whoopi Goldberg. Who wants to watch anything that has been 'put into context' by the likes of that foul-mouthed opportunist? I do not think elitist crowd in Bel Air will be buying this release so what is your point Warner Brothers? In my mind, you will never be forgiven for this travesty. Why don't you go back and tag all the other quality classics in your library and destroy them too while churning out the garbage that is trademark of WB today.

And this one is an abomination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I remember seeing many of these cartoons as a child and wondered why I never saw many of them again. This set does indeed include some cartoons with innappropriate racial or sexual references that children may not understand but don't need to learn. However, for the mature Looney Tunes fan, this is a great set of early cartoons that display the creativity of the Warner Bros. studio in the 1930s-1950s. Some of them are classic cartoons released during World War II and some cartoons that were only intended for servicemen (definitely not for children!). A great set for serious Looney Tunes fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep'em comming there's much more","review":"The Warners folks are at least consistent with the Golden Colection series. Here are my opinions of set 3:This Collection: Great in general but as inconsistent as the rest in production. By that I mean (see note on disk 2)Disk 1(Bugs): Absolutely Classic. Best of the group. Most consistent to what I'd like to see the whole set like. Don't miss the \\"Honey Mousers\\" in the Vault.Disk 2(Porky): Classic. I'm not sure why they broke sequence/fomula and included Daffy on this one too (they both deserve their own disks). Though \\"Daffy Duck Slept Here\\" is an absolute classic. Remember Hymie?Disk 3(misc chars): Disappointing but not a show stopperDisk 4(All Stars): Classics.A note about all 3 collections: Not enough Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn or Marvin the Martian. The 1st disk in all the collections is the best. It would be nice if they put the dates, or at least the year, of release next to the titles on the jacket.Worth the cash like the 1st 2 collections.

I've always loved the Looney Tunes like those featured on the 1 1/2 hour Saturday morning cartoon show (I believe it was called \\"The Bugs Bunny / Roadrunner Show\\"), but have never grown to like the black & white shorts or the \\"Woodland Band\\" type of Warner Bros cartoons. The pre-release reviews had hinted that this set was heavy on those shorts, but, not knowing the titles of most of the Tunes (and doubting the veracity of such reviews), I gave the Volume 3 Collection a try. Unfortunately (for me), the pre-release reviews were right on -- one complete disc and parts of the others are black/white or the era with the super-sized Porky Pig and more animal-like Bugs and Sylvester.If you are more inclined to enjoy the Roadrunner/Sylvester & Tweety/\\"Duck, Wabbit, Duck\\" years, hold off on this set, as there are very few cartoons that will be to your liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - SOME DEFECTIVE SETS OUT THERE!!","review":"I purchased this volume along with volumes 1 & 2.

These cartoons were made at a time before political correctness. We are the only country in the world that has a problem with cartoons. Why because we give people like Whoopie Goldberg a stage.

A comic novel with a delicate touch, it loses nothing by being set in the 1950s. We recognise the characters and situations. For me, the understated romance between Mildred Lathbury and Everard Bone carries echoes of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I defy any woman not to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satire of life in postwar London","review":"Excellent women are women who make the tea, manage the rummage sale, and arrange the flowers in the church. Mildred Lathbury wryly observes the lives of her neighbors and fellow parishioners as she goes about her quiet and lonely life of service. Barbara Pym is one of the best overlooked novelists of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snicker, chortle, snicker, weep","review":"Mildred Lathbury is a hilariously sharp but kind observer as she becomes embroiled in the romantic messes of both the Father at her church and her exotic new neighbours. Along the way, Mildred reevaluates her own role as one of the \\"excellent women\\" who can always be relied upon for a hot cup of tea or help polishing church brasses.Excellent Women often had me cackling out loud, though sometimes it was the kind of laughter that comes from giving the funny bone a solid whack on the table. The subject matter and understated humour justify comparisons with Austen's Persuasion though the tone and style remind me rather more of Rose MacAuley's Towers of Trebizond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"This is definitely not a Jane Austen novel, though it is enjoyable in its own right. The protagonist, Mildred Lathbury, is also our narrator -- a woman who is, generally speaking, at peace with her spinsterhood. She is a thirtyish single woman of good works, but she is also surprisingly funny. Sometimes she is downright canny regarding those people with whom she deals; at other times she seems to be endearingly dim.I really enjoyed this book, my first by Barbara Pym, and will look for more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected.","review":"Susan Branch recommended this book on her blog and I was not diappointed--perfect for light summer reading.

Everyone in that group is just mad about her, so I felt inspired to read her too, to see what all the fuss was about.Excellent Women is the story of Mildred Lathbury. Actually, the book isn't so much about Mildred as it is about the people around her; Mildred, one of the \\"excellent women,\\" has a sharp eye for detail and a subtle kind of wit. Unmarried, she lives and works in London and is heavily involved in church activities. The other major characters are Helena and Rocky Napier, a couple whose relationship is on the rocks, as well as Everard Bone, a surly anthropologist. It's a novel of romantic misadventures, with lively characters. Although the setting is bucolic, and the humor so subtle that at times it can't be noticed, there's something wonderful about the way the characters interact with one another. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of Pym's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY DAMN GOOD","review":"i like the band cold. amazing band. i also liked the song gone away and so i bought this cd. i found a good number of bands and songs here. i find soundtracks and compliations are a good source to find new music. i like trust company's \\"falling apart\\" and i never knew staind could sound so heavy. \\"take it\\" is a brutal musical assault, although i am a little tired of the voice from staind. .... i heard some of staind's other stuff and was so-so on it but this song is haevy and a great riff. good drums and all in all a killer song.also worth noting is \\"break your silence\\" by cinder. what an amazing sound they get. awesome song whcih i found myself skipping other tracks to hear. following that is a band called marz with \\"out of the cage.\\" another killer tune and a band to watch. it stuck in my head long after the cd ended.definitely a cd that surprised me. i did not expect it to be as good as it is.milkboydanny@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Man, I can't believe Cold, Weezer, and Unwritten Law actually stooped to the level of doing something like this.

The material it is made from is too stiff and has no flexibility. It is very cumbersome to carry, and I almost lost a $400.00 cell phone in one of the shallow pockets. I just don't like the way it is constructed. I only use it when I am going a short distance to the beach. I am still looking for something softer and more user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Adult IS appropriate","review":"Enough with Romeo and Juliet, enough with 'near-pornography'! The fact that this is a tragedy reminiscent of Shakespeare is used as a contrast of R&J;, not a retelling.Its flaws are of logical plot turns and character, not a misplacement in the young adult genre. It IS a young adult novel, written about a boy and girl more realistic, perhaps, than parents would like their children to read about, but it is far from pornographic (look in your school libraries for Tropic of Cancer and Ulysses if you want something to get angry about). Much is said here about Chapter 6, but what of Chapter 13? Is sex so much worse than an innocent's death? Young people read more graphic things in Cosmo and the Bible.This novel is about powerlessness and self-doubt in the face of Fate, and in that it succeeds better than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and overly simplistic","review":"This book was a real disappointment. There were far too many convenient coincidences, and the short length of time during which Chris goes from \\"innocent\\" to quick-to-suspect-the-worst-of-everyone is simply not believable.There was only one point that had a trace of Pullman as I know him from the brilliant \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy: when the book discusses how the loss of innocence (in the metaphorical, Garden of Eden sense) is not just bad, but also good in that people who lose their innocence then have the knowledge they need to consciously do good in the world.The book is also manipulative in that it opens with the sentence: Chris met the girl he was going to kill..... and then does not follow through with a conclusion that supports that statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Racy Romance Novel Sure to Keep Those Pages Turning!","review":"\\"The White Mercedes\\" is really a very good book, but much different from Pullman's other novels in some ways. This book takes place in modern-day Britain, and includes a great romance, and of course, a mystery (without which it wouldn't meet the definition of a Philip Pullman novel.) Because of a few racy scenes, I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone under twelve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed \\"Count Karlstein,\\" \\"The Golden Compass,\\" \\"The Subtle Knife,\\" and \\"The Ruby in the Smoke\\" and its sequels, but I was very disappointed with \\"The White Mercedes.\\" It is a most depressing, negative story. The writing is inferior to that in Mr. Pullman's other books, and some of the content is almost pornographic. This might be all right in a book written for grown-ups (though I wouldn't care to read it), but it doesn't belong in a YA book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan of Golden Compass","review":"A very different flavor than the Golden Compass series but still very good. Sad ending with a Romeo and Juliet type of twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"...Basically I think that this book was way to simple. I dunno if I was dazed while I was reading or what, but there were a lot of detailes and complexity that was missing. The whole book was kinda boring and kinda pointless as well.

Its not even original, Its a reteeling of Romeo and Juliet. The plot twists is really bad and predictable. COME ON PEOPLE! DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT ITS REALISTIC. I MEAN, BY COINCIDENCE, SHE JUST HAPPENS TO-- I DONT WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY. If your curious and bored enough, read the book. Even 10 year-olds can see that this is not realistic, Phil Pullman is a fairy tale writer and he should stick to that By the way, the sex scene is not that shocking, its just plain..let me put it this way, it was written by a horny, bald, peverted 40 year old man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and in initial packaging","review":"Great Candies, these were fresh and soft/hard as expected and wanted them to be.

I personally am not a lesbian, and don't feel that this is a \\"lesbian song\\" as I've heard some describe it. I could care less who Sinead goes to bed with, as long as she makes music like this! I would love to see this song become a sort of anthem for females of every age, because the truth of it is undeniable, and only comes with the experience of heartbreak and disappointment due to the princess-finding-the-prince fairy tale. I think it's a woman's true victory when she realizes that the only people in this world worthy of trust, the only ones worth depending on, are herself and God."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.6 stars ... Ehh ~","review":"A very mediocre Sinead single here. The trippy reggae remix of \\"Rebel Song\\" is terrible. The loopy sound completely clashes with the serious emotion the lyrics were written to reflect. I have never yet found a good remix of one of her songs, however, so it wasn't too much of a surprise. While I my grandest hope was on her take of the Irish classic \\"Her Mantle So Green,\\" it doesn't even compare to previously performed traditionals such as \\"On Raglan Road\\". So for those like myself who are looking for understated gems of the old Sinead caliber, in my opinion this single is wholly negligible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"in-the-middle\\" Buddhist Magazine","review":"I'm a little \\"new\\" to Buddhism. I've been trying to learn more over the past few years. I find that Buddhism is a lot like Christianity for the fact that there are lots of different \\"types\\". There's not one Christian religion, there are lots of different ones. . .Baptist. . . Church of Christ. . .Methodist. . . .etc. etc. etc. This is the same way with Buddhism, and honestly, one of the reasons I find Buddhism so \\"difficult\\".Having said that, \\"Tricycle\\" is a magazine that shares all points of view. The publisher tries to give each type (or tradition, as it's often called) of Buddhism a voice with having articles from a variety of people each issue.Though, to be honest, I'm still VERY confused about Buddhism, I really like \\"Tricycle\\" because though it's not really a magazine for \\"beginners\\", like me to learn about Buddhism, per se, it does have great articles, and I have found it helpful and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written","review":"Hard to compare, since there isn't a lot of competition in the world of spiritual-inspired magazines.

And, my favorite bit, they don't repeat themselves every few issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Editorial Integrity","review":"This magazine is not produced by Buddhists. Unfortunately this means that people like the Executive Editor have little or no understanding of what it takes to produce articles that are helpful to people interested in or practicing Buddhism. Furthermore, they produce a sort of Oprah or Dr. Phil type magazine with plastic \\"experts\\" contributing, as opposed to those with real work practice. Of the few genuine experts that do contribute, they mostly do so to promote a book or a tour. Disappointing that this is merely a bandwagon publication.

Holding has many good intentions, but his efforts in apologetics are marred by his use of mockery and insult. As a brother in the Lord I cannot support Holding's ministry. Mockery and insult have no place in any ministry representing Jesus Christ, much less apologetics.

Each artist is given 2 to 6 pages of pictures and write up. In my oppinion only 6 or 7 artists are showing innovative work and they are deffinetly worth seeing. The rest is bulky sweaters and shawls and a few children's designs. If you love oversized sweaters, this is the book for you. A few of the photos are \\"artfully out of focus\\" not good for seeing the work. Check it out at the library first or buy a used copy if this interests you. 26 Patterns are at the rear of the book. The patterns are for advanced knitters."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Serious Collectors Only","review":"After hearing Falick on a podcast and hearing the \\"story behind the book,\\" I picked this up at the local yarn store to leaf through it -- and quickly remembered why I hand't bought it the first five times I'd looked at it.I find the concept of this book somewhat garbled -- is it a pattern book? If so, there aren't enough interesting patterns to make it worth the investment (most are very dated). Is it a profile book? If so, there really isn't enough in-depth info about either the yarn stores or the store owners to make it entertaining.The photography, however, is gorgeous. So I've finally categorized this book as a \\"collectible.\\" If you're looking for knitting patterns, don't bother. But if you want something pretty to set on your coffee table -- or if you own every other knitting book out there and need this one to complete your library -- then go for it. Otherwise, leaf through it at the store, admire the pictures, then put it gently back on the shelf and walk away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really amazing pictures","review":"I agree with Lois, this is not a pattern book, although there are patterns in it.The book is divided up into regions, such as Southwest, Northwest, etc. and each shows locale-themed knitwear and outdoorsy knitters/spinners doing their thing outside in the fresh air... usually with some sort of pet or livestock in the back/foreground. There are lots of full-page, color, glossy pic sthat are very beautiful. Oh, and what patterns there are are tucked in the back.Primarily this book is a dialog on various artists around the country and their work. I haven't examined every picture, but it looks like not a single one was taken indoors. And that's the feel for the patterns as well. Lots of sweaters and wraps and jackets and blankets, all brightly colored and intricately designed. No easy stuff in this book, it all appears to be fairly challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"beauty","review":"A beautiful book. But why buy it?

Threads are hanging around the face that shouldn't be there. Their necks are as thick as their bellies. The tail is flat and looks like it belongs on a beaver. These animals were bought for a children's Christmas charity. I hope the kids won't be disappointed because I certainly was.

The advent of the \\"Buzz Bin\\" made us think about \\"alternative\\" music. Once an indie haven for those who didn't want to get involved with cheesy 80's pop or hair metal, it is now big-bucks stuff. This CD gives us all of the latter - Cracker, Stone Temple Pilots, Danzig, etc. All were great songs the first twenty-three times we heard them. We bought their albums only to have their best song blasted at us again and again. Don't buy this - you'll lose even more appreciation for the very songs that made rock music what it is today. Instead, go buy something awesome like Sunny Day Real Estate or Belle and Sebastian that won't get overplayed by greedy television personalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This book is a disjointed collection of \\"essays\\" about the various aspects of flamenco: cante, guitar, dance, castanets/palmas. History is thrown in somewhat randomly; parts of the book are repetitive. Occasionally you glean some kind of interesting fact (e.g. the flamenco scale is the same as in Indian and Arabic music), but it is otherwise not put together well enough to be informative. I second the view that the nostalgic, pro-gypsy, modern-flamenco-is-not-really-flamenco bias starts to get annoying. You get the message that the only real flamenco is performed by gypsies in the privacy of their homes, which *you'll* certainly never get to see so you might as well give up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop letting [some people] review things","review":"Dont listen to these [people]who are saying \\"I met Fred Durst and you will feel like you know him persanally once you read this book!\\" ...

Of course that should be mildly obvious by the fact that they charge nothing for it. \\"You get what you pay for\\" and all that.The main problems it has is print speed and quality.

Their own cartridges have to be cleaned weekly or they plug. The paper feed is a piece of junk. The on line service is no help. There is a reason they GIVE these printers away with complete systems.

What a waste of hard-earned money: don't even waste your time comparing this product to other printers, go with an HP or Canon instead.

However I thought my fellow Unitarian Universalists out there would be interested to know that the remaining 5% of the movie is about the good guys - a UU church that speaks out against the Army of God.This film is a must-see, just don't expect it to put you in a good mood. This is NOT a good film for encouraging interfaith dialogue. This is a film about an irreconcilable clash of values and where the battle-lines are drawn.

It should be called \\"Sexual Astrology for the Mentally Ill.\\" The claims it makes are absurd and outrageous. Taurus's being turned on by feces and filth, cancers being turned on by incest, Scorpios being turned on by extreme Sadomasochistic sex. That's just to name a few. I was surprised it didn't claim that Sagittarius was turned on by bestiality. It takes a trait of a sun sign and intensifies that trait into sexual perversion. My friends and I even joke about this book because everyone who I've shown this book to can't believe the claims that are made about their sign. It is completely inaccurate.The only positive point it has, is that it starts out SOMEWHAT accurate and then it seems to turn into a sick list of what sun signs maybe with sexual or mental problems would be into.I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially those who aren't familiar with astrology."},{"rating":"1","title":"A generalization of sun signs","review":"I also read this book many years ago. Someone just recently sent me a copy. There is a small amount of truth just going by the sun signs, but I wonder how the author can acutally claim the sexual traits of every person born under these signs. Then all of these people read about you or someone and assume that this is what they are like altogther. It's actually kind of humorous in a way. But people are made up of more than just their sun sign. So don't judge a book by it's cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, even if your aren't into astrology","review":"As a person that doesn't really believe in all this astrology stuff, I found the book to be quite entertaining. Everything was dead on. It gives you great insight about the way to please your partner and yourself sexually. A good book to have on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must have","review":"I had a copy of this book for several years and some how it disappeared.

Many of the author's statements written in the late 70's are totally unsubstantiated by any facts or figures. For example, the author states that a Scorpio male will not take NO for an answer even to the point of rape. The author tries to substantiate these broad conclusions by referring to one or two personal acquaintances or hearsay. For the Pisces female, the author states that her dependent nature can lead her into a master-slave relationship. Again, this just doesn't jive with the current BDSM activity and communities I've known. Yes, the Piscean female can be dependent but master-slave relationship? Just how did the author reach that conclusion? Overall an entertaining book that does offer some insights into the personalities of others but readers should bear in mind that the book was written in the late 70's and not take it as absolute gospel."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting info on sexual compatibility","review":"Not an astrology person, but open to new age things and was turned onto it by a woman I dated several years ago. Got this book when I recently started dating somebody new. I found it interesting to go beyond the basic \\"What's Your Sign?\\" (Sun Sign) style compatibility you see at a very basic level. I definitely feel there is something to it, although I am not ruling my life by it.If you enjoy astrology, I think you'll like this. If you're like me, and just dabble from time to time, you will also find it interesting, perhaps more so. Even if you think it's total bunk, it will give you interesting things to consider in your relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"If astrology was taught in school this would be the text book","review":"One of the first astrology books I read. Lots of details but has some really out there parts basically making people seem crazy. It reads like a text books not a light read. Also seems really dated but it was written in the 70's. I'd recommend sexcopes for more of a fun view on sexual astrology."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG BOOK","review":"The wrong book was saent to me - the packing slip listed the correct book but whoever was supposed to place the book in the package failed to pay attention.

I have owned this book for a long time and discussed it with numerous individuals and couples. Everyone seems to agree that it is very Accurate and amazingly easy to comprehend or use.Most Astrology books are boring and unexplainable to \\"Non-Believers,\\" but Sexual Astrology speaks for and proves itself.The advice in this work is sound, and very helpful in relationship matters.

I haven't lost any weight doing this video...I've actually gained muscle weight. It is great for lifting the butt too. I personally like the second butt workout better than the first. They tell you that you need exercise bands, and a ball, but it's a killer workout without them. The one workout that does call for the ball, I just roll my towel up like a ball and it works just great trust me.

She generally incorporates very effective ballet-style dance moves with aerobic and even strength training exercises. I have most all her DVD's and use them often. With this one, however - I was a little disappointed. It is mainly focused on losing belly fat right after pregnancy, so most of the moves just didn't seem to apply to me. My fault for not reading the video description better before buying, I suppose. She's alot more \\"subdued\\" and well--boring in this video, in my opinion. Usually she's very upbeat and motivating, without being annoying. Women in post pregnancy may enjoy this, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad follow up","review":"This is exactly that. I very poor follow up to the other series. The humor is scant to none and the movies have been turned into hollywood representations that p.g. wodehouse would shudder at. The stories are less absurd and more fantastic and the characters chosen to act in this series (excepting wonderful stephen fry and hugh laurie) are poor excuses for actors. If it weren't for the slight resemblance to story lines of wodehouse's books, all would have been lost. (let me note also though, that the books the movies are patterned after, are not even jeeves stories at all but another collection of wodehouse stories.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Read","review":"The represented view of the author displays a patwah usually reserved for Latif Khan.

They asked me if I would like a refund and like an idiot I said, \\"No, just send me another one\\". The replacement Klipsch system arrived and it played great for about 14 months and then NOTHING. No power from the sub! Same problem but now my warranty is up. Klipsh has a way of designing things to work just past the warranty. Shame on Klipsch for making such a shoddy product. Shame on me for asking for a replacement and getting burned twice. Heed all these warnings my friends. I would buy used speakers at a garage sale before I would buy another Klipsh product. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another voice to the chorus","review":"I bought these to replace my very old, well worn v2-400s which were being retired, despite a fair number of bad reviews at the time and they failed within a week. Sent to Klipsch for repair and they failed again 6 months later. The whole experience from failure to support was very dissapointing, especially from my ex-favourite computer audio company. I will be reluctantly moving to Logitech for my computer speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Good When it Last - Piece of Junk","review":"It sounds great when it works, my first amp died within the warranty period so Klipsch send me another amp after I send them mine but it too almost 2 months of turn around time and mailing charge. After another 9 months of use, just yesterday the bass started to go again, I am not sending it back for repair this time and it is going to the trash. Klipsch should never release a product like that, every forum I goes to the user has the same faith. If your speaker is working right now, good luck and enjoy it, it will go the same way with all the others in the near future. I am going to get the Logitech Z5500 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Klipsch Thx 5.1 - Two Failures!!","review":"Of course, there is a design weakness in these speakers, probably worthy of a Class Action Suit against Klipsch. I've had two system failures in two years, similar to the many other reviews here. I've already paid for one round of repairs. Contacts with Klipsch take a lot of time and get no where unless you are willing to pay them to repair a problem apparently endemic to the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed","review":"These were great speakers when they worked. Failed after 2 years, Klipsch wanted over $150 to repair them. Sub died and would make aloud buzzing noise. I don't think I'd buy a set of Klipsch Speakers again, its such a shame because when they worked the sound and base was amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best sound from a 5.1 system... while they work!!!","review":"I have had this system for 2 years, and for that time it was, simply put - AMAZING. It was the best sound I had heard from any 5.1 system for computers. My friends were amazed by them. Then the sub stopped working due to 1/2 of the amp failing. Its a very common occurrence with the BASH amplifier included in this system.I give it 2 stars because while it is working, it is the best. But far too many people experience failures from them for me to be able to recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Klipsch","review":"I bought this speaker system about 15 months ago through Dell while buying a new computer. I use it for my stereo and asked them for the best I could buy. When it went out a month ago I was devastated. I took it apart and tried to fix it myself. Not a good idea. Did not work out and I was VERY frustrated. Wasn't sure what to do. After reading some of these reviews I was even more frustrated. So I went out and bought the Bose system and was EXTREMELY disappointed! At that point I decided to take my chances and sent the sub back to Klipsch after coming very close to tossing the entire system. It cost me about 60 in shipping and another 60 from Klipsch to fix the problem. They fixed it and shipped it back within 10 days. While I liked speaker system before, I love it now! I think there was a defect with the system from day one. Even with that defect, it was still better than anything else I had come across. Whatever they did with the repair work really did the trick! Thanks Klipsch!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was \\"klipsched\\"","review":"I bought this system as part of a Dell XPS 4 gaming system. It was the best option they offered in the speaker department and after reading the reviews on Amazon and other sites seemed like a reasonable choice. My reaction from day one was, \\"that's it ?\\" The sound is tinny, marginal at best and certainly not worth the price. It's almost painful listening to mp3's and radio on them. The construction is cheap and plasticy. The speakers have no directional adjustments like angle or tilt at all to direct the sound. I was traveling during much of the 30 return window but just assumed that when I had the time to tinker with them I could tweak the sound to be full bodied and even. Unfortunately that didn't happen. I'm considering selling them on e-bay. Don't waste your money. Even Dell has switched to Logitech on their XPS system offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but mine failed too.","review":"I bought these at the full retail price when they were first introduced. They worked well for 2 years then the amp apparently failed. I still use the speakers with a good quality home theatre receiver and a new subwoofer.I read about the amp failures in the previous ProMedias but the problem was supposed to be addressed in the Ultras. Not for me.Given the choice again, I would have purchased a decent home theatre system to start with and used that with my computer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"They only lived for 16 months","review":"Do not buy.

It sounds like I was one of the lucky ones as mine lasted two years. But I really didn't use them all that much and I don't blast the volumes. When you spend this kind of many on a product it should at least last 5 years or so. I've never had any other speaker brand just stop working on me before. Worse of all is to hear that Klipsch is charging a lot of money to repair their faulty products and that people had problems with them even after they were \\"repaired\\". Well, I'm not wasting time and money on repairing them. I'm just switching to Logitech. No more Klipsch ever again for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID, DO NOT BUY","review":"i also bought this from dell back in 04, it worked for 2 years before the amp died, all the satellites worked but the sub did not.well 3 replacement amps later ( $90 x 3 = $270 ) i give up and have trashed these speakers. i'll look for something else.1st replacement lasted about 7 mos2nd lasted 2 mos3rd lasted about 24hrs, YES 24 HOURS."},{"rating":"1","title":"klipsch equals poor quality","review":"I happen to have gotten 4 years(awesome) out of my Promedias, before they ceased making any sound, a poor investment for over $500 spent.

Oh I will replace these items but not with any Klipschs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It finally happened again!","review":"This is the second system I've been through due to amp burnout.

I never ran these over half volume so there realy isnt any excuse for this.Klipsch refuses to acknowledge they have a problem and wants you to fork over $60.00 for repair, plus $35.00 for shipping to keep having them repaired.I finally got smart and went with a 7.1 amp and JBL speaker system.Beware if you buy these, They do sound great but wont last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable!","review":"[...]This is all you need to know about these!I had all of the speaker boards burn up on me.

Crisp, clear, sparkling highs, clear, tight, unmuddied bass... truly spectacular.... until they fail.The power supply is under-designed, and fails at a very high rate. More aggravating, Klipsch refuses to repair/upgrade the production components, and charges $90 to replace known failure prone components WITH THE SAME PART NUMBERS!A couple of years ago, I located a repairman (in Texas IIRC) who did an upgrade of the subject parts in the power supply, and have had no problems after the upgrade... Do not recall his name or address, but since this is a well documented problem, I suspect any qualified electronics shop could do the same thing for about what Klipsch charges for reinstalling the same failing parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Klipsch promedia ultra 5.1","review":"The Speakers worked for about 2 weeks, I thought it was something I did to cause them to go out on me. Because I still had the box for these speakers, I boxed it up and it has been sitting in my garage for 5 years. I just recently pulled it out to see if I could fix the problem. Everything works as far as speakers and subwoofers. What failed was the Circuit board on the Subwoofer. Now I am looking at trying to purchase the Circuit board. But after reading these reviews I will probably just buy a different subwoofer that has quality reviews and recycle the speakers into a whole new system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware! Klipsch Promedias have a high failure rate!","review":"I bought my set of Promedias with my new computer. The sound was indeed exceptional. But, after a year of use, they failed. I went to use them and got nothing but muffled bass and clicking. Then, I went to their forums. Seems everyone has been having the exact same problems. Some are lucky enough to get a year or two, and some measured the lifespan of their promedias in minutes. To top it off, they want $60 to fix a defective product since the warranty lasts only one year. Then, after paying the $60 to fix Klipsch's own problem, many have reported that the SECOND set failed. Buyer beware. These speakers are about as shoddy as they come and Klipsch is one shady company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, but sub still has problems","review":"I just wanted to throw in my two cents. I bought this system a little over a month ago (I didn't look at any reviews because my brother has been selling audio equipment for a number of years and told me this was a great system). This system does sound great, however three and a half weeks after I bought it, the sub stopped working. That's when I looked at the reviews online. Even though it's been almost two years since other reviews stated that Klipsch was aware of the problem and had corrected it, apparently there are still some flaws. I immediately boxed my system back up and returned it.This system does sound great, but if you are going to buy it, make sure you get an extended warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Puchase - Even worse customer support","review":"I bought these speakers and they broke over a year into it. I went to the Klipsch forums and saw a lot of people with failures....and repeat failures after getting them repaired. They (tech support) wanted $90 dollars + shipping to repair.

Not only does if offer a thorough review of the literature on ethical behavior, it provides a truly detailed analysis of how the ethics code applies to a vast range of contexts, client types, and vexing clinical dilemmas. What's more, the book is filled with interesting, and sometimes entertaining case vignettes--many of them based on actual ethical complaints. No other book on the market for psychologists offers this combination of clarity and thoroughness. It is a must for the library of any serious psychology graduate student or psychologist. When I teach Ethics at the graduate level, it is the only text I require."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practicing Therapists \\"Must Read\\" Each Year","review":"Ethics in Psychology is a graduate level textbook on the subject of ethical dilemmas in counseling. The authors definitely meet their goal in exploring the APA's Ethical guidelines and applying them pratically to the practicing therapist and academic. Their use of humorous \\"psuedo-psychologists\\" illustrate well the problem of many counselors who get themselves into ethical dilemmas each year innocently. I believe every therapist and academic should read this book at least once a year in order to minimize the ethical issues that are a part of everyday practice.

This book lists the view names (anterior, posterior, superior, ventral, etc.) and gives a diagram. It even spends some time talking about cells and tissues, with a colorable diagram of a cell. This book is a MUST for med students, and would make a great reference book for physicians. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in human anatomy, for I sure am enjoying it. Also check out \\"The Physiology Coloring Book, 2nd Edition\\". Note:For this book you should have a good supply of quality colored pencils, probably about 30, including gray and black."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to learn","review":"I am a massage therapy student and this is the great way to learn all the insertions of each muscles.

Perhaps you need a bench unit. The tube has to be peeled away so it can't be resealed. Very frustrating. Been to the dico site a number of times, followed the instructions, but no help. A picture or video would so much more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try to get it out of the tube","review":"I thought that the tube that the rouge came in was a good idea. To just push what was needed out of the tube, use it, and then push the remaining back in for the next time. The rouge is so tight in the tube that it is impossible to push out. The tube had to be cut off and it is very tough. What were they thinking? Other than that, the rouge works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"OF TIGERS AND MEN BY RICHARD IVES","review":"Beautifully executed, the story of one man's quest to explore and discover the wild tiger. Detailed description of his experience in India and written with sensitivity and raw brutality, the images evoke feelings of sadness for the diminishing wild tiger and the realization that in short time, they will be an extinct species. It is a call to awareness of our wildlife in general and how man has little regard for the beauty of these animals. Poignantly written, it is a wonderful story and read...I highly recommend Mr. Ives' book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crashing bore","review":"This has to be the most boring book ever written on the subject. It was so banal that I gave up reading it after 20-30 pages. The rest was read to me in chunks by a friend on a long drive back from Corbett Tiger Reserve. It confirmed I had made a lousy choice in buying it (the hard cover edition, no less, I kick myself), and a good one in giving up reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great choice_ make sure you get a dictionary as well.","review":"It is as compact as it gets... I was amazed to see myself reading and understanding (!) websites in Urdu after 3 weeks max (i have to mention tho, that i am a native Turkish speaker with some knowledge of Persian.. that certainly helped me memorize words much faster and eaily). The topics are well chosen, giving just about info you'd need for a daily conversation (and survival). The repetition pattern helps a lot to keep words in your mind. And no matter how much I want to complain about it's load of grammar and structure, in the end, it proved successful.pros: has a mini dictionary, there is no english transliteration after unit 6 (but included as an appendix- it pushes you to try to understand), includes info about the culture and traditions as well.cons: the dictionary could've been more comprehensive (a seperate verb list would be good), not enough chance to exercise what you've learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I found this book and CD combination hard to follow along with. As the CD played it was not clear what section of the book/page I should be following.

Therefore, \\"teach yourself\\" title is not really fitting.I think this product would be easier for a person who already has some background in middle eastern languages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too difficult for a beginner","review":"This book and cd are much too difficult for me as a beginner. Learning a language should be listening and visually see as object or know what a phrase means. Written language doesn't come to children for 5- 6 years after hearing and seeing words and phrase or listening to sentences and commands.It would be nice to have a series which teaches in this manner.I once bought a children's book in Egypt that had a picture of a shoe, then a picture of a crayon.then the word was spelled below Shugron = Thank You. If they would have the pronunciation along with the pictures and spoken slowly for the learner to hear, we wouldn't give up so quickly.This series is not as advertised for a beginner. Sorry!If anyone knows where I might find children's books here in the States like the one mentioned above, i would greatly appreciate it.

It's professional produced and also incorporates the cultural aspects of the language as well.

Be forewarned if you just want to learn to speak Urdu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I am very happy with both the book and the CDs and I strongly recommend this product for anyone trying to learn Urdu.I would have give 5 stars if the book provided corrections to exercices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can a PCMCIA connection be better than USB?","review":"I've used a Iomega 250 USB zip drive for sometime and recently added the PCMCIA to USB adapter designed for it.

One of the buttons doesn't do anything at all (and, according to my game, Fifa 99, the button should pass the soccer ball), and two others are switched. The only thing that works properly is the D-Pad. Basically, this is a piece of crap. I can use it, but only when I have to (for playing 2 player games.)

My second dissapointment was when the buttons started to stick. Not a fun thing when you're deep into a critical part of a game. The buttons are bothersome and take too much effort to get them to respond effectively. The directional pad is even worse. Its awkward setup only hindered my gaming progress.

The bubble stayed in that same end of the tube (it should have moved to the opposite end).

Also, I think the artist seems to have gone too far with his imagination,as I don't recall Longarm ever owning ,or likely to own,a scarlet redvest.

This is absolutely necessary reading for those interested in minimalism and anti-consumerism. \\"Culture Jam\\" does serve readers as an instructional guide to d��tournement and culture jamming. But I caution the underlying message of violence - or encouraging it.It's clear from the variety of books I've read on this topic that there are factions within minimalistic culture.

Some of his suggestions like buy nothing day and to stop driving cars are just silly. What happened to innovative green technology? His vision seems like a step back in time 100 years.

In considering Cheever's book, I cannot fathom where to start a conclusive review because the entire title of the novel is completely misleading. My intent in reading this autobiography was to learn more about an alcoholic firsthand, in her own words. Unfortunately, there was very little substantial material written about alcoholism, its effects, repercussions, etc. In fact, had that title been different I would have probably enjoyed this bland book about a woman's life tinged with alcohol, among many other things which were given just as much attention in the book. Therefor I find it useless to judge this book because it is based on so many vacant concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"The autobiographical drinking story has been done many times before, so the subject matter here is nothing new.What's so striking different about this book is that there is almost no self-reflection. It's just a compilation of what Susan Cheever drank, the places Susan Cheever drank, the men Susan Cheeer screwed while she was drunk. We'd get much the same result of Susan had gone to Kitty Kelley and asked \\"Will you write a shallow, vapid account of my life?\\"Note Found In a Bottle is self-absored and boringly so. I imagine what keeps Susan awake at night is that most people have found this account of her drinking years Not Very Interesting. She earnestly wants the reader to believe her life was glamourous, but in fact it's just an average drunk story.I guess there are worse ways to spend (money) than to throw it away on this book....but not many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful-Nothing like cashing in on Daddy's name","review":"I started this book hoping to find a thoughtful, absorbing account of how somebody can sink into alcoholism but ultimately survive. Was I off base. What I found instead was a lurching, unfocused, egocentric chronicle of all of Cheever's various love affairs and famous people she would just happen to bump into for lunch. The first few chapters, when she talks about the origins of her alcoholism and how widely social drinking was accepted in the 50s and 60s, are moderately interesting, but the book quickly degenerates from there into a litany of name-dropping and sexual escapades. Who cares? If she was trying to impress readers with her supposed attractiveness, I think she needs to wake up and get a life. Not only is her egocentricity and immaturity overwhelming. At one point she compares herself to Shirley Jackson-I wanted to ***. If this book hadn't been written by someone with a famous name, it never would have seen the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"no truth here","review":"Susan Cheever has written a superficial, narcissistic account of her life as a drunk. Even as she purports to be giving a tell-all account of her years of drinking, as a reader I had the feeling that she wrote nothing that she thought would make her appear \\"uncool\\". Plenty of name-dropping and anecdotes designed to illustrate just how hip she really is, drunk or not. There must have been plenty of disgusting episodes not revealed here. More to the point, the author as yet doesn't realize just how unhip a drunk can be and presents her story as a romp through jet set life, glossing over the devastation I'm sure she left behind. The people who wrote the blurbs for the jacket have lost my respect forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad for her children!","review":"Like many other readers, I was appalled by Cheever's book. Her self-absorption and narcissism seem to have survived her drinking days. This book would be merely another volume in the \\"me first\\" series of self-revelatory accounts we've had to endure lately, except that there are children involved. Cheever seems to have given no thought to her kids' welfare as she moved from place to place and man to man. Her confessions of faith at the end of the book are totally unconvincing. She's revealed herself to be an immature and irresponsible woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 'My Life as a Name Dropper'","review":"This book is a huge disappointment. I kept reading it because I kept expecting it to get better, to have a point, to go somewhere. It's an example of really bad writing by a woman whose ego keeps getting in the way of what could be an interesting story. I was hoping to find a book I could recommend to someone who is trying to stay sober; instead I will tell her to run as fast and as far from this drivel as possible. The one positive thing I've gotten from it? If this woman can be published, there's hope for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distressingly bad.","review":"This was such a disappointment. My major complaint is that so little of the book deals directly with her drinking problem. She also has an annoying tendency to interject a new topic almost in mid-sentence. I agree with another reviewer who said read \\"Drinking: A Love Story\\" if you want to read a good book about this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad","review":"I recently purchased Note Found in a Bottle : My Life As a Drinker by Susan Cheever, despite the awful reviews posted here. I thought, it can't be that terrible. But it is. It truly is absolutely dreadful. It reads like a tabloid newspaper one might skim at a supermarket checkout counter. It just didn't feel real or truthful or honest to me. I'm sorry to say that I must agree, this is one book better left on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"This book is an enormous waste of paper. My personal review is short, because this \\"book\\" deserves little attention.How many ways can one say \\"BAD\\"? This book should have never been published. It's dull, flat, ho-hum. My father was an alcoholic and my husband's father was also an alcoholic. This mess of a book gives exactlly zero insight or perspective. She should be ashamed of herself. An appauling book, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it the alcohol... or Cheever?","review":"I raced through this book, believing I would arrive at the place where Cheever would see herself clearly, judge herself more acutely, and change her life. Ten pages before the end, she \\"finds God\\"--which seems to mean something rather amorphous and unchallenging. It's not clear, because, though Cheever has given us all the details of her lousy relationships, she refuses to say much about why she stopped drinking. When the writing isn't too New-Yorker-precious, it's good; you are immersed in a culture of drink. But I concluded that it was not alcohol causing her problems, but Cheever's self-absorbed personality. And her judgment hasn't improved: she says she was married to three \\"extraordinary\\" men, but the two who fathered her children don't seem like great husbands or fathers. An odd book, unsatisfying and full of name-dropping."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is self-absorbed, sloppy, and profoundly ugly.","review":"Susan's Cheever's surname seems to have blinded most of the professional reviewers to the true nature of this book. The tone is whining adolescent, the prose is appalling, when it isn't incomprehensible, and her \\"insights\\" beggar description. It is sloppy and trivial, and reveals the author's true nature much more clearly than she realizes. Her self-absorption is perfect. She seems to feel she is a wonderful person who was led astray by alcohol. Quite obviously, she is a dreadful person who behaves even worse when she is drunk. Her accounts of her various marriages and love affairs make quite clear her total indifference to the anguish she has caused in her single-minded pursuit of happiness. Perhaps the reviewers read a different book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comment on Note in a Bottle","review":"Cheever's book is one more in a list of banal works she has produced. When will she stop?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Daddy's Girl, and Cashing In On It","review":"I read this book in a single sitting, which was all it deserved. Could Susan Cheever possibly love herself more while claiming otherwise? The name dropping, the cashing in on her famous name (would we care if this was an anonymous drunk rather than the scion of a genius?), the relentless references to her good looks and the aphrodisiac effect she apparently had on men throughout the world...yawn. I found Carolyn Knapp's book far more compelling. Cheever takes a plodding, self-important tone in her writing that I associate with the worst of women's magazines. What a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Simon & Schuster","review":"I would say, \\"Shame on Susan Cheever,\\" but it's not her fault she can't write. It may not even be her fault that she can't recognize that she can't write. But in making this book available, her publisher has done something rotten to readers and writers alike. Guilty, too, are the folks who supplied blurbs (\\"this is what Fitzgerald would sound like if he was writing today\\"...or something like that) and the reviewers who lacked the guts to tell the truth. Jeez, even the famously grumpy Kirkus handed this book an approving review! Like many others, I give this book no stars. Please allow us to tell the truth, Amazon. Get rid of the one-star minimum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book and read \\"Drinking: a Love Story\\"!","review":"I read this book because I thought it might give me some insights into fighting alcoholism- especially fighting alcoholism as a woman. I also expected that, in addition to the insights I could enjoy beautiful prose. I did not get any insights and there was very little that was beautiful in the prose. Forget this book and read \\"Drinking: A Love Story.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was A Preppie Drunk","review":"A real disappointment, especially considering the many glowing advance reviews. Mind-numbingly self-absorbed in the beginning, and smug at the end. What's even more laughable is that after detailed chronicling of her sex life, her recovery boils down to \\"I found God and stopped drinking, and how DARE you want to know the details of something so personal, you insensitive trolls!\\" Read Caroline Knapp's \\"Drinking: A Love Story\\" for an honest and heart-felt exploration of this topic. Cheever's \\"Bottle\\" should be tossed overboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying memoir of drinking","review":"You know when you're in AA meetings and there's that person who just blah-blah-blahs aimlessly about herself and everyone else is bored? That's fine for an AA meeting--it's important for us to process out loud in that forum--but it's not fine for a memoir. It's not that there is no value in this book, in the way that hearing other alcoholics' stories has value...but where is the craft? What is Cheever saying that someone else hasn't said better? This writer would never have been a writer if not for her famous name. Or, maybe if she hadn't had the famous name to fall back on, she might have actually developed her craft. As memoirs of drinking lives go, skip this one and try Augsten Burroughs' DRY or Caroline Knapp's wonderful DRINKING: A LOVE STORY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post - it in a Bottle","review":"Though \\"Note\\" is neither deep or introspective, it was easy to read with occasional excellent lines. My favorite (which made the whole book worth it for me) was \\"It's not that I had a miserable childhood -- I didn't -- it's that I was a miserable child.\\"The memoir is interesting in its very ordinariness: except for her father's fame which gave her access to more wealthy and famous people, her life, her affairs, her alcoholism and her recovery were unremarkable.Though I enjoyed this book, it was more like an after-school special on the dangers of alcohol (you will forget things, have big fights, and sleep with many men) than an illustration of alcoholism or even the life of Susan Cheever. She admits some things, such as God, and apparently her feelings about her father, are \\"too private\\" to explain. Perhaps so, but then why write a memoir?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy and fast style to read but lacking content.","review":"Unless you're interested in this particular family, time and money could be better spent with a good magazine article of your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceived Mormons","review":"This book is an excellent compilation from a former LDS who by the grace of God saw the truth and realized the god of Mormanism is just a man and ... a god without eyes to see and ears to hear...Aside from that, I find that the most of the reviews here are by Mormons who really can only attack this book by attacking the author personally and are not able to attack the material itself. Typical of these folk who are under the bondage to the enemy through the 'burning in the bosom' witness of the False Holy Spirit (aka the great deceiver, Satan) We shouldn't attack Mormons any more than we should attack a blind man who stumbles into the lanes of fierce traffic... instead we should rescue them if their free agency allows them to be rescued.

Even though the LDS people accept Christ in a different way than is reguarly accepted by his brand of Christianity. I believe those people believe that their acceptance and dedication to their savior is real. I do not believe it is fair to use so many obscure sources that are not generally available, or in the Cannon of the LDS Church.I regret I bought the book or wasted my time reading it.

Most Mormons are completely comfortable with their religion, what they're not comfortable with are people that lie and deceive. Is it easier to quickly say, Mormonism is false. Or is it easier to take some time to look into it for yourself? Right. So when it comes down to it, anyone reading and agreeing with an Ed Decker book is not looking for answers, rather fuel for their own ignorance. It is clear. Anyone that supports Ed Decker falls into that category and makes themselves look equaly foolish.

I will contend against no religion for Free Agency to worship God as God Guides ME to do does not give me the right to tear down and condemn others beliefs.

While the books attempts to focus on the luftwaffe it also contains many RAF accounts and pits both sides of the story together of individual fighter engagements from the battle. The result is a personal, and harrowing account of the battle showing the intensity and sacrifice at which it was fought. The author also summarises within these personal accounts the overall picture of the day(s) fighting that helps put things back into a strategic perspective. The end result is an enthralling account of the Battle of Britain supplemented with many photographs that is hard to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Battle of Britain and would like to note that there is a further book by the same author along the some theme 'The Luftwaffe Bombers' Battle of Britain'."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a family movie","review":"For those who reviewed this as a family movie...a family movie this is not! I consider a family movie to be something the whole family can enjoy; a movie that is appropriate for the entire family to watch - toddlers, pre-schoolers, school age, middle school, high schoolers, and adults alike. This movie shows a woman taking a bath, a man taking a shower, and explains that a condom should be put on the penis. Any movie with sex education in it, is not good for the entire family to watch. I can't comment on the entire movie as once they showed the scene where the teachers tells them about condoms, I turned the movie off.

When he got to the subject of men and women that, at times, he came from a more narrow, \\"traditional\\" position, which saddened me.

I believe that there are several ways that our higher power makes its presence known to us, bringing forth knowlege, as well. There are many religions in the world and many thoughts of what soul, spirit and awareness is, forcing us all to think of each other's level of consciousness, before passing judgement. Depending on each person's level of consciousness, one could argue the credibility of what is written. I believe that each person seeks God, or his/her higher power, according to an individual personality.

Do dolphins dive bottomward to find the light? Or is life nothing more than highly structured ectoplasm, waiting to expire? These are questions no one can answer for you but Zukav, a prankster-mythic of the highest order, is a top flight guide who will show you the way to the summit if you give him the time and patience that Soul Stories deserves. As I read Soul Stories I thought often of a solitary tree, a tree that had once belonged to a vast, glorious forest but now stood alone. Trees can come and go often cut down by the demands of daily life, but a forest, like our spiritual essence, can only exist if we nurture it and let it's beauty strenghten us. Read this book and save a tree: the tree that is growing within you. It may one day turn into a forest and bring with it the happiness and joy that life is supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you need a pep talk...","review":"This book was the right thing at the right time for me.

Within a year it was gone. I was fortunate to be able to purchase three of the FX's and I keep one as a spare. Some like it as a CAD drafting device, I for some reason didn't really like it that much as such. Beyond that, it is the best trackball ever made and why Logitech discontinued it is beyond my thinking. It's interesting to see the FX priced upwards of $200 at Amazon or bidding on Ebay in the same area. That should have told Logitech something, but I guess they don't read the reviews. Every now and then I bid on one on Ebay, but the bidding soon heads for the stratosphere. I have never had any wrist problems with the FX, and perhaps that comes from having it too low and having to bend the wrist. Beyond that, once again, the best ever trackball.

I developed chronic wrist pain while using this device.

Like a great mexican meal!","review":"Ms. Martinez's book came at the right time for me. I was beyond busy with 2 stressful jobs, about to get on a plane in stormy weather and was needing a laugh badly. The book delivered with a story of love, mariachi, religion, drug dealing, transvestites and a little witchcraft thrown in. Martinez's book blends Mexican and American culture to render a story that ultimately examines what love is- the love of lifelong friends, the love of long-time admirers, the love of god, the love of being bad and the plain need to just be loved. It's not sentimental or mushy. Magic realism peeks in now and again, but doesn't overshadow. I give it 4 stars because it was a great book, but the end left me wanting a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Cable MV3F-2M NF - They pay for themselves!","review":"Several recent upgrades and additions to my home audio and video systems necessitated several new cables. Part of those additions/upgrades is a Sony 36 inch television that, with the existing two way splitter and coaxial cables, just wasn't producing the picture it should have. This was when I made the decision to explore Monster Cables coaxial cables and two-way splitter. Using this particular \\"model\\" of coaxial cable in conjunction with Monster Cables SV1F-1M NF coaxial cables and their TGHZ-2RF two-way splitter made quite a distinct difference in the picture produced on the new Sony television, bringing out a glorious picture.In short, if you're in need of new audio/video cables but were worried about the slightly higher costs associated with Monster Cables products don't, they're well worth it. I highly recommend this product or any other such product from Monster Cable company. {ssintrepid}"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite bowling shoes","review":"Fit perfectly and look sharp!

And, I my command of the language was the same coming out as it was going in.I have given the book (yes I still have it) to my brother-in-law, who has a degree in Linguistics and is fluent in several languages.

The real issue is the actual size of each filter. As stated by the manufacturer's specs, these filters are made or cut smaller than the normal size for each category. This is a real problem for many furnaces that take fitted filters in a bracket or tray. Without shimming around the sides of the filter, the air flows around - not through the filter. Air is like water and will take the path of least resistance. Unless you are sure an undersize filter will work in your furnace, do not buy this brand. It's kind of like orange juice and ice cream, maybe no one will notice if we reduce the size and charge the same price. I made the wood shim to seal the sides until I use up my supply but will go back to paying the higher price of the 3M next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"I purchased A Hoover Foldaway two years ago.

Didn't feel any warmth or affection for her family either. They are superficially drawn and seem to have little connection to each other. The husband is uninvolved and disinterested in his family's life. Mostly disagrees with wife on everything. The village seems lackluster and full of unhappy, discontented people. Nothing charming or engaging about it to make one feel that it's \\"cosy\\". Bleak and dreary is more like it. Not much to the story line either.

Unlike other writers who only dream their English village, this one actually knows what they, and their inhabitants, are like.The plot is sound, the pacing is good and the dialogue is first rate - one of the best features of the book.

Despite exotic trappings and labored arcane rigamarole, the characters are cardboard creations pushed through a plot that is totally transparent from square one. Even in his better efforts Zimler's style tends to cloy because of his evident belief that his work is deeply meaningful and must therefore be difficult to grasp, and as a result he constantly makes the obvious even more painfully so with authorial nudges in the ribs.

I thought for awhile that the characters in Bill's book about the Inquisition would reappear as promised. The ending gave me the impression that Zimler stopped writing his book and started telling about his love affair. They were only scantily connected.

The characters were completely stock: the struggling, unsure protagonist; the mysterious iconoclastic stranger offering redemption; the ice-queen shrew; the golden-hearted (ex)whore; the tragic, doomed orphan. There was very little that was subtle about this book. Hints that Peter was celestial were very heavy-handed. The dreams that Bill kept having were obvious and seemed like quick and easy ways for Mr. Zimler to make connections and to move the story along. Nothing reminded me remotely of E.M.

Filtering would be a nice side benefit too. Very little $$ more than the power-strip design units I was looking at (& now I see it dropped even lower!).Pros: Build quality, fit & finish, plenty of outlets & diversity of outlets for me, nice form-factor compared to power-strip design, cool looking LEDs & meter.Cons: Those cool looking LEDs cannot be dimmed & are too bright (esp the blue one!) if facing HT viewers. I just blocked the LEDs w/a black card. CABLE/SAT cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider (Cablevision)... Caused more artifacts on HD channels, so couldn't use the cable line filter.Bottom line: Seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing @ Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved Picture","review":"I purchased this unit as a way to improve and maintain the already high quality system that we have in our home. I will give my wife's non-technical opinion as I think that really makes the unit shine better than my words could.My wife's first reaction was the LEDs on the front - they are bright - really to the point of annoyance. But beyond that, the first night we were watching a DVD with the unit installed, she described the picture as being \\"more clear and crisp\\". I couldn't agree with her more.I also agree with another comment here - plug your receiver into the CD slot. This was the only way I could get the remote turn-on feature to work. However, I plugged the subwoofer into one of the high-power, delayed start units. This seems to work great and my audio does sound more pristine.With Amazon's current deal on this - it is worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This unit is a great addition to my home theater system.

I liked it enough to purchase a second one for a different system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster does not support DIRECTV High Def","review":"I bought this device because I needed a surge protector. I could have bought a cheap $50 surge protector but considering the cost of this device $160 this was a bargain. I wanted to protect a new Samsung DLP, home theater and new h20 directv hdr. Its a solid metal piece, the volt meter and indigo glow is a discussion piece. I noticed the fluctuation in my house voltage from 115 to 120.Why a 2, well to my surprise one of the satellites do not register in the directv. Only when I disconnect the satellite coax from the monster device and plug it directly into the directv h20 dvr did it register. I would imagine all the Monster devices have the same problem no matter the cost since the enginneering would be similar.Really too bad considering monster's reputation, would have been better off buying a cheaper device.h"},{"rating":"2","title":"J.SMART.

My purpose was to have the day's reading be a part of our dinnertime together. Well, the first day is a whole 13 pages. That is much too long for us to read through together and take care of a toddler.However, the content is great. The daily readings have wonderful depth to them. The variety of authors is refreshing. If you are looking for something to read on your own, I highly recommend this. If you are looking for a family read, I'd get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly UN-inspiring","review":"With names like C.S. Lewis, Philip Yancey, Madeleine L'Engle and Dietrich Bonhoeffer on the cover, I expected, at the least, that the book would be orthodox. It didn't take long, though, to realize that most of the writers were extremely liberal in their theology.William Stringfellow wrote of the \\"political character of Advent\\" while John Howard Yoder wrote of Mary's Magnificat as \\"a revolutionary battle cry.\\" Furthermore, the people walking in darkness (Isaiah 9:2) are not walking in the darkness of sin, according to J��rgen Moltmann, but are crying out for their human rights. Dorothee Soelle wrote that the sick people in the Gospel of Luke had been made sick by political oppression and economic plunder. Sadly, the book manages to squeeze sin and salvation into the very narrow molds of poverty and justice.While I enjoyed the entries by John Donne, Brennan Manning and C.S. Lewis, the other chapters were too militant to be encouraging or inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Advent Essential","review":"This collection of excerpts, essays, and poems is not for those hoping for a quick five minutes of Advent feel-good inspiration. Selected from diverse writers across a wide time span, the readings are challenging enough to read over and over. I have used this book every Advent for about six years and could probably make good use of it every year for the rest of my life. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calm in the craziness","review":"This is a lovely book with simple, thoughtful passages for the days leading up to Christmas. The passages evoke feelings of centeredness, peace and calm similar to awakening to a beautiful, fresh snowfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaty enough to read this year and next","review":"This is a great devotional book, and I am not usually one that finds devotionals set up like this very interesting. It is set up to have a reading each day during Advent, Christmas and through to Epiphany, and the readings are all written by people like C.S. Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, Thomas Merton, Henri Nouwen, Kathleen Norris, Annie Dillard, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, etc. This is no, \\"What was the innkeeper thinking\\" sort of advent reading book. It is thoughtful and insightful and has a lot to say that ties into the preparative nature of advent, that is the preparation for the messiah's return. The writings vary in length and type from scholarly writings to musings to poetry or introspection. The readings are meaty enough, too, that you could certainly read them this year and again next year and they'll still be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chess set review","review":"The craftsmanship and quality of the chessmen for plastic pieces is probably unsurpassed excluding the fact that one of the pieces upon delivery was fraid on the felt bottom which I will eventually have to reglue with matching colored felt when it becomes unplayable.

It took about a month to arrive and when it did I played it and it wasn't what I thought it was. It is some techno junk music, not rare AC/DC."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Time","review":"Finally, a lucid, beautifully written book which takes seriously the politically inconvenient but dead true fact that current Western culture is awash in misandry. Type 'misandry' on your Word program and it will tell you that there is no such word. If Nathanson and Young's book gets anything like the readership it deserves, 'misandry' won't be a non-word much longer.The thinking on display in 'Spreading Misandry' is so clear, so apt, so free of cant, that even the most militant ideological feminist ought to be able to read it with something approaching delight.And so singular and distinct is the authorial voice in the book that one can only gasp in admiration that it was in fact written by two authors. Moreover, since one of them is a man, the other a woman, readers can have real hope that the spread of misandry can be stopped by men AND women acting together for the sake of that old friend of humankind 'the common good'."},{"rating":"1","title":"misandry don't real","review":"I do not think you understand. Misandry don't real, what the author is actually speaking about is trying to reclaim lost privileges. Cry more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victim Misogyny","review":"It is true that the rigid gender roles that prevent communication between the sexes create problems for men. However, this is a manifestation of misogyny, not \\"misandry.\\" Dogma in gender roles is exactly what feminism was created to work against. The right can throw around millions of dollars in grants so think tanks and individuals can write books like this or put forth endless untrue criticisms of feminism on Fox News, but there will always be people who just don't think it's right for women to make 76 cents for every dollar a man makes. They can't stop that by insisting that men are somehow under attack."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Guy","review":"Spreading Misandry is clearly one of the most important books of the new millennium. The battle of the sexes, it turns out, was won. Not by the men, though we've heard time and again how women have suffered under patriarchy. Nathanson and Young reveal how radical feminism took root and then took over. Pop culture took its cue from it and has depicted men, typically, over the past few years as one of two things: evil or inadequate. Think Sylvester Stallone. Think Tim Allen. Actually, just start thinking. That's what this book encourages. No, it's not a license for men to fight back, or to respond to hate with hate. It says that stereotypes and hatred of all kinds are unhelpful and injurious. Ladies, it's time to stand by your man again, as he stands by you. A must read, especially for Oprah."},{"rating":"2","title":"the beauty of the human form just became a lot darker","review":"When's the last time you ate a man... through your stomach?

The FS728TP does all that. With power over ethernet it can provide power to voice over IP phones on your network, remote webcams, etc therefore removing the need for local power sources for them.This really is a switch that suits all users - from the basic user this is effectively plug and play - just connect your devices and it works out of the box. With other more advanced features such as QoS, SNMP, Web based configuration & DHCP it offers plenty of configurability for the more advanced user as well.All in all, this is a great value for money switch with the performance and reliability that Netgear are known for.

Some people who read it said that it was insulting to people who live in the south but I wasn't insulted at all - merely bored and sorry I spent $3 for it. Part of the problem with the book may be that writers and comedians have already pretty much worn out all the old cliches about Southerners, so that if one isn't able to at least perk it up with some new perspective or observations, it's going to fall flat, like this book does.

Several major prominent international figures, former US president Herbert Hoover for example, supported the TRANSFER IDEA. Take a good look at Dr. Simons' book, you'll discover just how popular TRANSFERING ARABS OUT OF ISRAEL really was among world leaders in that period.

The good news is, that most of our feelings have more to do with the way we learned to cope within a society or environment that is not geared to serving our needs, rather than due to some personal flaw of ours. This book may also help us to wean off the awful habit of collecting too many self-help books, because it encourages trust in our inner wisdom. As a woman who has made it a personal project to enlighten women who are suffering in 12-step based substance abuse programs, because such programs often reinforce our self-doubt, this text is a fantastic part of the solution!!!

Do not rent this disc with the expectation that you'll see stunning imagery worthy of HDTV or music comparable to a live concert experience. Also, Beethoven is way underrepresented--if at all--among these selections, which is an important message for today's youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst staic-x ever","review":"I am not sure what they were thinking but the music is not metal anymore it turned into electronic music but not the good kind"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Solid Metal","review":"Static X is, in my opinion, some of the more fun metal to listen to. The songs are played well, the lyrics are fun to sing/yell even if they don't mean anything, and the band has time and time again put out good music. This CD continues that trend for the most part. Personally, I liked Start A War and Shadow Zone better but I think this album is better than Wisconsin Death Trip and Machine (but as anyone can tell you, beauty is in the eye/ear of the beholder). Some of the songs on this CD were a little boring such as Team Hate and Electric Pulse but others, such as Destroyer and Behemoth, were great. This album stays true to the fast, vivid, style Static-X has been using for their few albums and though Cannibal tries a few new things with varying levels of success, I am glad I bought it. Music and art are almost impossible to rate so listen to it before ya buy it. Theres my two cents, take it or leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Great comeback...","review":"...put as a great comeback even when they were always around. This album is full of great grooves, awesome guitar solos and great technical wisdom. In a way, back to their roots but embracing a new fresh air. the band is at their peak. The album grows on you more and more with every pleasurable listening. A most for any groovy heavy music. If you were one of the lucky ones, you were going to get a special edition cover and extra song from their website, but since you are here then you will have to settle without the extra song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to the old... and thensome","review":"The fellas are back in full stride with Cannibal. Evil disco is back. Just finished listening to the album that I pre-ordered from Warner site. They werent bs'ing when they said it'll ship sometime around the release date (but i got kinda ripped since it costed me like 24 dollars or something just for an extra song. Not even a freakin cool slip-case or dvd bonuses like they had on their special edition cd's.. maaaaan). My album has the extra track \\"Get up and boogie\\" since I pre-ordered it from the Warner site. The old days of short and catchy music/lyrics are back. Not a song is \\"sung\\" like in the Start a War and Shadow Zone. They even do guitar solos now. The tech-lectric background ambient noises are top-notch and compliment the songs well also. I think this is their most \\"metal\\" attempt thus far. Well done guys, now I can wear my static-x shirt again with pride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a return to form for Static X","review":"I always loved Static's first CD, Wisconsin Death Trip. I thought their downfall began with Machine. I liked one or two tracks on that disc and foudn the rest to be crap. I tried so hard to enjoy their music but it was just boring nu-metal garbage. What happened to the Static X that I really liked? Well, along comes Cannibal and I'm skeptical. I really didn't want to pick it up again, but I figured I should give them a shot since its got the original members of the band and maybe it'll be a little better.WOWIts not another Wisconsin Death Trip but its a great CD. DEFINITELY a move in the right direction. I'm sure its a great disappointment to the masses looking for an angsty emo nu-metal trip but oh well. Its good to have the band back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Just got this album and I've got to say it's pretty good. The Music has a hard bite to it and never stops punching your ear drums out. It has a fair amount of electronics in it that don't dominate the rest of the music. I see this move as more or less an answer to people that started to accuse the band of not being \\"metal\\" after Shadow Zone. Although \\"Start A War\\" Seemed to be good start to that answer, though few people here seem to agree with me on that one.Bottom line, for me personally. This album does not disappoint.... Grab it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I eagerly awaited the arrival of Cannibal, and was quite disappointed when I listened to it. To me, there just aren't any memorable songs. The songs sound very contrived, in that Wayne tried to throw stuff together just to preserve the Static-X sound, but the actual songs themselves are rather weak. He is trying to be \\"heavy\\" just for the sake of being heavy. Not that Static-X wants or needs a hit single, but there is nothing catchy that will stick in your head, a la \\"Push It\\" or \\"The Only.\\" Overall, I think the band will never top Wisconsin Death Trip. If you are a hardcore fan, you will probably buy this, but if you are on the fence about it or just getting into the band, I would avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? Are they for serious?","review":"Static-X really dropped a Static-Turd with this one. Experiencing 'Behemeth' while viewing the album cover had me in tears laughing. Really, I imagined these guys got a phone call and recorded for 2 days...maybe added some post production effects...and were like \\"Yup, good stuff (high fiving) lets go headbang at Bobby's house, PYAWW! (a la Howard Dean). then they got paid 28$ for their abortion of a record. sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"I've listened to Static X for several years now and I can say this CD is absolutely horrible. Every song is almost identical in the way it sounds. There is no songs that mix tempo or anything. They only difference between songs is the word that they yell for the chorus. It's almost like they're not even trying anymore. For anyone expecting more of a Machine or Wisconsin Death Trip sort of CD I would definitely stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVERMIND!","review":"This band sucks theres bands way better than this one.These are just some stupid metal wannabes and this is NOT real metal okay,whoevers works with rappers are NOT real metalheads got that and i don't care what you say this is a stupid lousy band.Don't waste your money on this stuff,true metal is certainly not like this and i know someone is gonna say it doesn't matter what you listen your a real metalhead HELL NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME - KEEP THAT HYBRID SOUND","review":"Being in Static X must suck. As one reviewer put it, every time they branch out from the typical \\"metal/screeching vocals\\" they get pegged as a sell-out. Let a band grow and diversify...until I see Wayne Static peddling hair care products - (or butter, as I recently saw Johnny Rotten doing) - lets just call Static X \\"experimenting\\" - not selling out.As for \\"Cannibal\\" - its great. Imagine Rob Zombie melded with Slayer...Death Disco is what these guys claim, and what they continue to pump out. High quality, aggressive music supplemented with electronics and break-beats.I'm glad to hear with the album they just recently released \\"Cult of Static\\" that they continued with this genre.Check \\"Cult of Static\\" out hereCult of StaticAlso, if you're into Hard-Rock/Electro - check out THE S1ND1CATE - Cyber-Punk-Electro at its finest (and their sweet cover of DEAD MANS PARTY) Reloaded"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are YOU serious?","review":"There are some idiots on here commenting. There's a guy named Brock Compton or \\"REAL METAL\\". Apparently, he proceeded to review this album saying things like \\"they're metal wannabes\\" and \\"this isn't real metal\\", but fails to explain or elaborate as to why this is so. If you read all of his reviews, you'll see that he reviews the new Breaking Benjamin cd and calling it \\"real metal\\". Now i think they are a good band with talent, but calling them metal and Static-X not metal, well that's just like saying Nickelback is death metal and In Flames is Alternative. Now to the cd, Great album from an ever-evolving band, and Wayne Static continues to suprise with his rough yet clean vocals. The guitar solos are another addition, showcasing the band's real talent from what used to sound like a bit of korn-esque riffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL!","review":"This is a pretty good heavy album with techno is just awesome.If you like static x you would like this but they are heavier than in there previous albums every song kicks so bad cool technotic sounds but the heavy metal is the best get it CANNIBAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Metal","review":"I managed to buy a copy of Static-X's newest album the day of their concert in Milwaukee, and so I only managed to familiarize myself with their three most popular songs from the album, \\"Destroyer,\\" \\"Cannibal\\" and \\"Cuts You Up.\\" I was blown away by the concert, mainly because they remained close to their CD material despite the heavy sampling and chaotic drums. This album is definitely the rawest material they've done since Machine, and--while their last album was still good--this cements Static-X in a genre all by itself. The only downside is there really wasn't really any of Wayne Static's trademark singing, opting instead to stick the with frantic growling--certainly not a bad thing, but for those who actually enjoyed SHADOW ZONE, it might be a bit of a letdown.But really, that's nitpicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"i have not liked static-x for a long time. everything after machine i didnt care for at all besides maybe a song or two thats it. i was upset and figured they will never make a good cd agagin. finally after so many years they make a good album. it have that little evil disco to it but not so much like WTD. To me it seems like WTD + Machine = Cannibal. Its a good album songs are mainly pretty good my only problem is the song \\"reptile\\" i hate that song so much its anoying. Also does anything think \\"Goat\\" sounds like \\"fix\\" when wayne says the lyrics before the chorus?

The songs are short and fast. The kind of intensity that made their debut so memorable. I can listen to this again and again.If you need to get your adrenaline pumping, look no further. If you've never tried Static X this should make you a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average Static","review":"Progressively I've seen Static-X getting better and better. Starting with a strong \\"Wisconsin Death Trip\\" to the highly innovative and incredibly talented \\"Machine\\" and \\"Shadow Zone\\", I was disappointed with the release of \\"Start a War\\" but I didn't consider it a total loss.With Static-X's next release, I saw just how unbelievably poor Static-X has gotten. Gone are the electrical sounds mixed with guitar and the mostly violently shouted vocals of Wayne Static, replaced instead with a seemingly listless, uncertain guitar shredding, and the violently shouted vocals are reduced to babbling \\"AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA!\\" in between the more coherent lyrics.Static-X is better than this. I've heard their older music, I've seen what they were capable of. This is not a step in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static-X at their heaviest, but also their worst.","review":"After purchasing all of the other Static X albums on their release date, I of course had to do the same with this one. The album starts off with Cannibal, an excellent song with great guitars and makes me think that I an for a treat with the rest of the album. Unfortunately, that is far from the case. Track 3 (Behemoth) and track 5 (Destroyer) were the only other songs that are worth listening to. Thats one great song (Cannibal), and 2 good songs. The rest of the album is horrible. By far, the worst album for Static-x. If you are new to Static-X, this is the one NOT to get. I recommend the following Static-X albums in the following order: 1)Wisconsin Death Trip, 2)Machine, 3)Star A War, 4)Shadow Zone 5)Beneath..Between..Beyond, and last and certainly least Cannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but disappointed...","review":"I purchased this watch for a friend as a gift, he was elated, initially.

Almost none of the characters are beleivable, and they are all dragged by the dull screenplay, which has the main purpose of first breaking all the relationships down and then creating one big happy ending for all. The discussion of Jane's work is forced, and not well integrated into the story, but only in very abrupt and obvious manner.

Maybe it's a case of a solid premise poorly written, but I disliked the book so much I couldn't finish it.The film version, on the other hand, is entertaining and intelligently presented, and with so many main characters, that's saying something. Each person in this impromptu book club, set up to help a newly divorced woman cope with the changes in her life, has a problem similar to that of one of Jane Austen's characters.

If you've read Austen's novels, you will obviously like the \\"book club\\" bits and see the parallels in these women's lives. I only had a small problem with the whole boys=sci-fi thing. Maybe it's rarer than I think, but I'm both a lifelong sci-fi/fantasy geek/fangirl and a Jane Austen aficionado. Hello? We are out there! I totally loved the reference to Star Wars. It's certainly not a point only a fanboy could make!**upon second viewing in 2010, i have amended it to four stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"The 4 and 5 stars are given mostly by folks who never read Jane Austen. If you have, you will be sorely disappointed. This has very little to do with Jane Austen and one cannot help but feel that her name was used to promote the movie/book/whatever. The characters were poorly developed and the watcher/reader didn't care one way or the other how things turned out. When there were references to the actual works, they were extremely heavy handed and out of place. I felt embarassed more than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little silly...","review":"The actors all worked well with each other but the story just wasn't what I thought it should have been considering the subject. I did find some of the ideas about the premise behind some of Jane Austen's books interesting. It has a decent ending but I can't recommend it. I did see the edited version on an airplane so I don't know what was cut out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful at times...","review":"You watch this film because of it's title and because you want to believe. Well, hope is not enough for this film that never gets a firm grip and often feels incomplete. The books and the discussions of Austen's books are the only things that do make sense in this film. The rest is several stories all in bits that never blend well.....never. The characters are just quickly passed on and loosely relate (the film hopes to show us this) to Austen's books in todays world. It does not succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This movie was not at all what I expected, by the end of the film I finally understood where they were going with the plot.

It was also a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Mishmash","review":"I am a fan of Jane Austen but I can't see that this film has much real relation to her. It is a collection--hodgepodge--of characters and storylines that don't really capture your interest because they are not really very interesting. The cast is okey but not great--they do an acceptable job with what they have to work with but none of them is particularly attractive or appealing. The connection to Austen is minimal--just the reading of her books by the club members and a half-baked attempt to somehow relate her characters to them. There is no real coherent progression of the various stories encompassed by the film and at the end everything is kind of thrown together slapdash for a traditional happy ending. I found it boring and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL JANE AUSTEN, ALL THE TIME","review":"i love this movie so much, i bought the dvd, this movie inspired me to read AUSTEN'S novels.i think this movie can inspire the younger people to read her novels.its good to read the classics this movie is now on my top ten favorite movies list.i'v probably watched this movie over 100 times!!!! its wonderfully romantic. funny. and dramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bad movie pretending to be good","review":"I purchased the DVD expecting to watch a great movie given that the subject was composed of many characters in Jane Austen's novels. I admire her as a writer and have enjoyed her books, even though I am not a \\"chick\\" and realize that they cater more to women. Still she is one of the greatest English novelists. However, despite the subject the movie turned out to be just plain bad: awful screenplay and bad direction. It has no beginning, middle and end. The characters never develop, the plot is extremely convoluted and shallow, and when I reached half the movie I simply didn't care what happened to any of them. Pity because the cast was great, but they had a pitiful screenplay to work with. Even great actors cannot save a movie when they have to work with material that does not even reach the limited standards of a high school production. So my advice is: skip the movie and go back to enjoying her books again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"It came in the original package as advertised. I was very pleased with my purchase.

If you haven't read Homer, you're not an educated person.If I had to rate the additional material in this edition on its own merits, I'd have to give it something less than five stars. Four, probably. The glossary is useful, and the \\"Backgrounds\\" (a brief excerpt each from Kirk and Nilsson and then snippets from various archaic authors commenting on Homer) are worthwhile and sometimes amusing. But the \\"map of probable locations for legendary places mentioned in The Odyssey\\", for instance, is silly. And the essays in the \\"Criticism\\" section seem randomly-themed and of hit and miss quality.But the additional material is all just icing on a very good cake. Cook's translation is readable and delightful. He carefully maintains the repetitions and line units of the original, so a reader of the English translation can get some sense of what the Greek feels like. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good budget minded edition.","review":"The first verse translation of the Odyssey I ever read. I like it. I prefer the Fagles, and liked the Fitzgerald the best, but this one was cheap when I first wanted to read the Odyssey. Indeed, this translation offers all the reader needs in a verse translation, in a modern sort of form, that does not conflict too much with the story being told.Personally, I like other translations much better, but I cannot forget the soft spot in my heart for this budget priced edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Toledo?","review":"As an adolescent, Tony Comes of Toledo, Ohio, was molested by a Roman Catholic priest. Tony is now a fireman, with a wife and 2 children, one of whom is soon to take First Communion. Through a cruel Twist of Fate, they discover that the Dream Home into which they have recently moved is only 5 doors down from Tony's former abuser - the unrepentant former priest, shown in his video depositionQ: Why did you decide to go into the seminary?A: I decided that it would be a good life if I was a priest.Good for whom?Church Ladies will not approve of Tony's \\"firehall\\" language - but then, they probably won't be watching. The scandal of serial abusive priests should be enough to P off the Pope. But one of the saddest things is, it's not. Too many priests and parishioners are in denial. This unflinching HBO documentary is not about the shameful statistics but the horrific and traumatic toll on actual lives of an abused altar boy and the \\"ripple effect.\\" /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith maybe, but critical thinking always!","review":"This is a DVD that puts a human face on the statistics of the Catholic Church sexual abuses. Jason Berry's book \\"Render Unto Rome\\" tells the startling financial losses of the Vatican and especially the U.S. Catholic churches who pay for most of the suits(closing in on $2 bilion). This money is nothing compared to the agony and suffering of these victims. Tony Comes is a reluctant victim at first, but the abuse from 20 years earlier forces him to act. Valiantly, he fights along with others to seek justice. His wife supports him which gives him strength to carry on under duress. I especially underscore the scene where he tells his 10 year old daughter about his experiences with this \\"monster\\" priest who lives only five houses away. This is a lesson for all young parents: be honest with your children. This HBO team and family have given us all a \\"teachable moment\\".

Reading the cover made me by and starting the first chapter meant that nothing got done that night! I was amazed at the way Celia Rees told the story of Mary, a young English girl, who must flee England during the beginning of the witch hunts. She is taken from the square where her grandmother has just been executed for witchcraft and sent to America where it is hoped that she will not be held for trail. Things begin to happen and soon Mary learns that she has not escaped anything. Acusations soon begin to fly but the question is... Will Mary survive? Read Witch Child and find out. Don't forget that if you like Witch Child, you should read it's sequal, Sorceress... as the adventures continue with the a new generation.."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Although this book was boring at first, it became one of my favorite books at the end. I always seemed to be waiting for something exciting to happen, but I still give this book 5 stars. The fact that most of this story was true brought chills to my body, for what a terrible story Mary (main character) has. Through her journal entries you get to know her so much that when you finish the book you feel like you have known her all your life. After finishing the book with an almost \\"cliffhanger\\" ending, I can't wait to read the sequel \\"Sorceress\\" although I hear it is not as good. Anyone who likes to read about witchcraft would love this book, and it has made me more interested in the topic as well. I recomend this book for ages 12 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Thumbs Up!","review":"Witch Child is a great book...for young and old.

Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read","review":"Witch Child is mysterious, romantic, and adventerous. It ends at the peak of the story, forcing you to buy Sorceress, the second book. It's a great story; I've read it many times. I would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction or witchcraft/magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A COMPELLING STORY EXPRESSIVELY READ","review":"This compelling and sometimes heartbreaking story is given an indelible reading by British actress Jennifer Ehle. A Tony Award winner for her performance in \\"The Real Thing, \\" she also appeared on Broadway with Alan Cumming in \\"Design For Living.\\" Miss Ehle's expressive voice adds dramatic resonance to an already commanding narrative.Set in 1659, \\"Witch Child\\" is the story of young Mary Newbury, the granddaughter of a witch. Mary witnesses the torture and death of her adored grandmother and fears for her future until she is offered sanctuary across the ocean in America.However, upon arrival on these shores Mary discovers that she is among not only strangers, but people who fear and hate. She must disguise herself as a devout Puritan or imperil her life.Celia Rees, who is described as an \\"aficionado of the supernatural\\" has recreated a time when being different was not tolerated and brought it to vivid life through the fictional diary of Mary Newbury."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book with character that loses your sympathy","review":"I was terribly disappointed with Witch Child. I had heard wonderful things about it, only to turn the last page feeling sort of, well, blank. Take out the middle hundred pages or so and it might be worth your time - but for a book about a girl's charge of witchcraft there is barely any news about it, and that only speculation that is faintly whispered here and there until the last chapter. It starts off well enough, is utterly maddening as you continue, is terribly fascinating, and then suddenly ends right when you're interested.For something worth reading in the same sort of category, readers would best try out \\"The Raging Quiet\\" by Sherryl Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting.","review":"Maybe I need to read the book again, as it's been several years since, but I'm not understanding the other reviews. I've nothing negative to say about this book other than the fact that it was a little dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review: Witch Child by Celia Rees","review":"First off, I was not tremendously moved by this book. Celia Rees effectively created a realistic world for the 1600's, but the pace of this book was very slow leaving my mind to wander. Mary being an orphan and a witch was a couple of the very few things that we know about this main character leaving this book lacking in character build up. Over half of this book is dedicated to the killing of Mary Grandmother and her travel to America; which is not the main plot so in most cases I would have given up trying to finish this book. That being said I did complete this book, but it is nothing that I would recommend or want to continue the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read this again and again...","review":"My copy of this book has been read on probably four or five different occassions and lost (since I keep reading it so much) and found again and very much loved through it all. I was hooked on the story from page one. I enjoy the historical aspect of it. I find Mary to be a wise old soul in a young girl's body. She shows strength, courage, and tenderness. This is one book that I hope they make into a movie - but then again - they will probably ruin it so maybe I take that back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read, will stay with you. Loved Celia's style","review":"I loved this book. I am somewhat a history buff and that is what drew me to this book since it is set in 1659. A group of Puritans travel to the New World. Among them is a young teenage girl, Mary. Mary is a witch. However this book is not about spells and witchcraft. It is a story about survival and persecution. It also enlightens the reader on the life of the Puritans.This book stays with you. I am delighted there is a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I'm a 13 year old, and I absolutely loved this book! It was brilliantly written and one of the favorites among our age group at my school. The story about a witch on the run leaves cliffhangers all over the place and I couldn't put the book down! I have started to read the sequel, Sorceress, and it is a bit different, but enjoyable and answers any questions left in the first book.I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, very realistic","review":"I and my daughter Katie (who is 11 years old) really enjoyed this book and look forward to the next in the series.

There's gonna be a sequel!!!","review":"Read this last night in one sitting and was duly impressed. Very concise writing, wonderful storyline, and memorable characters. When I was a kid, Shirley Jackson's \\"Witchcraft of Salem Village\\" had been my favorite book.....this is almost even better. I love the whole secret history hidden in a quilt concept...very mysterious and reminds kids that history is NOT always what it seems to be. (Don't get me started on Richard III).Anyways, exquisite book, a gazillion thumbs up, and waiting anxiously for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction & Folklore","review":"Witch Child is a 'junior' read, but very entertaining.

Written as a diary, 14 yr old Mary leaves her home after her grandmother is hung for being a witch, and travels to the New World in the 1600s to start life anew with a woman she has never met.Their travel is long upon a boat, and her she starts to discover her true talents as a witch; and the struggle to keep her identity a secret.In the New World her struggle grows to hide her secrets and her relationship that develops with the Native Americans. And ultimately, she is blamed for situations she did not committ.This book is an easy read, in journal form, and is very entertaining and heart wrenching.I reccommend to anyone who enjoy's reading witchcraft-lore & fiction combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witchchild review","review":"Do you like books that make you sleep!This book is called Witch Child, written by Celia Rees. It is about a girl named Mary. She had been left to her grandmother, who was a witch. Mary does not know why she was left with her grandmother, because her grandmother would never talk about it. The people in the town got suspicious of the grandmother and killed her. Then Mary was taken away for her protection and put on a ship bound for America to have a better life. The book goes on and talks about the trip to America. It ends with a twist, but I don't want to give the ending away.I would recommend this book to someone that would like the Dear Diary books, or someone that has read them, because they are sort of historical fiction about boys and girls and their adventures in moving to and living in America. Because this book is not really about witches and magic, Witch Child may not be what the reader expects it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this book was going to be a whole lot better but I guess I was wrong. I couldn't focus on the main point of the story. It was everywhere and anywhere.Mary was a granddaughter that was a witch. So they killed Mary's granddaughter they burned her. To figure out if anyone is a witch they would throw them in water and if they floated that was how they could tell if they were a witch.One of the grandmothers friends took Mary and had a whole life picked out for Mary. Mary left England to go to America to start a whole new life.If you like to read books that contain witches and old times then this is the book for you. If not then don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in my interest","review":"Well not bashing the book or anything, but this book just totally bored me in every way. I couldn't even finish it, I read the first 170 pages and just had to stop! I couldn't read anymore. To me this book seems like it would be more in the interest of an older reader, not as much as a younger reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy read, looking forward to the sequel","review":"I really give this one more like a 3.5 stars. I was drawn in by the author's voice, and that is mainly what kept me reading, as it connected me to the main character. Also, the strange use of verb tense. The writing switches back and forth between present tense and past tense--not different tenses for different scenes. Most of the scenes start in present tense and ease into past tense, and some switch back and forth a couple times within a scene. Oddly, I found it worked for me.The plot itself is rather mellow, but I never found it boring. I was a little disappointed that with the title being \\"Witch Child\\" it wasn't more...witchy. Mary does have powers, but there is almost no use of them. And the ending felt abrupt (that is what knocked this down from 4 stars to 3.5).That said. Worth the read. And I'm definitely interested in the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling and well-written new tale of mystery and magic.","review":"Mary Newbury witnessed the burning of her grandmother by her people. Her grandmother, accused of witchcraft, was brutally murdered for a cause -- witches are said to be evil, and Mary fears for her life. She may be killed next in the line of her grandmother. Boarding a voyage to America, she hopes that in the new country she will rebuild her life and find hope. And she does -- befriending a talented girl named Rebekah and even helping an Indian boy in the forest. But she fears that the truth about her past will come out. Can she run away from theterrifying truth... or face it, even if it will mean her own burning? Witch Child, an amazing new witch story beautifully written by Celia Rees, is the heartwrenching and powerful story of a young girl's travails and journeys in the 1600s.

I've been listening to metal for at least 11 years, since the age of 9, and I had always heard about Slayer, and how good the drummer is, which is a total crock of shi@ if you ask me. When you listen to Slayer, all you hear is a bunch of noise produced by the drummer just pounding away without thought. Also, the singer has the most wretched sounding voice ever in a legitimate metal band. The guitar work is anything but impressive, I've heard much better out of musicians like Mike Denner, Hank Shermann and Andy LaRoque to name only a few. If you want some really evil satanic music that's actually convincing, check out Mercyful Fate/King Diamond. Slayer is not as great as everyone says."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a slayer fan, you should have half of this already","review":"Ill tell you why im disappointed first: 1) this doesnt have all their rarities- SITA(with the flute), war ensemble(hellraiser remix)?

I downloaded their very old songs and I didnt like them and the reign in blood demos(theyre good). One thing that actually pissed me off is that they said they were rerecording some old stuff for a box set a few years ago....so where are those????

This is a really poor effort on their part [Please don't tell me they aren't involved with the creation of this]. Why is it so hard for a good box set to come out now? It is as bad of a joke as the Judas Priest Electric Eye DVD having the pathetic \\"Priest...Live\\" concert rather than the classic 1982 concert from the Screaming tour on it. I agree with prior reviewers: I have seen them since 1986 and wanted more of a reach if this is supposed to be a collection of rare stuff spanning their career; if you disagree with that statement, you don't understand the concept of box sets and are probably one of the morons yelling on the War at the Warfield DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the reputation","review":"I just returned from the trip through Germany for which I bought this map. I suppose if you are traveling far off the beaten path, the enormous detail might be helpful. But if you are planning on using major highways, such as the Autobahn, this is a very hard map to follow. The highway numbers appear as tiny, unhighlighted print next to the roads, and you could kill yourself trying to figure out where you are.

It looks nice, and does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well. There are however some minor annoyances that wouldn't be so annoying if I hadn't paid what I did for this.1. Power cable easily disconnects from back of dock.2. Base needs more weight in it, moves around too easily.3. Remote and Base collect more finger prints than dust.4.

The dock cradles the MP3 player snugly and has a remote control that allows me to change the volume,radio stations or mp3 songs from across the room. The sound quality depends on the speakers you use. I use a pair of computer speakers from one of my old computers. Its very compact and sounds GREAT. You can achieve the same set up without this dock, but the dock charges the mp3 player and allows you to quickly grab the mp3 player to use on a walk or in another room where you have another set of computer type speakers,ear buds or headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS tape only played a quarter of the way","review":"Received the sealed tape from the seller but it only played about a quarter of the way through before it stopped.

It seemed to work OK for NFSIII Hot Pursuit (which it came with), but I have had no end of problems getting it to work with Monaco Grand Prix Racing Simulation 2. In Monaco, the pedals don't work, you are either wide open throttle, or hammering the brakes. Because of this, I can not comment on the steering response (it is difficut to tell when you wheels are always spinning or locked). No other racing games yet, but I'm looking for a good one. This wheel seems to be getting varried reviews, some love it and others hate it (complaints of delayed response). Look closely into this one before you purchace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly crap - don't be lured by the price","review":"I'm surprised at the number of good reviews I've seen on this wheel - combined with the low price point, I had to get one. The install was smooth, until I updated the drivers and got VXD errors when I started Windows. Simple enough to fix, but annoying. The force feedback simply doesn't work well. In Rally Champsionship, it works great for about 30 seconds and then quits. In Midtown Madness, all I get is collision effects. Same thing with Need for Speed III. Maybe I'm the exception rather than the rule, but this one is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great!

My installed sound card was not compatible, and tech support told me \\"its not ever going to work with that sound card.\\" (C-media was the sound card manufacturer.) I then bought what tech support recommended (any Sound Blaster), so I bought SB X-Gamer. Now the wheel works for about ONE lap of one race, in \\"Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit\\". The wheel eventually stops responding, and your car spins in a left-hand turn, or crashes. (I do enough crashing on my own, and don't need the help.) If all you want to do is look at it, this is a terrific wheel. But if you plan to use it, be prepared that you might have to replace half the components in your computer with expensive, name-brand stuff, to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the better pepper books","review":"I have a hugh selection of pepper books, this is one of the best.

She speaks to those who have never grown peppers, but then provides an encyclopedia of varieties which should be grown. Unfortunately, seed and plant sources for many of the varieties are not provided. This is dissapointing, and makes me suspect of the book. Describing a fantastic variety in detail, but not providing a source to obtain it, is wrong.

More disturbing is her assumption that a good marriage is based on the woman's subservience to the man. She suggests that the bride make this commitment in her marriage vows: \\"[F]rom this time on, I yeild all rights to leadership in our home to you.

Dennis Hopper is in good form and the rest of the leads (with the exception of Patrick Wayne and a few of the supporting actors who are wooden and bland) do a decent job.That said the DVD itself is a disaster. The picture is out of frame and slightly blurry, the color is washed out and the soundtrack is full of clicks, pops and other noises. What always makes these rip-off releases even more of a joke is they sport the phrases \\"Digitally Re-mastered\\" and \\"5.1 Digital Dolby Surround Sound\\" on the back.

I am thinking of buying sets to give as gifts. The package arrived on time in excellent condition (Still cellophane wrapped.) The series itself is informative enough without feeling like a lesson. Jean Simmons voice is captivating -especially now that she is no longer with us. The art works are unbelievably beautiful and fit the narrative perfectly. I am no Bible scholar and cannot speak to the veracity of the content; all I can say is that I enjoyed this set even more than when I first saw it on television."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Set For The Casual Learner","review":"This set is great for the casual learner. The set is getting dated - going back to the mid-90's, but not much has changed dramatically in the field of Biblical Archeology - which is largely the premise. The narration by Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons is pretty good, though cal lull you to sleep with the dulet tones. The content is good as well, with interview of scholars, archaeologists, religious, and others who interweave the various components together to explore some of the Bible's unanswered and unanswerable questions. The integration of Jewish and Christian thought is well done, and I believe that either Christian or Jew will find this set entertaining and enlightening. If you are a heavy duty Bible scholar, this is pretty light weight. For the bulk of us, though, you will learn a lot, it will pique your interest, and you can feel comfortable that there isn't a great religious agenda behind the shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysteries","review":"Excellent product.

And there were sections that had me squirming, recalling what it was like to think and speak and act like a teenager. Mitchell has done a superb job conjuring the mood and scenery of Austria, along with the language and the people.

The arc of the story and the artful portrayal of missionary life in this fascinating place are nothing short of masterful and possess universal appeal. That is, until the last chapter, when the story descends into banality. Here the tale twists itself into fake spirituality that is engineered to appeal to brainwashed mormons. As the great nazi filmmaker Leni Reifenstahl showed us, there is a fine line between true art and propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation","review":"This book may perhaps be enjoyed by readers who are already disposed to believe its thesis, but is unlikely to convince anyone who expects that thesis to be backed up by competent research and honest citation of sources. To give just one example: my own book \\"Sado: Japan's Island in Exile\\" is cited to support the statement that \\"more than a thousand Korean slave laborers ... on Sado Island also vanished without a trace\\" (bottom of p.62). This is a deliberate misrepresentation; my book says no such thing. It is shameful for any writer to distort the work of another in this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsupported Exaggerations","review":"While this book may be based, in part, on some reality, their claims of the total amount of gold involved are beyond ridiculous, and completely unsupported, and thus, the book is more likely to be purposful disinformation, or lies put out by the establishment, on purpose, to try and discredit gold as an investment. The reality is that paper money is the real fraud, based on many frauds such as fractional reserve banking. The real truth is that central banks have been secretly selling gold for years to suppress gold prices to prop up their paper currencies. The real stats are that the world has mined about 150,000 tonnes of gold in all of human history, and the world mines about 2500 tonnes per year, and that demand stands at about 5000 tonnes per year. Central banks have now sold about half of their 30,000 tonnes, and without prior selling of 1500 tonnes of gold per year, the gold price would have been, and will be, much higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season's Mackerels","review":"I ordered these a while back off of Amazon.

Perhaps Lavery's other titles on Nelson are better-- this one almost seems like an ignorant editor just ripped out sentences & paragraphs from a longer work & put this out as an excerpted work. The writing is clumsy and often unclear throughout; points aren't made that should be; and the overall tone is too hagiographic to represented a balanced study, even as a sketch of Nelson's life.Nice packaging, though, and some good artwork and battle/harbor scene prints from Pocock & the Naval Archives.

No trying to make her look like a drug addled tragic figure, like many books that came out after 1975. He delved into real incidents and made her into a real person with real problems as well as real triumphs. Reading it feels like voyeurism in her world, real and truthful.

Curl up with it by a window seat looking out at trees and gardens and imagine the colors and forms as Van Gogh would have seen them. Alice Williams paints the artist's canvasses again in words as Vincent describes the paintings to his young friend Minette. The author has captured the spirit of the impressionists and the flavors of Provence and of the time. She describes Vincent's loneliness and failed friendship with Gauguin, and his dread of recurrent descents into madness. The events of his months in Provence are interwoven into the story of Minette Ginoux as she comes of age, finds love, marries her sweetheart and provides friendship to the man who was a tortured genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"best work shoes ever!","review":"I have to stand for hours at a time at my work, and ordinary shoes just didn't cut it.

It hasn't even been 3 months and the rack broke. I didn't even fill the rack half full of clothing when the metal poles at the top sank into the metal poles at the bottom (the only thing holding the metal poles up is the pressure from a piece of plastic where the metal poles connect). So I could live with the sunken rack, but the plastic on the bottom where the wheels are completely snapped in half...save the $30 and try to buy a REAL wardrobe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool garment rack","review":"I bought this garment rack from amazon intending to hang quite a number of coats which we use regularly. The assembly requires two people. The base is the toughest part to assemble. Once you are done assembling it you can hang any coat or garment.

It wasn't too difficult to put together, but the bars that go on top as a shelf constantly were falling out.

This product is priced very low for a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure how anyone hates this","review":"I got this because it was the only one with a shelf that was reasonably priced, and because I could adjust it lower for kids. I set it up as a \\"dress up\\" station for my kids and it is great. I dont have 100 lbs of clothes on it but it's sturdy. I like how the end bars can be flush or extended.

I made sure that all of the connections were tight. I then hung several women's coats and a few pairs of pants on it. The clothing weighed no more than maybe 15 pounds. While pushing the rack to a different part of the room, one of the wheels hit the edge of a throw rug. The upper part of the rack began to twist under the weight of the clothes. Then the entire rack began to tip over. I had to hold the rack upright while I straightened the vertical poles.Conclusion: This rack would work OK if you kept it in one spot. But, if you plan on moving your rack frequently or even occasionally, spend a little more and get one of the professional models. This rack is not sturdy enough for moving things around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit the space","review":"I needed a rack that would fit through a small door (48 inches high) into the eaves of our townhouse where it could then be expanded.

Where does one begin? This vaccum initially works well, but loses suction as soon as dirt accumulates in the canister. The attachments are a joke. No matter how securely you attach them, they fall off soon after you begin to use them. That cute little attachement with the brush bar? All for looks. The brush bar quites turning the minute it gets dirty. You can plan to have the brush bar motor replaced after a couple of months. As someone noted previously, the belts stretch and the motor burns up. And heaven help you if you try to work with Hoover's appallingly bad \\"customer service.\\" Hoover has put its money into making their product look appealing, but function very poorly indeed.

When I bought it I also bought the extended service agreement for $50 because I'd read that they didn't have a good repair record. It was a wise investment. I needed it after a year.To keep suction, you have to empty the canister each time and clean off the filter. This is a time consuming and dirty process. It loses suction quickly when the filter gets clogged. Thank goodness for the self propelled option. It's heavy and not easy to push without it. It's also very loud.It doesn't do bare floors well at all unless you use the hose and floor attachment. By just using the upright, the small rock particles are thrown by the brush to other areas of the floor and if the filter is plugged, it won't pick them up anyway.I will say that it worked pretty well in the beginning.

The third time it broke I called Hoover to find out how I could go about replacing or exchanging it. They told me \\"that's what the warranty is for,\\" and said they would not take responsibility for replacing it. So I am stuck with it.

At the most basic level, I enjoy the range of songs on this album and the incredible musicianship. Going beyond this, it seemed to me to be a good introduction (in part because of the range of songs but also because of the range of musicians) and I feel like I have already learned a lot.

True, it was years since she'd opened the front door of any house, but surely it had been easier than this?\\" Charles is the only one who is delighted since he will never have to be King.

To my eyes, it looks about as good as Warner's North by Northwest transfer, which set a high standard for material of this vintage. Both presumably benefit from being shot in VistaVision, a high-quality widescreen process that was new at the time and now largely gone.

The story opens with young Arnie Rogers (\\"The Beaver\\" Jerry Mathers) discovering a corpse lying in a open field. He runs home tells his air-head mother Jennifer (Shirley MacLaine) what he found. Jennifer thinks she did Harry in, but so does Captain Wiles (Edmund Gwenn) and Ivy Gravely (Mildred Natwick) and as a result, Harry gets buried and dug up so many times we lose track. The film is about how these diffident denizens of a small Vermont town relate, gradually revealing more and more about themselves. The dialog is wonderful, but you have to like films that move slowly with lots of conversation, if you do, you will love \\"Harry.\\" The photography is magnificent, the beauty of Vermont pours through. Vermont still looks just like it did when \\"Harry\\" was filmed, fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Alfred","review":"The more you watch this movie, the better it gets.

It is a rather unusual movie, a completely different style than his previous ones. It is made to be a comedy-mystery, shown by how Harry was constantly being dug up and burried again. Some parts of the movie were fairly good, but I didn't find it too humourous.

I have re-watched it several times since then, mostly on TCM, looking in vain for what I must have missed.I think Hitchcock must have tried to see how little he could put in a film and still have folks pay out good money to see it. Must have been some of his odd sense of humor at work. At least Weekend at Bernie's had a little fun out of the premise of a dead body being present with nobody holding their nose due to the smell.Sorry Hitch, but this one and Family Plot were duds.

A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble with Hitchcock","review":"Alfred Hitchcock always had a soft spot for his misfires; perfectionist that he was, he probably wondered what went wrong and how he could have fixed it. \\"The Trouble with Harry\\" is one of those: an embarassingly clumsy comedy that just doesn't work at all. A man is shot under unseen and unexplained circumstances and the humor is supposed to spring from how the residents of a small Vermont village deal with him. The only moments of real comedy are the romantic byplay between John Forsythe and Shirley MacLaine. \\"There are some things I just don't like to do by myself,\\" she tells him in a hilarious double-entendre.

I am a great fan of Hitch's films, and this would have to be in my personal list of favourites. Hitchcock manages to pull of a splendid balance of character, romance and dark humour, and the whole thing is a brilliantly executed bit of understatement as the cast wrestle with the practicalities of an acquaintance that just won't stay buried."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FINE BLACK COMEDY.","review":"The trouble with Harry is that he's dead. A thoroughly eccentric film (even for Hitch), it was not a success when first released back in 1955, perhaps because it's droll humour was misunderstood by the massess who preferred something more obvious and exciting. The film clearly shows that death may be beneficial to the living, since these characters do not know each other before Harry's death and develop deep mutual affection through their common cause. Edmund Gwenn is terrific as usual and Mildred Natwick was a natural scene stealer. Shirley McLaine made her film debut in this admittedly oddball film & she's a most unlikely Hitchcock heroine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, good price","review":"Awesome speaker, especially when there's a subwoofer helping out on the bass. The highs are crisp, the mids rich; they look amazing mounted.We did quite a bit of research before deciding on this set. We have them in a 25' x 25' room paired with their smaller cousins as rears and the matching center (the subwoofer's an older Infiniti). They fill the space quite nicely. We've cranked them with movies and all sorts of music and have yet to hear distortion.

I hated the heroine, the near love making scenes just got to be too much after a while. By the time thy did the deed I cold not have cared less about either of them. With the way the heroine behaved, it was a wonder no one put her in the madhouse before that, she was such a shrew.

Take a nave, if bright, niece played by Theresa Wright who finally stumbles on to his mysterious and fatal doings. Place them in middle class Santa Rosa California in the 1940's and surround them with a very conventional family and you can take it from there. The real suspense here centers on family pride and maybe just the slightest bit of doubt that Cotton is a real killer. Well you can figure the rest for yourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star movie ...","review":"While the film itself is absolutely brilliant, 'Shadow of a Doubt' loses a star for being a disappointing DVD.

Instead Universal didn't even seem to think 'Shadow of a Doubt' warranted a simple wide-screen format.I loved the film and will always think of it as one of my favorites among Hitch's works.

Its forward button didn't work so that you have to push the rewind button 59 times if you want to set the time 1 minute ahead. It is obvious that this manufactuerer has a quality problem because the odds for two things to go wrong simultaneously on a new product should be extremely low.By the way, if you haven't found your radio clock yet, check out the Teac SL-D88 clock radio.

It has a 'Fellini-esque' quality to it.It's a really good film with a really good cast.I'll be doing my own recommendations to other friends to SEE THIS FILM.jeff in fort worth"},{"rating":"1","title":"UTTER GARBAGE","review":"I agree with others who rate it as the very very worst gay movie ever. Shakey camera - extremely bad lighting. In many scenes the actors faces are too dark to enable us to see them ( this is in daylight as well). Bad script, bad editing at times and no one has any talent for acting especially tommy hamilton who gives the queeniest performance ever and he is embarrassing to watch . He has zero talent and knows nothing about the art of acting.Same for Julian le blanc who stays still and recites his dialogue without any feeling -like he is talking to a wall -simply terrible. The director -well the less said about him the better.I failed to see any direction whatsoever.This film should be seen by film students on how NOT to make a film.The dvd sleeve shows 3 touched up photos of guys on the cover.They don't look this pretty in the film. Even the title means nothing. 'Do' what?. The film gives a new meaning to the word \\"GARBAGE\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really!?!","review":"OMG! I have learned a valuable lesson about checking the reviews BEFORE I rent! I can not say it any better than these others! This movie - and I use that term loosely - was the most disappointing thing I have ever rented. Granted I don't know much about these actors but I have a difficult time calling them that! I at no time detected a plot and certainly what little sex there was had no redeeming value to it! I feel ripped of and will not waste another dime or minute with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I regret renting this movie. The camera work and lighting were terrible. It was bad enough to distract me from what plot there was. The acting was wooden on the part of pretty much everyone but Joshua Garcia.The story itself left a bad taste in my mouth. Either the writers never had siblings, or it they did they must have hated them. The \\"love\\" story of the movie didn't make any sense. Aren't we over wish-fulfillment straight to gay story-lines yet?Anyway, not worth your 1.99 to rent, try Redwoods or Strapped if you want to see something by people who actually know how to make a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words cannot express...","review":"...how utterly terrible this movie was. It did not have a single redeeming quality. I can deal with low budget, but this movie has faults that can't be blamed on the budget.

At first I was pleased with it, but after eight month's of use the table got to where it would not turn to the left or right with out grinding. Also the handle would not lock down. I took it to the local Nashville, TN service center to get it repaired. They called me back & told me they had repaired it. I went and picked it up. When I got back to work I tried it out and to my suprise the positive stops would no longer work & the front handle still would not lock down. I took it back to them & they repaired it again. 2 days later the base would not turn again. I would not buy this miter saw again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice saw, cheap fence, poor customer service","review":"THis is a sweet saw until it broke.

Bought the whole seed, rather than the ground seed, because of the better nutritional value of grinding your own. Will buy again. I read that whole seeds can pass undigested, and that ground seeds can loose their nutritional value over time. So we grind a week's worth at a time. Best used in oatmeal as the flavors blend well. Or in a cold cereal, or added to a cup of coffee for a twist. Seem to blend better in hot foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"good seeds but gravel bits","review":"I wasn't thrilled because I had to pick out tiny bits of gravel.

Grind them right before you use them, and they have a mild taste -- milder than brown flaxseed. I've ordered this product several times, and the quality has been consistently high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Good product. But remember that you need some way of grinding because apparently we can't digest whole flaxseeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good for you!!","review":"I ordered this flaxseed after reading how good ground flaxseed was for you. I ordered a grinder, both were reasonably priced, and the grinding was so easily accomplished.

The product arrived on time and in great shape--I have purchased from this vendor several times, and have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Goodness","review":"I've recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that flax seeds have terrific health benefits such as lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol. I add a tablespoon of chia seed and flax seed to my smoothies every day and since drinking my fruits and vegetables I feel better, lost some weight and have stopped having heart flutters. I'm now looking forward to having my next blood work done to see how well it has helped. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to get healthy an all natural way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"See the Star Wars star's first big role","review":"I suspect many Americans/Europeans will only discover this film because of Temuera Morrison's role as Jango Fett in \\"Star Wars II - Attack of the Clones\\". But I'm happy for that, as this is, without a doubt, one of the FINEST FILMS EVER MADE. Now that's a bold claim, but I'll stand by it. It's not fun or \\"enjoyable\\" (in the traditional sense), but it is an absolute masterpiece.It's definitely not a \\"first date\\" movie, in fact one major newspaper called it \\"A relentless sledgehammer of a film\\". With its central themes of cultural displacement, domestic violence and the struggle for human dignity, the actors handle their incredibly difficult roles with the utmost skill. It was probably the film that put New Zealand on the global film-world map.Several other reviews give an outline of the plot so let me just say this - you will never forget seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, but wrong one!","review":"This is an amazing movie, very enlightening about Maori culture, very poignant. But I have a word of caution for everyone reading this: don't order THIS particular version of the film unless you don't mind having a lower-than-DVD-quality movie with no special features. Looking at the specs, this movie is encoded in Region 0, which means it will play in all players. It also means that it probably won't look as good as it would if it were encoded for YOUR specific region. There IS a Region 1 version, for US and Canada, if that's what you are looking for. That's the one I got, and it's great! Just search for the movie again, and look for \\"Region 1,\\" but make sure it doesn't say \\"Asian\\" or \\"import\\" or \\"all region\\" anywhere on the page. The Region 1 DVD cover has the title in yellow, and it says, \\"Two thumbs up,\\" from Siskel and Ebert. It has a picture of a woman with her daughter and is mostly red.

At times this movie is very difficult to watch as it portrays quite accurately depicts the consequences of domestic violence, rape, suicide, drug use, and gang life.

However I was disgusted to read the comments of the Sydneysider. What sort of sick bigot are you. I am Maori, I'm not an alcoholic, my father never beat my mother, and my great grandfather was not a cannibal. I speak with the same vocabulary and accent as any other New Zealander. Sydneysider grow up. Don't review a movie if you have no respect for either the actors or the crew of the film. But to my point Once Were Warriors was a land mark film in New Zealand. Not bad for a bunch of Maori people who can't speak properly. Can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"This dvd does not play on North American dvd players.

Outstanting in every way...I put one star to garner your attention prior to purchasing. This blu ray is not compatable with all USA players. This is a 1080i 50Hz version. You need to ensure (if you are in region 1 or A) that your player converts to 60Hz or that your player and TV will play a 50Hz blu ray. Of course, none of the Sony's will. Check on-line, there are websites dedicated to providing lists of 50Hz compatable players.Again, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. And it is awesome!

It is simply terrible. The worst problem is the Chinese subtitles that can't be removed. They alone make the film unwatchable, but there are many other problems, including a transfer with lots of obvious dust and visible MPEG artifacting. I couldn't watch more than a few minutes but the sound quality seemed substandard as well.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Drama! One of my all time favorites!","review":"You just feel for this family. I guess it hit closer to home for me because this family did in some ways remind me of mine, especially Jake the Muss who has to be one of my all time favorite movie characters. He comes off as so ferocious and vicious at times, yet can have some endearing moments although the real him always comes out. Rena Owen is ALL WOMAN in this movie as she struggles mightily to keep her family together in the modern world after abondoning her heritage.If you haven't seen it, you must. It's that good.**Favorite Scenes: any part with the haka in it and Jake finding out the truth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching!!!","review":"I really liked this movie, it really brings out a lot of emotions as you watch all the drama that this family had to go through. The thing that touches me the most about this movie is that it is so true. Many people would like to forget and deny that these kinds of things happen everyday, but it is happening whether we like it or not. I really liked this movie and applaude the director and cast for a marvellous job. I loved this movie a lot and in a way it does teach one about courage and the importance of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie DESTROYED me","review":"When the movie was over, I felt as though I had been run over by a locomotive very slowly.

Watching this film is a truly soul-rending experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Great Film!","review":"\\"Once Were Warriors\\" is a unique and marvelous film. Gritty, scary but thoroughly believable.The film is set in the tough suburbs of south Auckland amidst a sea of social dysfunction. Yet in this sea, there are some individuals who shine however briefly. There are others who simply flounder.There are magnificent performances by Rena Owen who plays the role of Beth Heke and Temeura Morrison who plays her brutal husband Jake \\"the Muss\\" Heke. These two actors are great! See the film if only to see the characters that they have created.When seeing this film, do not expect to be uplifted. It is bleak and often terrifying. It is also very realistic. Social dysfunction is rarely pleasant. This film is not the dross of Hollywood but a real world with real people and real problems.If you see no other film this year, see \\"Once Were Warriors\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from this import version on DVD!!!!","review":"This just happens to be one of my favorite films. I own a VHS copy and its incredible. The import DVD has scratches. This is a very poor transfer. Also the DVD doesn't allow you to get rid of the Chinese characters which are totally annoying.

Even working the setup on the dvd player you cannot get rid of the Chinnese subtitles. It greatly disturbes me to have to have subtitles when there is no english version and have to watch a film but to have an english version and have to endure subtitles it throughly unacceptable. BAD! BAD! BAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Were Warriors","review":"Loved this movie. A great study of a New Zealand Maori family and the way relationships can go very wrong.

Graphic violence and disturbing sexual scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen the movie before on HBO","review":"When the movie first came out on HBO I was \\"whoa\\".. and was hooked.The movie itself shows the 'pride' and the roots of the Maori people. Whether it was in Jake, Beth or the kids. It showed many differences in having pride or trying to achieve it and also not to forget their roots and where they came from. It shows that one doesn't have to be 'set' in the structure of what or where society has placed them, you can change it if you really want to.I was both happy and saddened to what the contents of the movie had showed. Happy that it showed true to the culture of what the Maori people once were as a community in the old teachings but saddened in what future holds for life anywhere with the same circumstances.I'm originally from Hawaii myself, Part Hawaiian/Tahitian/mix and I've got Maori cousins..

Tatoos and native carved artwork became more popular because of this movie. The Aborigines of Australia were slightly less warlike but still battled exploring white people. One Maori chief was introduced to civilization and given gifts that he traded for rifles and led his people against his Maori enemies. This started an arms race of tribal extermination. What you see in the movie may be an improvement over their history.I like movies that are not shot full of political correctness. I think that I will like this one.

Just by reading the title I was able to give a complete synopsis of what the story would be about. But, I decided to give it a chance. That was my first mistake. I proceeded to make another mistake and keep watching it. Please dont waste your time. If you want to know what the story is about google the term \\"Maori\\" (include some current events in your search and other relevant facts such as their oppression ever since Europeans began to populate NZ), then re-read the title of the book/movie.

So, after we spend 100 bucks on the box set, we have to ALSO buy the standalone? This is complete BS, and unfortunately, Bruce (or his label or whoever) has pulled this previously as well (you buy Wrecking Ball on vinyl, you don't get bonus tracks, you buy \\"Seeger Sessions,\\" then a few months later another version comes out with a DVD and bonus tracks).

It was an intriguing and amazing look into this moment in time of a deeply insightful poet and songwriter's spiritual journey. But I took off a star for the \\"bonus feature\\", which was profoundly disappointing. This DVD would have been perfect if they had included the concert from 1978 or '79. They they only show brief clips of it, and I would have much rather watched that than a new concert in Asbury Park. The youthful energy of the history of the record is lost in the new concert they recorded for this DVD, which feels manufactured and insincere. Apparently you have to pay almost $100 for the whole concert. I will eventually buy it used, but after watching something all about the artistic integrity that went into making this record, it really seems an outrageous price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough worker","review":"These are solid performing and nicely made brushes.

What we have here is a very generic power metal offering. The band goes for a heavier vibe rather than the overly-pretty sound of many Euro-metal bands. Still, this doesn't really distinguish them from alot of what's out there- it just demonstrates that these guys listened to Accept as well as Helloween. The songs are interchangeable, all moving at a similar pace and featuring instantly forgettable lyrics. The one exception is the brilliant 'A Soldier's Tale', which opens with a great guitar flurry and rips along- it's the only track that sounds as though the band is really putting some heart into the song. Otherwise, just put Cryonic Temple on ice with all those other unoriginal LMP bands"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little here for anyone - spend your money elsewhere.","review":"There is more marketing of Netscape technologies in the book than there is valuable information.

That should be true of any entertainer.I don't pay attention to the lies that are published about celebrities. Perhaps some are not lies, but we never know the whole story. We don't even know them.Now young people are calling movie stars by the first names only.

I read this forgettable book about ten years ago and I don't remember a word of it. It didn't stick with me or have any important impact or message like Christina Crawford's autobiography \\"Mommie Dearest\\" that actually had a point. Her's was not written out of revenge, she had a legitimate story. Will celebrity children please stop jumping on the Mommie Dearest bandwagon? Probably not.

I can just imagine Bette Davis saying those exact words and phrases which B.D. writes.

I had not so different a childhood, and I know that only someone who had been immersed in that awful Alice in Wonderland world of dysfunction could recognize the truth of it. BD, in my opinion, is also a narcissist - self-absorbed, unable to relate to real feeling, unable to empathize, and utterly convinced that the universe was created just for her. One of her biggest complaints against her mother was that she raised her personally - always taking her to sets and locations. She planned surprise parties and other delights for her child and always made sure she had the best.

Yes, it's tough being the wealthy daughter of a famous celebrity who could be too raucous at times. Let me wipe the little tear from the corner of my eye. Hyman is such a twit that she finds her mother's passing off frozen macaroni & cheese as homecooked equally as offensive as alcoholism and suicidal tantrums. This book is her malicious, last ditch effort to drain more money out of her mother--if no longer directly from her pockets, then from her name. It reads like a campy amalgamation of all Davis' screen roles. And Hyman has the gall to claim this insulting 400pg diatribe was some sort of plea for reconciliation!

I have read several books by her and about her. This book, written by her daughter, is harsh, to say the least. The book seems to be more about the daughter, than Bette Davis. She gives a hard look at life with Bette Davis. And I have to wonder how much of it is true. All of this, from her point of view, which seems tainted. Some of it, although intended to shed a bad light on her mother, makes the daughter look like a shrew. I read this to gain some insight into Bette Davis' life. I didn't.

Quite possibly her sister, Margot, is not the only one in the family with a mental handicap. To read this, one is filled with a loathing, not for Bette Davis as the author would want, instead for the author herself. It fills me with disgust and pity for someone who would trash their mother, who from all accounts loved her very much. While reading this I didnt picture Ms Davis at all, instead I pictured Margo Channing. Hyman has gotten her mother confused with one of her most famous characters. Perhaps Hyman was chumming up with another particular author, and when she saw the cash flowing in she followed suit. At least Mommie Dearest was plausible.

Hyman wrote a scathing book here. One shouldn't judge her motives because we weren't there to witness what she had to endure growing up with one of the most famous actresses in the world. Knowing what I have read in other books about Davis (there ARE countless biographies out there), it is indeed probable that all happened as B.D. said. When one is dealing with a controlling personality, one either has to cut all ties or submit. B.D., for the sake of her family, wisely chose to cut the ties after she pleaded with her mother to change her ways. Unfortunately, no one could tell Bette Davis anything because she was always right. The things she did to her sister were deplorable. Davis is more to be pitied than anything because it is obvious she was a very unhappy and disturbed woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ungrateful overgrown brat makes money hurting celebrity mom!","review":"When I first read My Mother's Keeper, I was about 14 years old. Being young and naive, I almost believed Hyman's tale of woe about her famous mother. Thank God for being alive 15 years later. I have read the book about more than five times since then, strictly for comic relief.So Bette Davis endured an abusive marriage while B.D. was a little girl, wasn't the Betty Crocker mom, drank too much, and was occasionally obnoxious at the dinner table. So Bette Davis had faults (gasp!). Wow!...After all her mother did for her and gave her long after she was married, and this is how she repaid her. From the other Davis biographies I've read, B.D. needed her mother to shower her with gifts because her son-in-law was a lazy bum!Bette Davis is still one of greatest American actresses for all time, and that is how I will remember her in spite of her faults.

Highly strung, neurotic, and probably an alcoholic, she was demanding to the point of torture. B.D. and Jeremy, however, b***ch and moan about what a witch she is, but still had their hands out ready to take any cash she offered. If you would like a good laugh, read Narrow Is the Way, B.D.'s follow-up book detailing how they ran away to the Bahamas when creditors started chasing them in the U.S..

The terror of having a mother who curses, who doesn't make fresh casseroles, and who isn't delirously excited when her underage daughter wants to marry someone she barely knew, gosh B.D. how ever did you survive. This is clearly an attempt to jump on the celebrity mother bandwagon and sadly B.D. missed the bandwagon and thudded to the ground.

Everything about this movie is just bad... lackluster special effects, creaky convoluted story, half-hearted acting, etc. First of all, aside from the title of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Captain Nemo and the Nautilus, the film bears little resemblance to the Jules Verne novel. I understand that movies based on books are always an adaptation, but this one is a real stretch. It would almost be better if they changed the name so you wouldn't expect to see Verne's story. The cast is one of those where they use some B and C list actors with some name value but who are past their prime as far as being able to salvage this sinking wreck of a movie. Even the 1916 silent 20,000 Leagues is better than this. The Michael Caine version is also equally as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should sink 20,000 Leagues its so bad","review":"This movie is apallingly bad. I found that it has only a casual resemblance to the Jules Verne novel. Aside from the Nautilus and Nemo, the rest of the story is made up from scratch, and is not very imaginative. The special effects are lackluster, and obviously cheap CGI work (a la Sci Fi Channel productions). The story only vaguely resembles the Verne plot, with romance playing a large part of the new interpretation. The dark soul of Verne's Nemo is lost, as is Nemo's twisted notion of waging war against the nations of the world, to end war and human suffering.

There are very few books that I can read over and over, but this is one of them. And every time I read it, I pick up on something else, some sarcastic joke that I missed the last time. Evan Ames has a way of writing that makes you feel like he's sitting there, right in front of you, telling you the story of your own life.

He wrongly claims that the early settlement of Auraria grew into the present suburb of Aurora--page 45. This is completely incorrect. Auraria was located on the west side of present down-town Denver and merged with Denver in the mid 1800s. Currently the Auraria Higher Education Center, a tri-institutional campus, rests atop the former location of Auraria. Aurora can be found east of down-town Denver and is an independent suburb of Denver. There is no physical way that Auraria became Aurora. How can the author claim to know the hidden charms of Colorado when he demonstrates a complete lack of understanding regarding the state's history and geography?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected.","review":"This works exactly the way you expect a memory card to work.

Based partially in Toronto and partially in the alternate world of Marina, the story explores the concept that everyone has a twin. Marina, described as a medieval village by the sea is inhabited by shape shifters who switch between turtle and human, but the turtles have gone away and now only the human counterparts remain in the seaside village. When the Toronto-based characters become aware of the alternate universe they look for ways to bring the worlds and each other closer together.Taking bits and pieces of this surreal fantasy out of context doesn't do the story justice. It's an expertly crafted and intricately woven tale that takes you on a thoroughly entertaining journey. . The world that Pflug creates is breathtakingly beautiful. I hope we get another glimpse of Marina soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"green music","review":"This is a glimspe of two co-existing realms where only one knows of the others existence.

I didn't want this one to end. When you do put it down it will probably only be long enough to come up for air.

The one volume abridged addition is suited for quick word studies and for those looking for short background history on Greek phrases and words.The outline of the book is easy to follow. Kittel looks at every major usage of the Greek word from its cultural setting to its biblical usage. While I concur that sometimes Kittel's theology is not orthodox, his background history of the Greek word and its root usage is worth the price of the book. True New Testament Greek students will still enjoy diving into the Greek text yourself without seeing Kittel's word studies but it is helpful to see how he compares to your own exegesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nazi scholar's Bible dictionary","review":"Gerhard Kittel was both a Bible scholar and a Nazi who supported segregating Jews into ghettos where they would be denied civil rights in the broader German society.

As you progress through the game you accumulate Gusteau points which you can use to unlock in game power-ups, movie clips, mini games, cheat codes and more.

As far as we can tell, you have to master the challenges or else you go back to where you were in the story to do it over and over again. Not too fun.The graphics are really great though and the story is cute. I'm sure this is a great game for some people, but it just wasn't for us.

The special effect look expensive...and bad. The plot starts off ok, if somewhat formulaic and then just falls apart.

Not-so the makers of Sphere.A great deal of the movie is spent dazzling the viewer with very good special-effects. An equal amount of time should have been spent including many of the dialogues, from Crichton's book, the crew has with the alien intelligence. As it is, the movie does drag. As compensation, of a sort, I did learn a lot about the toxic properties of marine life on the ocean floor, and thats worth something!The DVD picture is beautifully clear, and the 6 (uh...5.1) channels of digital sound will put your home-theater system, and your neighbors, through their paces.For a Science-fiction fanatic like myself it was okay.

That means, amongst other things, that the initial premise, however hard to believe, is pursued to its logical endpoint.

Boy, am I disappointed.The most (or the only) interesting part was the opening sequence. Then it went straight downhill. I was so bored after 20 minutes into the movie that I really wanted to fast forward it. The script was so bad I don't understnad why the stars bothered to do this film in the first place. I thought I couldn't go wrong with the all-star cast. Boy I was so wrong! Could have spent the renting money on the Abyss (will be available soon). Now, THAT's a movie.

If Lem cared more about bothering to deal with American pop-culture \\"creators\\" he could most definitely sue the authors and makers of the various blatant rip-offs of his works. If you don't know what I'm talking about then read \\"Solaris\\" or see the Andrei Tartofsky film adaptation (of which \\"Event Horizon\\" in particular is a complete rip-off.) Lem has been an unattributed source of a lot of ideas that Hollywood has gussied up, even though his works are quite brilliant enough in themselves. \\"The Matrix\\" is another prime example.

The second half is weak, bland, and unexciting. The film stays true to the book, but abandons all the qualities that made is such a page-turner. Gone are the ever reaching tentacles of the squid monster; they've been replaced by a sonar blip in the shape of a squid. This is incredibly not scary. Also, the dialogue consists of our characters blandly saying things that progressively make little sense, to the point where the end is just a bunch of jumbled words. \\"Sphere\\" is a film that makes you feel mad at everyone involved for turning in such a weak film. It starts out so promising, then gives us very little. What a darn shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been great....but wasn't!","review":"The first 15-20 minutes of the movie was entertaining. Then it all went to hell. It seemed to me that Crichten slapped a bunch of random ideas together and made it into what barely passed as a story.

I really looked forward to seeing if my mental picture of the sphere and all that happened would resemble what the movie showed. What a disappointment. It wasn't even close. Had the movie followed the story in the book I would have concluded that my image needed an update. But the movie was just blah. It lacked the ability to capture you in the story.

If I had to describe it in as few words as possible, I would say that it's like a mixture of \\"The Thing\\" and \\"The Abyss.\\" There's a lot of paranoia and suspicion when things start to occur, and no one is quite sure where to put the blame. So if you like that sort of mystery/science whodunnit-style cinema, you will enjoy this.

The movie is \\"based' off the book almost always; it isn't an exact representation, and how could it be? Reading a book is an entirely different experience than watching a movie. The book is amazing. So is the movie, in my opinion. I thought the cast and the acting was stellar, and I was always enthralled and caught in suspense. I think the ending is beautiful, not anticlimactic. Why does the ending of a science fiction thriller always have to be a huge climax? This is a unique ending that wraps everything up in a very simple way. This will always be one of my favorite movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sphere mostly disappoints","review":"There are a couple of reasons to watch Sphere and the main one is simply because of Samuel L. Jackson, starring in his first of two underwater films. (I guess he still hasn't learned) Anyway, he delivers a great performance, and unlike in Deep Blue Sea, doesn't get cut off (literally) in a middle of a speech and torn in half. Another reason to watch Sphere is for some good special effects. They are there, but there is no story to back it up. Actually, there is a story that has a good mystery element to it but unfortunately NOTHING is explained. And if you thought matters weren't resolved in Event Horizon, wait till you watch Sphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOVIE STARTS STRONG THAN LOSES IT IN THE END.","review":"Hoffman, Stone and Jackson look so out of place in this SCI FI thriller taking place where else but space.

The movie sphere is not completely terrible, but not amazing. I guess that Hollywood believes if you throw in enough cursing it will make any movie good. But I think, as some of the other viewers do, that they should have stuck more to the book. It is a terrific story that I have read enjoyably several times. But the makers should have spent more time on the film! If the basic plot would have been as inspiring as the book, I wouldn't have minded to sit two more hours for it. It had the basis to become a terrific blockbuster equal to Jurassic Park. But unfortunately it doesn't come close to what I anticipated. The movie is ok for the, \\"Blow em up, blood and dribble\\" lovers. But if you want complete satisfaction, READ THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Bad movie off a bad book this film would never have made it if it wasnt a Chrichton novel.

I can't honestly tell you how much I hate this movie the only thing I can tell you is that I would not watch this movie again for a million dollers. The movie just drones on and on. Plus there is no point to the movie here let me sum it up for you. The go down in ocean and fool around with a giant beach ball for 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Why would anyone make a movie this bad? Furthermore,why would Barry Levinson make a movie this bad? I suppose I will be on my way to unlocking at least one of the secrets of Hollywood when I figure that out. This is so awful it probably killed reprint sales of the book for a time.Just terrible. Made no sense whatsoever, and will insult whatever intelligence you have with its thoughtless, cynical moral, which is somewhere along the lines of \\"if we could bring to existence whatever we dream, it'd all be ugly and horrible because that's what people are made of.\\" Real deep, huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't rent or watch me","review":"I did not like this movie and that has nothing to do with the fact that i read the book.This movie is a failure because the director failed to capture the notion of hysteria. What you get is small amounts of confusions.The story is about the unknown, and confusion would mean that people are not sure about certain things. Following what the SPHERE is supposed to do and be, everything is possible and anything can happen. There should be hysteria.The movies makes attempts at greatness, but falls short because of minor issues. For example, toward the end, three survivors are being held for debriefing, and you see the sub-title Day One on the screen. For affect, shouldn't it say Day three. Then the viewer would think, wow, three days, in a room, with nothing to do, wow. Instead, we see, day one, and then the movie is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Top Ten WORST","review":"This is an unbelievably bad movie and the actors who appeared in it aught to be ashamed and sue to have their names taken off it.

DO NOT buy this thing, whatever you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great effects, bad movie","review":"After watching this, I was scratching my head as to why they would blow so much money on the amazing special effects, with such a lame script. I think the actors did OK with what they had to work with, but sometimes the stuff they said or did just didn't make any sense! The movie starts off promisingly, with an interesting premise (scientists discover a mysterious futuristic craft on the bottom of the ocean, and slowly unravel where it came from), but pretty soon loses it and becomes annoying. Worth renting only if you're into seeing the cool underwater visuals.A better underwater movie (but older so with less advanced effects): The Abyss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, pure genius!","review":"This is a great movie, don't let the numb minded Critics change your mind on buying this movie! I must say this a movie with a great plot that you will learn to love more and more everytime you watch it! The cast is without a doubt a great bunch of actors. The soundtrack was done by one of the best Composers ever, which helps bring out the suspense, and action. The ending may seem lame the first time you watch it, but it is just like in the movie \\"Arlington Road\\", if you think about what happens in the end you really understand the pure genius of it! I recomend this movie to anyone, but most of all to Sci-fi fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer disapointment","review":"Why don't screenwriters learn how to read? This movie misfires each time it steers away from Crichton's novel, which provided yet a ready-made script. The filming is poor (we never get a clear sense of the underwater station's topography), the acting is clearly below average (the whole cast appears to be as bored as the audience turns out to be), and most of all the whole production looks cheap (the jellyfish is OK, but where the heck is the giant squid?

Unfortunately, most movies come from Hollywood--and we all know where the heads of most Hollywood executives spend most of their time.Samuel Jackson? Maybe.But Dustbin Hoffman???

The premise is from current science. The suspense increases and brings out the various characters personalities and how they each attempt to deal with each other, control and the unknown.

The authority figure played by Peter Coyote suffers the worst.The end of the movie is flaccid and actually kind of funny.A more successful movie in the same vein wasSolaris."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Abyss' ugly cousin...","review":"...and this sci-fi-thriller is wrecked by a bad script, unsympathetic characters (or pathetic acting -you choose!), unforgivable performances by a talented cast such as Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone (who hasn't played in a good movie for a while) and Samuel L. Jackson. None of them can save \\"Sphere\\". It is one of those movies that promises a lot, and when the movie is over you feel cheated. First time I saw \\"The Abyss\\" I actuallt felt a bit more \\"hungry\\", but nowhere near this. Uninspiring and boring and chaotic and confusing and stupid! Easy money, no doubt! It's not even at the same level as \\"Event Horizon\\" -and this should really draw you the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste for 3 big stars","review":"I like sci-fi flicks a lot but this one really blew me away.

What started out as an interesting premise - an alien spacecraft trapped on the ocean floor, becomes rapidly tedious. If there is no action in the movie, then there needs to be character development so that I will care when the characters start getting knocked off. No luck here.I hoped that the movie commentary from Hoffman and Jackson would at least be enlightening, but it was of little value as well.You would be better off renting \\"Forbidden Planet\\" - same premise, better movie. Plus it had Ann Francis in a much better costume than Sharon Stone, and RObbie the Robot getting drunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good reviews must be generated by WB publicity dept","review":"I just read the book, which I found impossible to put down. It was no great piece of literature but a gripping page turner with enough scientific theory to give it credibility. The film is such a disapointment. It leaves out the most interesting and thought provoking material, provides little sense of the characters and or the mystery of the sphere. Instead it showcases a series of action sequences and melodramatic confrontations between the three stars. I guess this would be entertaining but the effects are second rate and nothing new. I know nothing about film making but kept thinking that the producers' budget must have been too limited to do this the right way. I don't see how anyone could have liked this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not reflect Reformed thinking","review":"I don't have the book in front of me anymore, so I can't pull quotes from it, but I remember thinking as I read this book that the author didn't really understand what the Reformation was about. At one point, he says in effect \\"God's love responds to man's faith\\". The Reformers clearly taught that man's faith responds to God's love and His calling.

That was the most distracting part of the whole movie and spoiled a great deal of it - Mel's not from Boston and only those people from Boston can pull it off. Mel - you may have done fine with a Scottish accent in \\"Braveheart\\" but your Boston dialect in this movie was horrible!!

The BBC Series Edge of Darkness was an original, quirky and inspired drama that is still worth watching nearly three decades later. The casting was superb, the script for the most part tight, and the performances truly memorable. This film, which basically borrows the title and a few names from the BBC original, is silly, lightweight, badly written and poorly acted. Instead of a complex political drama we have John Wayne meets West Wing. There's really nothing much of merit in this film - it's a tired old \\"one man against the world\\" schtick and frankly we've been there, done that, and moved on a long time ago.

Mel Gibson plays a police officer whose daughter is murdered. He finds out that she had came into contact with a biological agent at her job. He decides to investigate the corruption and expose it. He didn't realize how high up the ladder this scheme actually goes, but he'll give his life to render justice.This really is a great movie. Lots of people give Mel a bad rap for being a little crazy, but I don't care. A good movie is a good movie, no matter how off his rocker the actor may be. Edge of Darkness delivers suspense action, and some pretty heavy drama. It's a very compelling story and it makes you wonder what is going on in America that we don't know, or even want to know.

However Gibson couldn't think of one single person who would want to kill a Boston detective.He is armed with a few clues: His daughter was sick, barfing her guts out. There was a phone call to her cell phone shortly after she was killed and the person hung up. In going through her effects, he finds a hand gun. His detective work quickly leads him to believe she was the target. The acting was good. The script was fairly solid, although one of the first signs of radiation poisoning is diarrhea, something we didn't get to see, and perhaps that is a good thing.Warning: There is one scene where he bad mouths post traumatic stress syndrome (Gulf Wars) as something that doesn't exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"no dvd :(","review":"when i received this item, there was no dvd, however it was sealed completely, no signs of tampering.

In an effort to build suspense each scene was shot in ultra-paranoia that led absolutely nowhere. Gibson is simply too old to be a 'badass' anymore; the days of 'Payback' are long gone. The action was awfully slow while the acting made it want to be a fast paced film. This falls way short of all the hype and commercial placement that was put out for this movie.

Add to that Mel Gibson himself, as he's been portrayed in mainstream tabloid stories, and this movie has three major strikes going against it from their perspective.However, for those of us who have no trouble believing in a soul and/or a government hand in 9/11 -- and don't judge Mel based upon tabloid journalism -- this is outstanding. Mel is a terrific actor, and in this movie we believe he is suffering beyond words over his daughter's murder. We believe him when he turns that suffering into action in pursuit of the truth. And we believe the underlying premise; i.e., that evil criminals control the levers of power in this country and have an agenda that sees the rest of us merely as sheep to be slaughtered."},{"rating":"1","title":"edge of hollywood","review":"Edge of darkness... AKA where Mel Gibson is right now. In short: bad script, doctrinaire lines, idiot mystery spy supporting role (De Niro walked away from that role while on set...no wonder...with lines like those) and depressing supporting cast. Director relies on shock factor every ten minutes to wake you up. A great concept wasted. Gibson's statement to Hollywood: 'You killed me, but I don't care coz I believe.' That insight the only redeeming factor. And his acting."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-100c6312"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/3.md","filePath":"quotes/3.md"}'),R={name:"quotes/3.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
