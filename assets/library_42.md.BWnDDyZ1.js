I can't imagine what the comforter would look like after it had been washed a few times. The crib sheet was very thin and scratchy.

Qwaali becomes about the sound, words are repeated in song until they lose their outward meaning and a deeper truth is revealed. This recording is filled with an amazing energy that perhaps could not be caught in any studio. There are instances of microphone feedback which only show the trance that the musicians got into, their total oblivion. This tape can bring you to tears before you know it. This is devotional music which can be felt through the cassette, a devotion to the mysteries and the sadness and the lack of comprehension of life, a devotion to God and to brotherhood, and it can be felt without any knowledge of Urdu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Identity crises","review":"Well it seems everyone has their own differing opinions and this band seemed to have a differing opinion on what it was trying to accomplish musically. I grew up listening to these kinds of progressive rock bands and I really loved this bands first album, although I admit I kept thinking that it was an attempt by Rod Evans who had previously sung with Deep Purple, to sort of \\"get even\\" with his former band by attempting to out-gun them with his new musical line-up.The first record had a very aggressive though not necessarily \\"heavy\\" sound. The musical interplay conveyed a sort of rock \\"drama\\". If you liked the musical direction the first record took you probably won't like this follow-up recording at all. I was amusued at the \\"Pink Floyd meets Santana\\" analogy. This is unfortunately an appropriate comparison, what a disasterous combination! The bands first record was \\"Definitely Listenable\\", unfortunately \\"Sufficiently Breathless\\" left me \\"Totally Bored\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscovered a Gem!","review":"I have always really dug this album from the time it was released and was wondering if I was the only person out there to appreciate this band.

These are #1 and #2 in my cd collection but I have yet to decide in which order."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mellower, groovier Captain.","review":"For my money Sufficienty Breathless is just as good an album as Captain Beyond's debute, but stylisticly it is a definite shift. While their first album was psycodelia rich, hard blues-rock, Breathless tones down the edge a bit, and rhythmicly takes a step more in Santana's direction.But the playing here is just as tight, the song writing is just as good, and Rod Evan's voice is an absolute treasure.I would definitely recommend people new to the band should start with their first album, but you'll want to pick this one up as well. It's a shame this band didn't last any longer then it did, but at least they lasted long enough to make two exceptional albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Captain rocks!","review":"If you don't have the first album than by all means buy that now. If you like it, which you will, than you may consider buying the second and third. They all have a different feel and production but are all excellent in their own right. The first Captain Beyond album is one of the best hard rock albums ever made so check it out. Sufficiently Breathless is very, very good just not as hard as the first. Creative song writing and talented musicianship throughout. You won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Bogus","review":"Captain Beyond's second album is so weak in contrast to their brilliant debut it's hard to believe it's even the same band. Whereas the first album is heavy with a variety of musical influences, the second album sounds like watered down Allman Brothers. Without Bobby Caldwell's excellent drumming the progressive quality of the previous album is gone. The only worthwhile song is the title cut which musically resembles \\"And You And I\\" from Yes' Close to the Edge album. Avoid this and get the first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd effort","review":"We all know that Sufficiently Breathless isn't as good as the first. However, lets be fair. As creative musicians they were simply expressing themselves in a different manner. If you listen closely the musicianship is still there, its just a different style. Do I like the first one better -- absolutely! But I don't think Captain Beyond has to apologize to anybody for this effort. It is, truly, a very good album. I own all three Captain Beyond CDs and I'm not the least bit sorry about any of them. At any rate, in my humble opinion, you won't be disappointed having this in your collection. If you really want to know why the first and second are so different just look at who penned them. Every song on the first album was written by Caldwell & Evans. All songs on S.B. were written by Lee Dorman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece from 1973","review":"This is without a doubt one of the greatest album released in 1973.

Many of the stories are told from the perspective of eye witnesses and include other bits of timely and relevant history that help to capture the moment.

I always wondered how alot of things came about such as the use of tools and weapons. This book explains it all. It teaches you about why there were fallen angels and what they taught us, like making weapons, tools, mirrors, jewelry, etc... (these were things that we were not supposed to know about here on earth.) If you are interested at all in knowing about the true fallen angels this is the best book I have found out there so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reasoning and Outlandish Claims","review":"First off, when I recieved the book there was a cigarette hole burned on one of the pages. (Nice one!) Right out of the package. Then when I opened it, I realized that all the claims that the book is based around are pretty far fetched and really cannot be substantiated. Every time the Bible used the words like: Evil Ones, Sinner, Wicked, etc. aren't really talking about people, but fallen angels....ummm...what?!Supposedly John the Baptist refuted these angels in the gospels by saying, \\"You brood of Vipers!\\" Umm...it doesn't take a rocket scientist to prove that in the sentence before (or the current one) says that he's talking with the Pharisees and Saduccees. The Bible is very clear on that point and I'm not sure what the writer was thinking.Too much conjecture, and false analogies in my opinion. I'm really sorry I bought this book. I wished whoever burned the one page burned the rest of it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Mumbo Jumbo","review":"Once again another flop, this book is a crock of mess suited more for the arm chair Philosophers and the Pseudo- Jargonist, who like to hear themselves talk or in this case, see themselves write. More conjecture over facts and speculation over evidence, a literal fondue of other peoples work. Your money would be better spent at Costco on a jumbo case toilet paper. Nothing grounded nor ground breaking. I would not insult even the new Age category with its like. I tore it to shreds 3 days after receiving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"speculative","review":"The interest here is in the actual Books rather than speculative opinions. These ancient Books were written for the few scholars rather than public mass consumption. A further limitation is the subject matter which narrows the readership still further from ancient Deism and Paganism. Salvific history is from the Creation. The Fall of Adam and Eve coupled with that of created eternal intelligence and Free Will. Salvific History its origins and consequences. The consistency of matter and material is also meant to be jigsawed into growing Dogmatic understanding and revelation. This is how the material is supposed to be used. The speculative sensationalism here displayed is phantasy in print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informational Stuff","review":"I found this book very helpful because in this world there are good angels and there are bad angels. It is only a certain type of person who can see that there are some strange things out there in the world and we should be aware. The watchers can also be in the media while using sexual immorality while we live in the last days. Maybe, it is true with our sex crazed society that's probaly ruled by impure spirits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring And Unoriginal","review":"First off, there is nothing startling about this waste of paper and ink. In fact, the whole concept of angels abandoning their heavenly abodes for the sake of earthly women is a theme that has been explored by bigger (and better) writers of both fiction and nonfiction. The constant comparing of the Book of Enoch to the books of the Bible grows dull very quickly, and the author's own commentary doesn't really add much, either. If you're truly interested in the Nephilim, then I suggest reading \\"The Gods of Eden\\" or \\"Genesis Revisited\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used this book researching my own book. Very Good.","review":"I wrote a Christian fiction book (Revelations, Alpha and Omega) and this book was the one I used while researching the Book of Enoch. I did first compare many passages from all the known version I could get my hands on and this one was worth purchasing. Great extra's that I also used in my own story. This book points out things I learned from other sources as well about the modern church and its history and how an important book like Enoch's was removed from our Bible just because it endorsed the idea of giants being the offspring of fallen angels and mankind's seed. Modern theology still won't accept that truth yet Jude (the half-brother of Jesus Christ) quotes the book of Enoch word for word (Jude 14-15 IS Enoch chapter 2). Remember, the Church persecuted Galileo for heresy because he upheld the theory that the earth was round instead of flat. That was only 400 years ago. Our race needs to wake up and re-read the past and make new conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, Lacking","review":"Overall I found this book disappointing. The basic premise of this book seems to be that the Book of Enoch was rejected/suppressed because it makes it quite clear that certain angels became fallen because of lust, not pride. And this is what was unacceptable to the church fathers who believed that angels where entirely spiritual and not capable of mating with anything physical. I think she makes her case well but I don't think this is much of a revelation if someone like me is already aware of this.

So I was pleased to see that they had come out with a line of straps. I was particularly attracted to the non-slip grip feature. I just put the strap on my Canon 20D and am very disappointed. First, the strap is rather short with no capacity to make it longer. The worst part ... the non-slip grip feature is totally ineffective. It wouldn't stop anything from slipping off your shoulder. It doesn't even feel tacky. My old UPstrap is going back on the camera and this thing is going in the trash. What a waste of money! Why did I give it two stars? I don't even know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be described in two words... TO SHORT","review":"After doing some research and reading the opinions I purchased this strap. As usual Amazon delivered the package in a flash. I own a Nikon DSLR and wanted a strap that can be removed when i'm using my holster case. When the package arrived I was impressed by the packaging. The strap looked great... seemed to be made well but as soon as I removed it from the package I noticed that it was short... real short... There is no way I could wear this any other way than around my neck. i had intentions of slinging it over my shoulder but it wasn't going to happen. The camera would end up in my armpit!And as the other reviewer stated... there is no room for adjustment.It would be nice if they sold some sort of extenders...To eliminate this problem Lowepro should include a picture of someone wearing this strap attached to a camera. It would have saved me a lot of trouble. Withing 5 minutes it was repacked for return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful at all","review":"This camera strap will NOT stay up on your shoulder unless you prefer to drap it across your chest on the other shoulder. The product says it has non-slip fetaures but this is not the case. The so-called non-slip material is actually just a stringy-decorative-like pattern that provides no grip at all. I bought two of these...one for my camera (Nikon D200) and one for my father's camera (Canon XT) and the straps do not work for either of us. Our factory straps have better grip. These are already boxed up and ready to return. It's a shame really because it IS a very nice strap. Very comfortable and nice....just won't stay on the shoulder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange and floaty","review":"I bought this book thinking it was the 'other' Cloud Atlas: I read it anyway and found it hard to put down.

Several of these bombs landed in California, the state of Washington and most in Alaska.But beyond this, the story is very dull.

About 6 months into use, and rarely was it used, it really just stopped working. I would say it would play about 1 of every 2 DVD's we'd play. Now we're lucky if it even starts a DVD and when it does it doesn't play without breaking and pausing and stuttering. It's really, really, really bad!

I wanted periods of silence to be able to go into a meditative state and prompts to refocus my attention, breath, and my awareness of my body. I got what I wanted and I still use it to this day.

DEVIANT WAY stunned me. It is a fascinating puzzle, solved by a flawed but engaging hero, peopled with a number of intriguing suspects, with enough red herrings to keep you guessing until the very last page.I've read some of the negative reviews here and, quite frankly, I'm a bit surprised. To those readers who think Paris makes a \\"dumb\\" move at a critical point in the novel, I suggest reading that section a little more carefully. Paris isn't following that car because he believes the killer is inside. At that point, he is being led by, well, another part of his anatomy.I am a big fan of Richard Montanari's work. He writes heart-pounding, complex whodunits that are virtually impossible to put down. Is DEVIANT WAY great literature? Probably not. Is it a great thriller? Absolutely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting my intelligence","review":"The story told is logically inconsistent in several areas, and the inconsistencies ruin the book. At one point in the book, detective Jack Paris follows the killer's white BMW, but apparently makes no attempt to get the license plate number. Shortly afterward, Paris is voyeuristically window-peeping at \\"Pharaoh\\" and bit character Andrea Heller, but is unable to get a glimpse of \\"Pharaoh's\\" face. Does he do anything to catch \\"Pharaoh's\\" attention to make him look at the window? Of course not! This is one stupid cop--but he's supposed to have solved eighty-one percent of the homicides he's investigated. The superhuman strength and stealth attributed to \\"Saila\\" are entirely implausible and unexplained, and the way women keep throwing themselves at Paris boggles the mind, especially since he's described as rather ugly, and something of a loser. Montanari gets two stars for style, but no points for a very weak story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about a thriller!","review":"Deviant Way was a thrill ride from beginning to end, and I'm not sure how I was ablt to take time to breath. I must have gasped for air as I turned the pages. Jack was a flawed hero, but he seemed very real to me, and I really cared about him. If you enjoy dark thrillers with a to-die-for mystery, then this book is for you. I voted it best mystery and thriller the year it was released. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow","review":"If you're on a plane, or the beach and want a page turner, Deviant Way will satisfy. If you're looking for depth, analysis, plot related research, or closure, you'll be sorely disappointed. There is no question that the book holds one attention, and Montanari deserves credit for that ability, but what he gains in style, he quickly loses in depth. There is no obvious research or attention to detail as in a Chricton novel. There is no analysis into the central characters' psyches as in a Harris novel and there is no closure or satisfaction in the end as in a Steven's novel i.e. \\"By Reason of Insanity.\\" In short, as a fan of intelligent, creative, provacative, and well rounded mysteries, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting topic","review":"I really like this movie - good acting, great story, great characters.

There seems to be too much Mike Wedgwood here, where he sings on most of the cuts here, such as the ever mushy \\"Lover\\". David Sinclair is on this album, but you hardly even notice him at all, it's almost like he didn't care at this point, which is even less surprising since he left after this album to be replaced by Jan Schelhaas. Caravan had made some of the greatest Canterbury prog albums out there, but sorry to say, with Cunning Stunts, the band messed up here. Don't make this your first purchase. Try an earlier release first, like In the Land of Grey & Pink."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"One of Caravan's weaker moments.

I do indeed have Admiral Blue cushions. I had picked the \\"blue\\" color option.Bottom line is in the hot sun these dark colors will be absorbing lots of solar energy and will be hot and may show signs of fading faster than a lighter color.

I vacuumed them, but a green powder kept rising to the surface of the lounge. If I swiped my hand over the cushion it had a green powder that wiped right off. Amazon did credit me 25% of the price of the cushions as I didn't want to pack them up and ship them. Amazon didn't know how much, if any $$ could be given me on return. I thought I could wash them, dry them and they might be OK. Nope - A green powder forms on them each time they dry. Has anyone else had this problem?

After playing it wondered what happened to this group. There are only 3 good songs on this album (Freezer Burnt, Maybe Someday, and Anthem) but the rest of the CD is filled with annoying high pitched vocals and a too mellow and sappy sound.

But I do write (only one novel and several non-fiction) but this little book is an excellent and easy read to help aspiring writers with the entire writing process. She begins characters, moves through structure and all the other points many of which I never thought of and ends with publishing and editors and agents, you name it.

Great little book for writers or anyone interested in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"How I Write: Secrets of a Bestselling Author","review":"I downloaded the Kindle version and although some of the areas regarding self publishing were dated, this was an excellent purchase.

However, as someone who has read many great books on writing and have been published, I was disappointed with this book. I had been expecting a stream of unique thoughts and insights on writing. Instead, this book is a Q & A of questions that Janet has answered her fans from her website, sprinkled with technical tips by Ina.For me, it wasn't unique and I didn't learn anything new. I confess that I skimmed through a couple of the Q & A's because of redundancy or because I've heard it before. The layout isn't conducive to a thorough covering of any one topic. Also keep in mind that some of her advice isn't what the majority of publishers and agents recommend.However, for anyone who's an Evanovich fan or who is just starting in writing, this book could be helpful. Her voice was strong and she does have a way of cutting through things in a no-nonsense and humorous way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"The book is designed for someone who has never written anything. If you've even read one issue of Writer's Digest you will have everything shared in this book. If you really want to write mysteries Hallie Ephron's book \\"Writing and Selling Your Mystery Novel\\" is much better. If you are a novice writer completely ignore the formatting information Evanovitch gives in the back of the book. 14 pt Genva with 1.5\\" margins is NOT the industry standard. 12 pt Courier or Times New Roman with 1\\" to 1.2\\" margins is. If you're a bestseller you could turn in a manuscript in crayon and they would still publish your book, but unknowns don't have that luxury. If you just want to read it for fun, it's an easy read, but if you want real information look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"Janet is so generous in her writing advice on her website and in this book. No you won't find stuff on how to get published but there are tons of other books that tell you how to do that.

What could be more fun than drinking champagne and eating m and ms and writing sex scenes? It sure makes me want to start typing. Plus she gives great advice on characterization and plotting in a fun way. Many writing books are dry.

It was so much easier to read than others I have purchased in the same genre. I like the way questions are answered with humor. I like the way the instructions are set apart in gray background boxes.

Some OK special effects, but the acting is really painful to watch (specially Matt McCoy firing a gun), low babe value and bad on racial stereotypes. But what is really irritating is that it is a movie about Rangers, who's motto is that no one is left behind (everyone makes it back, dead or alive).

There are no photos in the ENTIRE book, & it has nothing to compare real skin tones to. Even the colored pencil sample pages grouping the four seasonal color palettes aren't really accurate, as everything is grouped either in yellow, pink, blue, or grey tones, and this didn't help in 'finding a season' for me, mostly due to the fact that I've saw 2 copies, both had the 'same' shade listed, but really showed two very different shades of pink! Not to mention some colors were listed under a different season all together. If it can vary that much from one printing to the next, what are we to believe?You just can't tell if colors in this book would flatter anyone, since it's just filled with drawings... & if anyone could look as good as the drawings do, then I wouldn't mock people with pink hair as much as I do.So......Unless you're a cartoon or comic book character...

Why bother to read more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fast action","review":"This book moved along very quickly, which is something I appreciate, since I hate wading through long and useless pages of description. I did have a little trouble believing some of the heros actions, like when he comes home to find his girlfriend murdered. Why didn't he give his name when he called 911? And how could he possibly leave if he really cared about her? I also found it hard to believe that someone working in the white house would be so phsyically fit and good with a gun. On the whole, however, the book was interesting, packed with very readable action scenes, like car chases. A good read if you aren't interested in a great deal of depth and you don't mind that the main character makes all these \\"heroic\\" choices, rather than realistic ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nancy drew","review":"Very boring and not anything like the nancy drew books.I am very surprised and disappointed. This is of course in black and white, not in color like the cover.It is about a girl named Nancy Drew who lives next door to a boy named Ted who likes to play tennis with another girl, whom Nancy constantly schemes to help her out. He has a bratty kid sister and brother who have of course nothing to do with the actual Nancy Drew books.'Nancy' gets Ted into all kinds of situations; she can't figure things out;she panicks before she even knows there is a bad' guy because Ted's bratty siblings had put a fire cracker under the hood and 'Nancy' is sure that someone must be trying to blow her up. But when the bad guy chases her, she doesn't know why and isn't even careful about the evidence which she lets get stolen from her.It is just one set of silly things after another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful movie that has stood the test of time","review":"Nancy Drew continues to be one of the most popular and enduring adventure series for girls ever penned. It also served as the basis for a series of very fine films starring Bonita Granville as the plucky young girl whose curiosity and enthusiasm were always getting her into trouble. Nancy Drew: Reporter finds her sneaking out an exciting crime report to investigate for a local paper and promptly embroiling her friend Ted and wisecracking older brother Carson smack into the middle of a tangled and dangerous mystery. A wonderful movie that has stood the test of time and continues to be as enjoyable and family friendly as when it first debuted, Nancy Drew: Reporter is a very highly recommended addition to all community library video movie collections and we can only hope that Bridgestone Multimedia will eventually be able to bring out all the other wonderful Nancy Drew movies from a cinematic yesteryear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Drew, Reporter meets Hitchcock - well, kinda....","review":"Nancy Drew, Reporter (1939) is a very good entry in this series. I watched it for the first time the other night and was amused by two scenes with Psycho references. Since the movie was made over 20 years before Hitchcock's masterpiece, the scenes are pure coincidence, but worth sharing...during the movie, one of the characters appears in drag looking eerily like Mother Bates! and in another scene, which takes place on a rooftop, there is a sign in the background advertising the Bates Hotel! I had to smile. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Really, really comfortable. I never take it off, I wear it in place of my engagement ring and matching wedding band.

Its a great addition to my CD collection and I've listened many times. She rocks out on some of the songs and some of the songs sound so beautiful. She is so versatile. And it was great to hear her live with a band. She does a great job on Promised Land, In Between, Scarecrow, etc. Erin is a fun song. She does an incredible job on Cliff Eberhardt's my fathers shoes. I've seen Colleen many times live and this CD truly captures her live sound. Get the CD, it will be a great addition to your CD collection. And see her live. She's fantastic!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Eyes","review":"This video was delivered to me within a reasonable time and it was in very good condition.

While the text is precise and often very detailed, this book fails to make the connection between the present and the past. Moreover, it's author (a convert to Catholicism) bases his theories on his own ideas and not on anthropologic evidence. Failing to hold a degree in anything remotely related to the subject matter, and not having real-first hand knowledge of druidic practice lead me to seek more authoritative sources.I recommend this guide to anyone who just wants some basic info on Druidism. If, however, you'd like to follow this path, a more practical guide (Cunningham or others) is recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fave books","review":"This is one of the best mystery books ever, but, as with many Kindle versions of classic books, there are a lot of errors and inadvertent changes"},{"rating":"2","title":"vintage mystery","review":"I am a Peter Wimsey fan!

Ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caravan's Finest Hour!","review":"The progressive-rock group Caravan never really achieved much commercial success in the US. But, still had some loyal fans. They received a modest amount of radio airplay back on album rock stations in the early to mid 70's. This album probably was Caravan's Finest Hour! The best tracks on this one are Memory Lain Hugh Headloss, Hoedown, and A Hunting We Shall Go Pengola Backwards. The price is a bit steep, but may be worth it to those who still enjoy the days of classical rock music, like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'thlu Thlu","review":"This is one of those absolutely essential records that every grasshopper and bong brain should own for just those times when you know that you want to listen to some rock and/or roll but are unsure exactly what to bung in the Toshiba. 1973's Plump finds Caravan expertly blending the laid back with the robust while lobbing the occasional jazzy wackadoodle into the mix for good measure. The noodling and understated vibe throughout won't exactly blow the doors clean off but the overall effect is nevertheless one of a certain solid voodoo being finessed right in front of your ears. Plus the fact that you have a boatload of bonus material on this disk means the dang yoke pulses onward for upwards of 78 minutes--an album length you'd have to call generous at the very least. Soothes and suits me every time at any rate. Great production on this record too which makes it sound right beefy at high volume. All in all a bang-up job by the boys from Canterbury.

Beyond that the interesting facts are few and far between. Also, it did not do a good enough job convincing me that the only reason they were denied a bowl bid is becaue of their race.

The ten minute tracks consist primarily of feedback drone and the same repeated clanging sound effect repeated ad infinitum, with the occassional sample and little to no variation. In fact, I find most of the tracks to be indistinguishable from each other. When I first purchased this I lay in bed with the lights out, hoping for a scare, but all I got was too bored to fall asleep.If you're looking for REAL industrial soundscapes, I suggest Nurse With Wound's Spiral Insana, or Coil's How To Destroy Angels EP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Industrial","review":"This CD is too industrial for me.

I felt while reading this Steel took her formula of putting wealthy people into everyday situations and just wrote a book to get it out to her publishers for some deadline. I read this book in an hour, and at the end of it, I found myself extremely disappointed. It's one thing if the book is good, and short, but this was not that.

Grown children disapprove. The characters however are not fleshed out enough to give you true empathy for them. The book reminds me of a happily ever after version of Bridges of Madison County.

I just could not sympathize with any of the characters, especially the grown children. Maybe I would have liked the story better without the Hollywood glitz, but probably not much. I always knew what was going to happen next, and throughout the whole book I just wanted to shout at the charcters \\"GET REAL!!\\" So far I have read about 20 books from this author and the only ones I've liked have been Mixed Blessings, Accident, Daddy, and The Gift. I'm seriously considering giving up on Danielle Steel. It amazes me that she's sold as many books as she has; I'm not even going to get into the grammatical problems she has.

Troughout the book I had the impression that she had written it in one afternoon. The story is as simple as one you would read in a magazine and totally predictable, so much in fact that as I kept reading what I expected happened, and I had to stop reading to get over my disappointment.

But this one consists almost exclusively of exposition. \\"They had a fabulous weekend.\\" \\"Their sex was phenomenal.\\" \\"His children were the light of his life.\\" Etc. It's more like a synopsis than a novel. I see Danielle dictating this outline for a novel and then cutting and pasting a few (very few) lines of dialogue into it and then sending it off and voila--it sells a million copies.

He owns a boutique in Beverly Hills and named it after his lovely daughter Julie. He has two adult children who he loves dearly and can have any of Hollywood's most beautiful women. After a failed marriage, and a brief, tragic affair years after, Jack has become a perfect bachelor. Amanda Robbins knew Jack only because her daughter married his son. She never went in his store. After her husband died she locked herself in her house for nearly a year until Jan, her youngest daughter, talked her into going to Jack Watson's store to a Christmas party.

Instead of helping, however, I believe this book may have actually hurt my score. Each practice test had numerous (at least 50% of the total) questions on specific and often obscure theorists. As I had never heard of many of them, I focused my study time on learning their individual theories and areas of research. Much to my surprise, the actual GRE was primarily conceptual, with questions on specific psychologists limited to important researchers that were extrememly influential within their areas of specialization.

I finally went to my University's library and took out 2 general psych textbooks to study in the two weeks left I have until the exam.

Mine is 3 years old and the pump has never burnt out, mostly because I'm careful about keeping the water level up, but I have also spent some time cleaning out the pump with dish soap and a tooth brush. I actually bought a special brush (like a small bottle cleaner) to clean the rest of the fountain - so it's not exactly low maintenance. Also, the filters only last about a month, not 3 months like the package says. Think about getting a bigger fountain if you have more than two cats or a dog, because they could drain the water level rather quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had two so far, both leaked!","review":"I got the first one of these waterers about 3 months ago.

In fact, I purchased one for my mother's pets. I'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year, the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick. The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often. I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price, especially if you have to replace them more often. Check out the filters here on Amazon, you'll see I'm not the only one dissatisfied. Because of this, I am switching over to the Drinkwell system. I've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you really take the time to clean it","review":"Own a couple of these cat fountains and they aren't worth it. It is affordable and very quiet, but that is the only thing going for it. The resevoir, as has already been stated in previous reviews, is a horror to clean. It gets filled with scum frequently and therefore needs to be cleaned often. The filters are a waste too. I would give it a NO STARS if allowed. Unless you are going to really thoroughly clean it every 2 or 3 days your cat is going to be drinking disgusting water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats love it.","review":"Overall, very happy with the product. It is really quiet...not at first, but give it a few minutes. The water disappears quickly and I'm not sure if it's because the air is so dry or the cats are drinking a lot of water, probably a combination of both.

For the price, the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump, it seems reasonable to me. I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow, is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it. Those are its pros, along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes). However, I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning, which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy the larger one!","review":"Petmate Medium Fountain is defective after a week of use because it constantly leaks and makes a big mess!

Decided to order a second one this summer and discovered the changes for the worse. Seems the new pump is more powerful and NOT adjustable. This results in serious water leakage. I've tried 3 times to purchase and exchange these leaky fountains without luck. They all leaked so badly that my floor was soaked repeatedly and the reservoir was emptied in 2-3 days. Unless the manufacturer makes changes 1. an adjustable pump, 2. extending the interior wall above the pump area to prevent overflow, I won't purchase another petmate fountain.

But, I have had it for a year or so, and now it is not working. The pump seems to be broken, because when I add water to the resevoir it stops flowing and sometimes days later it will suddenly turn back on. It is also difficult to clean in certain parts that are hard to access for scrubbing, but good at trapping orange mold. I also bought one for my neighbor a while back and her cats refused to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm very happy with this fountain.","review":"I've had a very good experience with this fountain. My long-haired cat got used to quickly and I've been impressed with how little maintenance it requires. It's also very, very quiet. It sits next to my bed and I don't even think about it. Only when the water level starts to bottom out in the bowl does the pump start to spout some air bubbles, but that can serve as a subtle reminder that it's time to refill.Though the resevoir is slightly small, I find I can easily go 4-5 days before needing to refill it. The bowl itself does not seem to collect a lot of crud. Or if it does, it's getting swept into the filter somehow.I purchased this and the Petmate Fresh Flow Ramp Feeder on the same night. The feeder is a great product as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kona doesn't like this fountain","review":"My Drinkwell motor froze after a few years, so I needed a new pet fountain. My cat, Kona, absolutely loves drinking from a fountain and drinks more fresh water than when he has just a bowl of water. I purchased a Petmate Fresh Flow thinking a pet fountain is a pet fountain; this is not the case. The water in this fountain does NOT free flow; it essentially glides along a plastic runway. My cat stopped drinking as much water and would anxiously wait for the water dripping from my bathtub. So, Kona wins, I am giving up on this fountain (which is only a few months old) and buying a fountain which won't give Kona the plastic after-taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor redesign for the old one","review":"We had a Pet Mate water system for the cat for over 10 years. The pump finally failed and a replacement is not available. It was quiet, this one is not. Not enough water feeds the bowl to keep the water level above the pump pickup and it gets loud. Adding water to the bowl quiets it some but not much. The pump flow is not adjustable as it was on the original unit, the pump heats the water that grows a nice slime in the bowl even with new filters. Compared to the 10 year old unit, I rate it poor on design and function."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cat enjoyed this but read on...","review":"My cat really dug his kitty fountain but my overall experience with this thing was kind of bad. Yes it recycles the water a bit and keeps it fresher than say a stagnant water filled bowl but it seemed to collect lots of crud and hair that never makes it through the tiny hole to the filter. The reserve tank was useless...the water level never went down when the water was circulating so it was a pretty big waste of water. Also, the thing makes terrible noise when not completely full (but the reserve tank never worked) so you have to dump water in it all the time or else listen to this loud grinding sound. After, 7 or 8 months the pump conked out completely and so I went and bought a Drinkwell for my boy today. The Drinkwell is superior in every way and kitty is happier with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"This unit was very disappointing in that the pump is inadequate to keep the water flowing and requires constant attention. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so quiet","review":"i want to give this a higher rating as it is reasonably priced and fulfills a niche that is necessary. my particular machine at least is not so \\"ultra quiet\\". i read the manual and tried their suggestions about how to make it less noisy. i think the noticeable noise is just part of the design. it is definitely noticeable when the living room gets quiet. i know they could have designed this to be truly \\"ultra quiet\\". too bad. i probably end up junking this machine when the annoyance of the machine grows to be too much. i bought it so cheap at $16.99, that it is not worth the hassle to package and ship it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"First 4 days were great!","review":"My cats were fascinated by this water bowl even though i thought it looked like a baby toilet (maybe that's why they liked it??) They played in it more than drank from it for the first few days and made a mess! But, eventually they began to trust it and drank from it. By the 4th day, the cat hair they dropped (I have two cats) was constantly clogging the water intake at the bottom of the dish. This meant that not only was the water not circulating correctly, the water level would get very low even though the \\"tank\\" in back was full. It would make loud sucking noises that scared my cats and actually were loud enough to wake me up at night! So, this product probably works great for hairless cats, but for the rest of them...it's a lot of maintenance for a water dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy at times, durability issues","review":"These are reasonably nice and quiet when they work right. However, it has been my experience that they eventually get noisy and that the durability is poor. I would not recommend these unless you plan on replacing it every few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn How To Repair the Pump and It'll last Forever","review":"My cats really, really love this water fountain. However, I'd purchased 2 of them previously and even though I cleaned them regularly, I had to throw them out because the pumps made horrible noises and then stopped working after a few months. I had a geriatric cat with renal failure who had to have a lot of fresh water so I bought a third one (ever optimistic). The same thing happened to fountain number three. This time I took the fountain apart and discovered that cat hair and other gook had clogged the pump opening which is why it made noises and stopped pumping. An expensive lesson - but a worthwhile one. My geriatric kitty died at the age of 21 and my new kitties are total fountain devotees.

Meaning that any debris, cat hair, dust, etc get jammed in the pump long before they could ever make it to the filter. Once the filter gets clogged (in 2-3 days for us), the flow comes to almost a complete stop, and the cats stop drinking.Stick to the CatIt or Drinkwell products.

The pump then makes a gurgling noise and the flow of water reduces to about a trickle. Since no water can get through the filter, the water becomes very dirty and undrinkable.

My cats love running water from the faucet. The water in this fountain is not running, though, but flows down a slope, so it's difficult for the cats to even see the water running. My cats didn't drink from the part where the water was running. I later bought a different flowing water pet fountain that runs more like a faucet, but we no longer use that one either because it is plastic and our vet recommended that cats should only eat and drink out of glass bowls, not plastic. Apparently the plastic containers can cause irritations. One of my cats had a swollen lip and the vet suspected the plastic water dish as the culprit. Too bad no one has made a glass flowing water fountain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with the fountain","review":"My cat rarely drinks from it and prefers the dog's bowl or meows by the sink until I turn the faucet on for him. My cat also is a messy eater and frequently drops both wet and dry food into the fresh flow which gets clogged into the filter. In addition, the filter needs to be cleaned frequently as it can harbor worms! I went to clean the fresh flow as I regularly do to find scores of wriggling black worms coming out of the filter! Unbelievable. I'm ready to find a better filter that doesn't attract parasites like the fresh flow or just get rid of it all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Mate Fresh Flow Fountain ( a must have for my cats)","review":"My cats love this fountain.

And I do love how they keep the water circulating and the kitties drinking. But the first one I had lasted two years before the motor wore out and possibly part of the housing broke. Fair enough - it's not that big a price to pay for the cat's health. The second lasted about a year and 2 months, the third, one year. At this point I thought about jumping ship to the other brand, but decided to give this one last go. The current one makes a racket. Despite careful dismantling and cleaning, it is destined for the trash pile. After two months. I ordered this one on 3/28/10. And after the repeated taking apart for cleaning, there's no way that the plastic housing will endure much longer even if the motor wasn't faulty, it's far more brittle than the original model. Utter doodoo. Skip it and go with the alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad design","review":"I was really excited about this product before I actually got it. Cats naturally prefer moving water (like drinking from the faucet) over still water (like their pristine water bowl you just filled). However, the design is seriously flawed. The water and filter chambers have little niches and indentations which are virtually impossible to clean without running the unit through the dishwasher (and who wants to do that daily?). A layer of slime builds up on the inside within a few days, reminiscent of algae in a pond (yum!) The filter compartment traps food and fur so it's not in the bowl, but all the remaining water gets pushed through the collected gunk, which means all the water tastes bad. Definitely not useful for leaving the cat by himself over the weekend, because he won't drink water that tastes bad, even if he is the one who got the food and fur in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than a water dish","review":"As the review title says, this product is literally no better than having a water dish. The reservoir is too small to last even one day in a multiple-cat household. Worse, it quickly stopped working properly, leaving the pump sucking air while the reservoir was still full. Even right out of the box, the fountain merely provided a trickle of water down the center slide, with no waterfall effect, which means the cats drink straight from the bowl, just as if you'd never spent extra for a motorized fountain in the first place.Stick with the DrinkWell. Or a water dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed!","review":"My cats and I loved this product when we first started using it. But now, 6 months later, it's functioning very poorly. It makes a lot of NOISE--it hisses and spits and gurgles constantly and I am unable to get it to stop. I've changed the filter a couple of times, but I only use already-filtered water in it, so there is no way that it can be clogged. Because I am unable to figure out what the problem is, I will most likely have to get rid of it because the noise is intolerable. Also, the little plastic knob that you turn to regulate the force of the waterflow is cheap and broke. The unit is a good idea and would be great if it worked, but this thing is not worth the money.

The body has been redesigned - the pieces are shaped and fit together differently. I'm not sure whether this design contributes to the problem, which is that this second Petmate fountain is very loud, and regardless of whether the reservoir is full, the water level in the bowl is not maintained at a level to keep the pump from \\"sputtering.\\" The previous fountain was virtually silent; this one can be heard from several rooms away. I have had the manufacturer replace the pump, with no improvement. We will not be purchasing another fountain from Petmate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not big enough for three cats","review":"This would probably be good for one, very dainty cat, and an owner who's home all the time. However, the instructions say not to leave it on when you're not around - and indeed, the reservoir is so small that it runs out of water in 1 to 2 hours anyway. I have three cats, all of who love to splash in the water so crud gets into the dish and just stays there until I clean it out. My old inverted-jug waterer is easier to clean and change the water, and doesn't have a carbon footprint except for when it was made. I'm going back to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petmate pet fountain","review":"I had one of these I bought when they first hit the market because I have a cat who loves to drink from faucets.

I can't figure out why and have tried every thing I can think of to get it to work. The first one worked fine, filling the bowl automatically as the water level went down. With this new one I have to do it manually. I make sure the bowl is filled to nearly overflowing every morning so that I don't have to worry about the water dropping so low that the pump doesn't have enough water to pump while I'm at work all day.

I would recommend changing the filter at least once every 8 weeks, and cleaning the whole fountain at the same time.

I threw in a treat and they haven't had a problem since. It works great because I have one kitty who when she drinks gets more water on her face then she actually ingests. Gone are the days of a wet wall behind a regular bowl. I also have my fountain on a small raised wooden platform so my cats do not have to bend down to drink.

I'll be honest, in that the actual requirements to disassemble it to clean it are a bit combersome. But it has a handy power disconnect option that helps to clean it. I wish it had a larger water reservoir. Depending on what type of pets, how many and the heat of where you live, you still have to refill it every other day. I find that you have to clean it about once every five to six days depending on how messy of eaters your pets are. I have to replace the filter about every 60 days.

Within a couple of hours, though, they are back at the sink drinking out of the faucet again. The reason is that the pump builds up slime in any crack or crevice and the pump is not strong enough to filter out any debris other than hair. The slime is difficult to remove, requiring daily cleaning, and there are parts of the pump that are almost inaccessible using ordinary cleaning methods. The tube leading from the pump up to the filter is so narrow at the lower end, the only thing I could find to get in there was a q-tip. It needs refilling, even with the attached resevoir full, within 24 hours. And to clean it it has to be totally disassembled. If you use bottled water in it, the slime builds up slower, but it still needs refilling every 24 hours. Overall, it takes too much maintenance for my time schedule."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Zero Star Rating for truly worthless products?","review":"I have to say, I thought I was just unlucky.

There are no rubber seals or springs to help prevent this.It runs very quietly at first until the filter starts to get clogged with cat hair or saliva, rinsing provides some short time relief but it can be a good indicator that it is time to change it.

I found an easy solution I thought I would share. I inserted a 1\\" diameter clear tube, 6\\" in length into the exit hole. I trimmed the height of the tube slightly so that it would fit snug into the opening and wa la, instant waterfall.

My three cats love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst we've owned","review":"We previously had a Drinkwell and it lasted for years until something large and heavy accidentally got dropped onto it, and the plastic cracked. This looked like it would be a better design, but the motor hummed randomly from the very first day- even when completely full to the brim. The water in the dish was disgusting after a very short period of time, as the pump is to weak to actually filter anything, and then it just stopped working entirely after only 2 months. We're going back to the Drinkwell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"This is a great pet fountain, super quite, you can't hear it at all and the cat loves it.

This unit is also very quiet. There is some light maintenance,but well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Appeal to my Cat","review":"While many cats like drinking from the tub/sink faucet, this product does NOT mimic that experience very well at all. I wouldn't expect every cat to like this fountain when the water moves so smoothly and somewhat uninterestingly down the ramp. I thought the water moving would attract my cat but it is pretty hard to see the water at all. My cat was interested for 10 minutes and was done with it for good. The fountain is quiet, and yes, you have to clean it and monitor it so the pump doesn't burn out. Overall it was more trouble than it was worth. Not recommended. I would try the fountains that bubble or have the water free-falling down from the spout. At least it would attract my cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat loves it","review":"My cat is very timid, so it took her about a week to decided it was ok to drink from it, but now she loves it - she drinks a lot more water than she used to. An added benefit is that she rarely has any hairballs/vomiting since we got it. She used to vomit at least a couple of times a week, but now, maybe once a month.I thought at first that it was pretty loud, but I realized that it might be because it's sitting on a tile floor so the vibrations from the motor were noisy. I put a thick washcloth under it and most of the noise went away.We love it and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent product for the price","review":"The biggest gripe I have with the fountain is that it is noisy sometimes for no apparent reason. For the best results clean the fountain regularly and you probably will have a long and uneventful experiance.

I reccomend if you purchase this to make sure yours does not leak on any delecate surfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last long at all!","review":"I bought this fountain because my cat loves drinking running water and for the first couple of months I loved it. It would have to be refilled constantly but I didn't mind because my cat was deliriously happy with it.Then the leaking started. Just a small dribble out the side so I cleaned it (which I did every week anyway) to no avail. The leak kept worse and worse and made my kitchen floor a mess. I had only had it four months and was pissed!My story is by no means the only one. My friend had the same thing happen to her after about 6 months. Just don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I purchased this item and from the beginning I could not prevent it from leaking all over my hardwood floor. Even though I clean the filter often and adjusted the pump per other peoples suggestions, it still seems to leak around the back of the unit. The only way to use it is to apply tape on the back to seal up where the water container sits on top of the housing for the pump. I would not recommend this unit. I ended up throwing mine away and went back to the bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Drinkwell Fountain instead","review":"Pet fountains are a great way to keep my cat from trying to drink out of the faucets. I bought the Fresh Flow a few years ago and thought it was great, but the plastic it is made of is not the best quality and the filter clogs up constantly. I finally threw the Fresh Flow out today after several successful months with the Drinkwell Pet Fountain. The Drinkwell Pet Fountain is definitely a better quality product and hasn't clogged up once! The Drinkwell Pet Fountain also holds more water (even without the extra resevior) than the Petmate Fresh Flow. If I could go back in time, I would have paid the extra $10 for the Drinkwell instead of paying for both in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats like it, but it's NOT EASY TO CLEAN","review":"I didn't think there'd be another fountain as difficult to clean as a Drinkwell. This one is (the right hand upper section must be removed, and it's a bear to get off and on because it fits so tightly).Also - and this is not a criticism, because I misjudged capacity - but the medium size is not meant for a house with more than two cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"kitties like it, but they don't do the cleaning","review":"We have one of these and one Drinkwell, and the kitties seem equally happy with either one. The Petmate is a bit quieter, but is even more difficult to clean, which needs to be done more often than I'd like. Neither one is a day at the beach to clean, but the Petmate has even more little nooks and crannies and narrow little spots that are almost impossible to get the gunk out of. And as soon as you're done and fill it with fresh water, it starts getting icky again before you know it. Since there's no obvious useful purpose for all the little hard to reach spots, I can only conclude that whoever designed these things likes cats OK, but hates their owners."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disappointment","review":"I thought I was doing the right thing by my cats when I brought this Petmate water fountain home. Wrong. Right from the start, the pump has sounded like a small jet aircraft at take off. I've done it all -- dismantle and reassemble the pump, dismantle and reassemble the entire unit, drain and refill with cool clear distilled water. No. It is too loud to use near human habitation, and it is too loud for the cats to bother approaching it for a drink. And as someone observed here, it fills with junk and clogs in a heartbeat. Nope. I am resigned to leaving a faucet dripping and a bathroom door ajar around the clock to make sure our two cats get enough fresh water. This product has been a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take note of this review before buying","review":"I bought 2 of these things within a 3 1/2 year period. The theory behind what it is supposed to do is different from what it actually does. The problem is the water needs to be filtered before it reaches the electric pump, not after. As your pet drinks, saliva from your pet will cake up around the water intake of the pump. After a couple weeks, the intake gets clogged up with a thick brown mucus and the pump begins to overwork itself trying to suck up water to push through the filter on the other side. If you don’t stay on top of cleaning it by rinsing the pump with hot water, which is an involved and messy process of taking the whole Petmate apart, the pump will burn itself out after a short period and then you have to go out and buy a whole new Petmate.It’s not a wonder they’re only guaranteed for a year because each one I bought lasted about a year and two to four months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats Love it","review":"I have had two more of these fountains and they are great.So much better than the Cats sitting in the sink and waiting by the faucet looking for running water or drips.Little to no problems with the fountains over 2 years.No leaks, drips or puddles on the floorI had one power supply die after 2 years of continuous use but even with that problem I highly recommend the product.A side benefit is it very intriguing and a constant source of interest for my 2 Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good item","review":"This item is too noisy and hard to keep clean(a film builds up on it).

The reservior stopped adding water and it has to be filled twice daily with a water glass to stop the noise, even though the reservior is full.

The unit makes enough noise to be distracting in a quiet room (not a \\"fountain\\" noise, but rather a \\"motor\\" noise.) We used a large pyrex measuring cup to fill the fountain . . . the cat was more interested in drinking the remaining water out of the pyrex cup afterwards. Clever idea, but I'd recommend against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"We first bought this fountain for price and boy do you get what you pay for! We had actually been through 2 of these, because the first one didnt work properly, well the 2nd one didnt either. The flow is weak and gives out after a day or two and it needs to be constantly cleaned. I was really really disappointed with this fountain. We have since upgraded to the Drinkwell and I mean the difference was night and day. The drinkwell is a little bit more expensive, but it is worth it. Do your pet a favor and get the Drinkwell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet, works great","review":"We've had this product for several years for our three cats. It needs occasional cleaning -- at first I couldn't figure out why the pump quit, then I realized I needed to pull a glob of cat hair off the pump during cleaning-- but aside from that, it has had no problems at all. The cats drink from it and it means we do not have to refill the water all the time.Two possible improvements on some future model-- a filter before the water gets to the pump (to remove hair), and a model with a significantly larger reservoir of water. (We'd love to let this go when we go on vacation for a week, but there's no way the water'd last that long. Wish I could somehow connect it to a 5-gallon jug of clean water!)Overall, a great product that has worked for a long time.

I bought this for my kittens, because they love to gather together at feeding time so I thought they'd enjoy having room to drink at the same time. The main problem with this is that sediment gathers at the bottom of the well very easily and the filter isn't strong enough to get it out. So basically every day you have to unplug it, drag the power cord to the nearest sink, and get the whole thing in the sink to rinse it out without spilling water all over the place. I was unhappy with this product and I really couldn't see myself going through all that hassle every day to rinse out the well, so I returned the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET THE DELUXE MODEL","review":"I had the deluxe model, and thought it wasn't working correctly, and I ordered this model, which did not work water gurgled out the sides.

This product is made for pets, you would think that they would put a filter of some kind infront of the pump to prevent it from being clogged with fur. well they didnt. my pump would clog with fur at least once per week. i had this product for 3 months when the pump stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Good for a few weeks. Now it starts to make loud girdling noises. Now the water seems to SLOWLY leak.

I put enough water in this thing but I really do not know why the machine is not pump smoothly and powerfully even at max setting. Waste of money.UPDATE: Actually you need to clean the INSIDE of the product to remove the cat hair that gets stuck on the pump. When you remove the hair it works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY sorry!","review":"Before purchasing this Freshflow Fountain I 'watered' my dogs via a stainless-steel bowl in a raised feeeding-station.

When I'm out of filters (bought three packages w/fountain) I shall go BACK to previous arrangement!This thing is AWFUL to clean; there are numerous crevices & corners that my long/narrow brush cannot reach & believe me, it needs cleaning at least twice weekly. I have two Yorkies & a Golden, so it gets well-used but even so, it's extremely labor-intensive. The fountain is just TOO much work to give them a clean, sanitary container from which to drink. It is is VERY heavy when the water-level is as it needs to be; lifting it to the sink is very hard on one's back, especially for those of us who are seniors, as am I.The ads for this are VERY misleading, 'easy to clean'?

Due to constant water being inside the bowl, mold starts forming inbetween the creases of plastic. We cleaned and changed the water regularly, but there was no avoiding the mold. Soon after, we noticed that the water was barely trickling out of the top. We had to take the entire thing apart & clean out the pump due it being clogged with fur. It worked well after that, but the mold kept forming and it was in places where you couldn't clean well. I used a toothbrush and hot hot water to no avail.

My cats love the ramp on this one and would not like the other brand that does not have it.The fountain can be a pain to clean, but it doesn't have to be done everyday.

I took it apart, cleaned it and it appeared to be okay. I never did figure out why it was leaking or from where. Tonight after being gone all day, I came home to find a big puddle of water on the floor. Again I can't see why it's leaking or where it's coming from.

However, the hubby and I decided to keep it hoping he'd get more adjusted to it, and he eventually did. But there were other problems: after religiously cleaning the fountain every three days it still grew mildew on the inside within four months. I wrote to Petmate for a solution (figuring this was a defect) and the company never bothered to reply. I wound up with a product I can't use and a bunch of filters for it.

Over time, the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets' fur and food, which causes the motor to break down, even with regular cleaning. I found no way to purchase a replacement motor, so I was really bummed (as were my cats!).I ended up purchasing a new fountain, but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food, fur, and other particles from getting into the motor and its' reservoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fountain, but it is NOT the \\"deluxe\\" model.","review":"I recieved this fountain in the mail approximately 2 weeks, ago, so I will enter a new review later if my opinion changes...That said, this is a great fountain so far. Fairly easy to assemble, extremely quiet (almost silent), and very easy to refill...you can leave it running, remove the water container, refill and replace without having to turn the unit off.That said, it is not the petmate \\"deluxe\\" model..no in-line power switch, no flow adjustment valve... so, don't buy this if you are looking for those features.Only time will tell if the pump continues to work as silently and as quietly as it has so far, but as of now, this is a good purchase for the money...given the mistake in labeling it as \\"deluxe\\". It is still at least $10.00 cheaper than the same model at my local pet chain store."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Pump too powerful for product","review":"We bought this new Petmate Fresh Flow to replace an existing unit that had served us well for several years but which was becoming difficult to clean. Unfortunately the pump on the new product for some reason no longer has adjustable flow although the flow control lever is still there but intentionally frozen in the maximum position. This results in a very noisy product with water overflowing the internal filter reservoir continually. We installed the pump for our old unit and all is well but this new product appears to have a significant flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequent Pump Problems","review":"I purchased this product 1 year ago and immediately my cat loved it. The first pump went out after about 6 months so I bought a replacement pump, the replacement pump was fine except that it was more powerful so the water gurgled out of the top seam causing puddling on the floor. After about a month the pumps efficiency diminished enough that it did not puddle anymore. That pump lasted about 5 months so I put in another replacement pump. I am currently dealing with the same situation of the over zealous pump causing leaking and puddling.The unit is easy to fill and easy to clean but I am currenly online searching for a different brand. As much as my cat loves his water dish I can't deal with the leaking. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good.","review":"I like this water fountain. It only gets loud when the water level gets low, so you fill it up and its quiet again. It's nice because it reminds you to fill it up. My cats love it and it has stayed clean. Its pretty easy to put together too. I would buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it didn't leak","review":"The cats like the fountain, but it leaks unless the water level is very low. Since many people don't have this problem I suspect that it depends on how tight the joints between the various parts are. Sealing the joints won't work because the device needs to be taken apart for cleaning.If you get one, be prepared to send it back if it leaks.Edit: While the bottom of the fountain appears to be cast as a single piece, there is a small square plate on the bottom of the unit where the pump fits. Over time the glue loosens and this leaks where it is attached. This can be fixed by a bit of epoxy around the seam."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I spent a long time at Petco comparing this fountain with the Drinkwell. I could see no difference except the price, so I bought the Fresh Flow Deluxe, which was half the price. Three weeks later the Fresh Flow Deluxe has quit working. I changed the filter and checked the pump, but I can't get the thing to work. On the other hand, my friends are still using the Drinkwell they bought several years ago.Oh, and by the way, where it says that the Fresh Flow Deluxe is \\"ultra quiet\\"? That isn't true either.I'm going to buy a Drinkwell and toss the Fresh Flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well if you keep it clean","review":"The title says it all. If you clean this regularly, it will work just fine for you. I found out the hard way what happens if you go a couple of weeks without cleaning it. Gunk clogged the pump and while it does still work, it doesn't pump nearly as much water as it used to. Oh well, both of my dogs and my cat still love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow Pet Fountain","review":"I owned this product prior to ordering a new one as the pump shot craps on the old one. The old one I had worked great. The new one that I just got is very noisy. In fact we had to put it in a room downstairs so that it wouldn't keep us up at night. It seems to make a loud buzzing sound that is very irritating and distracting. Taking off the top part of the waterer to clean it is also very difficult with this new one. The old one was a cinch to clean. With this new one I have to pry the parts apart with a knife in order to disassemble it for cleaning. I don't know what happened in the manufacturing process but the new one is certainly not as good as the former product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for nothing!!","review":"This was great for a month.Then the pump gears started to grind.It continued to work but it was extremly loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pet Fountain Ever!","review":"I bought this because my last Petmate Fountain lasted over 3 years and my cats loved it. My cat used to wake me up to turn on the faucet because he liked drinking dripping water so I bought the Fountain and it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good water bowl for multiple pets","review":"This is a good product if you have multiple pets. We had the smaller one (next size down) and it ran out very often with our 2 small-breed dogs and 2 cats. THis bowl only needs to be refilled about every other day, even with all 4 of them drinking from it, so it's a much better solution. Now if I could only keep the toddler from trying to use it as a pool..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Fresh Flow Fountains But..............","review":"I have 3 cats who refuse to drink water from a regular bowl. The 1st fountain I purchased for them was a Fresh Flow and they loved it. I wanted a 2nd fountain and since they also like drinking water from a running tap, I thought I would try the Drinkwell, which has a larger water capacity. They definitely prefer the Fresh Flow. When my Fresh Flow began to make noise after 1 1/2 yrs, I purchased this new Fresh Flow Fountain in the larger size. Although it is silent when you 1st turn it on, after a short while, it begins to make a very annoying noise. I think this particular fountain must be defective, because I have since bought another Fresh Flow (but again in the smaller size) and it is totally silent. My cats definitely like the Fresh Flow almost to the exclusion of the Drinkwell, but this large size one is just too noisy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea with a weak and flawed pump","review":"I've now had this fountain for a little over 2 months and the pump is starting to fail.As is, if I unplug it, to start it again I need to open up the pump and push the impeller to get it spinning. Without the initial push to get it running, it simply doesn't start.Also, do not think that this fountain will replace your water dish or be less of a hassle. In fact, this will require a tremendous amount of effort to keep running.Daily Maintenance:Clean out cat/dog hair from the mesh.Fill up.Every Other day:Clean the inside filter.Weekly:Take completely apart, wash out all gunk, hair, dirt etc.Open the pump, push the impeller to get it started.Oh and both the cats and dogs seem to prefer the old large water dish as opposed to the fountain, which they also use, but not nearly as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats Love It","review":"This is a great water dish. It's easy to refill and the cats love the flowing water. The kitten likes to play with it. The only thing I do not like is that the cat hair that gets in the dish is not as easy to clean since you have to lift the entire thing up and dump the water in the sink (and clean it out) once in a while. Other than that slight inconvenience, it's great because the water lasts a long time (large tank) and the cats really love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cat fountain","review":"I would recommend this fountain to anyone. It is easy to clean and I have not had an issue with the pump or noise or leaking. It was a reasonable price and the cats,Sweetie,April, and Sam all approve. I do think that next time I will get a larger one but in the meantime this one is just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this item","review":"It started leaking out the top almost immediately. No way to solve water getting all over the floor. They need to recall this item and give everyone their money back. The water hits the filter and splashes out the back. It needs a water tight rubber gasket and some way to clamp down the top for it to ever work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor mechanical design","review":"The first one I bought did not work when I brought it home from the store. As much as I was concerned about potential quality control, I gave it another shot.My cats absolutely loved this when it worked. However, that was for under two months.Now, if you don't treat this well, it makes sense it might wear out. If the water runs low, the motor can easily burn out, as it is meant to be submerged at all times when operating.However, ours was always kept full, since we change the water each day. We did unplug it frequently, since the plug was used my another appliance at times, but I was very disappointed at how quickly it died considering the price I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petmate water fountain is a very good item","review":"This Petmate medium size water fountain has turned out to be a very good item compared to the last Petmate medium one that I had bought several years ago. This has a slightly more powerful water pump compared to my last one. The water filters with the fountain is the only thing that slows the water flow down too much after a few days of running. Their filters are quite thick in substance for the water to flow through. I have found that the small Whisper brand of water filters for the fish tanks work real well with this water fountain versus using Petmates filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cats won't drink out of a bowl anymore!","review":"EDIT: I liked it. My cats liked it. But the d@mn thing started leaking after only a month. Slow and gradual, but there was definitely a puddle on our wood floors every day that no towel could keep in check. It was thrown out. My kitties were upset. As was I...what a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat now drinks fresh water; no longer toliet water!","review":"The quiet stream of constant flowing water makes my cat drink more water now than previously, when I used just an open water dish. The unit is very quiet, easy to set up and maintain and cleaning is a breeze. Best of all is I noticed immediately that my cat is drinking more water each day. This unit is a great asset to my home; it works as advertized. Well worth the money for peace of mind, knowing my loving cat is getting fresh water everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"My cat was constantly begging at the faucet for running water- she would just sit in the sink waiting for the water to be turned on. This got old rather quickly and I found this product. She must like the constantly running water because she has stopped begging at the sink. I find that it is quiet and does not need to be refilled often. Once a week I clean it completely and refill it. Cleaning can be a bit of a hassle, but it's not too bad. The parts separate easily and with a toothbrush or q tip you can reach all of the crevices. I usually fill the reservoirs with brita water and skip out on the filtration cartridges to save money. I have had this product for 2 years and it still works great. I definitely recommend it for your thirsty kitty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted one year.","review":"The pump completely died on me after one year of use. I wish there was a better pump as these type of devices are clearly healthier than a standing water bowl, but without an effective pump they become useless.Someone also ought to make a better design such that water doesn't slosh all over the floor when moving or picking the unit up. As I have to frequently clean the entire unit (due to the weak pump!) this is a major issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petmate Fresh Flow Cat Fountain - 50 oz. capacity","review":"Have tried several other models and makes, but this model is the best, most reliable drinking fountain I have ever used and am still using. Easy to keep clean and the cat loves it. Only one cat is using the fountain, and I set it at about half speed, which seems to work well for me.I highly recommend this model and make to any one who wants the best for their feline.. The price is well placed and the filters are also rather inexpensive compared to other models"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky.....Loud.....","review":"I thought this would be a good choice for my dog since I figured he deserved the best. After reading the reviews it seemed this was a pretty solid choice. The whole concept of it, was everything I was looking for. However, I noticed a couple days after setting it up, that it leaks like crazy (usually leaves a stream on my floor) and its loud. Like really loud. I'm kinda dissapointed. Ive been thinking about just exchanging it, maybe this one is malfuction, but so far not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"dirty and noisy...","review":"My cat loves to drink from this fountain and uses it more than she would a regular bowl. I introduced it to her at 3 years old after using a bowl her whole life and it took a while for her to get use to, but she loves it now. The fountain worked great for a while....but after a couple of weeks it started becoming very noisy. This fountain is very picky. If any little thing is bothering it, it makes a tremendous amount of sound and it is a pain to figure out what exactly is bothering it. So this kind of defeats the purpose of it being a self-cleaning fountain. It also does not recycle the water very well. The water still gets very dirty and I see pieces all the time that don't go through the filter. I think the filter is actually cleaner than the actual water my cat drinks from when I go to change the filter every month. I wouldn't really recommend this product...After having it for about 3 months I need something more efficient..."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't do it","review":"I had this for less than three days. The first day it was great. I wish it gurgled more for the cat but it was fine. The last day I noticed that it seemed to be going through water quickly for one cat. Then I noticed the throw rug was saturated. Then i noticed the discoloration of the hardwood floors. Then i noticed the wet spot in the basement. I checked to see if the water container was screwed on correctly. Then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter. Within an hour the towel was saturated. Luckily I bought it at Walmart. Back it went but instead of putting it aside so that some other poor peeson would not be sold this piece of crap. They put it aside to be reshelved. I wish I could give this 0 stars.If this fails on you it could do major damage before you discover it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaning nightmare","review":"We purchased two (medium and large) for our 3 cats and small dog. I spend 30-45 minutes every weekend thoroughly cleaning the fountains. If you buy this product, plan on arming yourself with a small brush, Q-tips, and yes, even toothpicks to get into the small crevices to remove build-up gunk. Looks nice but poorly designed. I didn't realize how much cleaning the pump needed, even on the inside, and burned up the first pump within two weeks. I would not buy this product again. The only two good things I can say about it: they look nice and as soon as I clean them and put them down, the cats come running for fresh water."},{"rating":"1","title":"We were fooled!","review":"Fooled into thinking this is the best product around.the product was intentionally designed with a flaw to destroy the moter and force one to buy a new one. (why else would the company sell the motors and offer them as soon as the item was produced). Any intelligent engineer would have designed the product to have the filter BEFORE the motor, insuring the motor stays clean as well as the output water. we have to clean out the moter every 6-8 weeks so that it doesn't burn out from being clogged from dust and cat hair. I hope they redesign it and when they do, I will then write another review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable pump, grows slime","review":"When this fountain is freshly cleaned, the cats love it. The water does stay cool. But cat hair -- lots of THAT around here -- clogs the pump, and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly, it grows slime. Eeeeuuuw. The first pump lasted about three months, then the replacement lasted about a month. Not really worth it, because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Hated It","review":"It's not the prettiest product--kind of looks like a toilet, and I think the sound of the motor was what put our cat off. The cat, who usually steals our water in whatever form or location, won't go near this fountain when it's on. For your reference, we also have a Siamese, which can be a picky breed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Clean, Gets Messy Easily","review":"I've had this unit for over a year and while I like it better than a plain bowl of water, there are some flaws.The blue reservoir is growing algae in the corners and because of its shape, it's impossible to clean those spots. I also have hard water in my apartment, so the slide gets a lot of hardwater build up which doesn't come off with scrubbing. Finally, the thing is always getting clogged up with cat hair and weekly cleanings are necessary if you don't want your cat drinking gross hairy water.I will likely purchase the type of fountain that comes down like a faucet whenever this one breaks but I won't buy this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I also called the company and they said they could not help me except to offer advice on filling and cleaning. I have been filling and cleaning the unit the same way for 18 months and all of a sudden it started to leak. The woman said that many units were sent back because of leaks and they couldn't get them to leak. Seems like there are a lot of us out there that CAN get them to leak.We can't all be wrong. I told the woman there are a lot of comments on amazon about the leaking units. My cats love the filter and I want to use it because my cat once had a UTI before I started using it. I just don't want to buy another one after only a year and a half. You would expect it to last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective one after the other","review":"My original lasted several years before it started leaking. I replaced it, and was dismayed that the new one began leaking about a week later. I replaced that one - thanks Amazon - and the new new one started leaking within 3 days.I'm not sure what is wrong with these, but the water appears to be seeping out of the bottom. Nothing has changed on my side.I'm going to have to return this one as well, and now change brands. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for continuous clean water","review":"Great product for continuous clean water and convenient for multiple pets. The water has multiple (3) settings for water circulation. The product allows your pets access to clean, cold water at their convenience.

Small particles clean with the water circulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cat doesn't like this...","review":"I bought this about a year ago and our cat was never fond of it. If the water level goes down too much the motor gets loud which also scares the cat. I think it's because the water slides down the plastic slide, it doesn't pour like a true fountain.

We have two cats, and they both loved it. The fountain worked silently, and holds a large amount of water in a reserve tank that is removable for easy refilling. Unfortunately, after about three weeks, the device began making noise. It now sounds like many of the small desktop fountains people will buy for home to generate white noise from the water running over rocks. Luckily, this is not a particularly annoying noise, but it is enough noise to keep me from giving the fountain a better score. So be advised: the product works well, if you don't mind some extra white noise in your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed","review":"Fairly easy to put together.

It is nearly silent- and my cat loves it- he drinks more water than he ever used to. He never drank out of the bowl anyway- he would jump in the sink to drink tap water- this makes him nearly as happy- and he can play in it a little... I highly recommend it.

When it arrived you can tell that it was NOT new. The outside box that holds the books was all nicked up and weathered. Plus the books were definitely read and put back in the case.

These books have no real biblical or theological substance or foundation.

But then I went to college where I studied the Bible, and now I am in seminary studying theology and the Bible - and I realize how silly and misleading these books are. Sure go ahead and read them if you can accept them for what they are: fiction. But please don't take these books as biblical truth.

She uses this mug a lot. It doesn't leak. I have an old Nissan mug. The design of this mug is more attractive than the Nissan mug."},{"rating":"2","title":"great design. no leak problem so far","review":"I have read many reviewers complaining issues about this product, but mine has none at all so far. The lid takes some time to get used to it, as the angle might be awkward to screw the lid tight, at the right position (depending on whether you're right-hander or left-hander), but once it's all set, it does not leak, at least so far, and get the job done nicely. One drawback, if you want to call it, is the design of the drinking/sipping outlet. It's very small, the liquid comes out slowly. If you want to gulp down hot coffee certainly you need to remove the lid. But I think it's more of a safety design, to prevent liquid from leaking over your mouth, and from leaking due to constant rumbling on the car.Overall, this is a good travel mug if you can grab it at deep discount price (I got one at around $4). Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"The worst part of this mug to me is the fact that the hole in the lid, from which you drink, can't be closed. It's just a hole in the top that cannot be adjusted or closed. This is a particular concern to me because I don't want my coffee to loose heat or, worse, spill while driving. The materials used arn't bad, but the construction and design is. The handle seems loose or flemsy. I bought this mug because it was being sold for four dollars with a regular price of twenty-five. It is absolutely absurd to suggest that this mug is anywhere close to being worth 25! Honestly, I probably wouldn't pay four if I had it to do over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, flawed execution.","review":"I anxiously awaited this mug, which was backordered for about 2 months after I ordered it. It fits in my car's cupholder, which was my primary reason for ordering it, and it is stainless steel, which resists stains and odors much better than my plastic coffee mugs. However, the handle attachment is weak, and looks like it would be impossible to repair (though I did not test this). Worse, however, was the top, which leaked coffee all over me every time I drank from it. It didn't matter how tight it was. This was surprising because they designed it with an o-ring in the lid that should have prevented any leakage.I've returned it and am looking for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Mug!","review":"This is the worst coffee mug I have ever used. The lid does not fit properly and the coffee leaks all over you. The handle was so poorly conceived and cheaply attached that it came off the very first day I used it. Stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish Travel Mug, functionality is bad","review":"Brought two of them. Like the design very much, however it does not work well at all. It is hard to drink your coffe/tea with the cap on. Anyway Bodum design is nice but this is the worst product I ever brought from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle issues make this not worth buying","review":"This is a nice looking mug judging from the photo, and I ordered two at just over $4 each. On receipt I discovered that the handle is not well secured at the bottom. The part of the handle that wraps around the mug is a loose fit and is not tightly molded or glued. The effect is flimsy. In fact, my mugs look like a cheap knock-off of a \\"real\\" mug.My advice is: don't buy this, especially at the current price of over $17. Get the version with a grip (not a handle) selling for a bit over $4. I bought 2 of these as well, and at $4 and change each, they're a great deal, in fact I just ordered another 2.I'm going to keep my mugs, but only because I bought them with a gift certificate, and Amazon gives no refunds or exchanges on gift certs. Being a bit of a DIY-er I'm going to try to glue the handles at the bottom with marine-grade epoxy. I'm not sure that will stand up to the dish washer, but it's worth a shot..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"This item is cheaply designed and built. The handle is loosley attached and the top leaks. The five dollar walmart special communter mugs are much better built. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No vacuum in my mug, bad handles too","review":"Purchased two of these mugs. The handles are weak and flimsy: you have to be careful not to hold on to the handle when removing the lid. I'm afraid they will break off with any force.But the worst part is that one of the mugs has NO vacuum! It's obvious because, when you pour hot coffee in, the outside of the mug heats up quickly on ONE of the mugs, while the other mug stays cool. The main reason I bought this mug was for the vacuum: a vacuum mug keeps your beverage hot/cold about 10 times longer than a mug with no vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you 2 bitching about??","review":"So far I've read two differant reviews on this cd by customers. Are they listening to the same CD i am? This CD is one of the best cd's the band has released to date. Drinkin' a bad song? It sounds good to me. I enjoyed the cool guitar riff that intros the song. Talkin' bout a revolution has a great reggae beat-feel to it. It's top to bottom an awesome cd. I got it right after school today and haven't stopped listening to it.If you like Reel Big Fish you'll love the cd. Even if you don't you should find some enjoyment out of it. It jumps around in it's musical style, but never deviates too far, and keeps the listener excited about the next song.

The choruses are not good ol' sing-along RBF we used to get, they're just..boring! The production also leaves nothing to be desired.I just gotta say, Im glad I downloaded this album because I would be dissapointed to spend money on this.

Aside from the first track, this album can easily be thrown away with the trash.For a decent modern ska act, check out Streetlight Manifesto.As for Reel Big Fish, well, this album should bury them into the ground.If \\"they're not happy until I am\\" - here's a quick remedy.

From the moment I read the liner notes I realized that the line up has changed and something wasn't right....then the cd started playing and it was all down hill from there.

For this topic of affirmations, I would have chanted the otherside of this coin by saying, \\"I am pro-active. I take action.\\" and so forth. Maybe this works for some cultures but in American language there are so many other words to choose from that bring visions of positive thought rather than struggling thoughts.

It has great riffs, singing vocals, and the best solo ever, followed by the solos in welcome to the fold by filter and over the mountains by Ozzy. Darts, has great fills and rokcing riffs similar to that of Shimmy, from toxixity. Sugar, is another good song, more melodic than any other song.

I listened to my brother's copy of the album and decided I have to have my own copy. I listen to it on a rotational basis inbetween Nine Inch Nails, KoRn, and Beck, and it's a really well done album. I like the lead singer's voice, too. The best tracks are Suite-Pee, Sugar, and Spiders, although my personal favorite, Marmalade, is not on the US release (it's on the Japanese release). You'll like them if you like Rage Against the Machine, NIN, or any group with a political statement or if you just like singers with cool voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast, energetic, meaningful","review":"System of A Down is one of the most understood bands I listen too.

THEY SUCK.THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD OUR MILITARY SUCKS AND THE US SUCKS.COME ON.THIS IS THE BEST DAMN PLACE IN THE WORLD AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR SORRY MUSIC.TWO THUMBS DOWN.YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BAND."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than Fried Goat Testicles","review":"It is far from dimensional, and has no insight with the lyrics. Sure, there are worse albums out there. And sure, I would take it any day over the Fagstreet boys. But this is a good example of why Nu Metal is not music, much less metal. The guitars harp on the same beats and the singer seems to be trying to emulate the same song, \\"Sugar,\\" in every song thereafter. Unless you wish to be part of the non-conforming, conformists, do not buy this. So often these Nu Metal hypocrites sing about something as \\"stupid,\\" yet do the same thing in their music by finding a trend or faction to be a part of. What happened to the solos?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a voice...","review":"I like the rhythm of their songs...heavy guitars...slamming drums...all except one....THE VOICE...oh please...the singer ruins everything. He needs to be more melodic, like Lajon Whiterspoon of Sevendust. Yes, the music's cool...but the singer needs more practice..."},{"rating":"1","title":"soad is not metal","review":"It really makes me sick when people refer to system as metal(heavy,death,black, etc.) This band is in no way metal. All this bands songs are just random words with crappy guitar riffs and talentless drumming. Serj cannot sing in key or scream for his life(for really good harsh vocals see: opeth, dimmu borgir, emperor, dark tranquillity, etc.).I'd also like to say that bashing power chords randomly as fast as you can does not imply that the music you're making is heavy(slipknot is the biiggest committer of this crime). bands like this and slipknot and linkin park are to music what AIDS is to humans. the nu-metal genre is an insult to metal and an atrocity that should never have been committed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I listen to RATM, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and I still hate SOAD","review":"I didn't actually buy the cd. I also never listened to any other song other than Sugar from it. But if that song was one of the better songs on the album and they made it into a single then whole thing has to be just as bad. When I first heard Sugar I fell out of my chair laughing at how bad it was. You people who gave this album a 4 1/2 star average can't be serious and if you are that's really pretty sad. Please don't encourage this horrible band to make another album. I really couldn't stand that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album EVER! High-school drivel.","review":"This release has to be the single worst album in the history of music by the single worst band. No band has ever come even close this kind of atrocity.Not a single band member is at all talented at his respective instrument, and the songwriting is even more pathetic. They toggle between a few simple power chords at all times and the vocalist, who sounds reminiscent of a goat with laryngitis, shouts out-of-key rants in a horribly simplistic rythem. As for the lyrics, they certainly are nothing to rave about. You can get the jist of the intent, but the delivery falls short of what would be expected from a remedial-level high-shool teacher. If you want senseless teen angst, then by all means buy this garbage, but if you want quality music, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This Garbage","review":"My friend and I have similar tastes in music (Staind, Static-X, Godsmack, etc.), so I was pretty happy when he reccommended this alum to me. To be frank, I couldn't even listen to the entire album--This isn't music; it's noise...Aggravating, disturbing, and infuriating noise...Stay away from this garbage. I gave it one star only bacaue I can't give it a zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOAD R THE BEST","review":"System of a Down are the best band around. Undoubtedly! (is that how thats spelt?) I've owned their album for around 6 months now and fell in love with it straight away. It has so much energy in the music and certain tracks are perfect for different moods. If you're feeling energetic \\"Sugar\\" or \\"Ddevil\\" will be perfect for you. For the chilling out times \\"Spiders\\", \\"Suggestions\\" or \\"Mind\\" are the mellow but not too boring tracks to listen to. I just can't wait until their new album arrives. SOAD are fantastic and I strongly advise buying this album if you like metal music. And if you ask me Serj is probably the best singer there has been for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Songs Usually Aren't A Bands Best!","review":"Overall System Of A Down's self titled album is pretty much a failure, this album has the bands worst songs (which is strange because bands usually go downhill not uphill!) I am only giving this album two stars because there is some good sounding stuff when they are not scream (which is most of the album) as well as on the radio songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the stuff before you rate it please","review":"Hey I just want to say when I hear a song that I like a little I usually download some mp3s from the band. I heard \\"Sugar\\" on the radio and I thought it had an interesting sound to it. It was like really heavy punk rock. I decided to get a couple songs off the internet. Sugar is not even in the top half of the songs on the album and in my opinion neither is Spiders. They may not be the most talented band in the world but they sure as hell make you want to get up and just jump around. You can't sit down and listen to this album. Music great, lyrics ok, talent ok, originality pretty good. Get the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"inventive","review":"a fantastic example of the how inventive and original metal can be, stands out from the crowd. \`Suite Pee' would be my pick of the bunch, complete with its great intro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nowhere To Go But Up","review":"The new millenium has brought forth another top-notch metal group. System of a Down are set with original, catchy, and passionate vocals, combined with explosive and delicious music. It would be impossible to choose a favorite track, yet \\"Spiders\\" (their second, mellow hit single), \\"DDevil\\", and their marijuana-debate tune \\"Peephole\\" stand out as metal classics. Do NOT be narrow-minded; System of a Down will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The System","review":"I think that these Armenians from L.A. are getting the message across that the genocide of 1.5 million armenians did happen there are songs in the c.d. there a definite meassage coming across that he is for his counry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"When I first got this CD, I put on the first track (Suite-Pee) and I thought the guitars at the beginnig were awsome, but then when the singing started, I thought the guy's voice was horrible and irritating and I put the CD away and didn't touch it again until I saw they're video for \\"Sugar\\", so I took out the Cd and started listening to it again, and at first, I wanted to turn it off again, but then I really started listening to it and serj's voice has become less and less annoying and now it's one of my favorite CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the two cd one, cuz it has this cd and a live cd","review":"System Of a Down is a mad crazy band who kicks. They are a lot like French Toast. You eat a couple slices, and you just want more and more. Whenever i eat French toast, i get sick. It tastes funny when my mom makes it. She uses her magic tingly flour though. I've had to go to the hospital four times this year. SOAD rocks like a really good band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best one","review":"This one is too far paced. Teh songs are all distorted. Unlike with their next record \\"Toxicity\\" they really don't find their niche.But it is still a damn good album.All the opening tracks are good. but as you get passed the middle (Track 8) it starts to confuse you a little. Peephole is a great song. So is P.L.U.C.K.And of course Sugar and Spiders, but they are not the best songs on here. I think personally the best two tracks are \\"Suggestions\\" and \\"Soil\\". definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"system of a down","review":"this is an incredible cd. if you have any doubts about this aesthetic bunch of plastic, forget them.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"System Of A Down's self titled debut album is one of the best cd's I have ever heard.It took me a fews listens to relize this,when I first heard it I was like whats this.But I wasn't ready to give up on it after all the good things I had heard about it.So I listened a couple more times and I came to like it so much it was constantly in my cd player I had it for about a year and still like it.The best songs are suite pee,sugar suggestions,spiders,soil,and war(the best song ever) but thats just my opinion you decide for yourself.I highly recomend to everyone so check it out you wont be dissapionted"},{"rating":"2","title":"EASILY THEIR BEST ALBUM!!!","review":"ok, i am one of the biggest SOAD fans that has ever lived. and this album is one of the reasons i love them. suite pee and war? are 2 of the best songs i have ever heard in my life. and serj's singing is freakin awesome. buy this cd or be loser for the rest of your life. its up to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armenian rock???","review":"System of a Down's debut may - WILL - sound offbeat to people who find Tool normal...but after a few listens, System's sound grows on you. From the slow ballad \\"Spiders\\" to the faster \\"Sugar\\" and \\"War?\\", the entire album is an experience in music anyone looking for something new should try. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for straight-forward metal, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best band in music today","review":"Among all the sleazy MTV rock'n'roll wannabes, SOAD is simply a breath of fresh air... Listen to their music several times, and each time you will notice something new. The debut album is fantastic, I cannot wait until the next one comes out. The preview tracks like \\"Chop Suey\\", \\"Arto\\" and \\"Innervision\\" are very promising so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for extra material","review":"The 4 live tracks here are very poor. The guitar-playing is barely audible and the vocals are huffed and puffed. \\"War\\" was pretty good, but \\"Sugar\\" was truly awful. The other two were accessable. System Of A Down weren't a really good live band in 1999. Their studio music was very technical and hard to play live. However, on the Pleadge Of Allegence Tour around the time they dropped their sophomore album \\"Toxcity\\", their technical level dropped some, making thier live performances sound really good.There are some differences in the liner-notes, with different pictures. Just the lyrics sheet has not been moved.You might want to buy this for the \\"Sugar\\" video, but just be aware that there are many better live bands than SOAD.That's it, peace..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb metal CD","review":"This CD is good all the way through. The opening of Suite-Pee displays the guitarist's amazing talent, the initial drumbeat of Know is executed very skillfully, and the singer displays his very different, very cool voice throughout. Unlike most of the CD's I own, every song on this one is good. System of a Down manages to maintain great sounds in all 13 songs. I urge you to pick up this CD if you have any interest in metal. I'll definitely get their next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Debut cd ive heard yet","review":"Only because its the first, but still an awesome first cd... i understand that the first is supposed to be the ice breaker for a line of brilliant cds, and this is a great example. It sets the bar very high alone with Mind, sugar, and spiders three awesome songs. Suite Pee is intense but also very calm at the same time"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Start","review":"In the music industry most bands start out with a great first album and then sellout and fade away into the sun set. System of a Down has done the exact opposite - they have crafted two great albums (\\"Toxicity,\\" \\"Steal This Album\\") focusing on politics and a mixture of controled rage and harmony. On the otherhand their first self titled album consists of just idle yelling and it is surprising that it sold well enough to warrant the classic \\"Toxicity\\" to be made. It has only two songs of note, Ddevil and Spiders. Ddevil's drum beat make it a caustic track along the lines of Bounce on Toxicity. Spiders on the other hand can't be compared to anything else, it is pure harmony.However the rest of the album is pure trash, including the hit Sugar. Not one other song sounds remotely intelligent or thought out in the way in which they are recorded.So don't bother with this unless you can't find Spiders and Ddevil on the internet - and go buy \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Steal This Album.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth about SOAD","review":"Ok i happen to find SOAD an ok band, simple easy guitar, good bass, good drumming, and the vocals arent too shabby either. I think Sugar is an ok kind of funny song, but all in all for my taste i think Spiders is the best song off of here, terriffic lyrics, and music all together. But i think the song shouldve been longer because of how dark and deep it was. All in all SOAD is ok and sound alot better then alot of these bands today. At least the guy actually sings. The thing is though, is that SOAD is not metal at all. Not even Nu Metal, there is not such a thing as nu metal, SOAD are just good old hard rock, and ill take it over the rap/rock mix anyday, so hardcore rockers enjoy the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy, yet interesting music","review":"System of a Down is a great band. I hadn't heard their music until I saw the \\"Sugar\\" video on MTV. After that, I had to buy the disc. I absolutely love it. My favorite song is probably \\"CUBErt,\\" but they're all very good. As some reviewers have already said, Serj's voice is difficult to get used to, but I think his timbre (if you can call it that) is interesting and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"There aren't alot of good bands out there right now, but this is one of 'em. This album mixes metal with punk and a little jazz. It kicks hard with songs like know and sugar. You should by this if you like hardcore rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This band has got to be the most incredible thing since the invention of distortion. The music on this disc tends to be raw, yet very very tight. Extremely heavy and hard to dislike, I love the music and the message.Their live show kicks, also... Just saw them at the Ozzfest, and they ruled!!!P.S. Anyone who says Serj is \\"losing it\\" because he thinks the world situation is screwed up needs a serious reality check themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Amazing","review":"This is the must-have cd for any heavy punk-grunge fans out there. The music feels so right, and the lyrics take the songs to another level. AND its a great way to calm down if u feel tense. So, basically this is a SUPURB CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best in Hard Rock!","review":"This band is what absolutely has to be the very best in hard rock. Just take one quick listen to \\"Sugar\\", \\"Spiders\\", or \\"PLUCK\\" and you'll know what I'm talking about. These guys are just soo crazy, and soooooo absolutely out of their minds that it gets scary sometimes (Sugar), but, yeah, definetly pick this up. Also, their new album will be coming out pretty soon, and you all need to pick that up. Just check out some of the new songs (\\"The Metro\\", \\"Marmalade\\", and \\"Shame (Wu Tang cover)\\") that they've done off soundtrack albums and the such if ya don't believe me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"I'm not usually a great fan ofmetal. It's not usually my scene which would explain the lack of that last star.It did take me a while to get used to this album, but I must say, the more and more I commited myself to this foreign, weird bunch of glorious musicians, the more I liked it.The mood of the album varies after almost every track, ranging from the light-headed, slow mood of \\"Spiders\\", to the ultimate drunkard's \\"Sugar\\".My love for this LP is neverending and with any luck, the next one will be just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn of a new system","review":"What makes these Armenian band from LA different is the abundance of different styles and directions in their music. Definitely coming with their roots from a powerful bone-crushing hardcore metal aggression, \\"System of a Down\\" works their way into a separate music category with elements of \\"Deep Purple\\"-type hard rock of 70's, with a sarcastic voice of Serj Tankian, soaring at times into monstrous roar, or plummeting back into a husky whisper. They combine lots of different styles from aggresive rap to Armenian folk notes. They sing powerful ballads (\\"Spiders\\"), they sing cacophonic mockery tunes (\\"Pluck\\", \\"Peephole\\", \\"Sugar\\") and culminate everything with \\"PLUCK\\" - probably the most aggressive song. Their lyrics are well-formed and contain quite powerful images. This band definitely has got a lot of potential, which I believe puts them on a higher level than other similar groups like \\"Static X\\" or \\"Korn\\". Expect this band to rise to the very high grounds in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and the best","review":"This is definitely SOAD's best especially compared to their newer Hypnotize material where Serj gets less vocal time. If you're new to getting into System of a Down, I suggest not starting with this CD immediately because it might turn you off and perhaps starting with Mezmerize or Toxicity, but this CD is amazing and true to the creativeness and craziness of SOAD. All of this album's songs are outstanding, but I am not as crazy about Suggestions and Peephole as I am the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"i bought this album simply for sugar but jeeze! every song here rocks, a lot are even better than sugar. this album does what we all want to do and that is give nu-metal a good kick in the balls!

Worst concert I've ever been to too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk About Overrated","review":"My god, there are soo many bands capable of doing what these guys do. Barely anything original in their playing (but the singer's outfits are cool). I could pull four guys out of any bar band across the globe and they'd be as good a band as these guys. Powerman 5000, Static X, Incubus, Sevendust, hell, even Slipknot and Stepkings blow these guys away, period. The album is seriously mediocre, as well. Recommend take two aspirins and get a Led Zeppelin record instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOAD RULES","review":"There is no other way to put it, System of a Down is the best new talent I have seen. They have said that most of their fans look like psychos, but I can only understand why. Their music pumps you up so much, it sometimes is hard to come back down from the ceiling. I saw them live once, and am going to see them live again, and i know they will rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mental","review":"Fast, chaotic and unpredicable (especially the vocals which vary wildly from high-pitched warbling to death metal roars) but they never let the diverse elements, such as jazzy sounds, take over too much - their big, crunchy riffs take centrestage. Suite-Pee, Know, War, Spiders and the bizarre Peephole are the highlights, but there are no weak songs here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Millenium","review":"When I bought this track I was expecting live garbage. But when I popped this bad mamma jamma into my CD player I was blown away. Serj and the crew has managed to keep the same quality live. I loved it and it also has the music video for Sugar, which was phenominal. I highly suggest that if you read this you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need my System of a Down!","review":"Pretty much every song on this album I've wanted to listen to specifically at one time or another. I often ended up listening to more than just one song because all the songs have great beginnings that pull you in. You should probably buy Toxicity before this album but if you liked it you won't be disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inventive metal","review":"It's been quite awhile since this discs release and since I got it it's spent a good portion of time in my cd player. Every member is a master at the insturment he plays and utilizes them as best as they can. Instead of making radio friendly songs that basically sound the same all the way through the song, SOAD will change tempos and Serj will change singing styles every few moments to keep the energy flowing.There next LP is set for release in August and from the 5 songs I've heard off of it, it's going to be even better than this one! I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoops","review":"I'd heard OF these guys but paid no attention. I hate Korn, Limp Bizkit, Coal Chamber, ad nauseum and never bothered listening. Then i heard a song on the radio that was by far the best thing i've heard through the airwaves in a LONG while. The DJ didn't bother mentioning who it was, so i forgot about it. Then in a Mr. Bungle interview Trey mentioned how cool he thought these guys were. Well, if the guys in Mr. Bungle like them, maybe i should give SOAD another chance. I got this, instantly recognized Sugar as being the radio mystery song, and now i'd consider myself a fan. If you want teenage angst, don't bother with this. But if you want some creative and unique metal with awesome unorthadox vocal stylings, check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serj and the boys rip it up!","review":"I have been listening to System of a Down for a little under a year now, and i think that they are a great up and coming band. At first off you hear Serj's wacky voice and think that this is a band trying to hard, but if you continue to listen they really grow on you. i was fortunate to have caught them at Sno-Core 2000, and I must say that it is probably one of the best shows I have ever seen anyone put on. Just seeing the band charismatically jump around the stage crying their urgent message of political opression got them my immediate respect. But when they mix the lyrics with their roaring instruments, they really create something special!"},{"rating":"2","title":"System just rocks","review":"I first heard Sugar on the radio, and loved it. Then I downloaded the Spiders mp3, and loved it. I got the cd, and it blew me away. The vocalist's voice is incredible, he can scream like the best of metal singers, and he can make his voice sound really funny too, and it works either way. Some of the songs are almost laughable, they sound like something out of a circus, but its a great new edge for metal music. There isn't one track that isn't as good as the rest. I can't wait for their next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SYSTEM!!!","review":"One of their BEST albums!!!! Had to buy it again cause' I lost my original one. Can't have that now. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Like Some Intense Craziness","review":"This album makes absolutely no sense.It doesn't matter though, it has crazy lyrics and crazy melodies, and defies all genres. It is nu-metal, but just because it is new and it is metal. There is no other way to describe them. Daron Malakian shows he can actually play guitar on Soil, and the only hit off this album, Sugar, doesn't even make sense and just talks about mushroom people.Serj is an amazing singer and actually sounds like he knows what he is talking about.In a perfect world, this would be the Dark Side of the Moon of Nu-metal, because it makes about as much sense and is just about as influental.One last thing, buy this album because it is good, not because it is political. There is really only one political song, and the best song on the album, P.L.U.C.K., calling for recognition of the Armenian genocide of the 1920s."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We all fight the heathens!\\"","review":"This is such a cool CD. Seriously, it's so awsome and heavy. Parts of it will stay with you until you die, even if you never hear it again. I have to say the best lyric is from Suite Pee: \\"I wanna F*CK my way to the garden, cuz everyone...needs...a mother...F*CKEEERRR!!!\\". Anyway, the songs are all really meaningful. The cool thing about SOAD is that they only mean what you interpret in their songs. You make what you want of them. They're an awsome band and this is an awsome CD. I just won the \\"Limited Edition Tour CD\\" off of ebay, which is a preview of this CD for DJ's with three songs off of this, both live and recorded. The disk is blue. It's cool. Anyway, this is an awsome CD, so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"great debut","review":"Being the first album of a new band, this self titled CD is a very good efort. The \\"problem\\" is i got it only a week before i bought Toxicity and now i can't seem to be able to listen to anything but the new one.....anyways some thoughts: if you manage to like the way Serj sings, you'll love this. The album has really good songs, e.g. Spiders, but it gets really tiring once you've listened to 7-8 songs. But as i said, considering it's their first, this is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy brand name instead!","review":"I bought one of these for my digital camera, as well as 2 others made by the camera's manufacturer.

Certainly, the interested reader would learn more about the political conflicts that are the background of the novel and just as much about Cicero and the other main characters referenced in the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Harris and those Romans","review":"It is so much fun to learn about History in this way!

Fascinating characters from history like Julius Caesar and Cicero, unbelievable events, wonderful history, and well thought-out characters who feel alive.

A fascinating account of Cicero's life that includes some deliciously unexpected wry humor. If you like his earlier novel about Rome (Pompeii), you'll like this one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Thrilling Than I Anticipated","review":"I liked the historical aspect of this tale and I loved that it was told by Cicero's slave. I didn't love the political wrangling. I find politics dull, no matter who the players happen to be. Even when there is ample wheeling, dealing, and maneuvering- it's dullsville for me. I made it through this one but am sorry that I already bought the second one in the pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"END OF THE REPUBLIC","review":"Very good yarn, based of the life of Cicero as told by his aide de camp. I first was introduced to Harris, when somebody recommended Fatherland to me some years ago, I was blown away by that book, it was fascinating to think of a Germany victorious after World War II, the story unfolds as Hilter is celebrating his 75th, God help us, birthday, this book is not as original or as quick paced at that book, Imperium is more deliberate in its pace, but still it tells an interesting story of a great orator, who much to his horror, ushers in the Empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, Descriptive Historical Fiction","review":"Imperium is not only well constructed, captivating and accessible historical fiction, it's also an engrossing character study and an immensely entertaining courtroom thriller--all set in an ancient Rome with political and social issues very similar to our own.

I enjoyed this presentation of his life as told by his slave and friend Tiro. This is an an entertaining fictional option about his life. I also enjoyed the Anthony Everett biographical account of his life. I am looking forward to the other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very slow but thorough potential view of Roman life!","review":"Its really hard to give a review on this because, although interesting at times, this book reads like an encyclopedia. I liked it....I think.....at least a little. Ancient Roma ploitics could be riddled with action and to a point this tale had action but it was all verbal which seemed tedious. I loved Fatherland by Harris bu have been less thrilled with all his other works so far. This didn't live up to the hype and my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"verbose","review":"My husband and I tried to do this as a shared read-aloud book. We managed to get through 30% of the book but finally decided it was endless. Although the central character tends toward verbosity, does the author need to do the same? But, alas, we are old and time is short. Our reading choices need to be really engaging or we will toss them off and find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard slogging","review":"I enjoyed pompeii, but I am finding this one hard slogging. The story seems to be a straight narration of political events from one viewpoint, the slave Tiro, and there's very little personal interaction, very little that makes you like or identify with any of the characters, or even hate cicero's nemesis. I got about half way through it and realized it was never going to pick up or make me care about the characters, one way or another and skimmed the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have read all of Robert Harris's books and I am a great fan. Fatherland and Pompeii were really good novels -- especially Fatherland. His latest -- the Fear Index -- available in the US next month -- is a very good read. But, to get back to Imperium, the problem was a lack of a real story and too many characters (with difficult names to remember!!) I fully expected a really good novel about ancient Rome but I came away very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"\\"Imperium\\" is brilliant. Robert Harris produces a historical novel that zips through with high intensity while maintaining steady grip on reality. Its amazing the tension Harris builds during the political events in the novel. Normally such events are not the stuff of thrillers, but not so here. Also wonderful are the characterizations, especially Cicero himself. Another favorite for me is Julius Ceasar who enters the novel early in his career. The \\"insider perspective\\" the reader gets into how Ceasar begins to win space in Roman politics and into the character traits that lead to his future importance is a special treat. I definitely am looking forward to a continuation of this Cicero's saga"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic...simply fantastic!","review":"One of those rare books that left you wanting for more...what else can I say? I'm so glad this is on my Kindle because I took it everywhere for the three days it took to read. I've been to Rome several times and the action in the story made places like the Forum and Circus Maximus come alive. Really, really looking forward to reading the next book in this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rome from political eyes...","review":"Usually when I get a book about Rome I look for violence and blood. There wasn't much of that but what took it's place was almost just as good. It was about the politics of Rome and everything that goes with it. The plotting behind the scenes, making friends your enemies and your enemies your friends.What this book showed me is that politics have ALWAYS been corrupt but there will always be good men to fight the fight. This is a good book and one that I would recommend, but not if you're looking for the \\"muscle\\" part of Rome. This is more the \\"brain\\" part."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must disagree with previous reviews","review":"I read this for my bookclub, where we like to read books giving different perspectives of the world than the small corner that we inhabit. At first, I thought this would be a real eye opener, but as I read further, I found it to be uninspired and, well, boring. Most all the characters were relayed to us as a laundry list of issues with over simplified emotional difficulties. Just when I thought there would be real complexity, such as in the character of Marie, the book would stop and revert back to caricature and one note emotional levels that never change. I did enjoy the writing of the character of John Smith who was a genuinely interesting study of schizophrenia and sadness. But too often the story fell off the road of simple and truthful storytelling into the bottomless pit of fuzzy pictures with vaguely annoying plotlines. And, boy, did it need editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indian lovers","review":"Many of the people reviewing this book have missed the point, yes it is a violent, racially charged book. And it is about time that an Indian wrote it. So much of Indian culture is being stolen by white people who are in love with the idea of Indian. They think taking a sweat in the sweat house and smoking a peace pipe are still options to erase what was done by their white ancestors. They think that love with no tribe is enough for any Indian child Alexie is just trying to show how wrong these ideas are. The ironically named John Smith is searching for his people. Marie is fighting for hers, Junior is doing both. Jack Wilson is another character that is ironically named. (Jack Wilson was the white name of the Indian Prophet Wovoka) He and the professor represent every white person who steals from the Indians while claiming to love them. This is a powerful book. It will leave you reeling for days."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extreme disappointment for this fan of Alexie's.","review":"Until reading this book I thought that Alexie was one of this country's best young writers. But this is a terrible book. Not because of the anger. If you're not angry at the dominant culture you're not paying attention. I am glad that Alexie is voicing a hatred of the dominant culture. More writers should. Heck, things are bad enough that all writers should. But Alexie hates his white characters. that's a fatal flaw. It makes his characters flat and dull and boring and nothing but stereotypes. Frankly, his Indians aren't much better in this book. All the characters in this book are cardboard. I've loved his other work, but this one is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"- Big Time Wrestling mentality","review":"No heavenly fistfight here, just Big-Time-Wrestling mentality. Infantile. Alexie is a good writer, but this one is simply awful. Stereotypes abound, characters are but caricatures... There is no point to it, none. What in thunder was he thinking? All of his other books are worth reading, but say away from this one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"The reviews all seem to be either wildly positive or negative. I'm in the latter group. I thought this book was so shot through with hate and self-pity that it was painful to read, and the white characters were all cardboard stereotypes. It's a pity, since the author is obviously deeply familiar with northwestern Indian life and could have written a fascinating, mind-opening book instead of this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"novel","review":"It is one of the few novels by Alexie. Many of his books are poetry and/or short stories. It was fun to read, had a lot of twists and turns and very interesting overall. As with all of Alexie's books, it is well written and gives one something to think about. He is truly an excellent writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who or What is the Indian Killer?","review":"I have read this book twice. Once several years ago and once recently because a local book club was having a discussion of it. I still do not know for certain who or what the Indian Killer was. It is very well written and makes you think about Native American culture and prejudice. It is quite different from some of Sherman Alexie's other writings in tenor but does have some of the same insight into Indian life. I recommend this for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius manifested in the ending","review":"Indian Killer is a masterfully crafted story. The author weaves social issues and our most subtle prejudices into the story in a way that never feels contrived or gets tiresome. The characters are multidimensional-complex or simple, they come across real. The story moves at clipper speed. The genius of the writer is made manifest in the gutsy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book. Very Original","review":"I saw Sherman Alexie give a reading and I was an instant fan. He has some of the finest descriptions and plot lines of any writer out there. Wonderful writer that strays away from all cliches. Can't give him enough praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very powerful book","review":"This is the one book by Sherman Alexie that does not contain humorous elements. John Smith's descent into madness and homicidal mania is a powerful statement about what can happen when a child has no roots to fall back upon- and therefore invents his own past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Redford writes a novel","review":"After all the good reviews of this book, I was horribly disappointed. Indeed, half way thru I finally gave up. Why? Because I found the characters like two dimensional cut-outs of people, thin and pre-determined by their creator as good, bad, phony, laudible. I hate this kind of writing. It is like one of the bad Refdford movies in which all characters are little icons of his view of the world, politically correct or the reverse. Characters are complex, and the best do not need to be pre-judged. I'm sorry, but I will have to be hard put to try another of this author's books. There is too much good literature, and even good pulp fiction out there to be led around like in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Okay","review":"This is a good book and i would recomend it to someone with a short atention span. This book will wrap you up and you will not wantto put it down. The auther did a very good job with introduceing new people into the story. this is a mystery that will will keep you guessing untill the end. it is about the murders of white men you are being scalped and left for dead. this sends the city of seattle into an uproar acussing every person with an idian backgrond of being the murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow lame","review":"I'm fair skinned w/freckles and this product after one app barely showed any color what so ever.

But when I got a classic Bontrager steel hardtail to ride on firetrails and rural paved backroads in the Santa Cruz mountains, I did a lot of research. I decided on the Hard Terrains, ordered a set and after six months could not be happier! These tires are amazing. Absolutely no noise on the street -- no wierd behavior in turns, but edges that grab and hold in the loose stuff. You mount them with the arrow shape pointing forward in the front for less rolling resistance and backward in the back for more traction.Like the Michelins I have on my GTI and Ranger, they're solidly built, which means they could be a tiny bit lighter, but they perform and give me a real sense of confidence.

I bought it on sale and I feel it was worth the price (best of all NO contract extension!). The camera (love that there are two of them on this phone) and music player are fabulous! It's user friendly and a lot of the features did not require reading the book.Although I do love this phone, it does have some drawbacks, it slows down at times when multiple programs are open (but what phone doesn't), I would like to have a repeating alarm, as I use my phone alarm almost daily. And lastly I do find the keys are a little on the small side."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant book","review":"Many, many names for angels and some brief information on them. Although this book is not as thick as I would like it to be, the author did rely on more than the mundane orthodoxy for his information.

It would have rated 5 stars if the information had been more voluminous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not really truthful","review":"I suppose it depends on what you'd consider truthful.. But I didn't really get anything out of it. I don't believe angels can do much for you.. But I guess if you're into witchcraft or angel worship, then you would get some use out of it. It's got some pretty names, and some interesting ideas, but it's one of those \\"every religion is right, why can't we all just get along\\" type of books, and I just didn't have any real use in it. One of my \\"friends\\" stole my copy, so I guess it was never meant to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is full of Occult junk.","review":"I didnt like this book at all. I even ripped out the last four pages because it had occult spells and rituals. Most of the names it comes up with for angels comes from occult resources. I do not recomend this book at all. It reads like a real dictonary. So unless you have a demon or angel tell you their name it is pretty useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"Basically it's just a book of names. Not at all what I expected. I figured it would have some sense of a story connected with it in some other sections, but it doesn't. It's put together with also conflicting info on where some of the angels even are situated. The author even states angels cannot be in two places at once in his forward regardless of their speed ability. The end of the book has some enchantment spells that have nothing to do with God, as the author even mentions Jesus condemned this. He conteracts with the statement that this wasn't always condemned. The fact remains it is a practice that is condemned now by God in heaven. Satan is very smart so we must be careful to see through the disguise. Who needs to known about the fallen angels names? Angels don't usually tell you their names as God doesn't want us to worship them. Be careful if you decide this one is for you.

I recieved it just yesterday, and I am already reading it through for the second time. I couldn't put it down; I was devouring all of the wonderful entries.

Look, it's a *dictionary* -- it says so in the title. It's not something you read cover to cover, but you can use it to look up particular Angels by name, and then locate the relevant source material. Davidson makes thorough use of the rabbinic and kabbalistic literature, including fairly obscure midrashim, and in his Introduction he gives this Jewish source material equal or more-than-equal attention. I find this fairly refreshing, since I was expecting a much more Christian-centric approach.

Loaded with mistakes, poor writing","review":"I finished reading this book just to see how bad it could get by the end. Released in September 1999, the author should have known that Y2K was already big news, even with the Everyday Joe. He writes about embedded chips (that have no need for any date or time information) failing and causing massive systems failure. He has nuclear reactors failing or being taken offline. In perhaps the most egregious error, he suggests that the NY subway could fail due to computer error -- when in reality, it is well-known that the display board at Jay Street was never correctly wired, and all switches and signals are mechanically controlled.The plot is severely lacking. Four geeks rewrite the entire city infrastructure in two years -- and are stuck on some control passwords! A multi-billionaire wants to cheat the bank whose systems his company is rewriting!This book has no basis in reality. Any similarity to Planet Earth as we know it is coincidental."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real Y2K will disappoint you....","review":"Having first hand knowledge of the Year 2000 computer problems, especially involving the banking industry, will definitely lead to a different scenario than this book.There will be no cataclysmic events, just a minor blip here and there. Granted, there may be minor power disruptions, but midweek, things will be back to normal.Planes falling from the sky, riots, and countries going belly up, doesn't even merit a mention in the true scenario. The plot of this book is so off the mark, the author seems to be cashing in on millenium-hyped sensationalism of the unsuspecting.Learn how to spell \\"buses\\" (rather than \\"busses\\"), and don't waste your time on a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little, too late","review":"After reading Joseph Massucci's \\"The Millennium Project,\\" I was eager for another page-turning Y2K thriller. Unfortunately, this isn't it -- in fact, I couldn't help wondering how much of this material was \\"borrowed.\\" Plotwise the two books share a lot in common, but the excitement quickly ends here. Joseph's \\"Deadline Y2K: A Novel\\" stretches credibility to the limit, and his stereo-typical characters are recycled from a dozen movies (Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix in \\"Sneakers\\" -- unfortunately they're not as clever).

Too many mistakes","review":"The book begins in 1991. Doc..the techno-geek is 23. It states he \\"ogled dad's computerized porno collection\\" when he was 8. That means the year was 1976?? There were neither computer graphics then nor the hard drives to put them on. This lack of knowledge on the subject ruins any credibility that the author might have had. And this was on page 7. I stopped there. Unless you change it to fantasy..the book is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"A preposterous, unreadable mish-mash","review":"It's asking a lot to believe that Y2K will result in riots, fires and mayhem. And it's hard to suspend disbelief when one is rewarded with high-school writing, cardboard characters and a plot that is mis-paced. Deadline Y2K reads more like a description of a thriller that some inexperienced writer wants to do someday, rather than the book itself. That this sad effort could get published is evidence that the publishing world has its own Y2K problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already been done","review":"My reading group has tackled a number of these Y2K stories and found this one to be nothing new.

Of the three, my reading group liked Kelly's book the best. It captures the frenzy of the millennium best and, hey, it's the original. That counts for something. Knock-offs can try as hard as they want to be good, but they're still just knock-offs.

As a lot of the Calico Critter playsets come with tiny accessories, this carry n play case is practical as it has sufficient storage space for them. Also, this is a great case to bring along on playdates, or when travelling. My daughter was able to store some furniture, accessories, and up to a dozen Calico Critters in it when we travelled recently. My only complaint is the latch which is not strongly reinforced and opens easily. So, one has to be extra careful when carrying the case. But overall, I'd rate this item as a great alternative to purchasing the more expensive homes in the series, and a practical way to store and transport the critters and accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamp problem","review":"I purchased the 52hmx84 in Feb 05. The lamp blew the first time in October of 2005 and Toshiba covered it under warantee. The lamp just blew again in Jun 06. This now seems to be covered under an extended warantee. Cost of the bulbs is $[...] plus shipping. I got about 4333 hours on each bulb. Anyone interested in buying this model of DLP should purchase a lamp to keep on hand since the wait time could be a few days depending on mailing. Toshiba only has 8 parts distributors in the U.S. they told me, although it seems to be available online from other sources. The Picture is great and the built in speakers are good. I notice no difference between component input quality and the HDMI input so that's a user preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Long Lasting","review":"We bought our Toshiba DLP about 4-5 years ago from a chain electronics store. We only had to replace the lamps a couple of times, which wasn't too bad, although expensive. The last lamp, however only got a short life, because the color wheel broke on it, as our TV repairman just told us. Unfortunately, Toshiba doesn't sell the color wheel by itself, it comes as a part of the light engine, which is $1000 to replace, instead of $300 for the color wheel by itself. So, needless to say, we will not be repairing the TV and it is now worth nothing. Wish we hadn't bought this TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Toshiba DLP","review":"This is an annoying and expensive choice for any family and it should be avoided. You need to plan to buy a new lamp, which will cost you about $218.00, every year. That doesn't include any fees for service calls too. A TV that will fail at any moment and require a new lamp is a terrible thing. Calling Toshiba service is a nightmare too."},{"rating":"1","title":"steer clear of hdlp Toshiba tv's!!!","review":"Whatever you do - steer clear of Toshiba HDLP tv's!!

For me this has happened three times so far, every 14 months in average. The worst is now I just bought the third lamp, paid $200, and the thing (I can't call it a TV) doesn't work. So I ended up with a $3000 purchase (this was 2004 and it came with stand) + what I paid for the lamps, and after 4 years and all this money spent I have a non functional TV and a stand.

On low mode, the quality is just okay.You'll be buying a new lamp every 6 to 12 months, even on low mode with minimal usage. Avoid this TV like the plague.

With only 2 weeks of use, my new Toshiba DLP has been in the shop for 3 weeks and it appears it will be there another 2 -3 weeks.All I can say is read and understand the Amazon.com warranty and return policy for this item and expect little if any assistance if you should have a problem.

When I called Toshiba this morning to complain about this, the customer service agent seemed to think this is no big deal. After a while on the phone I was given a phone number of a local service center and told to contact them and get it fixed. I am now on my own with a broken TV and a local service tech.

And unlike some sets, it does very well with non-HDTV pictures.But it's not always working. Since April 2005, I've been through two lamps (one covered by warranty), and had a defective light engine. The light engine is the mounting for the lamp, and needs to be replaced as an entire unit. When it goes out, the symptoms are exactly the same as a burned out lamp, except that when you put in a new lamp, the picture stays black. My light engine was replaced under warranty, which was the good news. But due to backlogs at the authorized service agency, and backorder for parts, it took 7 weeks to get the set fixed and returned.This problem may exist for all DLPs, or it may just be Toshiba. Bottom line, I would not buy another Toshiba DLP.If you do get a DLP, don't wait for the light to go out to get a replacement. Buy one immediately.

Whereas the official James Bond film series stayed mainstream, CASINO ROYALE definitely seemed like an entry in the pop culture of those times and this album really captures that madcap nature right in the midst of all those goings-on.

Debbie Macomber is an insult to women everywhere. Every female character was a stereotypical weak woman who for 90% of the book pined away for some \\"perfect\\" male.

Three women join the proprietor of a new yarn shop in Seattle for weekly knitting lessons. Each of the four have issues that they may not be aware will affect the group. As they spend more time together, lives are changed by the interactions of the group members. Sweet romance is a given. I'm on to the next book in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Actually Think I'll take up Knitting Again!","review":"The Shop on Blossom Street kept my interest the whole way through.

I love Lydia's character and love watching her grow and grasp life without Cancer. Debbie Macomber delivers every time! I highly recommend her books which bring real women into our lives. We who do not have sisters or lots of female bonding enjoy hearing how women interact and recognize our own deep feelings.

The author mixes up several figures with similar names, such as James Warren and Dr. Joseph Warren. He accuses Samuel Adams of breaking into a governor's house to steal letters; those letters were actually obtained in London. Statements on two pages about John Adams's 1770 political career contradict each other, and neither is correct. And those are only some of the errors I saw in a one-day skim. As a result, I distrust the book's sections on other American towns.

The plots suffer from the sentimentality found in so many great 19C novels. Eliot draws you into pastoral English life and observes the scenes there with images that cannot be found in weaker fiction of the kind. There is a delightful description of vicar Barton by his fire with pipe and gin, enjoying the contrasting wet and dry. Her language here holds you, stops the reader and forces him to sigh. These stories are full of wonderful insights and descriptions, and these are what hold the reader. Of course, it should be understood that Eliot will not be read by anyone much amused by pop/tv culture.

I've been using it in the \\"all metal\\" mode which is an easy way to get started. I have used it a few times and find it to be quite sensitive. So far I've found coins, a few pieces of cheap jewelry, and a lot of trash items (bottle caps, hair pins, foil...) The trash can be filtered out easily by adjusting the knobs and switch on the console. I was just in a hurry to use it and didn't want to miss anything. One thing it doesn't seem to detect very well is very small gold chains without pendants. This might be true of all metal detectors. I don't know because this is the only one I've ever used. It uses two 9v batteries which can be expensive, but I picked up an inexpensive pair of headphones which seem to increase the battery life.

Every time the Tracker signalled we found something. Once you hit on something it may take a little sifting to find it, but we did find something every time - from old bottle caps, to some old square nails to some pocket change that had clearly been there for a while. Some of the items were as much as 12\\" under the surface.

I was very disapointed with the quality of picture at night or low light conditions. The picture quality during the day was par at best. I hooked it up to the docking station and it did not work. I had to plug it into the camara direct. I also had some errors while recording and it prompted me to do some repair. I pushed a couple of buttons and it seemed to correct itself. The software that it came with is hard to figure out. The only pro is 7 hours of record time. I am probably going to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good camcorder, with minor inconveniences","review":"After owning it for several months, I've found this JVC to be good quality for a non-pro like me. Very easy to use. It can hold so much, that I've never come close to filling the hard drive yet. Also takes good quality stills, on par with my digital camera, and has a nice interface for reviewing what's on the hard drive.I agree with some of the other reviewers that it doesn't take good video at night or in low light conditions. I'm not sure yet if there are other settings that can be tweaked to make the low light video turn out better, but the daytime / nightime toggle switch helps a little. Also, I recommend buying a second battery when you buy the device, since the battery that comes with it doesn't last long.The optical zoom is also a bonus, and gives it a feel of being a still camera with a good zoom. Stability of the image when using the zoom for video can be difficult though. Overall, a good buy, especially if the price is coming down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks an ending","review":"I had tired of the \\"hard\\" reading I've been tied up with of late, so I took a quick novel break, reading this brief work by Brian Moore nearly straight through.

The theory is that Zeno helped Sinclair navigate to Newfoundland. Pohl's initial findings are in Zeno's letters themselves. In 1398, according to the Zeno narrative, Zeno sailed across the Atlantic with a \\"Prince of the Islands\\" (Sinclair). Pohl does some astonishing calligraphy detective work on Zeno's maps and examines the Micmac Indian legend of Glooscap. According the Micmac legends, Glooscap sailed on an island with tall trees and was white. Pohl's detective work makes for a good argument that in 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue, but got beat to the punch by a Scotsman. The only evidence I am truly surprised Pohl did not introduce was the carvings of Indian Corn at the Sinclair's Rosslyn Chapel in Edinburgh.

The book itself, however, is unchanged from the 1964 text.Beginners will find this a difficult book to work through. MacIntyre presumes the reader has a basic understanding of the ideas and philosophers he discusses.But for those with adequate background this is a wonderful book, full of many insights. Be warned, though, this book is not a neutral review of the subject matter. In this book MacIntyre lays the groundwork for his own particular version of ethics (developed most fully in After Virtue).Much of the book is dense and part of it is, arguably, poorly written. But it is worth the work needed to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good survey of the history of ethics","review":"MacIntyre has produced probably the best history of ethics I've ever seen.

The really nice thing about Mr. Tozier's playing, though, is his touch. It matches up with the compositions in such a way that his music is truly compelling, and it's well worth listening many, many times.I'm not usually a fan of solo guitar collections - but this one is truly exceptional, and well worth the time to sit and enjoy.

Although this might disappoint some true fans of UT I prefer Halo over this game. The multiplayer in Halo is almost the same although I love in UT how you can download infinite ammounts of modifications (like new weapons, levels, characters, modes, etc.) which make the game never boring. Here's how it goes. Also I loved the weapons in this game. The alternate fire is really coo. It's fun to find out which gun to use and figure out what to do with it in certain situations.

I am particularly fond of the Main Title, Little April Shower, and Fun On the Ice. The vocals and instruments used to express the feelings of the mostly-silent characters in this animated gem is a purely genuine combination of innocent curiosity and fearful urgency. With over an hour of track time, any Disney lover will want to snatch this up asap!The end of the soundtrack includes bonus material (the last 4 tracks), and usually I delete these from my iTunes (like I did with Beauty and the Beast), but something about the heartfelt voices of the creators (even Disney himself!) adds an even greater emphasis on the beauty of this classic - enough so that I enjoy listening to them even when I have my iTunes on Shuffle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go ahead and touch yourself","review":"A force to be reckon with, the Catholic Church contributes many good things to society.

It DOES give pointers (some of them a poke in the eye)and is a real good book to sit down and enjoy. It is so funny that I recommend wearing Depends and bracing your ribs with a pillow before you start reading. Yes, it's that good.

I started laughing right at the dedication and kept on until the last page. Finally someone who's not afraid to make fun of writing, which is, by far, scarier than telling a tatooed biker that his motorcycle reminds you of your kid sister's tricycle.

While there IS real advice to be found in John Warner's \\"Fondling Your Muse,\\" it's just buried in the folds of all that humor. I had to keep reminding myself to pay attention between the lines to information I was reading for. This is witty as hell, tongue-in-cheek, hilarious (as the title would suggest, of course). And I hope no one takes all of Warner's suggestions seriously--I can see the lawsuits now!Read Warner for his humor, for his in-sight into how the book world \\"really\\" works, for his dripping wit and sarcasm--it's worth the chuckles and outright laughter. \\"Fondling Your Muse\\" is the ideal antidote I needed to counteract the sturm-und-drang self-imposed reading list I've been working through lately. Awesome stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cult of McSweeney's skunks me again.","review":"John Warner, Fondling Your Muse (Writer's Digest, 2005)I was unaware, until faced with the cover of this book, that Warner was the editor of McSweeney's, and as soon as I saw that, I had a good idea of what to expect. Warner didn't disappoint me; the book is mildly amusing at times, but never anywhere near as funny as it thinks it is, full of annoying political snipes that have nothing at all to do with anything, and easily forgettable. In other words, a lot like McSweeney's itself.That said, buried beneath the satire there could well be a pretty good how-to book. A lot of Warner's core advice (or the opposite of a lot of Warner's core advice, depending on the topic) is sound. Naturally, there's nothing you haven't seen before, but then, when was the last time you picked up a writing book that had anything truly original to say?A little more consistency and a better sense of humor and I'd have recommended this. **"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Inspiration","review":"Kathy stated that her father always advised her to under promise and over deliver.

Yes it is indeed horrible, I am baffled how movies even get produced like this. The feeling I got from this movie was anger, when it ended I could not believe I wasted 2 hours of my life, gone forever.

Predictably they get snowed in and after other patients start getting murdered, Sly comes to the brilliant conclusion that there is a maniac loose in the center. D-TOX is a lot better than DRIVEN but there's still awful dialogue. ie. Cop to Sly: \\"Whatsa matter Malloy?, ya used to be one of us before you became a Fed\\". There is also an impaling scene stolen directly from Stallone's CLIFFHANGER. But dat's jist some DAY-ZHA-VOO know what I'm sayin'? Still, things could be worse.

Though there have been some Sylvester Stallone movies that I've enjoyed I'm not a big fan of his. I was attracted to this movie by the strong supporting cast, which includes Charles S. Dutton, Robert Prosky, Jeffry Wright, and Stephen Lang...all excellent character actors. But they're wasted in this piece of junk, which stretches credibility beyond the breaking point, indulges in fairly pointless, gross-out violence and is a poorly-told story. And mind you, this criticism is coming from someone who doesn't mind silly premises once in a while--hell, I like 'Runaway Train'--nor a little gratuitous violence--hell, I like 'Runaway Train'...and 'Dawn Of The Dead' for that matter. But, no matter how silly or violent, I DO require a well-told story...and 'Eye See You' just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, the plot and the acting is bad and the violence is without merit!

The premise of the movie had potential, but somewhere along the way of actually putting this idea on film, something went horribly wrong.A cop (Stallone) becomes a wash down and is sent to a snow covered rehab for cops in the remote wilderness of Siberia, where his victorious rival (for reasons that make no sense) is also taking up residence.Despite the list of magnificently dull actors, the film still flops, as the plot is overly paltry. Character development is abject (they all die too quickly). There is no suspense. Scenes are pasted and cut together without any transition. It is wrought with cliches, stereotypical characters and feebleminded acting from each actor in this film.I am in approval of the people with the unfavorable reviews, as this is one of Sly Rockhead's worst movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye Know What You Did Last Winter","review":"First, the good points: Excellent performances by Stallone and Robert Patrick; able supporting cast; offbeat, interesting setting; good production values.Now, the bad points: Everything else. The story never quite gels; the sound level on much of the dialog is extremely low; the violence is overly gruesome yet at the same time unaffecting; the net result is basically unbelieveable and therefore lacking any real suspense.It seems like there should be a much better movie here somwhere, but it just never shows up.It's clear why this was never released theatrically in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIOLENT HORROR MESS","review":"My suggestion is not to let the kids watch this before they go to sleep, even more so not during the day either. Violence is one thing but this goes beyond violence and shows a psychopath on a killing cops and women rampage. Not just your run of the mill rampage but a horrific almost realistic look at how he commits his crimes, i.e. drilling a hole through the eye hole and into the eye of the looker, e gad, get me out of here. Totally unrealistic half way house in Siberian Alaska, where cops go to work out their problems, but slowly die off from suicide or is it the psychopath that has found them--- give me a break.

Not normally a fan of \\"cop\\" movies or Stallone movies ( except Rambo ) , I decided to give it a try. What drew my attention to this movie is the fact that a serial killer is on the lose and for the strong violence and gore indicated on the box. I've seen worse movies but I've seen better!

There were some cool scenes in this movie and was somewhat entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please let me give this movie Zero Stars!","review":"I suffered, and I DO mean suffered, through this atrocity only for the sake of seeing Jeffrey Wright.

Originally titled \\"D-Tox\\" for overseas consumption, \\"Eye See You\\" bypassed U.S. theaters and landed on the video shelves - a fate \\"Over the Top\\" somehow managed to avoid.

Like. If you have already seen it, I'm so sorry. If not, here is your chance to avoid a lot of serious pain. My favorite part of the \\"movie\\" is the beginning, where Stallone is on the phone with the killer and the captain holds up a sign that the police are \\"two minutes away\\" from his house. Yet somehow the killer has time to hang up the phone, go attack/kill the wife, hang her body up by a rope attached to the ceiling, then leave...before two minutes are up. That pretty much sets the tone for the rest of this slow film. Another great question...WHY IS THE KILLER STALKING STALLONE? Who knows? Who cares! By the way, ignore any review that gives this film over 1 star. They are just people paid by Columbia-Tristar to up the rating of this movie, because NO RATIONAL HUMAN BEING could like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arctic Blast...","review":"After losing his girlfriend (Dina Meyer from STARSHIP TROOPERS, SAW 2 and 3) to a vengeful serial killer, FBI agent Malloy (Sylvester Stallone) becomes suicidal. Helped by a cop / friend (Charles S. Dutton from GOTHIKA and MIMIC), Malloy ends up at a rehab facility in the middle of wild Wyoming. A group of other cops are there for rehab as well, including a hard-boiled SWAT officer (Robert Patrick from TERMINATOR 2 and TV's X-FILES) and others. The head doctor is played by Kris Kristofferson (PAYBACK and THE JACKET). Unfortunately for Malloy and his fellow patients, it seems that someone might not be who they are supposed to be. Then, people begin dying in mysterious ways! With it's desolate, isolated location, blizzard conditions, rampant paranoia, and a murderer on the loose, EYE SEE YOU takes on elements of movies like THE SHINING and THE THING, combined w/ an \\"old dark house\\" atmosphere. A superb thriller / suspense story w/ horror trappings. Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a good cast","review":"There was absolutely no reason for them to cast Tom Berenger in this. It seemed like an insult to him, having a role that really has no significance in a movie. An extra could have played the part and given it the same feel. Sly didn't have to be in it either. The only reason why anybody watches a Stallone film is so they can watch him kill every one, or at least beat them up. Sly only killed one person in this film. I don't know if the ending was supposed to be a big surprise, but it really didn't matter anyway. It was ridiculous to even think that anybody would go to the d-tox center that they went to as well. Regardless of the fact that Stallone didn't really do a lot of violence to people, the R rating still reflects strong graphic violence/gore and profanity.

I am pretty happy with it.However, I should let you know - When we bought the monitor from the store (both times!) it looked white underneath the store's flourescent lighting. But when we got it home, it was this weird light pink color. It wasn't ugly or bad - just odd because it looked white in the store. I'm not sure if the same issue would apply if you bought it here, but it's just my experience. Maybe if you have a boy, it may be an issue. BUT - despite its color, this is a great monitor.

Nina Persson's voice does not not have the warmth that can be heard on their two recent albums, and she sings many of these songs with a \\"jazzy\\" approach.Unfortunately I wasn't aware that the album could also be found with 5 bonus tracks, so my version ends with \\"Closing Time\\" and a short hidden track; probably called \\"Life\\".The music is mostly a lot of fun; some tracks with unusual 5-beat rhythms. My favourites are the catchy \\"Daddy's Car\\", which is one of the more straight pop-rock tunes, and the lullaby type song \\"Beautiful One\\".The campy \\"Closing Time\\" with is slightly chaotic ending is also a favourite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarks Sandle","review":"As always Clarks never fails to deliver a quality product.

Why do you meditate in the first place? To relax and get things off your mind. With so many techniques taught in this book, the ironic result is I have too much information in my head to start meditating. Frankly, why do I have to read 150 pages before I can meditate? A shorter book has got to be the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Glad He Made It (the CD)!","review":"Roger Salloom has a powerful voice and easy sense of catchy tunes and lyrics.

She usually wears it on the tightest setting; there are 2 larger settings. Occasionally the bib will come undone from her wiggling against the back of her chair, but this is rare. This bib catches most food that falls as long as the high chair tray is not pushed too close to the scoop. The softness of the bib allows my daughter to reach around to self feed even though she is still quite small. The bib wipes clean or I clean it easily in the sink so it is ready for the next use. It rolls up easily to fit in the diaper bag for when we are on the go. We liked my daughter's so much, we bought 4 more bibs for the daycare where I work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bib!","review":"This bib is great for travel and easy clean up, but not as nice as the BabyBjorn bib.BabyBjörn Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice idea","review":"The bib is very convinient to use, it can be easily fold up, easy to clean too. The only problem is that our son doesn't like it, he starts to scream when we put it on. He is only 10 months old, but we already use the largest setting. The rim around the neck is not nearly as soft as with cloth bibs and it doesn't feel nice on the skin, to my opinion. If maybe it could be made with some other type of plastic on the neck area it would be definitely much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite the same","review":"We used to have kiddopotamus bib, which was from nice, soft rubber, this one is considerably stiffer, not so good.

It is super easy to clean up, just wipe and rinse. It dose a great job at catching the food and liquid that might otherwise end up on the lap or floor. It is made of 100% non-toxic FDA safe materials.Side note: once your child learns to dig into the reservoir to retrieve food the bib has a tendency to get a small rip along the sides of the reservoir, from the child pulling on it. This did not occur until well over a year with constant day-to-day use. This is the reason for the 4 stars, but this is still my favorite bib.I would not hesitate to buy this product again and would highly recommend the bibbity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choker bib","review":"I did not like this bib. The collar is hard to adjust around my baby's neck without choking her! It feels too hard and cuts into her neck. I regret buying it.

But this bib was way too uncomfortable for my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Bib We'll Use!","review":"This is the BEST bib out there. It last forever (even with a child who tends to bite things!), cleans easily in the sink or dishwasher (so we don't have to worry about the laundry!), rolls well to place in a diaper bag, and comes in several pleasant color choices. We have tried many other brands/styles of bib and won't buy anything else now! We've used it with two children, cousins, and will use again in the future with our newborn! Buy this bib!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great bib","review":"We have Twins and these bibs lasted for over a year before they started to rip. That is quite an accomplishment if you ask me! My daughter pulled on the bib constantly and was finally able to get it off when she turned 18 months old. I'm ordering my second set and would recommend these to any parent.

Clearly this is an attempt to write a more comprehensive screenply in a greek tragedy form.This film is the introduction of Smita Patil, in a supporting role to Shabana Azmi and Naseeruddin Shah, who are both outstanding. Also outstanding are Anant Nang and his brother in the film who play detestible sons of a brittle and arrogant father, Amrish Puri, a signature role for him. Kulbhushan is also well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful!","review":"This book is an excellent guide to building your vocabulary. The fact that it departmentalizes words into common topic areas is extremely helpful. This is great primarily because it allows readers to better understand the context of the words being learned. Many of the words presented may be familiar to the average person, however, I feel that this helps to make the learning process alot smoother in that it doesn't pressure the reader into feeling he or she should learn so much at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airbrushed Karen's voice","review":"Really disappointed in this remastered album. Karen's voice is softened and looses subtle emotional tones on every single song. Its like the Richard Carpenter, who remastered the album, looked at the subtle grain of her voice as grain on a digital pic so decided to air brush it. I know and love Karen's unique voice so like to listen too it as well as sing along with the songs. String instruments: They are also retouched and sound brighter. You may like that, I responded positively for a few seconds. But listening more, all the songs just moved to a bright Muzak direction and actually, though slight I will agree, de-emphasized Karen's voice - made it less center stage. Don't fix (re-interpret) what was not broken. The sounds of the \\"raw\\" earlier version is what you should track down and buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird, but in a good way","review":"This album is quite simply incredible.

All the songs here are excellent, with highlights being \\"For All We Know\\", \\"Rainy Days and Mondays\\", \\"A Place To Hideaway\\", and \\"Let Me Be The One\\". My favorite is \\"Superstar\\", one of the greatest Karen vocals ever recorded. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me back","review":"Nobody can sing like the Carpenters.

The game consists of you (a male) playing mini games to try and get the girl of your dreams.The mini games are fun and I found it hard to stop playing unless I couldn't beat something and got frustrated (some are pretty difficult). Though I do wish they had come up with more mini games and a longer story because the game is relatively short and they repeat some of the games.The whole game looks like a comic book - I really like the way they did it because it's different.

Bad Choice. This has got to be the dumbest game ever released. It is highly over rated and very short. After about 10 minutes of playing it I was ready to break out an atari and play pong. Thats about how much fun it is. I wont be surprised to find it in a clearance section of wal mart very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't like this game","review":"Not only do I hate the animation style and the fact that it's nothing but a bunch of mini-games put together but when you fail at whatever task and have to start again it takes too long.Yes, the animation looks good from a technical point of view but all people appear in silhouette. I don't feel any connection to the so-called 'story' because I am basically playing with what appears to be shop window mannequins. And the music is annoying as hell too.The focus of this game seems to concentrate far too much on how to incorporate the features of the Nintendo DS into the gameplay rather than making the gameplay any good, or bearable. Sega and Sonic Team should be ashamed for making a game this bland and bad. They should have spent the time and money on something much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game is for and one who used there brain more than once","review":"this could be so much fun for you if your realy cant get a date but its just a game so do get to happy lol so if you like rpg and like the long crud games that some people dont get go for it i cant say much but its great and the pics are cool but it realy for 13 or older if u ask me"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game stinks","review":"This game is the worst.

I found a lot of them for cheap at a used game store, and, more often than not, it means the game wasn't popular and was a waste of money for the people who got it.This is absolutely not the case for this game. It is an awesome, entertaining game that takes from WarioWare Touched! and actually gives it a story. What you do is play mini games in order to impress a girl with your spectacular stunts. Once you have completed a stage, it will be able to be played again and again in the Memories section. Plus, once you master it in the Memories section, it opens outfits for the girl you're trying to impress in Maniac mode.Drop the ten bucks and get this game.

Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"Coppershot consists of producer Copperpot and MC Longshot. Their debut is intelligent hip-hop with an edge; Copperpot's production is soulful and sample-based, while Longshot's excellent flow lays back behind the beat just right. You won't find any party jams here, as this is serious stuff. Your feet might not move, but your head will nod, as Copperpot satisfyingly layers horns, strings, keys, and gritty drums. Longshot's lyrics are both thoughtful and thought-provoking, and KRS One (where the heck has he been?) drops in for a welcome cameo. If you're tired of bling and coke raps, check this fine album out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Readers' Theatre in the library","review":"The Paper Dragon by Marguerite Davol is listed for readers age 4-8, but it works well with older children or students as a vehicle for Readers' Theatre. Dramatizing the roles of Mi Fei and the Dragon is not only fun but brings the story alive and can be done with few props. The illustrations with the foldout pages are not only beautifully done but the format provides a little mystery on each page which makes for a great read-aloud. The role of the humble artist as someone who represents a particular culture is actually a rather mature concept to present to children - The Paper Dragon does this effortlessly. Often artists are treated as strange or crazy in children's literature; it is refreshing to see that the artist here is portrayed as a problem solver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book","review":"The illustrations in this book are fabulous.

This game is terrible.\\" and went to bed.It is lacking in realism and excitement. It is along the line of an arcade game in that you point and shoot at a moving target which becomes very boring in a short period of time. The hype is that you will sense the battle itself but I felt as if I was very detached from the overall action. The graphics are poor and the game itself is totally lacking.

However, one should not overlook the amazing guitar work and the purely sublime voice of Nina. I saw them live in 1997, just before Lovefool made it worldwide, and they were the best live act i've seen other than the Prodigy. Their recent stuff is still great, but they've moved away from the sugar pop of Life. Easy listening pop tunes don't come any better than this. Heck, music doesn't come any better than this.

Determined to find it, today I purchased the Quickdraw II (at a premium price from a local sporting goods store) and headed back to the water. It was simple to set up, and I used my wife's ring as the test to see what reading the detector would spit out (gold 5 cent I think). After 30 minutes of sweeping the area (yes, it works underwater up until the electronic head), the Quickdraw II displayed the same reading it showed for my wife's ring, I felt down and sure enough I found my ring! This thing is a lifesaver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mid-Priced Metal Detector!

After doing a lot of research for a \\"real\\" metal detector as a gift for my teenage son, I found the features for the price made the QDII the clear choice.The QDII has features that are generally only found on higher priced units:* The LCD screen can indicate what type of metal has been found* Indicates approximate depth* The Notch Modes work well for filtering out most trash itemsWe have really enjoyed using this sensitive and accurate metal detector!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best MD for starting out........","review":"This is the first MD I've ever bought and I'm extremely pleased with how easy it is to use. Whith all the features this detector has, it is still user friendly. But, you need to read the instruction manual very carefully (maybe more than one time) to fully understant some othe more advanced features. You don't need to learn more than just turning it on and adjusting two dials, and your good to go.. This detector should provide all you'll need to get started. If at some point in the future you feel the need to upgrade, plan an spending at least double of what you paid for the Quick Draw II..Here is a Bounty Hunter web site that will provide answers to most all of your questions.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Happy with it.

Bradley started out explaining how we, as a society, separate between the living and non-living. This led to many topics on the subject of death, which was not appealing to me. He did, however, do a good job of explaining his thoughts, but it just wasn't an interesting topic I suppose. The author seemed to repeat many things throughout the book and didn't have a clear point, just to write about death. Overall I do not recommend this book, not only because of the content, but it is a little depressing reading about death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe the previous reviews","review":"I'll begin by saying that my cats have a voracious appetite.

Then I tried mixing it with a dry cereal that they love, NOPE, that didn't work either. So i allowed a good 20 hours go by without feeding them and again nothing. They would have starved before eating this stuff. The packaging is also what got me. They threw in a couple of cans they were dinged up and no labels.

It covers most of the major periods of extensive financial speculation; including the Japanese market of the 1980's, the crash of 1929, and the South Seas debacle.It certainly offers a solid historical base upon which to view today's seemingly maniacly environment; one in which the Nasdaq sports an average P/E ratio of 175 and companies that have never made a penny in profits boast multi-billion dollar market caps."},{"rating":"2","title":"The boom and bust cycle is inevitable except in the middle of a very long boom","review":"Great history but don't expect to find any clues about how deep and long our current recession will be. In relating this interesting history of numerous market collapses, recessions and depressions Edward Chancellor makes it clear that distinguished economists, even with the benefit of hindsight, are still divided about the cause and effect of these disastrous events and the government actions that were actually effective in bringing on recovery. The author's description of how, during long periods of prosperity, time and again, a belief in the end of the business cycle starts to take hold in society and that people as important as Alan Greenspan are subject to delusions (moving \\"beyond history\\") like that is disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it says it is","review":"I read this book for a Finance book club. Although it is probably not one I would immediately have picked up on my own I did find it quite interesting. It is EXACTLY what it claims to be - a history of financial speculation. With 2 exceptions - the tulip bulbs and Japan, it is a history of speculation in English speaking areas - mostly England and the US. It does a good job in the begining of explaining the causes of speculation (they are the same every time.) That is the one downside to this book, after you read the first couple of chapters, they all read almost exactly the same! It gets a bit dull after a while. If you are interested in finance or more especially speculation, this is a very interesting and enjoyable book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and not the whole story","review":"This book is not that good. First is it a fairly dry history. The stories of the manias and bubbles that make up the book are fascinating times with fascinating people but the tales told here are dry and better told elsewhere.The subtext in the book, that we are in a mania and bubble today, is important and reasonable. A more important, relevant and interesting subject are the stories of other transitional times in history, like the introduction of the railroad, the car, the telephone, the printed page or the industrial revolution. Comparing those times to the introduction of the Internet would be more valuable or at the least should not omitted completely from the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please - No More Footnotes","review":"I'm fairly shocked by the extensive number of 5 star ratings for this book. This book is quite painful to read, but not because the stories are tragic or the warnings frightening. Though the messages contained within are important, the author rambles incoherently and the extensive use of footnotes is overly distracting. The footnotes for many pages are longer than the primary text and should have been incorporated into the main story line. Chancellor is in need of an editor with an iron fist toward readability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting lessons worth taking to heart","review":"I read this book a while back. This is a history of speculative bubbles. It is stunning that since the beginning of the establishment of the financial market abuses and excess crop up with stunning regularity. In the long sweep of financial history Chancellor has found the regular pattern that market participants are under the delusion that \\"this time its different\\". This conclusion does ring true in our time as we are just coming out of the derivatives debacle of 2008-2009. With every technological achievement both financial and embodied we come to these sorts of traps.Will financial markets fail and fail every so often? President Barrack Obama said that the financial reforms he and his congress put in place will end all financial crisis. It is doubtful, and not because of his failings. If we are to learn from the conclusions reached by Chancellor, then this book deserves to be read by you and a five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"sobering and entertaining","review":"The author brings broad experience, and deep knowledge to the subject. He writes extremely well, managing to be both scholarly and entertaining. He supplies generous quotes and footnotes, including many from contemporary writers, thinkers, and participants. I have read more than 50 books on investing in the past couple years and this one is a must read. As the well respected and also erudite William Bernstein has noted, a knowledge of investing / market history is one of the four prerequisites to becoming a successful individual investor. Investors, read this book and you will be wary of the recurring frauds and excessive enthusiasms that would be dangerous to your financial security.

Most striking is the many parallels and the never ending belief of speculators in a \\"new\\" era, where old measures, a good biz plan, earnings and profits for a company (or \\"fundamentals\\") can be easily neglected for promises in the future due to a \\"new economy\\" where everything has changed.

It comes from three different albums not his whole collection. I think it could of had more songs on than it does but the one's on it are good.

It would have taken very little programing to make this stinker O.K. No target range, no practice runs, not even a map to see where you're are headed. Twenty-five missions was a very magic number during the air war over Germany, here, Twenty-five is just another number. After Deer hunter 4 I had high hopes... Oh, well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no variety","review":"This is a bad game. There is NO variety; you go up against the same fighters every time after the 10th mission. All the targets look almost the same from 4 miles high and when the bombs go off all you see is the same target with a little smoke on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain fun!","review":"No reading large tech manuals. No real flight modelling to worry about. Just shoot and watch your ammunition, as the waves of fighters attack your formation! (BTW don't shoot the other aircraft in your formation and that goes for your aircraft too!) You can switch gunnery positions during flight. You also act at the Bombardier and drop the bombs on the target. (Yes, you get the adjust the aircraft just as \\"they\\" did.)

I think the sound was ok. But still.....not fun....."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like arcade games.....","review":"...then you'll like this game. I installed it, played it once, uninstalled it. I like combat flight sims of all types, and figured this was a gunner sim. Wrong. No comparison to gunning in B-17 2, for instance. The targets just cycle back and forth by your guns for you to shoot at. If you're inexperienced at sims, and/or new to gunning, give it a shot if that's worth [price] to you. If you're used to reality-type sims, you're probably going to be turned off by this game. Great for kids, though, probably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conover does it again","review":"This is a great book, period. An in depth look into the lives of corrections officers and criminals, this book reminds us that there are actual human beings working and living behind those locked gates. Conover's journalistic style and carefully documented observations lend a glaring light of authenticity and make for an interesting read. Prison life is an aspect of everday existence that is not often thought about seriously by those on the outside. This book changes that and raises important questions that either require significant soul-searching to validate views on this issue, or a whole new outlook. Conover's writing style has clearly matured since \\"Coyotes\\" and makes this book a treat to read. I can't wait for his next project!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling Detail","review":"If you are sentenced to prison, the state will take away your right to decide when you have a shower. Sure, a lot of other stuff will happen also, none of it nice, but for some reason being deprived of this liberty seems particularly degrading. The prisoners who Ted Conover oversaw during his ten monthes in Sing Sing obviously thought so, as they seemingly spent much of time he was there wheedling extra shower privileges from him.With such mundane detail Conover strips away much of the sensationialism and perverse romanticism from prision life, revealing an existence that for corrections officers (don't ever say guards) and prisoners alike is 99% boredom, and 1% sudden violent stress.Conover humanizes both COs and inmates, and raises, but does not address, the question of whether the system can be considered anything other than an abject failure.Well written, fascinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I can't believe these guys (corrections officers) put up with the stuff they do. It takes nerves of steel to work in a place like that. The book was very entertaining. At times I could not put it down. Also recommended : Nine-o Adam, Another Day in Paradise, Junky, Slaughter House Five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough job in a tough place!","review":"I've read Conover's other books, too, and this one, like the others, has the clear ring of truth. His writing is essentially a dramatic diary of his months as a new CO ( corrections officer ) with occasional asides on the history of Sing Sing and of American penology. I thought the book showed a fair balance of critique for the current system without romanticizing the prisoners or their plight. Likewise, the other CO's and the pressures they endure each day were portrayed with empathy and an understanding how the job can be brutalizing. Fortunately for us, Conover is too smart to suggest that any easy alternative exists for this horrifying institution. A fascinating read! END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book overall","review":"I'm about half way through the book now. I have to say that I enjoy the insider look into the prison.. although so far I can't say anything has been particularly surprising. As such, I don't feel I have really learned all that much yet. Nevertheless, Conover's writing style is informal and inviting, making this an easy and interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conover learned nothing in 1 year....","review":"Conover seems to learn nothing in 1 year on the job. You can't be running scared and still be an effective Correctional Officer. No doubt that he didn't have proper control of the situations or the inmates. Conover seems to focus on the plight of the poor inmates, victims of society. He feels sorry for the inmates. Inmates are in prison because of their choices and behavior. Prison is not the first stop for most inmates. This book gets rather tiring for people who work in the corrections field and know what it is really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, very insightful...","review":"Having never worked as a prison guard, this book does an excellent job of describing what it would be like to become an NYC Corrections Officer for those of us who aren't one. Amazing insights into not only officers, but the prison system in general. A very interesting and great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This undercover account delivers what it promises","review":"This book will satisfy some of the curiosity that people have about what goes on inside prisons. Bear in mind that you'll only get an officer's perspective (of course, that's the only one he can give), and no so much of the inmates' sides. For this reason, many of the anecdotes seem incomplete... but you might find them to be complete enough. Almost all of it kept me interested. It is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Respect","review":"I have to give the author credit. When he was denied the right to shadow a C.O. (Corrections Officer), he became one. This is not as simple as it sounds. He literally swore an oath to protect the inmates and the lives of his fellow officers. He worked the job with dedication, and got some great material out of it. I was wary, because I thought he might have been playing C.O. But, working in Sing Sing, you don't \\"play\\" anything. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"This book is daring, unusual, and--though I have never worked in a prison--seems to me exceptionally fair.

Interspersed within the narrative are segments on the evolution of incarceration in America, the way the architecture of Sing Sing reflects the development of \\"corrections consciousness\\", an excellent history of the death penalty in the context of that prison, useful data on prison populations. A good text for basics in \\"crime and punishment\\", excellent first-person narrative from the outside of the bars; thought-provoking and vivid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for your boss!","review":"I wish this book had come out a few years ago: I would have given it to my last boss. He was inspired as a leader and devoted to our organization's mission. However, he created an environment in which hierarchy dictated all relationships and communication. As a result, lots of great people left after only a few years. Had this book been out then, I would have gotten it for him as a holiday gift. It offers focused analysis of pitfalls that characterized our organization, why and how those pitfalls cause so much damage, and how to repair them and create a new corporate culture. Hopefully others will be able to benefit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone remotely interested in magic","review":"This book is a collection of silly, obvious tricks requiring nothing but the most primitive sleight-of hand. I bought this book when I was first starting out in magic, but even with little experience I understood the worthlesness of these effects.

Powerful ideas get an airing. With examples simple enough to convey easily the meanings to most readers. He introduces you to the Einstein summation convention, and the use of contravariant and covariant vectors, along with the covariant derivative.This edition seems geared towards applications in General Relativity. Though the chapter on Newton's Law shows how tensors can be used in material science deriving from classical physics, like with the use of the stress tensor.The exercises in each chapter are fairly numerous. Most should not be too hard to the reader. Note that no answers are supplied in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the most important CD of the 90's","review":"One thing, I remember Essra when I was a teen in Visiting NYC/Greenwich Village.

I am a Bible college graduate and have served in various roles in ministry for nearly 20 years. Nevertheless this book opened up new ways of looking at common life problems and issues and how to help resolve those with the proper focus on God's truth.I think the title of the book could be \\"Finding and keeping joy in your life by learning to follow God the way he designed\\" On second thought that seems a little long....:)Buy this book regardless of the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin Lloyd-Jones is never out of date","review":"Though the information in the book is excellent, it can be a little hard to read.

For example, it talks about a bulla, pustule, etc. and it's diameter and whether or not it is pus-filled but there are NO PICTURES!!! Also, the summary should be more of a chart than just more words. I did not like how there are multiple columns to a page, either, since when you're tired and hungry it can be confusing.

Almost 2 months later, I have still not gotten my camcorder back. I've called the repair facility numerous times (you have to leave a message on a recorder) to check on the status and my calls were not returned. I've also called Panasonic directly and routinely get the \\"it's not our problem attitude.\\" Every time I ask to speak to a manager they disconnect me.

Even the arrangement of buttons is perfect with the zoom, photoshot and menu buttons in easy reach. The 3.0 inch LCD display is a big advantage over the 2.5 inch display found in other comparable camcorder models. I would say the best part of this camera is its excellant video and infrared capabilities.

Balto risks averything, including his own life to save the town of Nome, Alaska. Despite the fact that he is an outcast and has few friends who believe in him, Balto follows his heart and his never-ending spirit to save the children and find out where he really belongs. I have fallen in love with this movie! It is a splendid and dramatic animated film that will take your breath away. The animation is amazing and the characters are bursting with unique personality. This movie has a wonderful story line and best of all, the characters don't sing an annoying song every 15 minutes! (we all hate that, don't we?) I give the movie 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!

There are many great character training opportunities in the movie, especially in teaching how to persevere in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

We learned (and its in websites all over the internet) that unlike the movie says, Balto gets all the credit for running the serum to the town in need, when really the dog that deserves the credit was named Togo. Togo was a dog owned by Lenard Sepalla. Spalla, with Togo as his lead dog, was the one who made the longest journey to deliever the serum. Spalla's assistant favored Balto and as part of the run he used Balto as his lead dog. The assistant happend to miss the place where he was to drop the serum off and just kept going to the town which was not far away. Balto gets almost all the credit for doing practically nothing when Togo gets almost none of the credit for doing practically everything!

Such a lovely family film that all ages can enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Balto is entertaining and enjoyable!","review":"I love Balto, and always have. I especially like it because it REALLY happened in real life. It has great animation and I love the goose! I like how Balto and Jenna have pups in the end(so cute!!!) It's kind of romantic(in a cartoony way) because she's a purebred lady who marries this halfbreed mutt who loves adventure. The only thing is, you're gonna half to explain to little kids why Steel is so mean. Little kids tend to talk more about the bad guys then the good one's for some reason....hmmm. But, be ready for alot of twists and turns in the lovable family adventure filled movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie ROX!!!","review":"Balto is one of the BEST movies of all time! Although Kevin Bacon's voice doesnt really fit Balto,its still great! Steele is a wonderful bad guy!! Hes cool! His voice is superbly suited to his looks and character!!! Jenna is GREAT too!! The best scenes are the moments between Steele and Jenna,the part where they go for the Medicine. You will LOVE this movie! Better than any Disney cause there is NO singing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Masterpiece","review":"This is the story of Balto, an outcast of the town of Nome because of his wolf heritage. He is teased and taunted by everyone in the town except Boris, Jenna, and Muk and Luk. When the town is plagued by a disease, Balto races to find his enemy, Steele, who is miles off the trail home. When things look bleakest, Balto is reminded by a familiar soul to look inside himself and release his despair and fears.This is based on a true story but the real hero was all dog and already on a sled team. It also includes some live action scenes from a suvivor during the 1925 epidemic. A funny, heartwarming tale of a true hero, Balto is one of the best action movies around,but never got the recognition it deserved. Balto was honored with a bronze statue placed in Central Park and his body is still on display in Cleveland, Ohio, his birthplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I have a Siberian husky and when I show this movie to my kids they instantly loved it because it is a movie about sled dogs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be a better film!","review":"This is a really good movie.I've been watching it for as long as I can remember.It's about a dog (part wolf)who is an outcast in Nome,Alaska.He's friends with a Russian snow goose called Boris (the funniest character in the movie) and 2 polar bears called Muk and Luk who can't swim.He's also in love with a dog called Jenna, and there's a villian called Steele.When a disease strikes (with Jenna's owner, Rosie, among the sick) and the sled team sent to get the anti-toxin is lost, Balto must find and rescue the team and face avalanches,icicle falls and (of course) Steele.A brilliant movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cats did not like the taste","review":"I am sure it is a great cat food - but my five cats did not like the cat food.

He has written many very good songs over the years, but this album is sadly not one of his better. The main problem is that the material is quite flat and can't be saved by Carey's great voice. To me it seems as Carey lack enthusiasm on too many songs. But it's not all bad, in fact the song \\"No man's land\\" is in my opinion so good it's easily worth the money. Then you got some songs that stands out a bit from the rest: \\"Heard it on the radio\\", \\"For you\\" and \\"I can't talk to you\\". This is an album you have to play time after time, since there's no immediate tunes (except \\"No man's land) that will capture your attention.I'd say that \\"For you\\" is an album worth having, but it might not be the best first choice. Try to get \\"Storyville\\" - that's Tony Carey in his prime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I complete my sixth Mission...Finally","review":"at last !!I finished watching the sixth season of Mission Impossible, in this season I can saw another character, because in previous seasons the cast change after the third.I remember in the third season and so the current change all the characters.I remember in the third season to present some of the characters change, for example in the third season Martin landau and Barbara Bain leaving the show in its place came Mr Spock (Leonard Nimoy) from the Star Trek Tee Vee Show for the fourth Season.In the fifth season fifth with Lesley Ann Warren and Sam Elliott.

Ronnie sounds very fresh and vibrant on these tracks. I think \\"Darlin'\\" was a poor choice for a lead off single. I would have chosen \\"Here Today,Gone Tomorrow\\" written by the Ramones. The weakest track I feel is \\"Happy Birthday Rock'n'Roll\\".There are several tributes in this track to Phil Spector,but the song is rather long and painful in most parts.But the rest of the tracks are very enjoyable which is why I rated it 5 stars.Now if only someone would release it to disc it would make me very happy.All & all this is a fun disc to listen to!**********************UPDATE:I went to the website of its about music and was able to order the actual CD and it's very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUS !","review":"This death-metal band from Liverpool is worst than Cannibal Corpse (if that is possible! ) THe lyrics are ridiculous, the songs poor.

Whilst the lyrics are undecipherable when being sung (cleverly, the group use manual 'double-tracking', with one vocalist delivering vocals in a low growl) there's a lyrics sheet. To my non-metal-trained ears this sounds almost like ambient music, but louder - only 'Cadaveric incubator of endoparasites' stands out, as for the first minute it is almost chaotic jazz music. Musically, it's essentially the opposite of Lloyd Cole. The drum sounds are very dated-sounding, but the guitars are extremely loud and it rocks like a brick wall. It's also available in extended for, with the 'Reek of Putrefaction' EP and a revolting cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and elegant presentation.","review":"If you are only going to invest in one book -- this should be the one!

Initially all metal mode works fine, however, after half an hour of use the batteries begin to wear out and the battery low indicator does not come on. When all metal mode is used after half an hour of the detector's use, it just squeals uncontrollably. It's supposed to go off over metal and pin point the source of your initial find with great accuracy. Again, after thirty minutes of use of the detector, it will no longer go off over the source, it will just go off constantly, no mater where you hold it. I could hold it into the air and it still squeals. I made every adjustment I could and it just continues to make noise. This mode is worthless unless your using it with two fresh 9 volt batteries every half an hour. Finally, if you're hunting say meteorites for four hours, you can expect to spend over $56.00 on batteries for that afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute for play","review":"When my 3 year old wants to dress as a pirate, this is an easy way to do it, Cute and easy to hold onto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my dogs!","review":"I can't tell you how many harnesses and collars I've tried.

Not as bad as when they're wearing a regular collar but they definately pulled. I have a Jack Russell and a Beagle. Also, my Jack still coughed and sputtered some when she pulled.

I think that it might work for smaller dogs but it's positioned where most of the dog's power is - in the front quarters. It does nothing to control his head - you can't stop them from sniffing or paying attention to things you want them to ignore. Luckily he was behaving himself on the walk and didn't pull too much, but I don't think he could care less that it was on and if we would have been in a more populated area I think it would have been bad bad news."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it, I think...","review":"It's been a long time since I read this, so I don't remember a lot.

I am a frequent visitor to Russia and I enjoyed the oportunity to compare and contrast Russia today with postwar Russia under Stalin. Unfortunately, Robert Capa's photos in the 1999 paperback are small and muddy. I could not even recognize places that I have visited many times. This book was a collaborative effort, but the 1999 printing seriously short changes Capa's contribution.I don't know if the images are better in the 2001 paperback or the Kindle version, but after reading the 1999 edition I got a copy of the 1948 hardback via Amazon.

It is written for those have just made a commitment to Christ and need direction for their next steps. But I have been a believer for 25 years and found his thoughts to be helpful and refreshing.

Some tracks are cajun/swing/rockabilly/ska/punk, and one track sounds like old Bad Religion with horns. Other tracks remind me of some older Suicide Machines. All in all, this CD absolutely rocks, and it is one of the few CD's out there that I can actually listen to and enjoy.

And the real standouts are Road Rash,(one of the best songs I have ever heard)The Gentleman, No Hope, Monkeys and Econoline. I just recently saw the Mad Caddies live at Reading Festival and I have to say that they are the best live. If you want a mixture of ska and punk (also polka and reggae)get Duck and Cover.

The number of words it includes is quite limited, and it will not suffice to read most Uzbek texts. For that purpose, the Uzbek-English dictionary of Karl Krippes, which has considerably broader coverage, is preferable.The Waterson dictionary does have one real advantage, however, and that is that most of the entries have sample sentences in Uzbek to illustrate usage of the words in question, accompanied by their English equivalents. Thus a learner of Uzbek can simply dip into the dictionary at random, look up a word of interest, and see it used in a sentence. This is useful for learning vocabulary, and thus even though the book's coverage is a bit too limited to serve as a useful reference when reading, it still can play a useful role in helping you assimilate new words, especially in the earlier stages of learning Uzbek."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Eric Clapton's Lover\\" and Other Stories","review":"This collection presents some of the best fiction published in the Virginia Quarterly Review - or anywhere - during the past twenty-five years.

The tracks were recorded live at the Copenhagen Jazzhouse on November 21, 2004. The album runs about 50 minutes.The obvious comparison is to John Medeski, and there's plenty of that going on -- but \\"Formula\\" is pure Jimmy Smith, and \\"The Tuxen Shuffle\\" reads like a tribute to Jack McDuff. There's something for everyone here, and the beauty is that it strings together nicely. It's a cohesive album that will appeal to organ fans, to Ray Anderson freaks, or even to jam-band followers.

Most current DVD players can handle this fine, with some converting the output to NTSC and others simply passing the PAL to the TV. Many modern TVs will handle a PAL signal, but not all.Finally, although they are \\"digitally remastered\\", the video quality isn't great.

But the one thing that stands out here are the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"a metal classic","review":"Incredible album, along with heartwork.

Why do so many \\"fans\\" mistake fast and furious for talented? And consider good songwriteing selling out? True it's not heartwork..But it's still definetly Carcass. To bad we'll never know what could have come next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold a candle to earlier work","review":"Alot of people either love or hate this lp. I gaveHeartwork a decent write up but this is pushing it forme. Song writing is boring, the lyrics are terrible,the guitar playing is cool and even the production iscool but this is way too mid tempo for my tastes.

I THINK THIS ALBUM IS INCREDIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than most bands, but still poor for Carcass ...","review":"Let me start by saying Carcass is one of my personal favorite bands, and way cool in an underground way. Once you get into this band you're hooked as you start realizing all the different layers of creativity and occasional bits of genius. With that being said this effort is pretty poor for Carcass. Almost everything that made this band intellectually interesting is gone and replaced with the kind of simplistic music most garage bands can play. Indeed, I've heard this album a thousand times ... from a thousand generic opening local bands.Quite frankly I'm glad they broke up after this album, and a part of me wishes they broke up just before. Don't give up on Carcass though, just get one of the better earlier albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't CARCASS!!","review":"This by far is the worst album carcass has ever done. Boring riffs and boring everything. If you are looking for an album that puts you to sleep right away, or forever as a matter of fact, this is the album for you. Heartwork blows this album away by a loooooong shot. I cannot stand one song on this album. This was no album to leave their fans with, I feel so cheated. If you want good metal, check out Micheal Amott's new band Arch Enemy, they bring back memories of the old Carcass. This album REEKS OF PUTREFACTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please no more","review":"I can't believe they kept the same name. This sounds like Dokken with a typical black metal vocalist.

Farewell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad record","review":"This was an illfated attempt by carcass to capture part of the market for alternative music created by the whole grunge thing. This created the only carcass album that can be described as truly bad.

Im still in shock that i used to like carcass if thats them! Don't buy it unless you like mediocre music.

Well, among all other heavy items, Amazon threw 4 spark plug without any packing material. End result- car shakes at idle and check engine light comes up every now and then. Reset ECU and same thing happened. I pretty much ended a solid part of a weekend troubleshooting the plugs, eventually gave up and put back original Denso plugs and returned these NGK plugs to amazon. 2 * for not giving me any trouble with the return.

When house music had soul and rhythm. If you liked Mr. Fingers \\"Introduction\\" album you will thoroughly enjoy this listening experience. If you are not into chicago styled house this is an introduction into what it was (not repetitive beats with limited vocals). There are some other classics such as \\"Martins Disco circus\\", kano's \\"I'm ready\\", & Hugh Masekelas \\"Don't go lose it baby\\" that would make excellant complements to \\"The musics got me\\". All in all this is a proven starting point if you want to kick it to an old school house groove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triple Threat: The Best For The Buck","review":"The three albums this boxset contains are quite possibly the three best that Judas Priest ever put out. Priest has had heavier, and faster albums since, but none can compare to the gestalt they created on these three. British Steel put them on the map with Breaking the Law and Living After Midnight, two instant classics as soon as they were pressed into vinyl. Point Of Entry, though not as commercially successful, is full of lost gems. Solar Angels and Desert Plains were innovative for their time and great driving songs. Screaming For Vengeance made them heavy metal heroes. Every song on that album has been played on hard rock radio stations across the world. I highly recommend getting this, not only does it document the rise of British Heavey metal in the late 70's and early 80's, but these albums are all timeless and can be redicovered by younger metal fans over and over. For [the price] of a cd, this deal can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motherload of Knowledge","review":"I read some of the negative reviews and decided I had to write my own.

I am always improving my craft. Each costume gets better and better and yet the ones in this book seem very amatuer. There was not much attention given to details.

I just think better costumers could have been found and perhaps a little less detail given to the woman's bosom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average Book with some cool pictures","review":"This book is really like a kid's picture book than an adult reference book. It shows some good pictures (maybe that will give ideas for your costumes) but that's about all it does. It appears that this was some grad-student's project that just happened to get published.

It was great for someone like us who have little dance experience and who want to learn the basic steps. It didn't provide us with much we could use immediately on the dance floor but it did provide a base for us to start from. That is very important. Some of the videos and classes assume you know more than you do. We were very impressed and plan to buy more of his videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling short","review":"Although the video does have some of the very basic steps for some dances it falls short of teaching anyone how to dance with any real confidence. The video only gives the very basic steps, not enough to feel comfortable at any event where adults may be dancing. The video is not money well spent, even for those of us with two left feet! Use the money towards some group lessons; they are much more fun, inexpensive, and you'll learn a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Better Than The Original","review":"This review concerns the revised 1966 edition. Frank and Joe help their father investigate for a shipping line which suspects that the owner of a valuable Egyptian treasure is trying to defraud their insurance company by claiming that the treasure was aboard their freighter, the Katawa, when it sank off Whalebone Island near Bayport. Also, Frank and Joe are haunted by the ghost of a pirate said to have haunted Whalebone Island years ago. This book sounds like it shouldn't be bad, but for whatever reason I never found that I was very interested in it. Very few of the chapter endings left me with the feeling that I had to read more. That said, for anyone who is going to read this title, read the revised edition because it is better than the original, which completely lacked a mystery and was really nothing more than an adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good transaction and prompt shipping.

Not the Grosset & Dunlap edition with the picture of the boys in their boat by a light house!While I generally prefer the original texts over the re-written books of the 1960's, this one is an exception. This early text edition dwells on the deep-sea diving craze of the late 1930's. Not Scuba-diving (scuba tanks were not yet in use), but diving with an airhose attached to a pump on the boat.The bottom line is that there is almost no mystery to this book, it is a dated adventure book about diving. If you have an interest in diving you will enjoy this trip back in time. If you enjoy a good mystery you will have trouble getting through this.The revised text of the 1960's is MUCH MUCH BETTER!

She tells us background information on every topic that comes up in the book and since the main characters are newspaper reporters there are many topics that have nothing to do with the main story line. Not only are we treated to information on surfing, internet dating, how e-mail works, how newspapers work (in great detail) we are also given background on recent current events, such as who Martha Stewart is. Anyone who ever turns on the t.v. or reads a paper will know most of this stuff, but the author presents it like a high school kid doing a research report. Plus there appears to have been very little editing because half the time the information is repeated a few chapters or paragraphs later. The plot moves very slowly.

Also, if you use a pinpointer (I recommend the Garrett ProPointer), you will be taking these off and puting them back on constantly.So...they work well, but I wish there was a better solution. I have ordered an adaptor so my iPod headphones will fit...only problem is, I won't have any volume control (no, your iPod headphone volume control controls your IPOD, and will not control the detector).

Park, a Mr. Universe and a well-spoken, elegant man in real life, is, like Steve Reeves, exceptionally handsome, but wooden beyond belief. That said, these pictures are worth a quick look. There is something almost touchingly naive in their technical inepititude. Though made by grownups, they reflect the deepest wishes of teenage aboys everywhere.

Larry Lowenthal perfectly captures the anguish of watching an enterprise develop with all hopes of wealth and success only to witness it's eventual demise as it's proprietor sinks on the ill-fated Titanic. His lyrical writing style as he describes the sinking of the Titanic is pure poetry.

It was a simple yet tasty dish, and I would not have guessed the oysters were from a can.I then decided to try to reproduce the dish, and ordered these and a set of the Roland's boiled oysters. As it turns out, I haven't yet used these in cooking, but I've had these as snacks several times. They're actually good straight out of the can, just salty enough, and if you add some condiments (e.g. Wan Ja Shan hot steak sauce) it's like eating real food - a perfect snack when you want something more than a snack but not quite a meal.I prefer these to the Roland's boiled oysters in a can... not much difference in the contents, but these are cheaper and don't require a can opener to open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price!","review":"Excellent product, Fast shipping, and a Great price.

I remember one message in the book which particularly caught my attention and made me realize how inexperienced I was at understanding and responding to someone else's grief. It was about trying to eat even when you don't want to -- and it said something comforting about it being OK if you just had a cup of hot soup as you stood at the window looking out. Many of the other empathetic expressions of sympathy on the loss of a loved one reminded me of my mother's experience on her loss of her soul mate - and I finally understand.

He was also an Academy Award-winning actor who starred in some of Hollywoods most stellar movies. This book simply doesn't do justice to Bing, his life, talent or the monumental impact he had upon popular culture.The Bing biography to own and cherish is Gary Giddon's recent Bing book, available on Amazon.

If I didn't know already that this was a mystery novel, I'd have no clue thus far (no pun intended). Clearly, all the plot is doing is introducing us to possible suspects for the crime that will occur who knows when. No first-time mystery novelist would be this relaxed with his or her plotting. Kemelman is a good craftsman, and \\"Resigned\\" is definitely readable. But I finally had to ask myself if my time could be better spent, and just how long was I willing to hold out until something, anything, happened?For superior suspense writing (as opposed to \\"whodunit\\" mysteries), I highly reccomend James Lee Burke's series of Dave Robicheaux novels, starting with \\"The Neon Rain.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Even more rambling than most of the Rabbi Small books","review":"Rabbi Small wants to start a new career before it's too late, and sets his sights on teaching.

I surely hope my girls, when they do get to that age, are interested in helping others, living with integrity and developing their own passions.

Having watched all the previous barbie movies serveral times we were hoping for another good story. A Fairy Secret is similar to A Fashion Fairytale in that this is a story starring Barbie as herself rather than telling a story. There really wasn't an age appropriate plot as the story was basically about a jealous boyfriend stealing fairy. The movie didn't flow well at all. It reminded me of a soap opera the way the scenes transitioned between Barbie and Ken. Honestly Ken was the best part of the movie with his small wings and humorous lines.

It's the 21st century; surely it is time to move away from the stereotype that shopping is the only thing on young women's minds. The writing and plot are insipid(\\"Gloss Angeles?\\") and the quality of the animation is poor. We've not seen the other movies, but I've read two of the books to my daughter; they were equally awful. Mattel is ruining their Barbie franchise with these poor-quality products.Disney did a fantastic job with fairies; both the movies and the books are excellent.

Anyway's I really enjoyed this movie but did feel as though it was somewhat rushed & a combination of the some the other barbie movie's mixed all in one.But overall very entertaining & enjoyable.

The last movie, Fashion Fairy Tale and this movie Fairy Secret have been true disappointments. Additionally, the animation, voices, and overall quality have not been quite the same.

I was originally drawn to TM by news reports of lowered blood pressure and stress reduction in practicers The book's emphasis on all the wonderful things you get, with very little effort, and very little detail on how, smacked, just a bit, of secret societies and too-good-to-be-true, $1000, instant-fixs.And, to be honest, I wasn't looking for a sales tool, I was looking for a how-to, so I feel a little silly and a little duped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this comprehensive introduction to the Transcendental Meditation Technique","review":"Very informative and easy to read.

Not only on this album, but others, where the music and liner notes are riddled with \\"new world order\\" and anti-America propaganda, blaming America for an impending apocaplypse and cheering on the 9/11 attacks. My personal politics are left, but all of this is too much to take, especially from hate-mongering Canadians who don't even live here (and yet choose to record half their material in Chicago).I'm sure this CD is always in Osama Bin Laden's rotation, but it sure isn't going to be in mine. Go with Sigur Ros instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it","review":"Three tracks totalling over an hour is just the first sign that you're headed towards something big. Big doesn't even describe what this album is. Enormous, epic and prodigious might be better descriptions of this album, but they still can't quite adequately portray what f#a# has in store for you.Please please get this album. Don't just listen to it, immerse yourself in it. Shut off the lights and the telephone and let the the music take you to a place you probably wouldn't really like to see in real life. The songs are incredibly dark, and very draining to listen to. But its worth it, if you can invest the time commitment. Don't cut this album short by just listening to one track. You must experience the entire 3 songs to get the full effect of that this album has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"The samples provided for these songs just don't give them justice, there is so much variety within each individual song. GYBE give us 15 + minute apocalyptic epics, which somehow have so much hope in them (I can't really describe it).This is definitely one of thoses discs that many will listen to once and then never put it on again (but don't let that happen to you). After a couple repeated listenings with headphones you won't be able to get enough of it. These songs will haunt you.If they ever come to your town, don't miss them, they do a crazy show with movies that play in the background with the music (it's really beyond description).Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total desolation","review":"\\"We're all trapped inside the belly of this horrible Machine, and the Machine is bleeding to death.\\" - this is an excerpt from the opening monologue of this haunting masterpiece of doom.

I have never been able to listen to nor look at this the same way again.It's a flawless piece of musical work and one that should and must be listened to, to fully appreciate. The vast epicness of the album is something that I can't even begin to think about describing.

GREAT MYSTERY!!!","review":"This book was suspense filled, it was a shocker, it's not going to get out of your hands until you've read every last word.Connor's friend, Branwell's, little sister is hurt. The 911 call (on the back cover) shows a usually talkative Branwell stays silent, while a female British voice explains that he dropped little Nikki. When he goes to the Behavoir place, he stays silent for about 20 days. This mystery, not led by your typical Sherlock & Watson (13-year-old & half-sister), takes many twists & turns, guided by a guy who isn't even speaking.I give this 4 1/2 stars instead of five because I got confused during the first parts. Otherwise, you simply should pick up this page-turning mystery/occasionaly humorous book right away. No, really. Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST","review":"I think this book was stupid unless you want to take up time its good for that. thats why i gave 2 stars otherwise it was stupid.i thought it was stupid because branwell is suspected of hurting his baby half sister so he desides not talk because he is ashamed of being seduced by the baby sitter and she the who hurt his baby half sister so he's juvenile behavioral center,suspected of a horrible crime he did't do and won't tell what relly happened so his best friend connor try's to get something out of him but he won't talk so connor remember the story of the paralyzed frenchman who wrote a whole book with the blink of his left eye they used that for communication.I think thats stupid because branwell is not paralyzed. after a while he desides to talk and the baby sitter loses her job the baby lives.the end"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not exellent","review":"Being an avid Koningsburg reader, I enjoyed Silent to the Bone, but I thought that many parts of the book were confusing, or could have been done with better editing. I adored the relationship between Conner and Margaret. I thought that Koningsburg should have simplified many aspects of family connections, but have gone into greater detail about Margaret and Branwell's relationship.She did a fabulous job with Margaret and Conner's relationships. I loved hearing about Branwell's backround."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasons to read Silent to the Bone","review":"This is a wonderful book. When I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The plot is well done and everything is organized in a way that isn't all that noticeable at first.

This book deserves a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"moving, smart story","review":"Branwell Zamborska's baby sister Nikki is in a coma. No one knows what happened except Vivian, the English au pair, and Branwell. Vivian got on the line that day and said that Branwell dropped the baby, so he's in a juvenile detention center. Branwell hasn't said anything since the Nikki stopped breathing. Connor, his best friend, doesn't believe that Branwell is really guilty, so he starts visiting and trying to communicate with him. Piece by piece Connor finds out what really happened that day, but he has to find enough evidence to get Branwell out of there. This is a great \\"serious\\" book that's light enough to appeal to young adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...weak ending.","review":"Silent to the Bone was a good book. I couldn't put it down, but the ending, in a way, was kinda perdictible. When I reached the end, I was kinda upset of how it turned out. If there was a sequel to this book, I would probably buy it. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moms perspective","review":"I would reccommend this book for ages 12 and up, not 9-12 as your reading level suggests. I enjoyed the interesting word games, strong characterizations & insight into young minds but found the plot slightly contrived. Never-the-less the book held my attention from beginning to end.

When I picked it up and started to read I got interested in the story line but by 1/4 though the book I could tell it was not appopriate for my 9 year old. This has sexual content between a 13 year old boy and an older au pair. It also discusses the allegation that the 13 year old was sexually interested in his baby sister. I looked this book up on amazon to read reviews and was surprised to see so many positive ones. I want to give a warning to parents that while it might be okay for older children it should not be read by children younger than middle school and might need some explanations or open discussion if your older child chooses to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Read! by Rachel","review":"Silent to the bone by E.L. Konigsburg is about a boy named Branwell who is accused of hurting his little sister, Nikki, and is sent to a Behavior Center. One of the few people who believe that Branwell didn't hurt Nikki is Branwell's best friend, Conner. Conner goes about finding clues that will help him prove Branwell's innocence.When I first read the title, I got the impression that this was a scary story. As I read the summary on the back of it, the book became more interesting to me, and I became more curious about the plot. Then I read it. I couldn't stop reading! As I read Silent To The Bone, I gathered clues along with Conner. I felt like a detective.I would reccommend this book for mature audiences, 12 and older. This book contains some questionable content, but it doesn't take anything away from this great book. If you like mystery or law, you will enjoy Silent To The Bone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utopia??? I think not...","review":"This book is a great teacher of how people in the extremes of society live. First it depicts a utopian society where everything is smoothly run, but on the other hand, there is the Jewish community in a strongly anti-Semitic environment. However, it shows that the kid living in the utopia is not nearly as content as the Jew living in Germany because he is not allowed to have any emotions or beliefs of his own. If anything at all, you should read this book to show you that you should pursue what you believe in without conforming to the ideas of others just because they tell you so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Overall I felt that this was a good book. It had an interesting story and you want to read more as the mystery unfolds. I did not enjoy it as much as others written by this author though. It was written beautifully, there are many quotable parts, and it gives you a lot to think about. I think that the best age group for this book would be teenagers and up, if you are in that age group I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read","review":"I did not like this book.

While the sexual activities of the female were not described in great detail, they were present. There are also allegations of insestual child abuse toward an infant.It reads like a trashy novel or tabloid news. The sexual innuendos were very inappropriate for this age group. We continue to complain as a society about inappropriate youth behavior and yet we continue to expose them to inappropriate content. What can we expect to get? Middle school students are embarrassed and appalled that they are reading this book as assigned reading. It should notbe the book they assign for a middle school reader.Hard to believe this is written for 10-13 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a children's book!","review":"Although this book is supposedly a children's book, the 13 year old boy who is the main character is sexually involved with a 20 year old girl named Vivian.

Worst yet, the 13 year old boy tells is friend about an encounter with Vivian: \\"Then a very ... adult thing happened.\\" \\"You mean like Viagra?\\" ...The author of this book should be ashamed. This book doesn't belong in any child (or adults) hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This was a great read for my middle school students! They loved the book and the great mystery and intrigue. There is some sexual conten in the story...but nothing that would merit extreme concern.

It is about a boy named Branwell Zamborska who is taken to a juvenile behavior center after he allegedly dropped his six month old half sister, Nikki. THe only reason Branwell can't tell the truth abput what happened the Wednesday before Thanksgiving is the fact that he won't talk. After he called to his babysitter, Vivian, and told her that Nikki was breathing funny, he had not said another word. Not to his parents, not to the doctors, not to anybody. Connor Kane, Branwell's best friend is asked to help. He sees Branwell after school everyday and uses flashcards to communicate with him. With the information he gathers from Branwell, Connor goes on a journey through Branwell's past and uncovers the truth of Branwell's silence and of what happened, that night, at the Zamborska household."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading.","review":"While it was clear from the beginning that Branwell did not hurt the baby and that Vivian had been screwing with him, I wanted to find out exactly what and why. The book was like a puzzle, each chapter being a piece you had to fit together. Wonderfully suspenseful, perfect for curling up in a chair with on a chilly foggy day. Connor was the best friend a person could ask for. Both he and Branwell seemed very intelligent. Connor's sister Margaret was my favorite character. Vivian was a snake. The only thing I wished I could change about the book would be making her go to trial for hurting Nikki instead of just losing her job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I find it hard to believe that this book is on the reading list for middle school students. It read like a trashy novel or tabloid news. The sexual innuendos were very inappropriate for this age group. We continue to complain as a society about inappropriate youth behavior and yet we continue to expose them to inappropriate content. What can we expect to get? Middle school students are embarrassed and appalled that they are reading this book as assigned reading. It should be the book they are sneaking around to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious themes for mature young readers","review":"As a general rule, Konigsburg's characters are gifted, introspective and mature beyond their years, and I suspect that the young readers who enjoy her work strongly identify with these characters. This book is no exception. Connor, who relates the story, is quick-witted and discerning as is Branwell, his friend, whose personal trauma has left him mute. The themes of child abuse, sexuality, divorce, and family dysfunction are serious and are probably more suitable to a junior- and senior-high audience, though the main characters are just thirteen years old. \\"Silent to the Bone\\" is definitely a page-turner; I found myself stealing moments to finish reading it. While some of the plot details may not ring entirely true, Konigsburg has written a compelling novel which is certainly worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"This cd brings back alot of memories from the childhood.

Listen to it over and over again. Ralph was a silky sounder of songs and music, man..., too bad he wasn't given enough respect for his talents.

The pages are the size 13,4 x 9,5 inches but the cartoons just have 3,9 x 3,1 inches. You have these really huge pages and mostly 4 cartoons are printed on less than 40% of the space of one page.

Therefore, The Complete Far Side impressed me immensely. There are over 4,300 comics to enjoy in this collection! While I may not get every single panel, the fact that there is one punchline per panel and there are 3 or 4 panels per page ensures much mirth. I've laughed myself to tears with some. And unlike some other cartoonists which just aren't funny to me, when I don't laugh at a particular Far Side panel, I feel as if I've missed out on some joke, rather than just grunting and thinking the strip is not funny. After reading some of the letters published in the books, if you get offended easily, then maybe these books aren't for you. But if you have a healthy comedic appetite, you'll be granted many HOURS of laughter from these two wonderfully bound books spanning nearly a decade and a half of comic genius. Off the wall humor with talking animals and dumb people just tickles my funny bone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure genius, but an unwieldy package","review":"I have been a fan of The Far Side from the very beginning, and I was glad to find a complete collection of these gems. However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because:1. The books (two volumes) are hardbound, heavy, and not easy to carry around or even to put on a bookshelf because of their size.2. Many of the cartoons are printed in color. I'm sure some people like that, but I feel that the cartoons always looked better in plain old black-and-white.Finally, but not directly related to this 2-volume set, I'd love to see a CD collection of these wonderful cartoons someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate far side collection","review":"One of my prized posessions.

The color printing on those panels in color is perfect. The quality of the slip cover, the paper, the printing and binding is well worth the price. Just wish I could afford the 750 dollars for the leather bound.At 73 years of age it just made my year for me.

I got it for Christmas and I'm afraid my mom paid the full, original price for the Complete Far Side. If she did, it's still worth it. 1300 pages of Gary Larson, with four of his great cartoons per page, arranged in mostly chronological order are worth any price. This book also has some explainations of certain cartoons which caused controversy, were mis-understood, or just deserved a word from the creator. The Complete Far Side doesn't have all that is in the Prehistory of the Far Side; I recomend either keeping the Prehistory or, if you don't already have it, picking it up as an 'apendix' to this set.Overall, for a fan of the genius of Gary Larson, a great set to replace all your smaller books, and now at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great side of the Far Side","review":"This is a definate must for any cartoon connesuer's collection. Weighing in at God knows how many pounds, this huge 2 book collection is well worth the price. It includes every single Far Side cartoon ever published, even some not in previous collections. Far Side is one of my all time favorite cartoons, and is right up there with Dilbert and Calvin and Hobbes when it comes to all time greatest cartoons. An excellent collection, and worth the back strain."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is seriously funny stuff................","review":"I have always enjoyed Far Side and mourned its passing. The Complete Far Side serves two purposes: it allows me to enjoy the remembered and forgotten joys of the series, and it also allows me to revisit the series the context of their original time frame.Unlike the other reader from Columbus, I find the series as funny as when it was originally presented. Not every panel is fall down funny, but the gems will still make me laugh out loud and a few even bring tears to my eyes.There are many Larsen-wannabes on the comics page today (i.e., Six Chicks, Cloer to Home). If you enjoy them, you should read this collection to see how the true maaster of the genre works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Far Side.","review":"This is about the best set of cartoons ever if you have a warped sense of humor like I do.

In every page we try to pick out the one we love best and there's always some which lead to more than a chuckle. And there are some intriguing ones which need to be figured out. Once figured out, it all looks so obvious... And there are some which we debate on the real intent.There's no question that this is an excellent collection, worth it's weight on gold. But the weight is also the downside - and the only issue I have. It's too heavy to read in bed. Only wish the publishers had a 5 or 6 volume set rather than a two volume set. But, hey, look at the brighter side, it's not in a single volume! Even with this issue it deserves 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous, simply marvelous!","review":"This is even better than I had expected.

So large and heavy and such poor design on each the pages. Each cartoon is framed with a phony looking bevel which I would guess was intended to be a picture frame of sorts with the copy beneath, then placed randomly (and small) on a generic pattern background.One has to look no further than the recent and very excellent Peanuts collections or the Dennis the Menace books to find respectfully designed collections. The Far Side collection Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 are poorly done and an insult to such a wonderful and memorable cartoon that a generation of us would look forward to cracking open the paper each morning to see the daily Far Side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acute and/or Chronic (ChronicAL?) Larsonitis","review":"Hey, OK for the superb quality of the cartoons (of course!), the equally superb quality of the edition, and the weight! But the Larson's introductions and commentaries are on the level too! And the faithful facsimile reproduction of some hate mail make those letters almost as FarSidish as the cartoons themselves (and tell more about their writers, than about the Far Side). Unique stuff, sold out of course (my librarian in Brussels could lay hands on three copies, not one single more). Far Side fans who already own the regular paperback editions plus the \\"Far Side Prehistory\\" won't have the idea of having spent too much money, because of the 1,100 cartoons not published in book form previously.

With over 4,300 cartoons and Larson's commentary it just can't get any better than this. This one's a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have been better in 3 or 4 volumes instead of 2","review":"The extra 1,000+ never-before-seen cartoons make this collection worthwhile, but the sheer weight of each volume, plus the oversized pages, make it awkward to view. I can only read this at the dining table, but as a Far Side fan for decades, I consider it a small inconvenience. My main complaint is about the weight, not the oversized pages. Each book really is unusually heavy. I think the compilation would have been more user-friendly in 3 or 4 volumes (as was done with the revised annotated Sherlock Holmes). Unlike some reviewers, I appreciated the colorized cartoons, but I do wish more of them could have been enlarged. There were several Far Side collections where iconic cartoons were printed in full-page format, and I would have liked more of that. One other (minor) quibble - the slip-case for the set and the bindings of the books seem to be a brushed material that collects dust easily and doesn't clean well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Far Side collection","review":"Having always been a fan of the Far Side, this was well worth the purchase and my wife and I have enjoyed laughing together. My only complaint are the many, many blasphemous cartoons where God is the butt of the joke. It is also annoying that there are so many cartoons promoting evolution. So discernment is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Supplier Shouldn't Be Allowed on Amazon","review":"Ordered and paid for book.

My only criticism if it really needs to be said is that they are totally not mobile, OMG they are heavy. So if you are thinking of toting one of these behemoths to the coffee shop just forget it. Unless you want the workout. In that case begin walking to the coffee shop holding a book in one hand and swing it perpendicular to your chest catching half crossed with the other hand and repeat, 10 reps in both directions.

A fan of any calliber will be instantly laughing, some longer than others. For me, humor can even be found when attempting to wrangle this immense beast of a book from its case, which is rumored to be made of solid oak. Then the two volumes sit there, like those statues on Easter Island, waiting for you to summon the courage to spend two hours reading them, battling the stomach pains, the sore cheeks, and the odd looks from your freind or loved one in the other room.I laugh every time I have to pick this book up, it even gets its own separate moving-box. I suggest you invest in this, it will always make you feel good when you read it--and you can bench-press it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most boring and poorly written parenting book I've ever come across yet...","review":"Sadly, this has got to be the most boring, poorly written, least inspired, parenting book I have yet to come across. At least 80% of the writing in this book consists of quotes from parents the author interviewed at the playground-- her friends and relatives, I suspect. If you're looking for insightful comments or suggestions on raising your only child, you won't find them here. The author is much more interested in justifying her choice to have had only one child. Why she should have the need to preach to the converted, should be obvious to anyone who bothers to read this. Only those who doubt the validity of their choice to have an only child, and feel the need to have their choices reaffirmed need to bother plowing through this long, tedious, repetitious, pointless, ...well you get the point..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More excuses!","review":"No way am I having any more children. This book gave me answers when people keep asking me when am I going to have a second child. An answer for my mother-in-law, an answer for my husband, and anyone else who keeps carping on this. The chapter that blows holes in the stereotype that people try to pin on only children, gave me more ammunition and made me feel really great about how my son is developing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parenting An Only Child","review":"I thought that this book was okay but it was more for working and older parents. It didn't really help me as a stay at home mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"total waste of time","review":"I married an only child and together we have an only child, so I thought this book would be a good support for raising one, but it's not. The author is only interested in promoting career oriented working women, and their husbands, who don't want to sacrifice any more of their time than they have to. There's basically nothing in the book about loving and raising an only child. There are plenty of opinions stated as fact and a subtle push to erase the traditional definition of marriage and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhelpful","review":"This book runs through a number of different reasons why one might choose to have only one child. It includes short statements from a range of parents talking about their concerns and fears when it comes to having more children and to a person they all sound self-centered and churlish. Reading this book has not helped me decide whether to have more children but it has made me realize what kinds of things are not important to me as I make this decision; cache,\\" \\"prestige\\" and a desire to \\"deposit\\" my child with relatives so that I can travel more. Unless those sound like good reasons to you, give this book a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Makes Digs At Those Families With More Than One Child","review":"This book is not about the joys and challenges of raising an only child. This book is about defending the only child. Throughout the book the author makes petty an immature remarks as to why having an only child is the only way to go. I purchased this book because I was on the fence as to whether or not I should have another child. I wanted an unbiased opinion on the pros and cons of having an only child to assist me with my decision making. Unfortunately, I am still on the fence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usual pop psychology junk","review":"I'm often reluctant to purchase these psychology books because they're so poorly written, take 30 pages to say what can be said in 1 paragraph, ramble, and have few words of wisdom contained in them. I do try because I find even if I have to skim a lot of junk, there's sometimes some helpful advice and it's often good to know that there are other people with the same questions out there. I'm not sure that paying $15 for the privilige is worth it, however.I would instead recommend You and Your Only Child by Nachman, which I bought at the same time and I found infinitely more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the booked I'd hoped it would be","review":"This book was mislabled when they gave it the title of Parenting and Only Child. Its not so much about parenting an only child as it is about WHY people choose to have an only child, and what to say to those who ask if you're going to have another one. I was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Haven't Seen It, You Should","review":"This was the concert that led me to a lifetime love and respect for Bobby McFerrin in the 80's and it still holds the magic. If you don't know his work - it's a must-see. If you do know his work, it will remind you again of his sheer pleasure and love for music in its base form. Who hasn't danced to thier own music and beamed from within?

It's a big lie as lots of other spams.This is an old show, yes, but here in Amazon I was able to get other good and newer shows.

I had just been to a Bobby McFerrin concert, which I enjoyed thoroughly, and have a couple of his cd's, which I also like. But this particular dvd became just plain boring after a while. There wasn't the wonderful audience participation, which was so much fun in the concert. There were too many rambling jazz numbers that went on much too long.The reason I titled this review \\"unfair\\" is because I am essentially a classically trained musician who mostly listens to classical music. I like some jazz, and I think McFerrin is a genius, but sometimes any jazz can become repetitive and for me, tiresome. I feel sure that a jazz fan would look at this dvd differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and enjoyable listening","review":"All around a good CD to listen to. Karen had that unmistakeable and unforgetable voice. I think this collection exhibits more of her vocal range than the more popular Singles 1969-1973 collection does.As other reviewers have noted, the Carpenters' style was changing in the mid 70s and they were experimenting a bit with different sounds. Even so, this collection is easy to listen to and has some memorable songs such as Only Yesterday, I Need to Be in Love, and Won't Last A Day Without You. Whether you remember these songs from the mid 70s or are new to the Carpenters, this is a worthwhile addition to your CD collection. (Arguably, Karen Carpenter is the greatest female vocalist of all time.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Marley Masterpiece","review":"Bob Marley & The Wailers / Exodus - Movement of Jah People: This is Bob's most accessible and universal album because his writing is less Rastafarian, the performances are magnificent, and the production is the best he had ever been given.

The \\"Deluxe Edition\\" series seems to have hit the nail on the head. The sound is excellent, and the extra tracks actually add to the experience.

It was a watershed mark for Reggae and for Popular music as we know it. Now we get an expanded addition of this classic album. Rich with alternate versions and other previously unreleased live tracks and remixes. But what truly shines here is the original Exodus material. All of Marley's talent is summed up on this album, it offers everything and then some. From the infectous steady groove of Jamming to the global harmony chants of One Love the album never dissappoints. It is classic. And in these troubled times of the last month Three Little Birds seems to make us feel \\"allright.\\" So just remember what Marley sings, \\"Don't worry about a thing, every little thing is going to be allright.\\" This is a must for any music collection. An important re-released version of one greatest albums every made."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting experiment","review":"This is Marley's best known later album, and deserves it; but many of the albums' subtleties tend to get ignored under the power of no less than 5 singles -- \\"Exodus,\\" \\"Jamming,\\" \\"One Love/People Get Ready,\\" \\"Waiting in Vain\\" and \\"Three Little Birds\\".The first half is dreamy -- \\"Natural Mystic\\" fades in and fades out over a simple and satisfying groove, then \\"So Much Things to Say\\" winds into \\"Guiltiness\\" (essentially one long song) and then the simple \\"The Heathen\\" gives way into the dubby but intense \\"Exodus.\\"I do have one small beef with the record -- the weak track of the lot, \\"Turn Your Lights Down Low\\" is basically badly derivative of his earlier love songs. All in all, worth it however."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Popular Music's Greatest Recordings","review":"A classic Bob Marley album gets the royal treatment with the release of this newly remastered and expanded addition of his masterpiece Exodus. Present on this famous recording are all of what makes Marley one of music's greatest artists. All of his styles are represented here and it never disappoints the listener. From the free jam of Jammin'to the politic statements of the title track to the friendly chants of Three Little Birds, Exodus is one those special recordings. It is still fresh, with a sound and style that feels like it was recorded yesterday. With the addition of a second disc, the listener gets live cuts and other remixes, but in the end the original material is what really shines. One of Marley's best. Highly recommended to anyMarley fan and to anyone who has never purchased an album from him, this is where to start. Let the music live on, and let it satisfy your soul.

Beautiful writing and performances throughout the record and People Get Ready is steller. This is one of the best recvords ever recorded and stands up decades later. You really cannot go wrong with any Marley recoord, but this record and Legend (a compilation) are two good ones. Exodus is wonderful, but Legen has many of the hits from Exodus plus some other great tracks such as No Woman No Cry, Buffalo Solider and Redemption Song (probably my favorite Marley song of all of them.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Bob Marley","review":"Time Magazine's Album Of The Century.

Three Little Birds and One Love/People Get Ready truly grab me with such pleasing tones and captivating melodies. However some of the less familiar tunes like Turn Your Lights Down Low and Natural Mystic stand fairly tall as well.The style does not vary too much and a few songs are a little long. Nonetheless, like Catch A Fire or the Legend compilation you cannot deny the soothing effects of Mr. Marley.

It is only fitting that the album start off with the powerfully uplifting track \\"Optimistic\\".

Your Wish is My Command is a song I enjoy listening to after I get through a rough day or a challenging week with so many responsibilities. It is my way of praising and thanking the Lord and offering myself to Him for redemption and forgiveness and His love.Other tracks that stand out include \\"Stand\\", \\"Testify\\" and \\"Hallelujah Lord\\".

I was blown away when I saw them. They performed Optimistic and it was amazing, hip, funky, contemporary and most of all relavent. The messages throughout the album reflect struggle and perserverance and ultimately success in the face of all obstacles. These messages appeal to all people not just African-Americans or Christians. The key to this album was a good grove throughout, polished basslines, and timely lyrics. If you like music from the nineties-hip-hop/pop then this album will fit in nicely. If you enjoy contemporary Christian Music then the messages are solid but the music is more urban in nature and may not appeal. If you love any type of good music then squeeze this into your collection-you'll be richly rewarded with a well crafted album that just happens to have something to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU!","review":"Effervescent Joy for me....Thanks to Sounds of Blackness for being bold enough to share themselves in this work.

This book will challenge you as a mother to choose a parenting philosophy that will allow you to raise up children who will grow to be both godly and productive members of society.

The only other 1-star review was annoyed that it didn't provide holograms, I'm not, since that would be asking to much. However, this thing isn't really good for anything. In America, YGO is targeted at 5-10 year olds. However, if a child of that age were to put one of these on, he'd look rediculous (actually, that goes for all ages). It'd be about half the size of him/her. Second, it's hard to actually put many of the cards in. The monsters are easy enough, but to put the Magic or Traps in, you often have to bend the card.The worst part though, is that the cards fall off easily. Lower your arm, and there goes the game. Why not just buy your kid some booster packs?"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great toy!","review":"now this is a great deal at yugiohcards.com they sold the exact same thing for 64.95 this place sells it for 34.00 now this is one of the best toys i have ever seen in my life you rule gift of toys.com!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dude, this is awsome!","review":"I'v been waiting forever for 1 of these to come out!

The people who made this toy didn't really think about realizim. It's supposed to go on your right hand and the magic cards are supposed to go in the back not the front.

I don't know why you would get a toy that destroys your cards little by little (it bends the edges). I can use a calculator or keep track in my head for the lifepoints. I could also play the cards anywhere, as long as I have card sleeves to protect them. Basically what I'm saying is, this toy is useless, but I do have to admit, it does make dueling look decent, but I wish it could actually make holograms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun....But Surprisingly Painfull","review":"(Picture this.

I'm 14 and I collect YGO cards and everything. I bought my duel disk at toys r us for $36! and trust me its worth it! It has monster slots for both atk and def position. Bad thing is that the magic and traps go in front. But if your careful your opponent wont see them. The LP thing lights up too. um... The deck holder is a little small so I recomend having a deck with no more than 50 cards. Graveyard is really small but hey if your a good duelist then u shouldnt worry about it. My favorite part is the positions. They change quickly so kids beware, cuts and scratches can occur. Everytime you place a card down it makes the little noise like on the show. This is one excellent toy and would make a great christmas gift!

Then to make matters worse this toy is a dangerous weapon...if someone is in front or too close of the person using the toy (like my 3 year old daughter) they can get SERIOUSLY hurt. When you open the launcher & release the trigger button it slings closed very fast..It can really hurt someone very badly.So now instead of this being the toy that he \\"HAD\\" to have for Christmas is the toy that has so many rules as to where & when he can play with it makes it not such a fun toy after all.[...]Very Unhappy mom"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's O.K.!","review":"In January they're trying to come out with real duel disk launchers.

I saw it in a Yu-Gi-Oh magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duel Disk? Maybe","review":"First of all I've never played the CCG (collectible card game)... But I am big fan of the Anime, both US and Japanese versions. From a glance it looks pretty big. It's hard too imagine that a child of 5+ would be using it. The straps that harness the Disk to your arm IS however small enough for a child. Adult and Teen wearers may have some difficulty with the velcro. I fixed the problem by sewing on some additional velcro. The Disk itself is pretty sturdy and kids might want to be careful when switching modes, it kind happens quickly and scratches can happen.With that said I think it's pretty faithful to the Anime. The Cards fit nicely and the mode changes are pretty good. If you are Yu-Gi-Oh cosplayer or need to complete a Halloween costume this item is perfect. I am pretty happy with it. It will complete that Duelist Costume you're trying to create."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don\`t Buy this!","review":"Don\`t buy this toy.It\`s not worth the money.It\`s fun until you see what it does to your cards.

I bought this for my son who had been looking forward to this toy. When we got home, we saw that the buttons you push to decrease the life points wont work (you press the buttons but the numbers do not decrease) and when you slide the short platform clockwise (as per the directions) the platform will not lock and it ends up snapping back. We exchanged it for a different one, but we still have the same problems. We are going to try a third time and if that one doesn't work we are getting our money back. This is a cheap toy, and I can't believe that you have to pay almost $30 for something worth about $5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Toy","review":"This toy is cool but the bad thing is that it is dangerous.

You can duel almost exactly like the duelists at battle city.EXCEPT for the magic and trap cards go in the front.Also,it can barely hold the minimum # of cards of the deck(40) in the deck holder.It also holds a range of 17-31 cards in your graveyard.Educational? Why the freak would this be educational? You're supposed to have fun with it, not learn something from it?

Anyway, i like the duel disk, but theres a major problem with this thing and that is that it ruins the bottom corners of your field cards! this may not bother you seeing as how there arent many rare field cards out now besides necrovalley, but when dark sancuary (used by yami bakura in the anime) and temple of the kings (used by odian in the anime) come out, they are sure to be holographic so DONT USE THEM IN THE DUEL DISK especially with the fact that you can't use plastic sleeves in it. other than that it's a great toy and if you're a parent reading this and your son/daughter loves yugioh but is tired of booster packs and says that they are getting lame, put this under the tree. peace out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth About The Yu-gi-oh Duel Disk","review":"When I first heard of the duel disk coming to stores I had to have it, so I bought it the first day it was released. Since I am a national Yu-gi-oh card game champion, the main reason I wanted it was to use it to duel.The first thing I noticed was that I could not use cards in card protectors, because they wouldn't fit in the card slots. This was a problem because, like all serious players, I wanted to protect my valuable cards. so, I tried not using card protectors, and that was a big mistake! Every card placed in the card zone slots were from damaged to seriously damaged!! But I was impressed by the technology of the duel disk. So, in conclusion, if you are a serious duelist this product would be useless to you, I don't recommend buying it. I guess this toy would be fun if you were an average six year old kid that doesn't pay attention to the true possible value of a card, or the condition of their cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP CRAP CRAPPITY CRAP CRAP!","review":"Why?

The deck holder is also small and the graveyard is tiny... but the later shouldn't matter if you're a good duelist.If you lift weights and don't care about your cards it's a good toy, if not... and you like to keep your cards in good condition don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son is happy","review":"My son was happy to see this when he opened his gifts this morning.

He loves using is and not having to play on the ground if he is outside. I would say it is fairly educational due to the fact if they are playing and reading the cards and calculating damage points, they are using their brains and imaginations too. We have had no problems with the durability. I say that with caution though as he is very good with his toys. It has not broken due to normal use for that reason. If you have a rough child it may not last as long or may get bent. The only improvement that I would have like to have seen is a better damage calculator. My son has not commented on it but as an adult I think they could have done better on that one aspect.

He told me that this was no mis-conceptoion. he stated,and i loosley quote. \\"in production of the prototype of the duel disk launcher, we came across a major flaw. that flaw was that the \\"Secondary\\" card holders required us to take large slots out of the back of the \\"Blade section\\" to place the cards inside. we noticed that this would greatly infeeble the plastic and cause it to snap, thus greatly decreacing it's durability. so we decided to place the slots in the re-enforced front section of the Blade.

Even if you don't use card sleeves, both Deck and Graveyard holders warp and even bend the cards. I'm returning mine and getting my money back.

At the end of each week I would read my entries and remind myself what I am grateful for and for all the wonderful things I have in my life.I just ordered, on Amazon, \\"Plain and Simple\\" by the same author and cant wait for it to arrive.

Here Mr. Moody proves Mr. Peck is correct. It's not as badly written, as it is a bad novel. Also, it is clear from reading this book that Mr. Moody is far more concerned with being a famous writer than being a good one. Sorry, Mr. Moody. I gave you another chance, but you failed again.

During this time, the \\"band\\" concept was being replaced by the singing group, and the solo artist. It was and still is refreshing to hear artists that know how to play instruments. The groups first single, Breakin' My Heart, was a R&B chart topping hit. Listen to the keyboards, guitars, and drums, and reflect how they mesh together so perfectly. Add the singing of Stokley just as a finishing touch. Their second single, staying with the love theme, Forever In Your Eyes, was also a charting hit. (Radio and Records Magazine 1992)- Single to Mingle, the groups next single didn't do as well on the charts, but it is a Mint Condition standard in their live performances.

I didn't think I would like it from reading the blurb, but I was wrong. This is a compelling read that held my attention throughout. The obsessive and quite mad July is a pretty unnerving character. I got a little tired of the protagonist making stupid mistakes, but he eventually tries to redeem himself. The Colombian shaman is a great character and Kimball did a great job with him.

The poses are held quite a bit longer than other beginner DVD's which I found helpful. There's no music which is refreshing since it can be somewhat distracting. Instead there are natural sounds like bird calls. All in all this was a first class DVD. Maral Hadidi is an excellent instructor and her calm voice is soothing. This DVD is an excellent buy and I will be using it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for beginners & not easy to follow","review":"Thank goodness I ordered two begginer DVD's and actually liked one of them. The menu for this DVD is hard to understand and the series' are very hard to follow. They are all taped at different locations, etc and then all thrown together. One 75 minute session jumps from the woods to the beach with no transition from the instructor. She also doesn't give any modifications for harder poses or any encouragement along the way. Most of the DVD is set in the wilderness, while it's a nice setting, the constant bird chirping and bugs making noises is less than ideal for me while doing something new and challenging.

I gave it to the occasional chewer, and she sniffed it before slowly grabbing it, chewed a little while, and left it alone. She hasn't chewed on it much since. The crazy-mad chewer likes it, but not as much as the other bone. He was chewing it one night and from the sound I thought it would be gone in the morning, but no, it is still holding up pretty well.

Any chew toy fragment swallowed (no matter what type of chew it may be) can suddenly become stuck in the throat or intestinal tract.(I did not give it 5 stars because it's not made from a natural material.)However, I am very disappointed in the price tag from Amazon: as of this review, the regular size (4-1/2\\") is sold for $5.49, but you can get it through Drs.

Picture quality excellent with Stereo Sound. Digital8 holds it's own against MiniDV. And for the price I paid for this Sony CamcorderYou will not be disappointed. Believe me. Nightshot is Off the hook. Super Nightshot is unbelievable. Digital Stills on tape is good, would of perferred a memory stick but for [money], can't complain.

The strength of Sony Digital-8 line has been in those two mentioned above. TRV130 is the only exception to that. It doesn't playback analog 8 mm/hi-8 mm tapes, it doesn't let you dub your old VHS tapes to digital tapes, you can't record the tv shows to this camcorder. Even those who don't need these functions, you can get a much smaller camcorder from other manufacturers at cheaper price.

Those were really the musclecars that were out there in numbers, a poorly tuned Hemi could'nt beat a well tuned 327 or 289 and that was often the case on the street.But hey the photos are pretty good, and if you haven't heard the stories and legends ad naseum - this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for understanding Frameworks","review":"I found this book to be a great book to learn the ins and outs of designing and implementing a Business Framework, and how to implement real world OOP. I have had a lot of trouble in the past reading all the examples in books about OOP in general. They would start off with the analogy of a car, an airplane, a person, etc. a lot of detail would go into designing that object. All well and good but how do I really break down these objects so they can be used in a business model and extend that same object.

I will no longer buy Wahl products without trialing them first.My favorite part was that they tried wave the Made in America flag. Most of the funk was made in China and assembled in US (just put in the box?). Wow. 100% pure funk.Strangest of all was that I looked at the ratings on Amazon. and showed that they were solid.

The second time I used it the thing would begin to vibrate out of control making an extremely loud high pitched sound. I would have to slap it against my palm to to get it to stop and sometimes it took a couple of whacks. After I took it apart and learned that the vibrator is made out of cheesy plastic. The piece just barely went through the slot and had enough play to slip out. I tightened the screws as tight as I could but it kept happening. Sometimes if you adjust the slide it will stop.The thing is pretty quiet when it works correctly but when that plastic piece slips out and it makes that loud vibrating nose it scares the crap out of you.I still use it and put up with it as I didn't save my reciept. I would avoid this one. Maybe Wahl has a better model.

The barber's cape was kind of a joke--it was cheap plastic garbage bag quality, so I ended up throwing it out after the first use. Zip case is nice to store all the parts.My main criticism of this product is that it is called \\"Chrome Pro\\" yet, it contains no chrome whatsoever. Don't call it chrome if it's not actually chrome. The shiny parts of the clippers that look like crome are cheap plastic.Overall, a good deal for your money.

The plastic works loose from the blade, causing the clipper to stop working. It requires a simple disassembly to fix the trouble (2 screws)but it is annoying to have to do it every 10-15 minutes. The $10 Conair clipper that we bought from Dollar General work much better. The extra doodads that come with the Wahl clipper are nice, but unnecessary.

As did Diaz's book, this book made me feel as though I were sitting beside Cortes and Montecuzoma as the drama of their meeting unfolded.

Other things like Xlink, XPointer etc.. are yet really to be defined practically and face it folks - we will be married to implementations of the future. I would tell anyone getting this book to reconsider and check out the Dietel & Dietel XML How to Program book. Sure the samples are in Java, Perl, ASP and VB, but you should be able to figure things out AND they do a much better job with XSLT and DOM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I have always had high expectation of Wrox for being the best in technical books, but this book was very disappointing. The book is good at telling what XML is and what the application of XML is good for, but does a very poor job at showing the HOW TO of implementing XML. Most of the codes demonstrated are in portions and tid bits and was very difficult to decipher."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...something warm to hold me.\\"","review":"I don't wan't to over alanyze, but allow me a brief banter in a critic-extraordinaire manner. Amongst the often flat humored, romanticized insincerity of \\"emo,\\" the Alkaline Trio delivers a sense of honest, emotional rock with a dark flair. However cliche', the first listen doesn't convey the perfection of this cd; it is at first somewhat unaccessable, but quickly opens up, and when this happens you will be overwhelmed by the affection, the rejection, the glory and the disgrace. Plus it rocks hard, with the trio producing a complex wall of sound using a simple formula. Of all the A3 releases i've heard to date, this is by far the best for1)lyrics, 2) coherence as an album, 3)all around, dark-punkin', emo-whinin'..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe I'll Catch Fire","review":"Love the title, love the songs, simple as that. I like 9 out of the 10 songs on this album!! This is defenitly in my list of all time favorites. I've listened to it every single day scince I bought it. Very addicting songs!! The only one I don't like is ''SleepyHead'',I thinks it's kinda annoying. This is on my all-time favorite label \\"ASIAN MAN RECORDS\\"!! If you like punk, BUY THIS ALBUM!! You won't be dissapointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never fails to keep my attention.","review":"Alkaline Trio are lyrical genuises. OK, maybe they are not the most musically gifted band alive; but they make due with what they've got better than any other power chord punk band on the market. Sometimes, it seems, all they have besides three chords and a quick drummer is humorously sarcastic stories to tell. Often, they involved alcohol and girls. Each Alkaline song has something to say and about 99% of the time it is very worth listening to. Every time I listen to this CD I catch some new lyric that makes me rewind it and play it again to make sure I heard it right. Something about \\"Maybe I'll Catch Fire,\\" as well as all their others, just makes you sit down to think while enjoying every tune. Although this release from the three \\"dirty-punk/emo\\" boys is not their most consistent; it boasts about three of their best songs ever written. Go buy this, The Trio has something to say and you need to listen up."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS?","review":"This album F---ing rocks!!! I listen mostly to indie/emo/punk and the Alkaline Trio has to be in my top three favorites for current emotional melodic punk act out there. While this CD isn't the same as Goddammit, I don't think it's necessarily worse. The real problem with most punk music is that it's the same thing over and over, played out. This band doesn't resign to that. If you don't like it...then you need to analyze what you consider good music and a true artist. These guys yank my heartstrings with each verse and screech. Viva Alkaline Trio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alk3 is God, and this cd is their blessing","review":"I'm am sooooo shocked at the first reviewer and the 12th guy, what the F**K IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?! This cd rocks!! Not that it's better than GD or their brilliant eps, it's just as good, becuz Alk3 is one of the greatest bands ever. You fools out there that judge a group whether they're \\"poppy\\" or not or whether some of they're songs sound the same should go somewhere far away and listen to jazz impromptu for the rest of their lives. It's just like saying that blink 182 is a trendy piece of poo, but go listen to Chesire Cat and then tell me that. Whatever. This is an amazing cd for anyone that loves music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock,with deep emotions","review":"This is a Great Record! these guys help you get through the dark and hard times in life, by letting you know you're not the only one that's had bad things happen in life. and they rock at the same time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever","review":"The Alkaline Trio are an incredibly underrated band -- to stick them in any one category doesn't do them justice. The songwriting ability that's jammed up in this band is amazing. Songs like \\"Radio\\" and \\"Madame Me\\" prove the incredible ability that Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano have to punch in great chord changes that are comparable to late great Nirvana. Punk can't hold these guys, emo can't hold these guys, pop, indie ... none of those categories have the flexibility to have the Alkaline Trio placed in there. The lyrics are amazing; dark and humorous but at the same so filled with joy and pain and anger that you get swept up into these guys heads' immediately. This band is proof that simplicity is a VERY undervalued characteristic in music, but that doesn't mean that creativity has to take a cut either. Best songs on the album: \\"Tuck Me In\\", \\"Radio\\", \\"Sleepyhead\\", \\"Madame Me\\", \\"Keep 'Em Coming\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"two listens later","review":"Initially I found this album a slightly disapointing follow up to the Trio's previous efforts of Goddamnit, and the various vinyl tracks (re-released on the CD compliation \\"Alkaline Trio\\"). After listening to this album a mere two times, I realized how truly amazing this record is. Lyrically very few bands can match the Alkaline Trio's remarkable skill for conveying emotion with sincerity. Their lyrics manage to tell a story as well as paint a picture. Musically, this album has a little more of a poppy feel than previous releases, although it sticks to the melodic, emotional punk sound. I have a million more things to say about this record, but I think you should just buy it for yourself. This band has something that simple words cannot describe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still The Best Trio Album!!!","review":"I have been a fan of Alkaline Trio for awhile now and I've heard every one of their albums several times. In every one they have a certain unexplained genius that flows forth, but with \\"Maybe I'll Catch Fire\\" they jump beyond that, into a sort of world all it's own. It's a beautifully depressing record for the down hearted. The songs \\"She Took Him To The Lake\\", \\"F+++ You Aurora\\" and \\"Radio\\" are my personal favorites and contain some of the best lyrics they've written, but you really need to listen to this one as a whole to truly appreciate the deepness. I would recommend this over all other trio records, truly their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original-Infectious","review":"The lyrics on this album are poetry, they make you picture the situation described in such symbolic and refreshing ways. Mat's voice is amazing, emotional, and powerful without ever becoming whiney like many \\"emo\\" bands. If you don't like it at first give it a couple more listens. The music is original (when compared to a lot of punk out there) so it can take a while for it to grab you. Once this cd starts growing on you it doesn't stop, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of all","review":"This is the worst album made by my favorite band. Its monotone, annoying and depressing. Its not depressing in a good way either and its more annoying than anything else. Track 1,4 and 10 are my favorites, Radio is the best one. I heard Hot Water Music's version of Radio before Alkaline Trios version and I like it more, so this version was kind of a let down. Almost every song on this cd made me wanna press the skip button. Skip this cd, buy it after you get all the other Alkaline Trio albums. I recommend buying them in this order: From Here to Imfirmary, God Damnit, Good Mourning. My favorite is God Damnit, I really cant think of an album from any band that I like more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"If you didn't like emo before, you'll hate it with a vengeance upon unfortunately listening to this album.

It is a copy from an LP to a CD and the quality is pretty poor. And 2 other Studio Recordings listed here in Amazon are also copies.

I was bored with it long before the night was over. One problem is that it can seem like a total waste of time because you have to watch the map and if you run into a disaster, your ship will sink and you have to start all over. You can also not change your route after you have choosen it, you have to just go around in circles.This does not measure up to roller coaster tycoon or the Sims at all. There is not much to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Game for a welcome aboard tycoon fan","review":"This game was a very good introduction to a tycoon game. The moral of the game is to try to make X amount of money in a certain amount of time. Their are some pretty cheezey graphics, but overall the game is very well writen. The only big problem is your money. You start off in the career mode with 50 grand. To build, let's say, a twin pothole suite, you are throwing away about 2000 bucks. You then have to build shops, bars, eateries, entertainment, and recreation to make your ship sucsessful. So really, you need to be a complete expert on this game to win.

It does fill a little bit of time, but only for a few days. It gets boring, and the graphics are not as good as I had hoped. The box shows better graphics than there really is, and I have a top of the line computer.

The authors attempt a serious look at what defines science fiction, as contrasted to other genres like mystery, romance or adventure. The hardest problem appears to be in drawing a good demarcation between science fiction and fantasy.If you are a science fiction reader, here is a rare chance to get deeper look at your genre. Perhaps the essays might give you a better appreciation of what makes SF so distinctive.It should be said that the essays are not light reading. Unlike breezy book reviews [like mine]. Some of the essays also provide a good survey of the trends over the decades in SF. And there are also numerous references to classic SF stories, like the Demolished Man and the Cold Equations.

Of course it only did it 25% of the time so I kept using it for a few weeks but eventually I started to lose my mind and threw it away. Since most mice would work with my Mac I grabbed an old PC mouse I had and presto I was back in action and that trip to the psycho ward was avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macally USB Optical Mouse Review","review":"Mouse works fine as does all the Macally products I've purchased in the past.

Like the size, like the click action... love the right click feature since I haven't had that with a one button mac mouse.

It's great otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The price is right...","review":"For the price this is a good mouse. I would go with the actual Apple product if you can afford it. This one is a little harder to click (especially the scroll wheel button which I have configured for Dashboard.) The Apple mouse seems more ergonomic. But a good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two fatal flaws, to me.","review":"What makes a good mouse is a pretty personal set of criteria.For me, this mouse has two fatal flaws.I tend to grip my mouse as if my hand was a claw, meaning that I use the tip of my thumb on one side and pinky on the other, and click with my index and middle fingers.With this mouse, however, the claw approach doesnt work. For one, the sides of it are too slick, which makes gripping it difficult. Secondly, the mouse buttons dont extend all the way to the front of the mouse, so if you have long fingers, you find yourself trying to click where there is no button.My other compaint is the wheel doesn't have very good tactile feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that keeps you thinking.","review":"The title of this book is unfortunately an accurate description of Raoul Walllenberg's fate. Why wouldn't (or couldn't) the United States step in to save a man they later named an honorary citizen from the Russian prisons? Or for that matter, why did Sweden abandon a countryman of family stature the likes of a Rockefeller in the United States? This book is part biography, part mystery novel as to what may have happened to Raoul Wallenberg. Gersten explores in depth each possible angle beyond the well-known factors of his life, yet allows the reader to make up his own version of the truth behind his tragic disappearance. One can only wonder how many heroes there would be in the world if they were all treated this way. I did not know who Raoul Wallenberg was before I read this book, and now I will never forget him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Hold Tune Well, Not My Favorite","review":"I've always used Elixirs.

This allowed for various themes seperated by cards. All this came to an end after I had the camera just over a year with drive error C:32-01. After research on the problem including hundreds of listed similar problems, I found that Sony charged under 20 dollars for the part and about 150 dollars for the labor. I understand that this common problem has been eliminated in more recent mavicas, but Sony lost my support in their lack of customer care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Forget Copies","review":"I took this camera on a trip to NYC.

If you are with friends or family, you can pass out copies to them right away!I recommend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another camera!","review":"I got this camera as a gift from my company last Christmas, and it was an ok starter camera to fool around with. However, I went on a trip to South America and saw some incredible things-but the camera did a below average job capturing the pictures. A lot of the pictures were HEAVILY pixilated, so I went and got a better camera.Save your money, and buy a higher resolution camera-they can be found at or near the same price point. You will probably regret it if you don't buy a 3.3 meg camera to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO!!","review":"We bought this as a back up for our primary digital camera (Sony FD95 - a GREAT camera). Came to discover that this one will not accept a Sony floppy disc adapter and memory stick!

I can't say enough good things about the Mavica--I literally took it around the world and captured some amazing sights along they way--and was able to share all of them with friends and family all over the world. The floppy disks make on the go transfer and trasmission extremely easy--any internet cafe will do. The quality of the pictures online is great although when I've printed them, I haven't been quite as pleased. Although the camera is a bit bulky, it isn't too much of a hastle to travel with and the rechargeable battery is a wonderful feature. In all, I highly recommend this camera for anything except prints--you can get decent 4 x 6 photos but the quality isn't what you'd like it to be. Just the same, it's a great camera with an outstanding zoom and enormous versatility."},{"rating":"2","title":"great easy to use","review":"this camera is for any beginner, it's so easy to use anyone can figure it out.

The 3.5\\" floppy makes for speed and convenience. BUT... the negatives outweigh the positives with this camera. It is heavy and bulky (Mostly because of the floppy disk application). The pictures are coarse and grainy and not suitable for printing with ANY printer. It is necessary to focus this camera throught the LCD on the back and in bright sunlight, you can't see what you're trying to photograph. I also have an HP618 digital and there is no comparison, yet they sell for the same price. I am a believer in SONY products and own several, but they dropped the ball with this one. I'm sure that their higher end models are much more satisfactory, but I would not recommend this camera to anyone. I'm not a professional photographer, just a point and shoot guy, but this camera will disappoint you. Sorry SONY."},{"rating":"1","title":"FD75","review":"Great if you want an easy to use camera, and good value for money. However, I now own 5 mp camera and woouldn't go back. The FD75 is only 0.3 mp, and is ok until you want to enlarge pictures. The camera is great for kids to use at school, but I would not use it for those important occassions, when quality counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy introduction to digital photography","review":"Despite the low spec of the Mavica, it remains unbeaten for ease of use and convenience.

This camera fits the bill. I limit digital photography to web usage, sending pics via email, looking at pics on my computer or TV via DVD player, posting pics on eBay and hobby websites, etc. and this camera is perfect for those purposes. The use of floppy discs is particularly nice and so is the outstanding macro/close-up capability. If you plan to blow up pics fairly large and print them, a higher resolution camera may be preferable, but for 95% of my needs this camera is perfect and so much easier to use than my wife's fancy, expensive, high resolution camera with more of bells and whistles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a stupid buy","review":"[that much] for a 0.3 Megapixel camera?For that price you should get a much higher MP camera with a digital zoom. You'll get the same quality when you zoomed all the way in as you would with this camera's optical zoom. Actually, you might get better shots, since you should haveless camera shake.And you'd have a high MP camera instead of a cheesy 0.3 MP for close-up shots -- which is what you'll be shooting most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta havica my Mavica","review":"I'm a technophobe with limited computer and digital photography skills.

Floppy disc goes rignt into the PC..no, they don't hold a lot of pix. Image quality is pretty good (I'm a fisherman, so mostly I take pictures of some goofball holding a fish). I've taken worse pictures with better digicams, so I'm happy with this camera. Or was. My little freebie Mavica got wet...with salt water.

Now, it's a no-no for a 0.3mp camera at this price in 2003. Even if you only use pictures for web and it was 3 times cheaper, it was still not really a good choice. Memory is pretty cheap now.

They may not be sold in stores soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than a megapixel","review":"Sure the floppy is great for ease of use, but do you want to spend three hundred dollars on a camera with a resolution of less than one megapixel?

It's terrific. I really like the fact that it uses floppy disks. Using default resolution I get 25-30 images per disk. No extra software, no cables, just put the disk in your floppy drive and use explore. Easy easy easy! And lets face it, if you forget to pack disks you can get them ANY where. The picture quality is good. The camera is very easy to use.

No Mint Condition album has ever disappointed me and it's because every effort put into them is straight from the heart. This album was one of my favorites because it contained \\" So Fine \\" one of the most beautiful ballads I've ever heard. From the minute the album begans, Stokley's heavenly vocals takes you from the grips of Heaven to unchanted waters with blues and jazz sequences only Mint Condition could create. This is a MUST buy for Mint Condition fans and like their other albums, you get your money's worth and more!Long Live The Mint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic R&B","review":"The second release from Mint Condition follows closely on the heels of their successful debut. Principal vocalist Stokely has good presence, projects sincerity and earnestness on love songs, and reflects Stevie Wonder's influence. The backing vocals, arrangements, lyrics and production style aren't overloaded with electronics, strings or any other devices, and they balance a traditional soul sensibility with a 1990s approach. Several numbers are enjoyable, none are overpowering or unremarkable. Sometimes they move into light funk or new jack, but Mint Condition is best at sentimental, breezy love material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubtedly One Of The Best R&B Albums Of The 90s","review":"I first got hooked on this album when I heard \\"You Send Me Swingin'\\" on the car radio while driving home one night. That song is one of my all time favorites. The other song's on the album are excellent; smooth R&B with a jazz edge. Especially tracks like \\"Someone To Love\\", the very smooth electric guitars of \\"So Fine\\", and the jazzy feel of \\"Back To Your Lovin'\\". \\"Fidelity\\" is a slammin' song that sounds like Sly & The Family Stone but more amplified. A must have album for any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good To Be True!","review":"The very talented Mint Condition gives you more of what you're looking for...real music, quality musicianship, classically-written lyrics!

This book ostensibly addresses feminists, but it spends so little time actually addressing this point of view that it self-demonstrates the more inclusive, globalistic, humanistic that it posits. I particularly appreciated the combining of literary review with this new global social theory of identity formation. My only criticism would be that the highly specialized jargon Friedman uses can at first seem obstructive. Overall, invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if not terribly challenging contemporary poetry","review":"If you start by accepting that hip-hop is the only truly living style of verse in America today, the bar is not terribly high for a book of contemporary, mostly American poetry. That being said, the poems here are notable first for being contemporary and second for being consistently high-quality, if not always ground-breaking. The range of experiences, class and ethnic backgrounds of the poets are what you might expect from a progressive NPR show- fairly broad but ultimately safe; the introductions also read predictably like NPR intros.The women poets supply some of the best material; maybe Bowman's ear is especially attuned to irony and pathos of a particularly female type. But most importantly this collection contains many fresh voices and avoids falling back into tired material such as beat writers, with the notable exception of Diane Di Prima."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone-chilling story of a real psychopath","review":"I didn't read this book until after I'd read this author's other book that came out last year, She Wanted It All.

For therapist, parent or the depressed adolescent herself, it provides both left-brained and right-brained perspectives on this often hereditary disease. By alternating between clinical observations from her current counseling work, and creative writings from her own teen years, Keena gives us a window into the mind of the clinically depressed, at times offering some gems of poetic expression as well as tools for understanding. She also inspires us by showing how she survived the sometimes fatal disease in order to live a productive and happy adulthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work with Samsung Captivate","review":"FYI, this item does NOT work with the non-standard micro-USB slots on the Samsung Captivate.

I however have never heard a Randy Newman album I did not adore...in fact most of them are downright brilliant. OK, so this early one has Strings, is that supposed to be a bad thing? I do not see any problem with this album as it is, and I wouldn't respect my own record collection if this were not part of it.

She reminds me of the comment that Carlene Carter made years ago about putting the 'c*nt back into country'. Well Sarah certainly does that and more. Jesus she is tough! I got to see her live last night at the Old Town School of Folk Music here in Chicago and she just blasted off. She even LOOKED like she could be Carlene's daughter. Towards the end of her set she did a cover of Dylan's Outlaw Blues that was just unbelievable.This CD is so good it hurts. Sarah Borges is the REAL DEAL.

First off the motor was so loud it was terrible (louder than my gal's voice in some scenes). I took it up Mt Timpanogos and discovered that not only was it too loud, but the 360 degree mic was overpowered by even the smallest breezes, and colors of flowers and plants got totally washed out in bright sunlight (can be corrected by a filter). The B&W viewfinder is useless (I couldn't make out a deer standing in shadow 20 meters away) and the LCD is hard to see in bright sun. It was also way too heavy to carry in a pack all day. In low light conditions it gets very grainy (to be expected, but not to this degree). I returned it and now am trying a DCRTRV17.

Some good features are the night shot, ilink, and the different titles or modes that you can have. The ilink is for those that have a sony television so that you can plug a reciver in the back of the TV and the laser shoots from the camcorder to the reciver and you can play the movie without any cords. One thing they need to have is a light which will make it a better film. Otherwise the zoom is more than i need and the automatic focus reduces the shaking of the video.

It's very sparse and acoustic (the Mick Moss tracks at least.) There is a great cover of Trouble's Mr. White, taken to new depths of sorrow and doom. If you need an album to listen to while at your lowest, this is it. Duncan Patterson left the band after the recording of this, but judging from the strength of the Mick Moss penned tracks the band will carry on with no problems. Half of the tracks here are written and performed by Duncan, and the other half by Mick. So, fans of Duncan's work in Anathema will be pleased, and hopefully like Mick's songs just as much if not more. Highlights include \\"The Weight of the World,\\" \\"Mr White\\" and \\"A Portrait of the Young Man as an Artist.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Half Bad","review":"Fun. Worth reading. I enjoyed Harrison's commentaries and expositions on various subjects. Many interesting byways. But nothing totally unexpected in the plot -- no place where you suddenly stop reading, look up, and say, \\"Oh --- my --- god!!\\". Marred a little bit by several minor flaws in the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad","review":"Harrison can tell a great story, Manhattan Nocturne and Bodies Electric are terrific, but the Havanna Room simply blows polar bears. The first ten pages are great, they suck you into the story, but like the main character's life, the rest of the book unravels into a bizzare and untenable story line. I could forgive all that if the book would have been at least entertaining, but it wasn't. The worst part about the story was what actually happens in the Havanna Room. It's as much a dissappointment as the rest of the book. I'd pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly book masquerading as a mystery","review":"This book, advertised as \\"noir\\" mystery/thriller has a shallow and highly improbable as well as very convoluted plot. It hinges on interactions between a depressed attorney, a sexy restaurant hostess, a sick client, a Chinese chef and some off-the-wall mobsters. While this mix may sound potentially attractive it is based on some ubelievable suppositions, lousy editing and even contains spelling errors (\\"hyperbolic for 'hyperbaric'). I kept waiting for some satisfactory ending but it never came, just a shoddy tying-together of too many variables that never reached a believable level. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I loved Bodies Electric, Harrison's first book. Each one since I have loved less. This one I didn't even like. I read all the way to the end, hoping, I guess for some revelation that would surprise me. Instead, it started with an improbable concept - a guy who has been fired from his high-powered job, is basically bankrupt, and has no hopes of working for any real money again, decides to eat an an expensive steak house every single day. Why? Because the author needed him there to meet other characters and get the plot lumbering forward. Then you take more unlikely scenarios - an addiction like none you've ever heard of, a character whose sickness seems to wax and wane when it's called for by the plot, a bizarre suicide method - and what you are left with is an over-written mess that never surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD HAVE STOPPED AFTER FIRST 50 PAGES","review":"Havana Room started with an explosive, accidental death that could happen in the home of all of us. The resulting downward spiraling of the main character's life was stunningly sudden and believable. It seemed like we had the makings of another Bonfire of the Vanites where one wrong turn, one wrong decision, and everything can fall in on us all at once. Regretably, that's the highlight of this thoroughly absurd tale of characters one more wretched than the next. It was silly and repetitive with no character seemingly deserving of redemption or reconciliation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Not exactly what I would call a thriller and certainly not erotic (prudish actually), The Havana Room is ok if you want to read about an overweight, white, real estate lawyer (a wannabe “master of the universe�? who faces a major crisis and is forced to slum around with the normal people for a couple of months before regaining all that he has lost. Oh, and there’s narcotic sushi too.Racist and sexist, this poorly written novel ultimately reifies white, male, upper-class privilege. The fact that the New York Times favorably reviewed this Grisham-esque pseudo-noir TWICE is the biggest mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"I'd give this book no stars if I could. I liked nothing about it -- all of the characters are unpleasant and poorly drawn. They don't act like real people or speak like real people, and the things that happen to them aren't things that would happen in real life. The \\"style\\" is off-putting as well. I mean, should you really notice that a book has a \\"style\\" when you're reading it? Usually, I don't like to speculate on the marketablity of a book (I like to think that writers aren't writing merely for market) but in this case that's the only way to put anything positive in this review. I imagine this book might appeal to a small segment of middle-aged male readers, but it's not bright, brave or new enough to appeal to younger, savvier readers and it's got nothing in it at all that would appeal to women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, compelling read","review":"Is there a better novelist crafting well-written, utterly engaging stories about Manhattan than Colin Harrison? I doubt it. He locks you in from page one, dazzles you with superb writing, and fills the pages with daring plot twists. This is a story about a lawyer, who after an accidental mishap, loses his wife, child, career and dignity until he happens to stumble into a midtown steakhouse with a mysterious private room called...you guessed it. This is really a book about losing a child (either through death or divorce), but we're clearly not in Oprah-ville. Some things strain credibility (like how does an unemployed lawyer down on his luck afford lunch and dinner EVERY DAY in a steakhouse?) and the plot gets a little too tricky at times, but it's easy to ignore these faults because of Harrison's huge writing talent which breathes life into his characters and Manhattan. I, for one, couldn't put it down. I wish he would write faster...I can't wait for his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"This is a multi-layered urban thriller. The story is excellent and Mr. Harrison neatly ties up every loose thread, but what may be more interesting is the off beat commentary on life in the early 21st century.

I bought these boots, they were great, but one size too big. So I tried to exchange them. Amazon doesn't do exchanges.....apparently too difficult. On top of this, the price doubled after I bought them, so now if I want the boots, Amazon will not honor the previous price.

They work very well as night lights - not too bright but just bright enough to see the floor, stairs, etc. They are very good in a power outage, creating even a brighter light. I also like that they are LED, so I don't have to worry about replacing a bulb. Finally, the flashlight is also useful when a flashlight is needed quickly. It doesn't replace a larger flashlight, but is good for looking under beds, and such.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"As bright as u need it to be!","review":"I noticed a cool feature that I don't think ayone else mentioned. If your house has lights on faders, then you'll notice too that this little light fades up and down proportionally to how bright the surrounding area is! Meaning: as u turn down your lights, the emergency light gets brighter. Nifty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my purposes","review":"I rent, and the bathroom has no window. I wanted an emergency light so that I would be able to get out of the shower okay if the power went out. For that specific purpose this light is great. I don't mind the nightlight staying on basically all the time, and it's really nice at night not to have to blind myself with the overhead lights. The light gets brighter if the power goes out (or you unplug it), bright enough not to bump into anything. I think the flashlight is decent- at least in a total blackout. It doesn't block the other outlet. So for use in my small bathroom, this is what I wanted.The negative is that right out of the package I can hear something inside rattling around. It works fine, but the rattling can't be a good sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lights","review":"These emergency lights work great. You can also use it as a flash light.

Hard to set in the \\"Emergency light\\" position.- Poor battery. Let it charging overnight and unplugged it in the morning. It was totally discharged the next morning.

We actually have to turn it off, which then defeats the auto on in case of power failure mode. We just have to put it places that it won't disturb our sleep due to the illumination.

I put them in two hallways and the basement. The light output is enough to let you see where you are going, but not so bright as to be annoying at night. When you first turn out the lights and these kick in, they seem dim, but after your eyes adjust a bit, they seem to be just the right amount of illumination. They are defnitely not floodlight-style backup lights like you would see in a commerical stairwell, but they suit my needs well.They seem a bit inexpensively made, but you aren't paying a fortune for them either. They do seem to make the adjacent socket a close fit for another electrical plug, but not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them.. highly recommend .","review":"Love them.. highly recommend .

Recently I ordered an additional 3 and only 1 was working so I had to send the other 2 back.Biggest general problem is that depending on your outlets, they can cover both plugs so you can't put anything else there.Best thing is that after 2 years we finally had a power outtage at night and I got to see how bright these really were. Couldn't believe the great light they threw. I was glad they were in my bedroom, bathroom and kitchen. I recommend these lights BUT, I believe from other reviews AND my latest experience, the products can be irregular and not work properly when you order them.As I stated before I have 3 from two years ago and they work perfectly.The merchant is refunding my money from the latest purchase without an objection and they were packaged beautifully.

Next brownout I noticed it didn't light up, went to try & it only worked as a flashlight. Saved it in the junk drawer at least for that use, but by the end of the week it wouldn't work at all anymore, even though I tried recharging it. It's a good concept, but useless if it only works for a few weeks. If it's bad batteries, I'd rather have something I have to put my own instead of this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy and affordable","review":"I bought this for my parents, after they experienced a power outage at night and had trouble finding their flashlights. So this is now in their bedroom. At first, I didn't like the idea of the little red light being on all of the time, but it does make it easier to locate it at night (but when the power isn't out). They haven't experienced another outage for me to confirm that it lights up when the power goes out - certainly when I pull it out of the outlet, it just is \\"off\\". It's nice that it has the option of being a nightlight also, but it'd be a white light, which they don't care for as much as their other blue nightlight. I have used it as a flashlight - it's handy to have, but not exactly ergonomically designed - it's wide and flat. It leaves the other outlet available, which is important in their house. I don't think you'd go wrong with this one. You may also want to look at the battery-powered LED motion sensor lights - VERY handy to mount at stairways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploded","review":"When I received this unit I plugged it in and noticed the nightlight came on even though the room was bright.

A no-no by many accounts, the attempt by Richard Attenborough to recount the story of Ernest Hemingway and his love affair with a WWI nurse starts as something promising. Yet, the promise is broken in the first four minutes, and the viewer is left to dwindle among the every-so-long plot, which seems to have no sense of balance. While the movie may be accurate as far as the real story goes, it is certainly not entertaining enough. The actors do what they can to contribute emotion and gumption into their characters, yet this, along with well-designed sets and scenery, is not enough to give moviegoers what they want.

I hate to say this, but they both really stunk. The beginning seemed promising, especially as we got to know the hospital residents. But then Hemingway (O'Donnell) had to start acting like a butt-head, and then the love affair...and then the ending! Jeez louise, it stunk the skunks out of their burrows.

Sure Chris and Sandra have starred in romantic movies, but they are unoriginal, and just like the next. Chris O'Donnell was the last person who should have been picked for the role of such a noteworthy and distinguished American author. This movie puts Ernest Hemmingway to shame. Which is a complete disaster. Where was the build-up of true love? This movie bounced from one scene to the next, without ever convincing me Agnes and Ernest were truly in love. This movie did not deserve the accolades it received from the critics. It has the potential to be excellent, if there were different actors in the roles of Agnes and Ernest.

This camera allowed me to take video footage and import it to my computer. I would then edit it and re-record it back onto the camera. I would either send the movies out over e-mails or put them onto a DVD disk or record then onto a regular VHS. The camera has been in Korea then back to the US and then over to Afghanistan. Because it has held up to all of that I give it a 4 star review. This camera has had no problems what so ever. I did buy a larger battery for it. It now records forever before the battery dies. You may also want a larger memory stick if you want to buy one also. I have the 4MB and it holds 32 pictures. A 16MB would do fine for everday pictures. The resolution is only 640 x 480. It is not made for taking pictures but more for recording. I hope this review helps someone out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't touch it with a bargepole","review":"This Digicam sulks..I used it for < 2years and it has gone kaput.

Terrible pictures, it isn't worth the extra $$. However, the camera recently broke, despite extremely mild usage. The camera will no longer close with a cassette inside.

I have been an aerospace historian for more than 30 years and have a personal collection of more than 1,000 documents relating to the space program. It appears that the documents on the CD have been copied from poor-quality micro-fiche (at best) and are totally useless. One cannot read the legend on most of the illustrations.

From the mid-' 60s to the mid-'80s, packs of self contained singers, rhythm sections and horn players ruled the land.They were not only able to reproduce records exactly as you heard them on the radio, the amazing showmanship chops, dazzling choreography and charisma.Though their reputations were rarely staked upon it, most of these bands were well versed in all styles of music.Beyond R&B;, they could usually hold their own in whatever vibe was called for. But as disco morphed into techno and classic soul strains, and records began to be more producer-powered (Jimmy Jam And Terry Lewis Production) than musician-driven, bands slowly faded from the landscape. One band had the fortitude, talent and multiplicity to keep the torch not just lit, but BLAZING. That band is (Solo)...I Love this guys... Best Grop so far...

I found myself becoming attached to them as if they were part of my own circle of friends.Ms. Murphy creates a remarkable story which shows the importance of not only having friends, but being a friend.Grace is a story of healing and one of intercessary prayer.

It makes a great gift; share it with someone you love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puff piece","review":"While this film might be moderately interesting to those who don't know much about '70's American cinema, it's a dud to anyone who has seen most of the landmark films of that decade. Coppola,Scorsese, etc. are revered in this Docu, and you have to wonder if the interviewers intentionally skipped over some of the problems of a directors having too much freedom. Only Scorsese gives some mention of 'New York, New York' being a dud, while there's no mention of half the insanity that went on during Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now', although it's been well documented in the film \\"Hearts of Darkness\\".If you want to watch something better, buy \\"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\\".

The basic premise of the movie is: its okay to cheat the IRS; change your identity and that of your 13 year old son to avoid going to jail; lie about your kid's age so that he can play another year of little league (with an 80 mph fast ball no less); embarrass your City and sponsor, your teammates and their parents, and Little League, Inc.-- as long as you can throw 80 mph and beat those lieing over-agers from Cuba to 'win' the Little League World Series. Oh, and when you do get out of jail for lieing and cheating and breaking all sorts of laws, all is foregoven, and by golly its time to get back to baseball!

Down in New Orleans.Michael Curtiz directed this - one of the great noir filmmakers ie.,Mildred Pierce w/ Joan Crawford. I love his directing.

His rise from butcher to the leading cattleman of his time is a testament to his skills, knowledge, and wisdom, both in regard to beef cattle as well as people.

I love that I can set my camera at a wide variety of angles and heights and all of the changes are pretty easy and fast. My only small gripe is the wide stance of the legs.

The sound is not rich and they eat batteries amazingly fast, then begin to buzz. I do not recommend these speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not impressed","review":"I needed a basic set of speakers for my office, and a portable set like this looked like a good choice.

I have to say that I was amazed by the sound quality and the power these little speakers produce. Sure, I'm not an expert - but they sound way better than most speakers in general (even bigger ones) and they're perfect for the traveller as they are quite small and foldable.The other day I decided to buy an extra set for my friend (who has a laptop with awful sounding speakers) so I went online to check the prices on the Panasonic RPSPT70 - I NEVER thought it would be so cheap. It's not even half the price of most products in the same category! I've been looking at several alternatives in the store and the Panasonic RPSPT70 sounds much, much better than most of them.

They sound slightly better than your average alarm-clock radio.

It's a little bigger than a thermos and puts out excellent sound and rich bass.Gave this one a 4 star because while it's not the best quality, it's cheap and portable so if it gets damaged or lost, no sweat.

When the switch is in the off position, you can use them as passive speakers--meaning that they don't use the speaker batteries, but you have to turn up the volume on your source all the way. This is great option if you have a rechargeable player and need only moderate volume. When you do use the speaker power, you can turn it up quite loud for such small speakers. This is a great set of speakers, and a total bargain; I'd have paid $40 for them. The only downside is that there doesn't seem to be a power supply available to plug them in--so you'll go through batteries if you want it loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow..","review":"This large of sound, with this small of speakers?I am amazed by the sound quality of these speakers.

His unpleasantness wouldn't matter so much if the book wasn't, in a sense, a diary, the kind of book where the reader is thrust into the company of the writer from beginning to end.There are also lots of lyrical descriptions of snow, rocks, ice, mountains, etc.; other people may go for that sort of stuff, but I found it self-indulgent and pointless.

Not only is Bunky an amazing musician he is also a wonderful person. His compassion and caring for his students is legendary. There is a reason that Down Beat voted him into the Hall of Fame as an educator. He also belongs there as a musician as well. Only problem there is that his talents are better known in the music industry than by the general public. Possibly recordings such as this will help rectify the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Documentary","review":"As mentioned in other reviews, if you are a fish enthusiast and especially an African cichlid enthusiast then this is a must have. It offers incredible insight into the fish that we all love and keep in our home tanks.

It was without a doubt the most helpful thing in making a wise choice since there were conflicting ideals regarding the accessiblity to activities if you live in the middle of a city versus the convenience and quality of life of living in a new suburb. In the end, I decided that Mr. Rybczynski had made all the arguments and fleshed them out beautifully allowing me to also discover the value of living in a very old, very close-in suburb. The architecture is interesting, the communities are set up to be cooperative, the drive is quite short to downtown and the only thing I am missing is mega-stores and malls in my neighborhood. This book makes it clear that there are many ways to look at the issue of \\"whatever happened to city life that I once knew.\\" I could not put it down.

I've had cats all my life, and finally got rid of our hard-sided cat carrier when our oldest cat died last spring. When we adopted two kittens in the fall, the person we adopted them from lent us her folding carrier, which she had used for a long time.The construction is solid, and the carrier is both sturdy and spacious enough for two cats. That is folds up is a major plus, as I live in an apartment and do not have much storage space. The mat on the floor slides around, but it's nothing that stitching in a little velcro couldn't fix. I wish some of the other colors were more readily available through Amazon, but beggars can't be choosers. Overall, I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for 2 cats","review":"I needed a lightweight carrier to transport two large 'Maine Coon' cats who alone are not featherweights. This works beautifully. The mesh might be an issue if cats were destructive when confined or stressed but if not this is a great carrier.

He gets the patterns wrong from the start and then spends pages working his way out of the traps that he has set for himself.Please do not buy this book, unless you are looking for somehting to amaze your friends with.

Another gem is the author's suggestion that there should be a central repository for singleton instances.Was this chapter even reviewed? I can only assume that the whole book is of this low quality so for your own sanity and the betterment of mankind do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic introduction","review":"This book provides an easy introduction to design patterns. The book moves easily from subject to subject and the material covered is refreshing and novel. Too many Java books do nothing to illuminate important design concepts but simply rehash well-worn concepts, i.e. what is an object, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. This book provides an excellent introduction to design patterns, an important tool in the lexicon of programmers, through good prose and concise examples that highlight the similarities and differences of the various patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing attempt at a worthy goal","review":"Like other reviewers here, I had hoped that this book would offer a more approachable look at the GoF design patterns. Instead I found it to be confusing in places, wildly inaccurate in others (Cooper mistakenly identifies the WindowAdapter class as an example of the Adapter pattern, for example), and filled with bad examples and poorly written code. I ended up putting this book aside and investing the extra time in rereading GoF and I would strongly recommend that others do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regurgitation of the GoF","review":"I don't think this book is any clearer than the GoF. I feel that the material presented in this book is pretty much the same as that of the GoF. Instead I would recommend: \\"Design Patterns Explained, by Alan Shalloway\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author doesn't understand the patterns he's explaining","review":"I liked the writing style of this book. It is much clearer and understandable than any other pattern book out there, but it has one major flaw... the author doesn't understand patterns either! Here's one example... Template. Easy! Take an algorithm, put it in an ancestor class and extend it, then implement the steps of the algorithm. I just explained it. However, Cooper misses the most important part: the algorithm!! Instead, the section labelled \\"Template\\" is in fact not about the Template pattern, but a decent explanation about how to use abstract classes. I looked in my copy of GoF and re-read the Template pattern section. It's only about 10 pages long and is explained fully on the first page. This may be the worst example from the book, and other templates he explains pretty well. For someone new to patterns however, it's very misleading if every third pattern isn't correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont think this book worth my time to read","review":"well, i have Pattern in Java at home, and this book at my working place, compare 2 books, i like previous one much better.

It explains patterns as if they are solutions to recurring problems. Gee, I thought that's what they are? Well, they are - to some extent. They are more about a way to think. The problem with patterns as design solutions is that they don't help you until it is too late. Design Patterns Explained talks about why patterns are good solutions. You can then use this information on any project."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK! You will regret it.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and wish I had done even a small amount of research prior to purchasing it.As others have noted, the examples are difficult to follow. The editing is non-existent; the reader has to spend way to much time deciphering the examples to make them useful.Code snippets are internally inconsistent (at least with regards to code style), code snippets are duplicated across pages, references are made to objects that you haven't been introduced to.At this point, I'm nearly halfway through this book after repeated attempts to read it through (its not very long -- 300+ pages) and cannot say my grasp of Design Patterns, as applied to Java, is much better than when I started.Go online and follow tutorials. You'll find better information.The fact that this book retails for [$$$] should be at least a misdemeanor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is the worst book I have read on java design patterns. The writting, like the author's column on java-pro magazine and his book on java, is unclear, at times even somewhat goofey. Most examples are strange and irrelevant to IT professionals. Over all, it reads as if the author is talking to himself while sleep walking. Programs provided on the CD are also pieces of pointless show offs and overkills, This book is hastly put together. It is clearly not written for anyone who wants to learn the subject"},{"rating":"1","title":"The poor examples hamper my understanding","review":"I am not an expert on design patterns so I won't tell about the validity of the concepts written here. However, I am very upset that the author has chosen examples that are not familiar to the average programmer. I dont understand about five of the patterns discussed because of the examples. I have to do my own research to find out how a swimming competition works. Instead of making the readers quickly grasp the main idea of each pattern, the author may have probably applied his own interest on those \\"out of this world\\" examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, filled with typos, poor examples.","review":"There is a tremendous need for a good, readable book that teaches design patterns in a way that the average reader can understand and follow and which uses Java for code examples. Unfortunately, this is not that book.In a session at JavaOne 2000, the author stated that he wrote this book as part of his process of learning about patterns, and it's clear throughout the book that he didn't have a full grasp of the patterns he was writing about. For example, on page 80 he mistakenly identifies Java's AWT adapter classes (such as MouseAdapter) as being examples of the Adapter pattern. They are not.In addition, as other reviewers have pointed out, the book is riddled with typos and also suffers from poorly chosen code examples. Given all these problems, I cannot recommend this book at all for anyone interested in learning more about patterns.

The book might have some value for interviews(lot of interviewers ask about patterns during job interview) but at times is very confusing. The author goes back and forth on explaining things.

The author clearly has no real comprehension of any of the patterns he purports to describe. His examples are bug-ridden, have hideous style, and often totally contradict the text. Simply comparing his class diagrams with those in the GoF book indicates that his code has almost no correlation with the actual patterns. Couple that with a frighful lack of basic Java knowledge and you have something that will only serve to damage young designers. As a concrete example: the Prototype pattern means, to Cooper, that your class has a clone method. That's it. And he can't even write *that* properly, and instead gives a thoroughly incorrect exposition of how Java cloning works.Stay far, far away.

Turned out they had differnt priorities - he was intomaking the best time, and she was more interested in seeing the people and land. The result is that, for about 180 pages out of 268 we get to read her complaining about the man. I understand that sometimes you get into a situation that is so bad that you lose all perspective, but I would hope that the author had reflected a little more before writing the book. She identifiesmale/female power struggles as the problem, but does little to figure out, even in retrospect, how it happened and how she could avoid this trap in the future. I know that she had to interact with people to buy food, for instance, but she focuses so stongly on the relationship that she rarely writes about people.

Just Kane's way of writing itself is poor and difficult to follow. He pretends to explain things yet he really does not. One example of many is that he says that \\"outside an atom there is a residual electromagnetic force that binds atoms to molecules.\\" This is blatantly incorrect. Molecules are held together by sharing electrons that are w/in the atom. The electrons can then become delocalized and stray from their normal orbit (based on electronegativity) however his statement implies a world made up of ions... the world is not made of NaCl. This is just one example of many mistakes the author makes. I am finding it difficult to even get through this book. In addition to the mistakes the author does a horrible job of explaining himself while he dumbs it down at many parts he does so too much while at the same time he introduces concepts with out introducing them. Don't waste the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superymmetry at the wrong level","review":"In his review of Gordon Kane's book Supersymetry, R.J. Fokkink bad raps Witten. The book doesn't claim to be co-authored by Witten and states only that the Forward was written by Witten--which he did.The correct level for a book on a complicated subject such as supersymmetry is, of course, the author's first challenge and I believe that Kane shot too low. The \\"layman\\" will probably find the whole subject pretty dull and the \\"informed layman\\" familiar with the basics of the standard model won't find much that he or she didn't already know. I wish Kane and the physicists at Fermilab luck in finding a super particle in the next few years, but will be on the lookout for a more informative book on supersymmetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to this book. Supersymmetry is such a fascinating subject, it is even more fascinating if nature turns out to be indeed supersymmetric. However this book, is written in such a style that it assumes that the readers IQ is below 50. The author throughout the book tells the reader that some of the details are too complicated for the reader to comprehend. He avoids using any equations, or in that case any significant mathematical examples that are above the level of a 5th grader. However he does explain the Higgs Boson pretty well.

My rating of the book, when finished, will be much higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band no one knows about","review":"Devil in a Woodpile is a great band. I saw them live at SXSW in austin. They play a great mix of old time Delta Blues, the best song on the album is a Charlie Patton cover called Shake it or Break it. If you like blues, buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining mix of instruments, vocals and choice of songs","review":"I stumbled over Devil In A Woodpile in Chicago when these guys played before the Asylum Street Spankers last November. The style of both groups has some similarity: Mostly accoustic instruments, no or very little use of demon electricity and a great sense of humor.In Your Lonesome Town captures their live act very nicely. Sherry's special style of singing is fun to listen to. He uses his organ with a rythm, almost as if he tries to imitate a drum set. The only thing I hoped would be more prominent is the tuba. The instrument was an essential part of the concert I attended. It is heard on the CD but somehow a bit burried in the mix. But this is only a minor drawback. I love to listen to this CD in the car. Upbeat and great to sing a long. Highly reccommended for anybody who likes Bar Blues and doesn't mind some Swing and Jug Band influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its more like \\"Devil in a CD pile\\"","review":"Its this Rootsy, country, folk sound with other instruments in the mix.I'm not buying it........oops I did, I wish I hadn't.I read the reviews and it sounded pretty good but to my dismay it was far from good.Maybe they needed help mixing it in the studio?! the vocals stick out like a sore thumb, maybe thats what they were going for but it doesn't work.Apparently they're good live, I'd pay cover to see them but would not pay anymore on a CD.I do like the ability to use a clarinet, tuba, kazoo and a jug.Yes there's the Broonzy and Charlie Patten covers but they're nothing stellar."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally something that might last","review":"These bump stops are shaped very close to the factory originals, except that, these are polyurethane, way better. I have been replacing the original stops with the more commonly available tapered and round stops. When the frame comes down on the axle, which is round, it defects it forward or backward, and it doesn't take too long before it shears it off at it's metal attachment. These are longer and like the originals will hit square on and should last a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Significantly larger than stock","review":"I purchased these for use on my 2001 F250 to make carrying my truck camper more stable. It's a pretty dramatic improvement when the camper is loaded. The rear suspension had to move nearly 2 inches before the factory overload spring came into play. With these extension on it comes into play all the time. With the camper loaded, these extensions significantly improve the latteral stability, and ride quality while reducing rear sag.The downside is that because the overload springs are engaged even when the truck is unloaded, ride quality unloaded has degraded somewhat. Optimally these would be .5 inches shorter for my specific application, to allow for a little smoother unloaded ride quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The toy that fell apart on Christmas!","review":"This horse trailor is not durable, it started to fall apart within two hours of opening the package and playing with it.

Anyway, first a window popped out then another then the back window then the bumper fell off and on and on it went...I felt horrible for her. So, I DO NOT recommend this toy for anyone. It was not worth the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will fall apart within minutes!","review":"Bought this toy for a birthday gift. The toy arrived and the doors were already broken off of the trailer. This toy is EXTREMELY cheaply made.

The patterns are very child-like and may be appropriate if one was quilting for a baby or child. The book is nicely segmented by area (bird, animals etc.) Very few instructions, only the basics. For me, it wasn't worth the price and had I had the chance to see it before purchasing, it would not be in my library. A good choice if you want a way to quilt outlines of animals, plants, and birds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth","review":"This book what a wonderul look at friendship, mistakes and truth. In the beginning of the book, I wanted to find out the truth just as much as reporter Laura. In the end, I felt the same as she did : empty & sad. The truth does not always set you free.I loved the setting of this book, a few weeks after September 11, in New York City. Although the events of that day have nothing to do per se with the events, it does set them in motion. It's my first book by this author and I was left marvelling at the beautiful prose, the wordly expressions and the images it all brought up for me.This book deserves a lot more press then it has had so far. Pick it up, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up.","review":"I wanted to like this novel. Having never read one of Rozan's novels before, I did not know what to expect. What I found was a confusing mess of alternating viewpoints, unlikeable characters, and long-winded flashbacks which did nothing other than add pages to an already lengthy book. I gave up reading 3/4 of the way through--I just found myself getting annoyed with the pace and alternating narratives. Too bad, because the subject should have inspired an amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome To the world of dark Pop","review":"This is the sounds of a new generation. This cd has a voice, And that voice is the sound of a new erra of pop-rock. I call this Dark pop. This cd pioneers the first in the real combination of Rap/Rock/Techno/ and soft poetry like ryhmes. With songs like \\"clint eastwood\\" and \\"tommorow comes today\\", the others songs are up to par with these powerful singles. The rap aspect is in this cd are when it needs to be, and does not drive the whole of the cd's songs with heavy rap. The songs which do contain rap (\\"clint eastwood\\" and \\"rock da house\\") only makes the cd stronger. The rest of the cd is a look into a whole underground of dark pop. The soft rock is supported by mind-melding ryhmes , and lyrics that leave you thinking. The cd does a justice to music. Join the dark pop and become one of the gorillaz."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"this cd is great. too bad only six songs are good. but those six are some of the coolest songs out there. #2,5,7,9,10,11. so yeah, if you wanna spend 15 dollars for 6 songs, then go ahead, its worth it. thanks for your time and good evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I can't Stand some people telling you that the only good song is Clint Eastwood. Sure Clint Eastwood is a great song, but other ones like 19-2000 amd Latin Simone are great too! Starshine has a great guitar chorus for example. Altogether, the whole CD Is great and not slotted into genres"},{"rating":"2","title":"gorillaz kick ...","review":"this cd rocks. i like this cd. the best song is rock the house.the rest of the cd is great.it has some djing.my bro rob burnedme a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinal tap without the laughs","review":"This album is supposed to be some sort of parody, but I never understood it and neither does anyone I know .

If you're looking for a quick high, then this is it! This group mixes everything from rap, funk, and rock to produce a strange, funkadelic sound that really is unlike anything else I've ever heard. If you're tired of the usual mainstream stuff, then you owe it to yourself to get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorillaz inconsistant but mostly good","review":"there is surely something for everyone on this cd. everything from rap to latin. I couldnt figure out why it has a parental advisory though. I only heard 5 swears on the whole album. It is worth the money to buy it though, so go out and get it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique, interesting, and enjoyable CD","review":"When I heard the Gorillaz for the first time, it was, of course, their single \\"Clint Eastwood\\". Judging by the single, I assumed the CD was rap. I am not much of a rap fan, but it was unique enough to warrant a purchase. Imagine my surprise when I found the CD was not rap but, I'm not sure what to call it, so I'll say techno-pop w/rap-style beats. Anyway, on a first listen, I thought it 'bit.' After a few times, however, I realized it was actually a cool CD, with interesing vocal styles, cool beats, and very unique music. While there are a few songs I don't like, all in all it's a pretty good CD. I highly recommend it, mainly because it is unlike anything else I have heard before, but don't expect \\"Clint Eastwood\\". The rest of the CD is like the single, minus the rapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Del?!?","review":"When I heard \\"Clint Eastwood,\\" I was expecting to hear more from Del throughout the album.

It has about 4 desent songs and all other once are a waist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Total/Pure [edit]","review":"Horrible, The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was because Clint Eastwood is really that good, but that is it.

When I saw the video of Clint Eastwood for the first time, I thought to myself WOW. I immediately picked up the record, and was very disappointed to say the least. I read a few online reviews of this record earlier (some good, many bad) and then decided to buy it. If for nothing else than the song Clint Eastwood.Well, I put it into my player and started to play the first few tracks. Hmmm, OK, let's skip one, another one...wait where is Clint Eastwood. Ah, finally, Track 5, Clint Eastwood. Good song, after that...let's skip this one too, not my music. At the end of Track 11 I think to myself \\"What the hell?\\" This is getting worse by the minute...I don't know, some people might like rap-funk hybrids like this. It is not me.Go listen to the entire record before you purchase. Then you will decide whether it is worth it. My copy is on eBay however. Ohhh, 2 stars were given for the cartoon characters. They are damn cool...True."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huh?","review":"I first heard/saw the Clint Eastwood video on the internet, and after a few weeks, I was just dying to buy the CD. So I brought it home, popped it in, and my god, I've never heard anything like this. The songs are nothing like Clint Eastwood, but they have a lot of very weird attributes. For those who like rock and roll, this CD is not for you. It never gets up that rock and roll \\"beat\\".Its so weird, this CD almost makes me cry for two reasons: one, the songs are very haunting and atmospheric, very other worldy. Two, the bad part is it always seems to want to evolve to something beyond the Hip-Hop beats I think its restrained to.I don't know what to make of this CD, its so depressing in some parts, then it becomes Hip-Hop, and I wake up from that coma I was in from all of that sleepy, very surreal music. I swear this stuff is more potent than any hallucinating drug. Listening to it has left me speechless. I can't decide whether I like it or not, but I can say one thing:Oh My God"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet CD!","review":"To those who think that Gorillaz are just a marketing scheme, I can say with confidence that they are wrong. Not only are the videos fun and the website rockin', but the CD is a surprise. It covers many genres, from hip-hop to punk. The beats are catchy and fused well with the lyrics.The particular CD I have is apparently the UK version, since it has remixes of \\"Clint Eastwood\\" and \\"19-2000\\", so I can't speak for \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Left-Hand Suzuki Method\\", but I can definately say that the main portion of the CD rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont believe the people who say its bad.","review":"Dont believe those guys. They dont know what they talk about because they have a bad sense of music. I play bass so I know. So I would recomend this because its good and you dont get in trouble for listening to it even though there is literaly no cuss words.

That way if the computer crashes I have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have album","review":"Very interesting! There is songs for rappers,rockers, or even both and if you get in to the music there is the G-sides (yes it is the b-side of the gorillaz) and Laika Come Home the dub version of the songs. If you have enough money to buy it? Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Automator is King Midas...","review":"...because everything he touches is golden. I think this is some of his best work, too. He's already wowed anybody who picked up his other producing efforts (Dr. Octagon, Handsome Boy Modelling School, Deltron 3030, etc.), but this is amazing. To hear his sampling genious behind trip-hop and rock songs is so... fun! I don't know how else to describe it. It's just a wonderful listen. Of course the producing wouldn't amount for much if he wasn't allied with great artists, and Damon, Miho, and Del don't disappoint. Props to Jamie Hewlett for the concept of this group, which is so refreshing in this age of photogenic boy bands and teenage divas churning out crap on a weekly basis. Let me get this straight, is he on base, too? It doesn't matter! And that's what is great about this band! I hope 2-D, Russel, Noodle, and Murdoc keep at it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Experimentation at its almost finest","review":"First of all, if you are planning on buying this cd to hear songs like Clint Eastwood, forget about it. Only one or two other songs on the cd are similar at all. At first, that made me hate this cd. I'm glad I changed my mind. (If you like the rapping parts in Clint Eastwood, they are done by an artist known as Del The Funky Homosapien. He is very good, check him out.) Anyway...this is a really solid cd. The influences are very eclectic, drawing from Brit pop and Electronic and mixing samples to boot. This is one of the albums that need to be listened to as a whole, but some standouts are Clint Eastwood, Sound Check, Dracula, Double Bass, 19-2000 (featured in a cingular wireless commercial i believe), and Rock the House."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny, ugly and tornillo.","review":"inspired for children? or created for destroy MASSES? .......listen this record,SUPERTOYS...or something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting project, but criminally overrated...","review":"This effort is probably one of the biggest hyped albums of the year, mainly due to the fact that Gorillaz is a very interesting project. I mean, an animated band...it's a brilliant idea. But let's stick to the music, shall we? The album's highlight is without a doubt the smash hit single \`Clint Eastwood'. And fellow singles \`19-2000' and \`Rock The House' are OK too, but the rest of the album is an utter letdown. It seems as if the people behind this project had a rush making this album, because most of the songs are dull, monotonous and definitely not interesting. Don't let the singles fool you. The album really isn't that good at all! Actually, the best thing about Gorillaz is their excellent animated videos. Maybe, if you're a real hip hop fan (or as I call it \`Brit Hop') you might dig this debut. It's not my thing, I guess..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Music Cartoons Ever","review":"I love Gorilaz they ment so much to me with there song \\"Clint Eastwood.\\" I got so into them and nowIjust addicted I drew some pictures of them too.They're great with their mix of Punk,Rock,and Hip-Hop.I dedicated my voice to sound like the music.And after so much practice I finally did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like I expected","review":"I bought this cd thinking it would have songs like clint eastwood. I was wrong. There are only two songs that are good on this cd. They are clint eastwood and the clint eastwood remix. The rest of the songs are very slow paced and just weird. I definitely don't recomend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't think it was going to be that weird","review":"All I can say is weird. Aside from Clint Eastwood and maybe Rock the House, there is just a lot of tracks with people saying things you can't understand. I warn you, I'm not saying that I totally hate this cd. I just believe you have to be in one of those weird moods to listen to it in its entirety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent animation, less than great music","review":"I think that Gorillaz is more for fans of animation than fans of music. I fell in love with that little line that shows up on Murdoc's butt as he's thrusting himself around on the \\"Rock the House\\" video, but just listening to the CD was disappointing. Am I the only one who thinks that the music doesn't live up to the visuals?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"I tried really hard to like it, but it's just simply, not good. If you ask me, it sounds like it' trying way too hard. Too hard to be important, different, or art for art's sake. It's chockful of boring trip-hop throwbacks, watered-down rock, awful rap, to stuff like 5/4, which is actually not that bad. It's uneven, too long, the lyrics are nonexistent, it's boring, it's just a waste of time. The only reason it's popular is because they make cool videos/it's rap/people are easily led to believe if they're buying something cool, they're nonconformists. I usually end reviews like this with something like, \\"if you want good trip-hop, go get ---\\" but I can't think of one. Bleh. Keep the emo/punk/rock alive. Go buy a Get Up Kids album and experience a little emotion and creativity in your music. I'm out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is an incredibly good CD,i picked it randomly looking for new artists.Its definately the most unique music ive heard in a long time.Its the perfect blend of hip hop,pop,punk,rock,and almost everything else.It has its own genre,everybody who likes music at all should add this to their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Mind","review":"The Gorillaz CD \\"Gorillaz\\" is not my personal favorite. Some people seem to like their disturbing lyrics and odd sound vibe. I will admit, there were a few times when I thought to myself, \\"This could be something.\\" But then again, there were many times when I paused the cd player to say, \\"What do people see in them???\\" More often than never, I paused the cd player to ponder over this. One of my friends loves Gorillaz, and me, being open minded, decided to see what he sees in them. I cannot. My brother liked them, so he had the cd. To listen to this cd, you need an open mind, and plenty of time to stop the cd player and say, \\"What is appealing about them?\\" I give this cd 2 stars, and say that I do not understand what IS appealing about the bad lyrics and bad singing. The beats are ok, but I'd rather them be set to another song."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it","review":"I like the song Clint Eastwood, so even after reading so many mixed reviews I ordered the CD. The CD is like a mixture of every style of music that exist. It is bound to have at least one song you will like, however, not many people buy a CD for one song.Personally, I am going to tape that one song I like and sell the CD. I listened to it several times, hoping it would grow on me. I tried, but no interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"S Club 7 + Vanilla Ice = The Gorillaz","review":"Albums don't get worse or more formulaic than this, folks. Clint Eastwood is the worst hit song of any genre over the last two years, and this album doesn't sound anything like Clint Eastwood - it sounds even worse. The cartoon characters desperately grasp for anything interesting to say 'n' play, but this all stuff you have heard before. Junior high school couples compose more interesting poetry to one another, and the talented scratchers and musicians on this album mail in their roles. There are no words to explain how cloying and dumb this disaster of a CD is. I will never buy another Blur album in protest of this Gorillaz insult. I like Blur; however, I hate Gorillaz passionately and look forward to waking up in the morning safe in the knowledge no followup album is forthcoming to further waste precious MTV and radio time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am sorry but this album is really really really bad.

IS THIS THING GETTING 4 STARS!!!","review":"Before I took a look at this page I had assumed that everyone along with me had found this whole cd to be nothing but complete track. I think that it was the Clint Eastwood music video that had tricked me into thinking that this was a good band.

HE WAS SO RIGHT! The music is very funky with cool rhythms that you'll find yourself getting lost in. The CD's not short, but you'll think it is because the music is just that seamless.If you've read other reviews of mine, then you know I'm a fan of Groove Armada, and Gorillaz strikes me as being in about the same category. Of my favorites on this CD: Clint Eastwood (of course), Sound Check, and Slow Country. This CD would be great when you just don't know what you feel like listening to because while the songs flow together so well and sail from one to the other like it was all one big track, they do have separate personalities.Very cool music indeed, give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different, needed in everyone's collection","review":"Gorillaz. The very thought of a successful cartoon band sounds very weird. Yet this group has made it to the very top of the charts, and is finally getting recognition in the states. If you have ever heard Blur, you would love Gorillaz, since the lead singer's (2D) counterpart is Damon, the lead singer from Blur. The songs are very creative, and each song has a different feel. From the raps songs \\"Clint Eastwood\\" and \\"Rock the House\\", to fun mellow songs like \\"Re-Hash\\", \\"19-2000\\", \\"Brother\\", and \\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\". If you like the feel of \\"Latin Simone\\", but don't like the Spanish vocals, I would suggest buying \\"G-Sides\\", for it has the english version.The cd is one of the best of 2001, and certianly one of the most creative. This is one cd everyone can enjoy, and I guarentee you'll be hearing alot of Gorillaz in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gorillaz should go back to the jungle.","review":"The Gorillaz are by far the worst \\"band,\\" if you can even call them that, that I have heard in my entire life. First, the \\"band\\" is just a collection of no-talent artists from other failing, no-talent bands. They are nothing but a one hit wonder, except the thing is, \\"Clint Eastwood\\" [is not good]. The person singing the chorus sounds like he has down syndrome, which, unfortunately, is not appealing to my tastes, and shouldn't be to anyone elses, unless of course he did in fact have down syndrome, in which case he should be congratulated for the success and effort of overcoming his handicap. This, however, is not the case, and no congratulation or applause should be rewarded. This is the worst CD ever created, and everyone is dumber for having heard of the Gorillaz. They can't even spell correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great idea!(sarcasm)","review":"Here's a great idea! Since nobody likes stupid techno music, Why don't we have the \\"mucicians\\" hide behind the scenes and have a bunch of badly drawn cartoon characters play the \\"music\\". Everybody loves cartoons right? Wrong! You'd be better off buying a real life gorilla to destroy the CD for you. What I just said makes no sense and I am aware of that but you really shouldn't waste your money on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"My \\"Summer 2001\\" CD","review":"I can't believe how much I like Gorillaz! I'm so happy with this CD and I can't stop listening to it! Hip hop, indierock, 70's supermarket keyboards, old skool beats, there's something for everyone with Gorillaz.

And boy was that the BIGGEST favor I've done for myself in a LONGG time! This CD has got to be the best in my collection so far! Any fan of music has to own this; They take all different varities of todays types of music, alturnative, dance, rock, pop, folk(last track and you'll see), rap, and the list goes on...

Then again I don't really listen tecno but the hip-hop portion seems out of place. This is a good concept album but unless you really listen to tecno, you may not want to buy this cd. Fans of hip-hop may find it extremely lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might expect","review":"Just reviewed this CD, as most people I was mesmerized by the animated videos for these dudes. To me it seems that they spent way more time on the marketing for this band, and it shows. I was expecting the tracks to be kinda like Clint Eastwood, but in fact this album is all over the place. Reminds me a lot of Beck, however the production doesnt come close, vocals are very weak, and they leave a lot of free, ambient spots which annoys me. The rap sections were good, if you are into rap. If you are someone who likes to throw in a cd and listen from start to finish, this is for you. Overall I only liked 6 out of the 17 tracks. Track 11 \\"19-2000\\" is great. For me this CD was not worth the $$$. I realize I am the exception (most people liked it), and no doubt this album/band will take off, simply because of the unique angle they use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cd gets old","review":"\\"Clint Eastwood\\" is a good song, but take it from me: Don't listen to it too much or else you will hate it.

It offers everything that I had expected from an album that came from such a diverse background. 2-D's vocals are phenomenal along with Murdoc's, Noodle's and Russel's musicianship. Russel provides the percussion and the spirit of his dead homies provide the skill and rhymes. Noodle only speaks one word of English, and that is noodle. Murdoc plays the vital role of Murdoc in the band. 2-D is plagued with migraines parlty caused by Murdoc's crazy driving. This band really came together supernaturally and literally lives through the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity","review":"Ok this cd has to be one of the most unique ever released. The new Gorillaz cd is a little more catchy, a litte easier to digest. But this one is far more interesting one you delve into it.Re/Hash ooozes with beck style beats and accoustic guitars. Love this track. 5/4 also fits into that category, although there is a little bit of a nine inch nails style to it. After the first two songs you almost wonder if you picked the right cd for your player. Neither sound like the gorillaz on the radio.This theme is continued throughout the disc. Despite a few skippable tracks (Tomorrow Comes Today and New Genius) this cd flows well and rocks all the way.Top Tracks are Rock the House, Double Bass, and the Pink Floyd-style M1A1.Outstanding disc, a must buy to experience the many different sounds that are expirimented with."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not that bad... but not for everyone","review":"This album is definately not for everyone. It's for all the jaded people out there who are sick of the typical pop songs and stuff that are playing on radios nowadays.

I have to admit, very unique-unlike any music I've ever heard before. But....it's a taste I didn't acquire. Some will love it, and it will leave an extraordinarily foul aftertaste to others.

Also, it is very, (...)weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again: \\"don't believe the hype\\"","review":"Gorillaz must be the latest proof that just about anything can sell nowadays: they are kinda cute cartoon characters, make silly childish songs and pretend to be changing experimental pop music. Good Ol' Fella Damon Albarn has done better efforts before - and I do consider myself a non-Blur fan -, so did Dan 'The Automator' (can you believe the same man produced and helped creating the Lovage project?), so that's worth the 2 stars they're getting.Listening to the whole CD's just got me annoyed and thinking where Blur's frontman had his mind when decided to put this up: probably trying to irritate his pal Liam. By this time, our public enemy Gallagher #2 was doing some real rock music and punching photographers. How can somebody not go for that? Way to go, man!So, unless you're a 3-year-old boy looking for some dumb music, buy yourself something else, like Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Rotten Apples\\" or Oasis' \\"Hindu Times single\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"this is gonna b a kwik review. this album is 1 of the best I hav ever herd. most of the songs r grate. espeshely 19-2000, Clint Eastwood, Rock The House and Genious. ignor the rest and by this album (even if its onli for the cool karacters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbing, Droning Anti-Music","review":"I had high hopes for this CD, and the first track started off lively and rich, but very quickly descended into the numbing, droning anti-music that constitutes the rest of this CD.

Thankfully none of these tunes were released on a Blur album and I hope their music never takes such a mindless, worthless detour."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"save your money it's not worth it the only song worth listening too is CLINT EASTWOOD so just get the single"},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch...","review":"there are plenty of great cd's out there to put you money into... this cd is most definiately not one of them. if you like the clint eastwood song buy the single. for the simple reason that all the rest of the songs on this cd are terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonderz","review":"The single Clint Eastwood is maybe the best single this year in my opinion, where it had a nice blend of rock, rap and a little techno. I was so excited by the idea of the other songs on the Gorillaz album being similair to it I bought it. Boy was I in for a shock when every track except Clint Eastwood was background music mindless techno, with nothing clever or exciting in there to captivate my interest. So before I leave just imagine standing in an elevator for a few hours, hooting and hollering to the elevator music. Know where you are? At a Gorillaz concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I bought this CD thinking that I was going to get a hybrid of Del the funky homosapien and Blur. Unfortunatly what I got was 1 decent song with Del, 1 average song with Del, and the rest a bunch of experimental garbage. with te exception of song 5, this cd has no merit. It is just a bunch filler and electronic sounds with absolutely no coevsiveness throughout the entire album. one only has to listen to track 12 (the lyrics which are entirely in spanish) to realize how truly terrible this album is. If get this album excepting songs similar to Clint Eastwood you will be sorely dissapointed to find experinmetnal Kid-A-esque noise with no musical talent anywhere within the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but....

With the exception of \\"Clint Eastwood\\" (the only song I was familiar with prior to listening to the rest of the album), all the other songs are disposable. I expecting a mix of rap and alternative rock. Instead I heard a couple of rap songs, a couple of alternative songs which weren't anything special and the rest being junk. A majority of the tracks just wander aimlessly and sound more like noise than music. I couldn't even listen to this whole album once although I did at least listen to sections of all the songs.I bought it, barely listened to it once and I am selling it immediately.

After VOD's debut album, I expected another awesome hardcore CD. Instead, IMPRINT gave me mediocore metal. Tim just doesn't sound like he used to on the self titled album. I cant even make the connection between the Tim on Imprint and the Tim on Vision of Disorder. The guitars sound...I don't know, kind of messy. The first album had catchier riffs and smoother guitars. And the abuse of the lumpy double kick just sounds awful too me. Try VISION OF DISORDER or FOR THE BLEEDERS first. Go ahead, click 'no' below, if it will give you any kind of satisfaction.

If you are a fan hardcore or heavy metal this is a must have to your collection. I gave this album four stars, I didn't give it five because I found track 11 to be rather disappointing.

Christians will be particularly inspired! Not a recipe in it...just sound professional advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Biblical Fpundation","review":"The forte of this writing was the abundant amount of scripture offered by the author. It was also a good wake up call for getting right with God and letting the results and benefits come as a result of seeking God and not the approval of others. It does not minimize ones struggle with weight but points out it may be a symptom of our need to address our relationship to God first as well as God's will for our use of food."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes me feel guiltyI","review":"I have read about half of this book and so far I am having a lot of trouble with it. First of all, the book deals almost exclusively with overeating. I suffer from anorexia, so the book hasn't spoken to my issue too much so far. Also, the author really reiterates over and over again how sinful overeating is (and giving food too much of a prominent place in your life to include restricting your intake). So far, I have found no helpful advice, for change - just more and more criticism of the way I've been living my life. I know that God should be the center of my life. I am striving to get food back into it's proper place. This book has done nothing but make me feel worse about myself. I am hoping that sometime in the second half of the book the author will provide some concrete help to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in as good of condition as I expected","review":"I normally ask for very good condition of a book, maybe good also.

I love the contents of the book though and can still read it, so I am thankful for that. I just would have had this book listed as fair quality instead of good or very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. had thought the title would mean it would give more practical advice.sadly it was a book that offered little other than confrontation re sinful thoughts and behaviours. while i am a Christian, i felt people with eating disorders need more compassion than just being smacked around the head with verses and dogma. very let down by this book, as it made me feel WORSE not better...maybe for someone who is nearly recovered, but think it would be very unhelpful for anyone struggling with eating disorders"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you're very religious, don't buy this","review":"I thought this book would help would my issue with emotional overeating.Most programs refer to God or a higher power and touch upon it from time to time, but in this book it is the theme : Turn to God so you won't overeat.If that works for you then that's wonderful, but it is not so clear from reading the summary and cover just how focused on religion this book is.I found it misleading and was very disappointed. Clearly, not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Christian dogma, little authoritative guidance","review":"Like her fellow misguided evangelical Larry Crabbe, this woman quickly puts the label of \\"sin\\" on problems that are more complex. Being told that they are sinners who need to repent is the last thing that people who are struggling with eating disorders need to hear. I think it is this belief about themselves that drives many of them to eating disorders in the first place. The book just pushes evangelical Christian dogma without seeking a proper understanding of the issues it discusses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad way to end an era","review":"This trade paperback features the last Hulk stories Peter David wrote and you could tell that by then he had run out of ideas to do wih the Hulk so he wrote a story where something really devestating happens with the Green Guy.It was something that most readers did not like and many haven't read the comic ever since.

As much wit as may be expected from the writer of Shakespeare in Love (in fact, some of the same jokes) but more depth. Houseman the scholar is devoted to fine translations of classical poetry; Houseman the man is devoted to his friend in an unrequited and hopeless passion, and to expressing the passion in glorious verse.Oh, and it all takes place in the afterlife. The dead, older Houseman encountering his younger, buoyant self at Oxford is almost too gloriously terrible to take.Yes, it's erudite.

To be avoided at all costs unless as a prescription for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"the king of the erudites","review":"Warning: This play is nothing like R&G Are Dead or Arcadia. The Invention of Love is boring, erudite, and trifling. The constant referencing of Classical poetry is painful to wade through. The concept behind the play is interesting but the execution is directionless and unengaging. There isn't a single line of dialogue that doesn't include italized Latin squashed into an otherwise strong sentence. Surely there is merit to using Latin but Stoppard overdoes it and as a result, the play is worthlessly pedantic.

Maybe some grammar school kids might like this story of dumb crooks and dumb cops, but I can't see a broader audience for this movie.There would be potential for some laughs if the seven principle characters could do an episode of Hollywood Squares. Just put Whoopi Goldberg in the center square, stick Gilbert Gottfried in the empty seat and you would have \\"A Funnnnnnnnny Show!\\"On the plus side, \\"Disorganized Crime\\" came in a high-quality Blu-ray box, complete with a locking tab.

The first novella (The Priest's Story) slams back and forth through time as a Catholic priest attempts to reconcile his spotty past by murdering an old lady (and saving her daughter). In the second novella (Wake Up and Breathe), the narrator suffers from sleep apnea, and every time he wakes up, he is in a different time of his life with a different murder on his hands. In the last novella (The Gift Room), the reader is again tossed through time as a family implodes under the weight of absolute freedom and a fetishistic attachment to \\"objects of affection.\\" Well worth buying.

Hopefully our irresponsible species (3 billion humans in 1960, doubled to over 6 billion today straining the planet's resources, devestating its ecosystem, with over 9 billion humans conservatively projected by 2150) will survive long enough to in a few hundred years get a ways out there into the cosmos.

But i'm very glad that I took a friend's advice because this CD has really helped me with my self-confidence. and not just with that but also I feel that i can focus better.

What an odd combination. I admit I've never liked anything about Steve Lukather but to put him together with Larry Carlton is like \\"Steve Vai & Pat Metheny...Live!\\".I think its fair to say Larry Carlton is at his best when he works the solos out in advance (vs. live) but no question, he can be sublime at times. Luke hits everything with a sledgehammer, tons of distortion and everything sounds like a picking excercise from Guitar Player.Next time, how about Larry Carlton & Mike Landau? Or Frank Gambale or Eric Johnson or...."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unoriginal and unexciting","review":"I absolutely couldn't wait to hear this CD, but I have to be honest: I was more than just unimpressed -- I was really crestfallen after hearing how \\"cliched\\" both guitarists have become. Here is what I would suggest to anyone: compare Larry's version of 'All Blues' on \\"Last Night\\" to the one on \\"live in Osaka\\". My opinion is that they all throw in the towel and sell their souls when they convert to the GRP religion.Larry says in the credits that this album was all about \\"checking our egos at the door\\" - A more accurate statement would be that they checked their improvisational flair and creativity at the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Console yourself solely with the price....","review":"I can't imagine a worse piece of crap to unleash on the world and market it as great musicians coming together. This is no balls guitarmanship in the veins of steve vai and satch or santana but even more watered down and senseless. Somebody called this jazz but jazz always has focus and direction which this has niether. Thankfully I paid the MP3 price which is basically what it would have been worth in the bucket bin. Sadly, I can't throw my copy in the bucket and deleting it repeatedly from my playlist gives me little joy. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The forgotten Larry Carlton","review":"In recent (1998-present) years, Larry Carlton has been paying the bills as a working member of Fourplay, the \\"Smooth Jazz\\" (shudder) super-ensemble featuring Nathan East, Bob James and Harvey Mason. But don't forget this one critical fact: He can STILL pound the average rock guitarist into a fine powder! Here, he's paired with Toto's Steve Lukather, and it's a pretty even match. Jeff Beck's \\"The Pump\\" is the perfect showcase for some back-and-forth pyrotechnics. Fourplay has served up some fine tracks, as well as a big helping of \\"Quiet Storm\\" GARBAGE. This is a live recording from the guy who powered MANY of Steely Dan's hits...a guy who is more well-rounded than his Fourplay resume would suggest. Lukather's no slouch either. Get this, as well as the DVD, and you WILL NOT be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite lineage and friendship, an odd couple.","review":"Two talented guitarists, but a live performance that is a bit schizoid. Lukather's often fierce rock splayings overpower Carlton's woody, muted noodling. The opening track, the Tony Hymas/Simon Phillips-penned \\"The Pump\\" (a Jeff Beck associated rock instrumental classic), is easily the best moment (worth the album all by itself). Luke, a Jeff Beck student, is on fire--big, fat in tone--- and quotes Beck extensively. Carlton seems uncomfortable and resorts to off kilter harmonies and tricks that do not do justice to the piece. The album quickly loses its energy from there, Carlton's watery \\"jazz fusion\\" influence takes over, and Lukather is forced to retreat. Nevertheless, there is plenty for guitar fans and students to study."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Combination","review":"This album could be described as a mixture of of Karmah, Poem and Chimera. Unfortunately like all of the post Semantic Spaces albums this also has only a couple of instrumental songs (Tectonic Shift, and Lumenis). The duo recruit Isabel Bayrakdarian and bring back the Mediaeval Beabes to give the vocal songs a operotic/mediaeval feel vice the arabic feel that Chemda brings to Conjure One. As for the lyrical songs you can have the usual supspects, Zoe Johnston, Kristy Thirsk who makes her vioce sound like the Kristy of the Late 90's, Kirsty Hawkshaw, the Mediaeval Beabes, and Jael (what happened to Rani!?). Each bringing their own trademark blend of lyrics ranging from melodic to ethreal to down right poppy. If your still mad at the Delerium of Semantic Spaces and beyond do what I did, get over it and enjoy the music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and Extraordinary.","review":"This is the first Delerium album in the last 5 years that I did not shun in the first 10 minutes of listening. For once it showcases voices less the pop-dance schmoozy trepidation. It isn't too long either. I appreciate the ideas in this record. Sure, pop comes through here, though it is less refined and produced to seem like \\"hit\\" single perfection. This genre is famous for the dj single and the never-ending \\"house/trance\\" versions. Well be sure that these will still be released. So why not and album that is the true art form? Thumbs up guys.

I have been a fan for several years now. I must admit their last studio album \\"Chimera\\" was far from perfect. There were some good songs but the album wasn't as good as \\"Karma\\" and \\"Poem\\" were to me. I was a bit nervous about the new album \\"Nuages du Monde\\" after my mild disappointment with \\"Chimera\\". Thankfully worries were put to rest. I found \\"Nuages du Monde\\" to be a real gem. I love the operatic sounds of \\"Angelicus\\". Isabel Bayrakdarian has a lovely voice and it matches well with the music. Gotta love Katherine Blake and the gals in Mediaevael Baebes. Their contributions to Delerium's music, past and present, is always a delight to hear. And it is always good to hear the enchanting vocals by Kristy Thirsk and Kirsty Hawkshaw. What would a Delerium cd be without their lovely ethereal voices?

With shows like \\"Ragtime\\" coming out there is no place for these stale representations of Lloyd Webber's talent...or lack thereof. Like most, I do enjoy Webber's works...however, I find that after a while they all start sounding the same. Gradually pop influences have found there way into his works and key themes from shows seem to find there way into the scores of so-called \\"new\\" musicals. If Webber wants to get his popularity back to it's status during the days of \\"Phantom...\\" then he needs to go back to his former style. A la \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\". One that works.

I was introduced to Cats by watching the wideo, after seeing it I immediately became interested in everything about Cats. I just saw the musical live, and let me just say, I am addicted! Well to that anti- cats person who gave this fantastic musical 2 stars, you will never know what a true musical is. Cats will live forever no matter what, and it will touch the lives of many.

And if anyone thinks they sold out for playing Warped Tour, they just don't get it at all and never will (which also goes for Dropkick Murphys).

My impression was 'pay more and get a better product' but in this case that is not true. This detector gave me nothing more than a series of false alarms or no alarms. When radar was detected correctly, it was either too late (less than 1/4 mile) or the alert signal did not increase as I approached the radar making me think it was another false alarm. Thankfully Cobra covers their units for one full year and it is on its way back for replacement. I will say that their customer service is much better than my luck with their radar detectors.

Unlike the escorts, you can return this thing if you have to","review":"This radar detector is definitely worth 100+ dollars. Also, unlike the Escorts and other brands, it sounds like you will have no problem returning this thing if it happens to break.Many previous posts have said they did not detect police cars until they were about 1 block away.I would like to point out that many patrol cars drive around constantly emitting Ka band radiation even though they are not manning a speed trap. Perhaps in this idle mode, the power of the Ka signal is a bit less than when they are trying to measure your speed. I don't know.I was able to detect a patrol car at a drive through about 1/4 mile away and a cluster of 5 idling patrol cars at a crime scene at a distance of about 1/6 of a mile (both in the city).I have not yet encountered a false Ka band signal.

I didn't think the leg section was as challenging as the abs and arms segment but overall it was a decent workout. I would recommend for lighter days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"She moves so quickly from movement to movement it is hard to get the exercise band correctly. I would find it annoying to possibly pause the DVD player constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed - D. Larson - Oconto, WI","review":"I purchased this dvd in December & after 2 uses the band has a lot of pinholes in it. It does not stay in place very well when doing some floor exercises. The exercises themselves are good, but she doesn't really take time to explain the moves, it may take a few times to understand the moves & be able to keep up. I prefer using my Richard Simmons Tone & Sweat video, I feel like I've really worked out when done with that tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for traveling or as an add on","review":"This is the first 10 Minute Solution workout I have purchased. However, I have many other workout DVDs, and the portability and option to adjust the length of the workout makes this one one of my favorites. I often use this one as an add on to my cardio workout, so that I can get some quick and simple strength training in. It is also a very good solution for strength training while traveling because the strechy band is very portable.I would not necessarily use this DVD as your primary strength training method, but it is a nice addition to any fitness library, especially if you are looking for something that is portable or that gives you the flexibility of choosing a short, medium, or long workout.In addition, the instructor is clear and motivational without being too cheery, and the moves are easy to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Energetic","review":"This 10 minute solution DVD is very fast and hyper-active for me. she goes to fast that I couldn't keep up with her. My suggestion is that if you want to have your heart rate up tp the sky and you energy is equal to 10 tablespoon sugar this is your best fit. I love the 10 minutes solution workouts but this is not one of my favs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like it!","review":"This is a great workout for someone who is mom like me and is short on time. Amy Bento is very good at explaining how to do each exercise and has a good personalty that isn't over the top like other instructors. The workout doesn't leave you exhausted but energized and ready to take on the day! I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"I bought this DVD because of the reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. I needed something to get me started after loosing all tone and flexibilty from chemotherapy and being lathargic for almost a year. I did buy another set of resistance bands, but only because I wanted to start gradually and work up to more resistance. I'll definately buy more of the 10 Minute series DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like My Arms","review":"I love working out with a band and Amy puts it to good use in this DVD. It has helped alot in getting my arms toned and I work on my arms and shoulders often. She is a good instructor and moves at a good pace. If you watch the exercises once before trying them it makes it easier the first time you do them. I really like the way my arms are looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Minute Solution: Tone Trouble Zones","review":"I really like this tape. The instructor is really good and very easy to follow! I have been using this tape for about three weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quick workout","review":"I love this workout DVD! It allows you to custom-tailor your 10 minute sections (pick one, two, three, etc., in whatever order you want) and comes with a latex band (necessary for the workouts). It really makes working out convenient. If you're used to workout videos, it's a nice video for a moderate exercise - more in shape folks might not find it that challenging. However, I found it quite good to use as something to do quickly in the morning before the shower, or before I go make dinner after work. A great addition to the workout DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 10 minute solution workout","review":"I bought this because I wanted Amy's new hot body 10 minute solution. I love the toning with the band in this particular 10 minute solution. I've been doing Amy Bento's workouts for about 6 months and love the fact she is innovative and choses different exercises rather then the same thing everyone else does. The ab section in this workout is the best I've ever done, I knew I had worked my abs two days later. You also get to have more control of the workout using a band. The whole dvd is great for those days you only have a short amount of time and need the energy buzz, pop it in do the 2 segments of your choice and you just completed 20 minutes. The cueing is excellent and pacing is easy to follow and understand. One of my new favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Black Beauty produced","review":"This 5-hour miniseries from the late 1970\\"s is clearly the best production of \\"Black Beauty\\" I have ever seen. There is no doubt other well done shows, but this miniseries captures the novel ( One of the greatest novels written ) in a wonderful way. The cast was first rate and when I see Bill Devane, I have no choice but to say \\"aw, the poor horse\\". You need to hear it from him with his Irish Accent. I suggest all adults and children alike to experience this great production in all it's glory. The book was adapted by Peter S. Fischer of \\"Columbo\\" and \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" fame. His other miniseries \\"Once an Eagle\\" is being released in August and his short lived gem \\"Ellery Queen\\" is being released in September.I recommend all these shows to all.thank you,Chris FischerOnce An Eagle starring Sam Elliott! Epic miniseries - over 7 hours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Beauty is back","review":"We saw this version of Black Beauty as a television special many years ago. It was one of the best versions we had seen. We searched for it often and never found it. I remembered that William DeVane was in it and always used his name search as a means to determine if it was \\"the one\\". I was surprised when I saw that it was available and purchased it right away. We watched it and even though our memories of a great movie can change over time, we still found it to be a rewarding experience in watching it again. I recommend this version of Black Beauty as a good family movie to watch together like my family did."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"I gave this watch to a 12 yr old neice, and it didn't even work right out of the package.

It should also come as no surprise that I loved it. Quinn's description of the world on fire brought tears to my eyes...he had had the experience I suspected I too could have.

In this book, his autobiography, he talks about his childhood, his adolescence, his experience with the Catholic Church and his personal experience with Thomas Merton and the Trappist order. He talks about his years in educational publishing and how he began to work out the ideas that found their expression in ISHMAEL. In the process he delves deeply into his personal religious vision of the world. This is a very valuable work that gives people the opportunity to re-think their religious beliefs. Several people have said that Quinn has finally shown them a religion they can love. The way that Quinn lays out his life and ideas is unique and very intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book about a amazing author.","review":"Quinn lets you step into his life and what he has been through to get to where he is at. Great Book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy There, Fella!","review":"Quinn may very well be a genius... in that the ideas behind Ishmael were genius. In Ishmael, he impressed me with his ideas about the human condition. That those ideas were, in fact, genius, is what Quinn spends the first part of the book talking about - about how much his fans appreciate the book. How some of them, when asking where the ideas came from, would not be surprised if they were sent to him by aliens. Ha ha, Daniel. I think they must have been, and you must have betrayed their holy alien mission - not only by showing how stupid you are in this autobiography - but by hiding those ideas in the first place behind the whole stupid monkey thing in Ishmael. Good going, Dan. Great way to show the whole world how staggeringly stupid you are, you egotistical hedonist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A insightful book about a insightful man.","review":"If you want to know about the man behind Ishmael, The Story of B, My Ishmael,and Beyond Civilization.

It is quite a thin book and not the most informative autobiography I've ever read but you leave it feeling satisfied. It's very concise and so easy to get through. Apart from the story of his life there are also some interesting sections in there about education and about how he lost his faith in reilgion (he lived in a monastery for a while). If you like Daniel Quinn's other books read this because it provides an insight into how he arrived at his beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers a few more questions, gives a few more insights","review":"Quinn details his spiritual journey towards his current beliefs and takes us along with him.

But, I find it no more an unreasonable an issue than guys having tatoos; which, but for patient treatment and expense, they can't remove. And this purchaser is not a jewelry type, nor a metro-sexual.But this item is suggestive of something firm, not dainty. It even feels substantial; clasp seems strong and it hangs just below the ankle (though higher than I expect the sag would eventually be witnessed by a tatoo).It's my thing, my rationale, and I'm quite satisfied with it for substance and evident strength. Unless I'm at the gym or a beach, or going sockless; I'm it's only witness. As for remarks? What's an echo, but a sound not heeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little gift.","review":"This is absolutely perfect. It fits very well and looks like it should cost much more than it did.

I read the book and it made a lot of sense so I tried it. After 6 weeks I had gained 6 pounds (I was overweight to begin with). I phoned Women to Women for advice, and was told my body was adjusting to the new eating plan and would soon feel much better. After 10 weeks, I had gained 8 pounds. I felt sluggish from all the dietary fat and I just did not feel \\"right.\\" I had no energy and I just felt unhealthy. I decided to stop eating all the butter, full-fat cream, fried eggs and the rest of the artery-clogging food in this program. Three weeks ago, I started on a new program that uses carb-cycling (Crack the Fat-Loss Code) and I have already lost all of the 8 pounds I gained on Schwarzbein, but more importantly my energy has returned and I feel 10 years younger already. Schwarzbein may work for many other women, but it was a bad experiment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"A very disappointing read. There are so many opinions expressed in this book without further explanation ... it is pitiful. Example: the author claims we should not use the natural thyroid medication Armour. Why not? No further explanation is given. This is extremely annoying and therefore a complete waste of time. This book is going into the recycling bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"moderation of old program to keep up sales with societal change","review":"I feel that Dr. Schwarzbein is just interested in $$. Her old program doesnt sell that well anymore due to the fact that alot of people started eating GOOD carbs and went away from high protein/fat diets. She then had to modify the program to keep up with what people would actually read and buy. The whole adrenal burnout jargon sounds like a lot of hoopla to me and the way she says you have to be careful how you cook meat fat in order to not DAMAGE it, is just a tedious task that people do not need in their lives. PLEASE!!!! To me she lost professional credibility with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"If I could give it Negative 5 stars I would, or at least 0 stars. Maybe this could work for you if you eat unhealthy (as some people like this book), but what the hell happened to Dr Schwarzbein and her \\"principles\\"?????? She did a complete 180 from her other books: The Schwarzbein Principle and The Schwarzbein Principle II. She was all about eating lower carb in those books and gave a great story on how she came to discover why eating that way was better, along with eating real butter and cream. Then in this book you'd be eating like 400 grams of carbs a day. It's like the media finally got to her and she wanted to go with what was \\"in\\" instead of tried and true science on lowering your carbs. Complete waste of time and money. Stick to her first books and anything by Atkins and Dr Eades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas","review":"I've tried the program before and had trouble. I really committed to it, and did great.

However, I found this book to be trite and shallow. Not nearly enough detail to be beneficial and a constant reiteration of the same text over and over from chapter to chapter. The author mentions many complex topics, conditions and supplements in a very high overview manner. If you haven't read her earlier works and/or don't have a good understanding of the endocrine system and the effects of hormones on the body you will not gain much from this volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"she should make a christmas list instead","review":"and ask for clothes cause she's obviously missing them on the cover of this CD. haha"},{"rating":"1","title":"This ablum's like Woah Buddy!!!","review":"This is by far the worst Christmas Album I have ever heard.

I was very disappointed with this album. I do not enjoy the sound of Ashanti's upper register and this is what she relies on for the first several songs. Most songs I couldn't wait to be over. They are repetitive and boring and grate on your nerves. There are 2 tolerable songs on this CD, \\"This Christmas\\" and \\"Silent Night\\". These tracks standout but don't expect much from this CD.

I would guess thats what she's trying to do, but it sounds all the same. Her \\"ooh babys\\" sound just as annoying. She can sing, thats a fact, just like saying Bush is President but there are certain notes some singers just can't hit, she sounds like she's straining...very hard. The cd is ok, yes ok, just like any other cd she's brought out, but not refreshing or exceptional. There's nothing different about it, nothing that makes it stick out from the rest. I wouldn't buy the cd, seriously, i'd spend the money on something else. I'm yet to listen to Whitney Houston's but i'm sure when i do, it will be better.

I mean sure, she's great to look at, but come on. If you want to even go as far as comparing her to Britney, at least Britney has stage presence. Have you seen Ashanti trying to dance? It was painful to watch the video for her song \\"Happy\\". She is NO WAY in Whitney's league.This cd is a hot, steaming pile of crap. She butchers the classic \\"This Christmas\\".

Ashanti's limitations as a singer are completley exposed on this album. She's trying to sing great and beloved songs with a voice that just isn't suited for it.

She doesnt have vocals 4 this type of music. She needs fast music and lots of background singers because shes not gettin it. And she cant dance jus 4 the record :) And one more thing you cant compare whitney to ashanti no matter what whitneys personal life is she can sing 100,000,000,000,000,000 times Ashanti. Thanks all I gotta say buh-bye :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I only gave it a star because of the default","review":"This was one of the worst Christmas cd's I have ever heard. Ashanti is not necessarily a stand out singer, her vocals are bland and at times off key and unchanging. She's more of a back up singer. I purchased one of her cd's with that \\"Baby\\" song on it (don't burn it, but don't buy it if you don't like disappointing yourself). The daycare business was not a bad thing Ashanti, now you have enough money to start your own and you have interesting stories to tell probably but I have been disappointed with every cd you have put out, no consistency just \\"one hit wonders\\" I'm sure you'll be the star of some reality show for washed up entertainers, you acted pretty good in that one movie where you were pregnant by that basketball player. Sorry to be so harsh but the truth hurts. YOu're a beautiful girl, maybe modeling would be a bigger hit for you than your singing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashanti's done it again!","review":"After such success as her 1st album, you'd expect her follow-up CD and this Christmas one to be good as well. The follow-up was bad and this is worse! This CD features very drab and boring songs that sound as if they took 5 minutes to record. The editing is bad, the music is bad and so is the singing. There isn't one good song on the CD. The stand out bad track is \\"We Wish You A Merry Christmas\\". Why do i say it is so bad? It sounds as if she is singing one note the entire time and then when there's a key change, she sings another note. I would very much say stick to Christina Aguilera or Destiny's Childs christmas CD, a lot better and not such a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"First of all, you can never never ever compare a little fish like Ashanti, to a big Shark like whitney. so that is the biggest do not ever! Ashanti does not have a bad voice, she has a mickey mouse club voice she should only do like disney channel cuts. however as far as R&b she needs to leave it alone. as many said before whitney is back..don't let your personal judgement for her personal life, block the fact that she talented no matter what. go and get that \\"one wish album'..it is the off the chain. Whitney is surely back. don't hate appreciate real talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature","review":"I really wanted to by this cd today but after listening to it I realized that it was done with no creativity and once again she is singing out of her range. Ashanti has talent but Irv Gotti is making this girl reallly look bad. The music sounds like it was done for young kids. Ashanti, is pretty, and has talent but she needs to work with someone else to help accentuate what she has. Except for the first track which was good the rest is bad. I would love to see her work with another group of producers that knows how to market her talent. Sorry Ashanti, you need to evaluate what you are doing before you look simply foolish. This industry will eat you alive!!!! She needs to take sometime and realize she is being used for a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashanti's Dreaded Christmas","review":"From the snippets I heard this CD is trash.

Thinking of a fresh new Artist, I choose Ashanti. Well, that was a mistake. The Christmas CD of Ashanti lacks flavor, soul, and flare. Most of the album sounds juvenile at best, with simple cords, no harmony and flat music. I have tried several times to give the CD a chance because I have an open mind. Well I'm done playing the CD! The Whitney CD is much better. Much Much Better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Is Not Merry","review":"I will admit Ashanti has haters, but its clear to most people who are honest that this girl can not sing. I have tried and tried to like Ashanti, but her vocals are too weak. I suggest that she takes the direction of Britney Spears and try to hide her weak vocals with some exotic tracks and hot dance moves. The problem with Ashanti is while she is a decent songwriter, she has no star quality and these days, that means everything. I heard this cd at a friend's holiday party and most people at the party agree that their biggest wish for Ashanti is for her to get some pipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"Ashanti sounds like a little girl in church. She just does not feel good on such songs. If you wanna good new Christmas album then buy Whitney's One Wish, don't waste your money for Christmas Album by Ashanti."},{"rating":"1","title":"UMMMMM","review":"She could have done way better than this. It sounds like this album was rushed and recorded in a basement with cheap equipment. Ashanti is really a good songwriter and she's cool but this album really didnt get it for me..I was very dissappointed c'mon girl u could have done better... I reccommend Mariah Carey Christmas instead of this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL. This is NOT gonna bring You a Merry Christmas. Trust me. 2.5 stars.","review":"I love Ashanti as well as the next shallow music-listener, but this is ridiculous. I would pay 2 bucks and no shipping for this because I enjoyed one song, thoroughly and another one, half-heartedly.Christmastime Again (classic X-Mas tune)Hey, Santa (good...enough)And some other tunes here are passable....but...The vocals are weak and somewhat strained and YES, She hits the wrong note in a song. I swear, that Day, I wanted to retreat into My own shell when I heard it. I really was gonna leave my Bro's house. But something crazy made me stay. And endure. I could've used ear plugs, People!

A christmas album is sacred to those that can sing. Buy Ashanti album to see how not to sound. If you want real singers get Brian Mcknight, Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston, MAriah Carey, Christina Aguilera, shirley Caeser, Yolanda Adams...you know people that can sing.This album made me so depressed.

I thought she would be very pleased with the gift but she never mentioned the CD after XMas. After I read the other reviews, listened to the clips, and found out the album was only 29 minutes long I can see now why she never talked too much about this album. There is nothing to talk about. I can see this album gathering dust in my friend's CD collection, maybe she'll give it another try next XMas, but I'm guessing this album will still suck!

I was unable to listen to most of it. I'm sorry someone wasted their money to buy this for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashanti's Christmas","review":"HORRIBLE! Just go to the DefJam site and listen for yourself. I am in true disbelief that this is a real album. It sounds like a Barney or Cartoon Network Christmas album. The music, mixing, and mastering sounds very unprofessinal and 'keyboardish'. The vocals are just Ashanti's normal soft nothings. I'm appalled. This has to be embarrassing to DefJam and Murder Inc. On the other hand, the other CDs have sold, so I could be wrong. ******I do recommend some other Christmas tunes that have great production and vocal talent; Destiny's Child and Christina Aguilerra. Toni Braxton has a very nice one, too, if you're into the jazzy/soulful sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arguably one of the Worst Artists Ever","review":"Ashanti is fastly on pace to go down as One of the Worst Artsts Ever.She messes these track badly.for all the Hype She gets you'd think maybe She would cash it in for some Studio tricks to enhance that lemon of a voice She got."},{"rating":"2","title":"For specific purposes","review":"This book is very well presented and clear; very useful for students of architecture in their early years of study.

I purchase it to use it at home on a carpet floor but that did not work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mat!","review":"I was really torn about what mat to buy and reading a lot of online reviews helped me with my decision. But, I also went into a few studios and yoga shops to get some opinions on their \\"favorite\\" mat and this one kept getting brought up. I do yoga daily at home and occasionally go to a studio for warm (85 degrees?) yoga, but not hot. I've worn out a few mats so I wanted one that would last for my money and this one is great! I was worried it would be too sticky I guess because of the phrase \\"sticky mat\\" I'd been hearing. Nothing sticks to it but me though. Currently I'm pregnant and I'm glad I have that extra support and am not sliding around. Worth the money!Oh, and the smell that some people are talking about doesn't bother me.

I was pleasently suprised to find so much good music loaded onto one CD. From Crawling from the Wreckage to Slipping Away and some of the gems in between, I found the album to ROCK. Covering songs from Elvis Costello, Phil Spector, and several others, Edmunds reminds us of what he does best (and no one else seems to do anymore). I would recommend this CD to any music fan that appreciates straight ahead Rock on Roll, Blues, or Rockabily. There is something for everyone here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting the record straight","review":"My sentiments accord almost exactly with those of Pete Harris- I think this is the best single disc compilation of Edmunds' work. It's a great mixture of rock, pop and country and showcases Edmunds' legendary guitar skills as well as his simple but effective vocals. He's also a great producer and this CD shows that side of his work.Obviously a single disc can't come close to being a comprehensive overview of such a long career, but the songs are well-chosen and there are no fillers or lesser-quality recordings here.My main purpose in publishing this review is to help to offset the negative effect of the one-star review, which is totally unwarranted and based solely on the exclusion of one particular song. Those who would like a great CD of Dave Edmunds music should know that this is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"chronicles\\"? more like \\"massive omission\\"!","review":"missing career defining chart smasher \\"information\\", obviously the best song dave or jeff were ever involved in."},{"rating":"2","title":"AZ The Greatest Forgotten Rapper!!!","review":"Mo Money, Mo Murder!!!

Ms Deen's running narrative can be charming at times, but when I bought the book I really wanted recipes that were innovative....and these were so old fashioned, and when accompanied by her 'down home' comments, I was quite put off. Unfortunately, this will go to the local library. There was absolutely nothing in it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cookbook to give to a beginner cook","review":"I have been a reader of cookbooks, but rarely made the effort to actually cook from them. Most all cookbooks' liberal use of exotic ingredients made it next to impossible to attempt to recreate the dishes. Not so Paula's. I have tried about 4 recipes, and have been pleased with the results. My husband has been appreciative. I think this would be a great cookbook to give as a gift to a young person just starting out, but also for the more seasoned veteran cooks too. Simple comfort foods do have a place in everyone's life.I actually purchased the two-volume set, and immediately found out she was coming out with this hardcover edition. I think the publishers could have reorganized the two books by categories instead of printing two books back to back inside the hardcovers, but at least the index is organized as one. I bought this because I prefer hardcovers.

Sorry but with these books \\"The Lady doesn't Cook\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible recipes","review":"What a disappointing cookbook! Canned soup is often used instead of homemade sauce. Bisquick based breads & rolls. The absolutely worst recipe for collard greens (one of the tastiest dishes on earth if made right). Pattypan Summer Squash is cooked into a casserole mush. I thought surely the Southern Fried Chicken would be authentic and delicious, but sadly the only bit of seasoning in the entire recipe is a small bit of pepper. Really?

My wife has made several of the recipes and all have been great. Some of them are so good she has gotten tons of requests for the recipes.Note, as with most of Paula's recipes, most (not all) of the recipes in the book are high in fat, butter, etc. So, they are not very healthy. We eat healthy most of the time, but for special occasions and holidays my wife will go after taste instead of health. I guess we all tend to do that.Anyway, in my opinion the recipes are not for 'every day eating', due to the reason mentioned above.

Seriously, although this book is the first that I'm aware of on the subject, it wouldn't have a chance getting published by an investment publishing house in it's present form.

I don't expect much from the After Dark Horrorfest - two or three decent flicks, maybe one excellent one, and a lot of garbage - but this was the worst horror film I've seen in my entire life.

He tells you why you need to know this, what he will cover, what he will not cover and where to find more information (although this seems like an obvious thing to do when writing a book, many books miss it and you end up wondering about the relevance of some sections, or wanting more information without a clue as to where to look). Also he manages to get his thoughts across without too many words. So you end up learning more in less time. I also like how he anticipates reader questions and answers them."},{"rating":"1","title":"So THIS is why they call Burlesque a Tease!","review":"I purchased this book with the Dvd of the same name--while the Dvd was not great, this book was rather worse. There was no text whatsoever, not even an introduction to explain the concept! Lots of glossy pics of neo-Burlesque dolls, some none too flattering to the ladies in question. I was very disappointed--if you are a particular fan of either Erochica Bamboo or Kitten Deville you may like this picture book anyways.

There was a huge movement of people between the two countries, and thousands of people were massacred. The story takes place in Lahore, just before the partition, and is seen through the eyes of a ten-year old Parsi girl. She has a Hindu nanny, who is young and attractive. The nanny has a group of admirers, a Hindu, a Sikh and two Muslims. The director, Deepa Mehta, uses this little group of friends to portray the break-up of the country. At first they stay loyal to each other, but as the violence touches them, the cracks appear and suspicion and hatred creep in. The film is based on the book by Bapsi Sidhwa called The Ice-Candy Man (though the film calls it Cracking India--maybe it has two titles)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as \\"Water\\"","review":"I gravitated toward this movie after seeing \\"Water,\\" which I thought was amazing. \\"Earth\\" seemed to me to be, though ambitious in scope and subject, a much less accomplished film--somewhat pedantic and leaden, awkward and fragmented. The characters all too obviously stand in for aspects of the social and political landscape, whereas in \\"Water,\\" the characters' stories and relationships with each other, while embodying larger issues, were for me much more involving, immediate, vivid, and poignant. I think Mehta grew enormously as a filmmaker between making these films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener","review":"This movie opened my eyes to India and it's diversity, as well as it' past. I first saw \\"Earth\\" about three years ago, and I have been in love with the Indian people ever since. I think that \\"Earth\\" illuminates for Western eyes what happened in India after WWII and shows how much love her people can have regardless of where you come from. I know this is a bit of an idealization, because there is a lot of hate there too, but an overwhelming feeling of love of life and of earth is what \\"Earth\\" gave to me. Thank you Deepa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther's greatest","review":"I was just replacing a scratched copy of this CD. I can't imagine my music collection without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fourth in the quartet, but just as essential...","review":"This is the most balanced of Luther's classic recordings. Every tune is extremely memorable and meaningful, and could have been a hit in its own right ala Thriller. The production, songwriting, and LV's voice are all in top form. Faves are the title track and 'The other side of the World'. Billy Preston's organ solo on 'Til my Baby comes home' is flat-out scorching, while Marcus Miller thumps his bass guitar ferociously on 'It's over now'. Its kind of surprising that this disc isn't included with his first three recordings as a collector's edition box set. I would buy that just because its Luther for goodness sake. Epic Records, are you listening? This is the last 'pure' R&B disc Luther did before he started recording the synth-and-drum machine laden cheesefests known as 'Give me the Reason', 'Any love', and 'Power of Love' that were obviously recorded for the sake of winning Pop music awards. Oh well, I still got love for LV. RIP..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Novice Builders","review":"This is definatley not a book for novices. I bought this book for my 13 year old son for the Iron Clad models to be built for a school project. We found the ships extremely difficult to make. The book recommended model cement for plastic models to glue the ships with. We tried 3 different kinds of plastic model cement and the glue would not dry. Our chubby fingers made it impossible to work with the smaller pieces of the ships. Our MONITOR looked so awful we chucked the entire idea of using the paper models and he made his project with Legos. In the end, I felt this book was a total waste of money from the modeling aspect. However the information provided in the book on each of the 18 boats was very good.

When you purchase this wonderful project you should immidiately insert it into your CD player so as not to burn your hands. You will be overjoyed with the fantastic rythmic expression. Songs like \\"Incredible\\", \\"In The Morning\\" and \\"God Bless\\" will have you moving and praising God all the day long.

Be prepared to groove!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Mary Mary, and they've changed!","review":"I can't totally recommend this CD, yet it has it's credentials. Both \\"In the Morning\\" and \\"Incredible\\" are great songs! There are other tracks that have a blessing coming from them, and yet, like most Contemporary Christian CD's, there are songs that plain stink, at least to my taste. Can't remember which ones, but it's a decent record.

I can't think of one song that I would remove from this album. The beats and their voices flow so very well together and they are not afraid to lift up Christ in their lyrics. This cd doesn't take you to the Holy of Holies, but it definitely takes your mind off of any troubling situations. Very seldom can artists top their previous work, but this album hits hard and right away. This is the best that's out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great C.D.

I find the music very infectious and catchy. You'll be humming the choruses for weeks! I find the musical arrangements very innovative and full of surprises. I also find it to be a VERY encouraging project, lyrically speaking. Based on the thoughtful and insightful lyrics, I believe these girls have a true relationship with God through the savior Jesus Christ. It's not background music, but it's music to sit and listen intently to. Their music \\"talks\\" to you, much like a conversation. It's great \\"road record.\\" :-) There's even a bonus hidden track on the CD not listed in the titles. Thanks for the opportunity to share my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"Thankful\\", but it is \\"Incredible\\"","review":"I don't think that Mary Mary could have topped their awesome debut, \\"Thankful\\", even if they tried, but they did make a good attempt. \\"Incredible\\" is a great CD, with a mix of hip hop, RnB, and Gospel, spread all over. Not everyone will like the CD at first listen, I didn't even give it a chance the first time I popped it into the car stereo. I decided to hear what the rest of the songs sounded like on the album. Boy, was I glad I did that! I was beginning to like the CD, and then I got to track nine, \\"I Try\\". My God, my God. This is the most beautiful and yet most powerful song I have ever heard. The lyrics are so honest and simple that you just fall in love with it, and when the girls belt out those lyrics later on in the song, you can't help but catch the holy ghost. These girls sound even better live. I had the opportunity to see them at Beach Fest, here in Ft. Lauderdale. All in all, you won't be disappointed by this album. Pick it up, it's \\"Incredible\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree","review":"This cd is alright and younger crowd's will buy it just for the beats, but to me this album sounds alot like their debut album thankful.

It tries to cover such a vast subject in such a concise way, that unfortunately it ends up saying not much at all. At the end, I think it leaves you with more questions than it answers, which I also know, it's not necessarily a bad thing in education. About the questions under Cuestionario at the end of the book, the questions given are usually very specific after the subject was treated very briefly or sometimes even barely mentioned by the author, like it was the case in chapter 5, questions 2 through 9.

Example: Piano spread across sound-stage as wide and loud as the orchestra in the Gershwin, high piano notes come from the right and low notes from the left--the pianist is seated with his/her back to the audience at concerts?

One of them was a very good book called 'Battle of the Bulge' by Danny S. Parker. In addition to a high reguard for Parker, the Amazon's professional review and reader's review were both excellent. So, for me, this was a 'must buy'. I was disappointed. The book has six chapters. Each chapter is an interview experience with an important German officer with real responsibility in the battle. Some of these chapters are hardly comprehensible. One, General Kramer, is poorly translated. There is personal puffery, poor memories, and precious little real insight into the battle. Only General Brandenberger's narrative is concise and informative.

Adventures were many up to the last rendevous of 1840 with the typical Indian fighting, grizzlies, starvation and thirst, etc. He then helped guide the first wagon train to Oregon and had much to do with the first government of Oregon.

This has the emotional appeal of a paperweight sitting on my desk .. none at all. Contrived, but maybe he'll kill himself lik Ian did, it would be the end of a oh so tragic 15 minutes of faim.But let's move on people. The grunge sceen has been repeting itself with Pearljamisc repetity, so why not goth? At least it's not another winy band sounding like Default, or .. fill in the blank. So in that light it's listenable.Some bands do a good job of covering a style. Let's look at The Merry Thoughts. They sounded a hell of a lot like the Sisters, but were able to inject their own style to give it originality.Maybe, in a few years, She wants revenge will find the dark soul they are striving for.

I've seen mannequins in department stores with more life and personality than one verse or chorus from She Wants Revenge. It's one thing to be inspired by great songs from Joy Division and The Cure and it's another thing to dress them up in drag and call it She Wants Revenge. How can someone even trust a guy with the name DJ Adam 12? Shouldn't he be doing some house/trance/techno wicki-wicki crap or even worse, rap. Perhaps that might suite his buddy's taste.

EVERYTHING, and I'm not exaggerating, is taken directly from Ian Curtis and his band Joy Division.

Like an 80s wannabe vocal style with bad reverb effect thrown in. Hard to believe that Depeche Mode and Placebo had these guys open for them, I love both of them, but the vocals on this album were painfully bland. Unfortunately, I don't know if its editing or what, but the way the vocals are laid over the music it can't be disguised. I mean, music like that should make the vocals fairly irrelevant, but the music is kept at a level that puts the vocals on display. . .and because the vocals aren't WOW it comes off as cheesy at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE WANTS SOMETHING NEW....","review":"I LOVE \\"TEAR YOU APPART\\", BUT I DIDN'T FOUND ANOTHER GREAT SON IN THIS ALBUM, IF YOU ARE UNDECIDED, BUY THE SONG YOU LIKE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent music, laughable lyrics","review":"My friend suggested I give them a listen being a Joy Division and Bauhaus fan and a fan of some things 80's gloom/goth rock, so I did. And while musically they are quite good, and better than I expected (but still far too derivative), their lyrics were so inane they border on parody (a lot of goth music is like this, and I can easily put with with the lyrical excesses of bands like Sisters of Mercy, etc., but this has taken it to a new level).

It's not that the Los Angelesduo made up of party DJ Adam Bravin and former De LaSoul copycat Justin Warfield means for its self-titleddebut to be funny. But the group's one-note impressionof dark new wave acts like Joy Division, The Cure andBauhaus is just so blatant--from the ominousbass-lines and fawning band name (Peter Hook's NewOrder side project was called Revenge) to song titlessuch as \\"Tear You Apart\\" (Ian Curtis fans would beright to notice the similarities to their beloved\\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\") and Goth 101 lyrics (\\"Takeyour hand, and smack me in the mouth, my love\\") --it's hard not to laugh. --Aidin Vaziri"},{"rating":"1","title":"But sour grapes ALWAYS want revenge...","review":"Well, this thing is just awful.

This Truly SUCKS.","review":"Having only heard the single, \\"Tear You Apart\\" I would NEVER want to listen to this entire album. That song is so unoriginal it verges on plagiarism. The singing is flat and monotone with a self-important gravity that is laughable, the lyrics sophmoric and pretentious, and the music a monotonous drone of club beats and electronic noise. Worst of all, it copies all these styles from a variety of sources, none of those original to begin with. So it's like a third or fourth generation xerox.

If SWR heavily influenced by these pioneers, how can that be a bad thing? I enjoy this CD because it invokes the dark sound without being TOO noisy or depressing. Ok so the lyrics are a bit cheesy, but most of the songs are about sex & lust anyway, so not much sophisticated articulation is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Wants Revenge...Not Joy Division","review":"After some deliberation(which i usually do when it comes to music), i decided i did like this album. After reading the reviews amazon had gave it, i had read from all the americans reviews on it and yes of couse there is an obvious Joy division interest, but credit where credit is due, this band is good, but they aint no joy division at that. Thats what americans jump to when they hear unusual dark lyrics coupled with banging bass guitar.be happy, this is a good album on its own right, dont go into this album wanting a new joy division or a new interpol. She wants revenge are here and i wont be comparing them to joy division. joy division disappeared in the wake of Ian Curtis' death. Don't you think he would have wanted it that way. Appreciate this band in their own right as they should be"},{"rating":"2","title":"Latter day Joy Division","review":"If you enjoy Joy Division and The Psychedelic Furs, this one's for you.

They are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrived? Yes Awful? No","review":"The 2000s have brought us an era of rock fandom where rock bands are often judged based on their indie credibility. Bands like Arcade Fire and Interpol have exploded in popularity due to their originality and DIY attitude. Thus it would seem that She Wants Revenge were bound to fail from the beginning; the band makes no secret of their goal to contrive an album similar to their 1980s role models. But no one anticipated that SWR would be so darn good at it. Fans of Interpol, Depeche Mode, and Joy Division will probably find it difficult not to love this album. If listeners can set aside SWR's broad lack of originality, on a smaller level they will find a fun, fresh, dark album that fits perfectly in the current 80s-heavy indie resurgence."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know all these reviews are negative...","review":"Maybe I'm just naive, but I really dig this album, and I'm familiar with 80's stuff like Joy Division, Pulp, and all the minor ominous key changes and synthesizers, etc. I think this sounds like Interpol if they got really high and tripped their asses off listening to Depeche Mode on repeat.

I happened to stumble on this group by mistake. All I have to say is that this is AN EXCELLENT ALBUM. I love the driving baselines of \\"Red Flag and Long Nights\\", and \\"Someone Must get Hurt\\". My favorite tracks are \\"Red Flag and Long Nights\\", \\"Out of Control\\", \\"Sister\\" and \\"Tear You Apart\\". Heck, the entire album is good.In all this group captured real gothic rock the way it used to be and SHOULD BE. Marylin Manson is NOT gothic rock. Rob Zombie IS NOT gothic rock. She wants Revenge is gothic rock in the 4AD style and these guys get an A+ for their music.Finally, this is refreshing dark music from the crappy Brittney Spears, Outkast, Justin Timberlake, and Beyonce baloney I have to put up on every stinking Top-40 station. A+ to She Wants Revenge. I hope they can put another album out."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALUBM!!!! one of my top 5","review":"what can I say, if you like Alt rock/indie.

Just listening to the songs released so far on the radio is enough for me. I'm not really interested in buying their album because they sound like a second-rate wannabe Interpol, and SO NOT good lyrically. Where Interpol is subtle, haunting, intriguing and BRILLIANT, She Wants Revenge is the opposite. No mystery. Some may think their lyrics are edgy, with heavy sexual (read: teen angst) references, but I think they are too obvious. And I was way too generous giving them 2 stars and now I can't change it."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting","review":"It goes to show that many just have no decent taste in music anymore. Sure.. She Wants Revenge \\"sounds\\" like bauhaus and joy division but that's it.

I thought the band sounded ok, but after hearing their single numerous times I got tired of it.Come on it doesn't take talent to use other peoples music and make it your own. Another preview stated that people want art to be original but nothing really is. But someone can listen to a band and be influenced by them and the majority of the time they will put their own sound in it as well not obviously rip off other peoples stuff. Listen to the bands SWR got their sound from. If Peter Hook heard this he would be pissed off not to mention the other artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this?","review":"Is it Bahaus?....is it Sisters of Mercy?...is it Joy Division?...is it New Order?....is it Interpol?...NO!!!There is more than just an \\"influence\\" of the listed bands in this album.

Even some of the lyrics (themes) are copied!!If you want to hear this band....just put on one of these other bands' records. It's the same thing only original and with talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying Too Hard To Be Clever...","review":"\\"These Things\\" is a decent listen; otherwise She Wants Revenge's sound is too diet Depeche/Sisters of Mercy (a VERY keen observation by another reviewer that I hadn't considered until now, but yes - Sisters of Mercy, definitely).At times (more often than not), the band tries too hard to be Interpol, with their faux-tortured, faux-psycho/sexual lyrics and sound. Put this CD up against Antics, and it's like the old laundry detergent commercials where the lady puts a clean sock up against a dingy one. It appears as if She Wants Revenge is attempting to co-opt a moment (I hate to label it, but what? Nu Wave? New New Wave?) inasmuch as 98 Degrees tried to jump on the Latin Explosion a few years ago.That said, I'm sure it takes time for any band to find their authentic sound, so maybe She Wants Revenge's next effort will be all their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definition for awful","review":"I picked this up for four bucks thinking I was getting a great deal, having heard that they were similar to the Killers and drew influences from the Cure.

The lead singer does his best to sound like Peter Murphy which actually attacted me to the CD but upon hearing it I was dissapointed. The whole album tosses out horrible cliche lyrics that even the youngest of goth kiddies will get bored with quickly. The one song on the album \\"Tear you Apart\\" which is constantly played on the radio is sadly the best thing on the album.

You may have heard him on the Placebo track \\"Spite & Malice\\" rapping. On this release, his voice is grand. Yes, it does sound like a Interpol/Joy Division rip off. However, this release contains something that Interpol and Joy Divisions do not: GOOD electronics. I love both Joy Division and Interpol, but this release won me over. I enjoy it a lot. Also, Interpol is big now and they were written off as a Joy Division rip off as well. This is the best 8.99 I've spent in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are gonna be big!","review":"Imagine the singer and guitar player from the band Interpol playing with the guys in Depeche Mode....THAT is what She Wants Revenge sounds like.

Really suprised by the quality of the speaker. I was going to run an external, but the built in speaker is loud and clear. It is small so it mounts easily and is easy to use. Looks really good in my truck and is tucked up out of the way.CONS-Knobs feel flimsy but seem to be solid. sometimes it takes more than one click to advance the channel. Microphone cable could be a few inches longer.Overall, for the price it is a great CB. Initially I was going with a used one from craigslist, but the price on this was the same I took a chance and it paid off."},{"rating":"2","title":"great price for this radio","review":"I am a ham operator, however, have to say that this radio packs a nice punch.

Installed it in my 2006 Jeep TJ, and had all sorts of problems with transmitting and receiving. AMazon.com customer service was GREAT, and they sent me a replacement unit, and still, after installation, I had problems. I enlisted some help from some friends in my 4x4 club (several were actual mechanics and all have done successful CB installations). We finally got it working, and it seemed to hum right along. NOW, I had an off-road weekend, and the darn thing started messing up again. It will transmit, but I do not get any incoming sound. I have checked the mic input, the external speaker, and everything. I even tried unplugging the external speaker to see if that was the problem....NOPE! I do not recommend this cb.

The compact size and easy installation was a plus. I thought that you couldn't go wrong with that price, and maybe that is still true. It worked great for a month. Then one week after the Amazon return window closed, it stopped working. Completely dead. Every other piece of electronics in my vehicle was functioning fine. My recommendation, save your money up and buy a better radio. Sure, you can always send it in under the three year warranty, but after the shipping and handling costs, you might as well have just bought a new radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"installed 3","review":"I have installed 3 of these radios, two have malfunctioned one is still working after a month.

I don't even care about the White Stripes association, this is a far cry. The instant I played it I was put off by the production. I thought that garage rock was supposed to be part of the solution! This album is boring at best. It's not the worst album I've ever heard, if it was I would have to give it some credit. The problem seems to be that the Von Bondies wish they were as famous or as respected as most of the other bands from Detroit are. So it's clear that they've made a lame attempt at commercial success. I give this two stars just because their first album was pretty good, but Pawn Shoppe Heart makes that seem like Sgt. Pepper!

The DA40 is \\"plug and play\\" so there was no software to install. It has the quick release so you can easily switch from VOIP to landline. The only thing that would make it better is if it had an inline mute button, but the price of this item more than made up for it, so I gave it 5 stars anyway. The newer DA60 has that but is three times the price. I knew before I purchased the DA40 that the mute feature was missing, but didn't think it was worth an extra $60 just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use!","review":"This is one of those products that is just well engineered.

I have used it with work phones for over 15 years. It was always my standby. Then I starting working where I need to use Google Talk for phone. I tried 4 different bluetooth headsets, and the outgoing sound quality was poor on all of them. No saying it's the headset at fault, but for me with my wireless network the connection was suboptimal. My boss sent me a Plantronics over the head style, USB wired headset. The sound quality was great afterwards, but the thing hurt my head because it put too much pressure on my eyeglasses. I started looking for something else, and stumbled on this adapter, which allows me to use my old favorite headset with the quick disconnect. I am now a happy camper, no longer completely leashed to my desk. Could only be better if it were completely wireless.

I bought a Parker Fly Mojo Midi in April 2011 (so, yes, conveniently for Parker, their one year warranty has expired). The guitar began buzzing on the lower register frets, while the higher registers were buzz-free. Seems unlikely, right? i took the guitar to my local guitar tech who pointed out that the fretboard is separating from the neck. I am an amateur who plays the guitar several hours a week. The guitar has been out of my house once, for a two hour jam session. I would be angry if a $300 Mexican Strat suffered such a fate after a year and a half of gentle play. But a $4,000 guitar?!?! Looks like a replay of CBS' purchase of Fender. Unfortunately, I have a Post - U.S. Music Corp. Parker Fly, which will probably have all the value of a post-CBS Fender down the road.

Most of the stories come from the Victorian and pre-WWII eras, although there are some exceptions. The series is also notable because the editors have made a special effort to find interesting stories by lesser known writers and the more obscure (but almost always entertaining) tales of the usual suspects such as Bram Stoker, Poe, J. Sheridan le Fanu, Conan Doyle and F. Marion Crawford. The collection under review is a great deal of fun despite the odd clunker and one or two of the stories is exceptional (Gerald Durrell, of all people, is represented by \\"The Entrance\\" which I regard as a small masterpiece).

A player may even use all of the boardcards and no personal cards to form a hand (play the board).

Strategies address all areas of anxiety, including physical tension, worry, and interpersonal issues. Each chapter details a specific anxiety reduction strategy--eg, diaphragmatic breathing, self-hypnosis, thought stopping--and at the start of the book, there is a self quiz to help determine which chapters would best meet your individual needs.

It covers a period of laborers working in the sugar plantations of Hawaii. A diverse group of people, coming together under hardships, overcoming adversity and language barriers. Mr. Takaki did an excellent combination of relating the days that made sugar King, and how it was built on the backs of the Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino's.

It could be named \\"progresive sludge\\" or \\"melodic drone\\" or \\"progressive noise\\" and so on...So, what could you expect of conifer? Heavy and unique music. The length of the songs of these CD are quite varied, from the epic initial song named Troy that last 23 min. to the 5:51 min. of widowmaker.The best example of the ability of Conifer is in the first track, Troy. It stars with some sort of progressive and electronic elements for almost 5 minutes, it's followed by a melodic introduction with electro-acoustic guitars and by minute 10 the fun begins. Heavy guitars riffs in arrangements that could be described as droning and melodic.If you like heavy and unique music and are not scared of different approaches to heaviness then Conifer is for you.For fans of Ocean, Neurosis and so on...Get Yours!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"Video documentation of the blues greats is shamefully unavailable.It is a tremendous loss to us all that there is so little good footage and that the Europeans had to show us where it's at and how it's done.

If you are wanting to go deeper in your faith, you will find that the teaching is challenging, but repeatedly backed by scriptures. Because it is so \\"meaty\\" for most of us mainstream Christians, it helps that it is backed up with a forward by Billy Graham. I am so thankful I found this treasure and have shared it with many. Those I know who happened on it years ago still recall its impact.--\\"Prayer is where the Action Is.\\" Do get this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with an overrated book","review":"I thought the advice given was nothing new, cliche-ish and thus very uninspiring. The book often refers the reader to other books for what I believe it lacked--depth and focus. Also I disagree with the writers idea of how to handle anger. They mention how, in early editions of this book, they had encouraged readers to physically express anger safely but now recommend verbal expression instead. The importance of safe physical expression of anger is clearly and effectively explained in John Lee's \\"Facing the Fire\\"--a must-read for anyone having issues over anger especially suppressed anger left over from the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was amateurish.","review":"The table of contents and general outline were acceptable.The reference to diet affecting assertiveness was a big stretch.The bibliography was difficult to corroborate and certain references to books were not found when searching for them by using Amazon.comThe book is worth less than the price asked."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRONG DON'T BUY","review":"I installed it with standart options.

So i emailed them SEVERAL TIMES and they still did not help me. This software is now useless to me and i haven't even been able to use it on my computer. Their customer service was very poor. Instead of offering me an exchange they expected me to contact the technical dept. that charges $2.95 (i think)/minute as it was over 30 days that i purchased it.

Until I tried to upgrade to the newest version so as to stay up to date. Completely took over my machine. I even had to reformat. Tried to install the new version after reformat, and NO LUCK! Wouldn't even let me get on the net even after I allowed my explorer access. So I restored my machine back to the reformat and I have reinstalled version 6.0 back onto my machine and no problems.

After uninstalling it over and over it will keep on reappearing and running in the back ground doing the same dirty things as if it was never uninstalled.One more thing, your email client will never work in the presences of this software.

Especially in dial-up and e-mail configurations, you must implement certain settings. This book really answers those questions. There's a whole chapter on configuring DNS for e-mail servers.Technical depth is quite good. Good enough for most environments anyway. This book will not answer every technical bit, but than you would need a 1500+ pages book. In all other circumstances: GET THIS BOOK!

But, like the other reviewer noted, the design is flawed. The top piece that holds the 8830 into the case will flex and break within the week. Almost guaranteed to break within the month.

I settled on an OEM leather case instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed design","review":"The holster came in very handy until it broke. The design is flawed. The area near the top, just above the belt clip handle, has a cut out for the speaker. The cut out leaves very little material for strength of the entire top area that actually locks the phone into the holster. I bumped the phone against my desk chair and I heard a snap but the phone didn't drop out because of the cupped area on the bottom holding it in. So I didn't think much of it until I tried to remove the phone and it just slipped right out. Then I saw that the locking area broke off at the weak spot. This was with a very small bump against an office chair. The very brittle plastic probably didn't help.
