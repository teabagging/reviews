The Brothers Grimm are defintely the best tale-weavers this world will know. Even Hans C.Anderson cannot produce stories up to their standard. They put the magic in the story and proceed to charm the reader with the tale's simplicity and innocence.

The title of the book says 'Andalusian' but there is nothing about it. The decoration in all houses is pretentious and over elaborated with objects filling all spaces. The houses scream 'fake' to anybody with direct contact with the real Andalusian style. Don't buy the book looking for Andalusian style. The only thing I saw related was the use of Mexican saltillo tile in a few floors. If you want Andalusian look for books with Moroccan style, like whitewash walls, 'albero' (ocre) colors on details, lots of Moroccan style tile, ery little furniture, baked clay tile on floors, etc. Some houses on the book did have courtyards but none had the Andalusian style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I can't say more about this book.

It is a dangerously seductive piece of propaganda that persuasively hits all the \\"right notes,\\" especially for anyone with a muddle-headed agenda that exists in defiance of common sense. When looked at rationally, it is probably the single most evil, hate-filled piece of writing I have ever encountered. It could only have been written from one of two perspectives. Either the author has absolutely no understanding of the realities that make human life possible, or else he has a profound and deep-seated loathing of civilization. I am not exaggerating when I state my feeling that, if there is ever another truly dangerous ideology that, like Nazism, will be embraced by the weak-minded and easily misled, a book like this could very easily be their bible. In it, they will find all of the misguided ammunition they need to justify destroying everything of value and beauty in the human world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character and intelligence define real progress","review":"Berry writes in a very eloquent and poignant manner to enlighten readers about the big American misconception that modern agriculture and technology is the only way to prosper.

I recommend this book to any person who cares about the environment, agriculture, and public policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Statistics by example only - very little theory/concepts","review":"After using this book for a class, we all agreed that this book was not the best for those of us who are just learning the concepts in analyzing variance. The author tends to assume the basics are \\"hard-coded\\" into the students head. Fair enough. His next step, however, is not to discuss the theory/concept. Rather, it is to give an example of what he is talking about, hoping you will grasp the concept. It would very helpful to have the concepts explained and then the examples given. In addition, the notation (subscripts) are not always explained, nor are the formulas obvious/straightforward. Finally, the book has editing problems.A better editor and supplementary manuals (step-by-step explanation of concepts and formulas, SPSS instruction, etc.) would be a big help.My recommendation would be to find another book from which you will learn statistics."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEST LAXATIVE EVARRRR!!!","review":"Whew!

But who cares? from the first \\"Nadir's big chance\\" to the last \\"2 or 3 spectres\\", Hammill proves that he's a great rock'n'roller. Also, his fans were surprised to hear that bitter artist telling a joke and laughing about one of his songs, that was too close to Stevie Wonder. David Jackson is wilder than ever with his saxophones (if you had the chance to see him on stage playing 2,3 and 4 saxes simultaneously, you can understand how good the man is). Yet it's not the typical Hammill I recommend this album to all rockers around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smash The System With A Song!","review":"Peter Nadir & Rikki Hammill...This is one of the essential rock records of the 70's. What still amazes now about this epic recording is the purity of its lyrics and the honesty of its music, so far from the pressures of stardom or fashion: a rare example of intelligent energy in music. In my opinion this concept album was the first and last of the \\"indie\\" rock albums. Just Incredible. Hammill's fantastic gift of expression will soon move to different sound worlds and masterpieces like \\"The Future Now\\", \\"PH7\\" and \\"A Black Box\\", all very recommended. One last note: the Track \\"Nadir's Big Chance\\" was also the encore on the glorious Van Der Graaf \\"Vital\\", one of the most extraordinary live recordings in rock history.

The reason is that while this juicer simply applies downward force, the reamer in the Breville squeezes out little bits as it rotates. With the Olympus you also get some bitter taste from the peel because the force here is much greater.I realize that the Breville I used is not commercial grade but they make a commercial variant which I will be buying.

We were all familiar with the story of the \\"littlest angel\\" and hoped that a movie with such a cute kid in it would do the story justice; we never expected the most boring musical of all time. A low quality song and dance routine is given for every single little step the kid takes. There is even literally (and I wish I were joking) a song about nothing. I can't imagine any child watching this movie and enjoying it--I am a very patient person who loves movies others consider slow and even I found The Littlest Angel unbelievably dull. When it finally ended I felt I'd been through an ordeal. Needless to say, The Littlest Angel has NOT become a Christmas classic at our house.

The heros, in trench-coats and hats, try to keep the peace in streets filled with inhuman villans, who are strangely human, much more so than the heroes themselves, in many ways.

Does that strike anyone else as utter and complete nuttery??? It's like telling a holocaust victim that thier experiences built character. What a crackpot!

Some are just wonderful. I love reading Mary Balogh's or Jo Beverly's reissues because they write timeless storylines and truly powerful books no matter when they are published. This one, however, pales 9 years after it was first published. The endless plotline with Bonaparte, French spying, and smuggled goods has been done to death. If Enoch had done some editing before this was reissued and reduced all the extra \\"intrigue\\", the book would have been much better. The relationship between Kit and Alex is still good. But, it takes soooo long for anything to happen between them. I got bored long before they develop any kind of relationship. Skimming 2/3 of the book was frustrating.

Found her too obnoxious. I couldn't figure out exactly what Alex saw in her- at all. I also found it incredible that with all her cleverness, she didn't know what her father had been smuggling into France. Really?She is so good at getting into locked rooms, but no curiosity or means to find about what her father smuggles? She is at Alex's house, spying on him and his friends, eating his food, getting money for clothes and what not, traitor to her country and acts the complete Brat, calling him, ox, pig, and whatnot.

Kit is independent and brave and has a sweet innocence about her. What won me over was the beautiful way with which Ms. Enoch describes Alex's growing feelings toward Christine.

The author gives equal development to both human and nonhuman, and addresses classic discriminatory issues between each, as well as a well-established romantic relationship that stems from unlikely sources for two sets of main characters, and the ending is as fast-paced and emotional as one might expect, offering a realistic view of emotion and war.

Also, there is almost no action to move the story along - and I don't mean just battles etc. I good story has to move along and this one stagnates. The characters and writing style is very sappy. This writer needs to learn how to write a story by showing more then telling. They just simply tell everything. Very poorly written from that regard. One thing good about this book is the fact that the birds were fairly believable. The ending was good in some ways, and terrible in other ways. The antagonist was barely known throughout the book and his conclusion was almost nothing. If you like romance novels, you might like this book. But I prefer better writing than that. Read David Gemmell, then compare his writing to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Days of Our Lives!!","review":"I just don't get it! The whole book doesn't make sense. This is a boring book revolving around some weird [adult] fantasy the authors have about therapists/clients and they try and get the reader involved with it. It rambles from one position to another and revolves around life in a camp. The camp life became so boring I was hoping there was a printing fault and all the pages slowly became blank. This book is about relationships FULL STOP! The fantasy part involves some flying bird things and it has no bad guy of any consequence. It's more like Days of Our Lives with a little magic thrown. If you buy it second hand for 99cents then you have paid 99cents plus postage too much. If I had got this book from the library instead of paying for it, I would not have bothered finishing it. There are only two books that I have paid for and not finished reading Wheel of Time (Book 1) and Althalus. Honestly this book is horrendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lackey is brilliant!!!!!!","review":"I was absolutely smitten with her world the moment I picked up this book. Valdemar is so well developed and tied together, I can believe in it. Lackey's unending creativity, originality, and persistance at making this world live pay off. Anyone who reads fantasy should read ALL of the tales of Valdemar, beginning to end. No fantasy reader could be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all fantasy fans","review":"This book was excellent. The characters are so well defined its as if they were real. It has a good mix of tragedy and humor. And with characters like Skandranon who would get bored with it?

The start and finish of the book are excellent. The characters are full of life and the I got deeply involved with their lives. One drawback to this book is the length of time spent describing the camp life of the main characters. The other drawback is I never really got to know the main villain. In fact the only time the book involves the villain is at the finish. More involvement from the villain would have made this book something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read even for those who dislike fantasy!","review":"I am not one who cares for fantasy; I am often appauled at the severe lack of good science-fiction (not just Star Wars or Star Trek) in bookstores today. But after I recieved a copy of The Black Gryphon from a relative after Christmas, I couldn't put it down! Instead of focusing on spells and potions, the author focused on character development, relationships, strategy and what it's like for those behind the lines in the time of war. You could really sympathize with the characters! (I especially did with Zhaneel). This is one series that will be read over and over again in my household. Snag this one up fast if you can find it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writer","review":"Mercades Lackey is a great writer, and proves it again with this book! I love that she is able to write above just the war, but inside it as well, the fear for/of friends and the hardships they all have to overcome is just awesome! I'm not going to go into detail about the book, other than read this and its sequel because they are worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"But why?","review":"This is the fantasy novel equivalent of a \\"chick flick\\". The true focus of the story is not the war between Maar and Urtho, but the personal travails and relationships of a therapist and his clients set against a fantasy backdrop. If you go in for such relationshippy stuff, this is a book for you (indeed, Mercedes Lackey excels at this kind of writing). To me, it seems a waste of the fantasy genre. Consider: human relationships are real, magic is not. Hence, it is possible to write about human relationships in a real-world setting without losing anything. But fantasy is meant to provide escapist fun or, at most, reflections on life, the universe etc. neatly packaged and disguised with lots of escapist fun. What other purpose is served by putting in the fantastic? As a fantasy, The Black Gryphon fails to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"My intro to Valdemar","review":"This was the first Mercerdes Lacky book I'd ever read (That was more than a year ago).

The imagery conjured up is fantastic- readers are transported to the battlefield in this fast-paced war and are left wondering... did s/he make it? What happens next?The ending, however, is not for those who enjoy happier endings. I usually don't mind a well written, unhappy ending, but this one bothers me because I feel as if it was thrown together without much consideration to what reader reaction would be. I almost feel scarred from it, emotionally, though I will soon forget this book because the impressions are not lasting, memorable, or in general, good. It was a great ride for the first 350 pages and then it was over for me. Sadly, the ending left me disappointed and angry with life in general. Perhaps this was target action the authors wanted to elicit? If so, they hit it head on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I really loved reading about the Mage of Silence and the war that caused the disaster.

Lackey manages to capture the trials and tribulations of being a hero as well as the successes and joys. It is also a realistic look at warfare, though the fighting takes second place to life in the camp and the relationship between a healer called Amberdrake and the legendary Black Gryphon, Skandranon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved It!","review":"Lacky has really outdone herself this time.

The caliber of songqriting is extraordinary, and the line-up (Gary Windo, Mongezi Fesa, Fred Frith, Brian Eno, the amazing Laurie Allen) reads like a who's who of the avant garde of the time. I alway enjoyed this somewhat more than \\"Rock Bottom\\" because its attitude was more fun. Wyatt had seemed to come to grips with his paralysis and was realizing more of what he could do by the time this album came out.It has the same dreamy, shimmering atmosphere as \\"Rock Bottom\\" but is no less brilliant. This was one of the few times that I have heard jazz, avant garde, and pop sensibilities blended so seamlessly. A great work!Gary Gomes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fine Wyatt Disc","review":"The oft-overlooked companion to \\"Rock Bottom\\", \\"Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard\\" lacks its predecessor's spiritual flow but checks in with a number of highlights, most notably the long cut \\"Team Spirit\\", which sounds like a pretend-pop song gone wrong thanks to the singer's inimitable vocal style. Wyatt's brand of avant-jazz-prog instrumental is in fine form throughout, although all of the little bits and pieces of \\"Muddy Mouse\\" which take up side one can get on one's nerves a bit. It doesn't feel as essential as \\"Rock Bottom\\" from either a lyrical or musical standpoint, but that kind of album comes only once in an artist's career anyway--and \\"Ruth\\" offers up strange delights of its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are not Adjustable!!!!!","review":"I just received these and it was a waste of money.

I especially don't think men would like it - it has a strong female slant, seems primarily applicable to females, and to females in rough spots - the author talks a lot about her prior experience married to an addict, and how women who are content to smile and nod should break out of their shackles (in so many words). Perhaps this book is beneficial to women suffering from a lack of self-confidence, or women in really unhealthy relationships, but I think people who are just seeking better communication skills or general improvement for their relationships won't benefit from this book. Almost half of the book was \\"questions you should ask each other,\\" which I also didn't find helpful. Wouldn't recommend this book to others; there are definitely better ones out there. I think part of this woman's fame and hype is the result of her connection with Oprah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"All in all, I really enjoyed this book, as it brought home the truth about marridge, and what we're really commiting to when we say those sacred wedding vowes. The truth in my opinion is that you are commiting to just more than love, and enternal life together, than we let ourselfes in for, and this illustrates this in this fascinating, book, that really tells you the truth about marridge, with self expeirences and other peoples problems, Smith really brings it home in a truly amazing way.Sam Worrall rating: 4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read Before Marriage","review":"As a wedding expert, I've often told couples to focus on the MARRIAGE, not just the wedding. Now I have just the book to recommend to them. These are the *real* questions that must be discussed before the wedding -- not 'what color do you want the napkins to be.' Dr. Robin has provided such a terrific guidebook to get couples talking about the big issues, and the little things that become big issues, so that they have the communication, honesty and insight into where their partner stands on deeper values. Expectations about marriage will certainly be more realistic after reading this book, so I highly recommend it for engaged couples and as a gift from the parents, bridal parties and friends who love them.Dr. Robin has just provided THE book for engaged couples. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this before you get married.","review":"The author brought out some thought patterns people have that I have never thought about - subconscious beliefs that we have but don't realize it. The problem is that these beliefs mess up our relationships. An excellent book for those serious about making a lasting marriage.Edited 1-24-2011 to add: It is vitally important for both partners to read this book and to be honest when answering questions. The book is loaded with questions to answer, questions that should be answered in a different space from the person you intend to marry (preferably not even in the same room). I made the mistake of not doing this with some of the questions (we verbally answered them together). It turned out that he answered the questions in ways he thought would please me - and I glossed over some of his answers that were warning signs.

In fact, his six warfare theses only require a standard Arminian approach to interpreting the bible. However, the real treasure of the book is the second half, where he deals with prayer, natural evil, and hell. His chapter on prayer is nothing short of intellectually stimulating, his review of the accounts of natural evil are concise and yet systematic. His treatment of Hell, however, is the singularly most fascinating aspect of this book, and it would be well worth one's money just to buy the book for the last 2 chapters on hell alone.

It would seem to me that the price of the book has been inflated beyond what any rational person without a class would pay for it. Here's a theory for you. The college profs and authors of the textbooks have a pact. You require the book that I write and I'll require yours. Then we both charge triple what it's worth and run with the money.

The problem is that they're too episodic, with too little resolution. They don't stand well as novels on their own. There's been little real plot advancement, just incidents, stuff happening, and all shortly after the post \\"Paradis\\" split of the fleet (it's telling that half the fleet doesn't actually get to its destination, while the other half stays where they were at the start of the book).

With all due respect to Richard Hatch, the book doesn't flow well. It seems choppy. There are places throughout the book where the story moves from one character to the next without any break in the text to notify the reader. I found myself reading sections several times trying to figure out what was going on. Maybe this is the fault of the publisher, or formatting the print, and not the author.I leapt at the chance to own one of Hatch's novels. Prior to reading this book, I was looking for copies of his previous Battlestar Galactica books to add to my collection. Now I'm not so sure.The ending of this novel leaves the impression there will be more to come. Check your local library for future books, but leave your money in your wallet. (Unless you need a good paperweight...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book needs more of everything","review":"This book did not have a real story in it expect for the romance of apollo and sheba. Mr. Hatch needs to add more action and adventure. Where did it go with this story. It was like reading a soap opera. If he writes another one I hope he adds a lot more than he did for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Vignettes","review":"The book starts off with essays on various aspects of Indian poetry, particularly the different motifs used by poets writing in particular languages. The essays are a bit dry, but they are important for interpreting the poetry if you have not had any other background on Indic poetry.The poems are grouped by speaker/audience of the poem, which is helpful thematically, but is confusing when flipping between the poems and the various essays depending on which language the poem is written in. My favorites were generally the Tamil poems, which had very precise symbolic meanings attached to various aspects of nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, I'm sure but...","review":"I've waited for this and the solo's version for ever, unfortunately, they are only available in PAL format.

The focus is upon two Mennonite villages: \\"Apanlee\\" in the Molotschna settlement of the Ukraine, and \\"Mennotown,\\" near Hillsboro in south-central Kansas. The main characters belong to two interrelated families in these villages. The story moves from a golden age built on Mennonite virtue to a disaster imposed by evil outside forces. Volume one is filled with stories of romance, love and community creation in Kansas and the Ukraine. Rimland is a vigorous storyteller, especially alert to the experiences and feelings of women. But her writing is repetitive and few of the characters rise above the level of carricature. The novel is flawed by an antisemitic bias. Rimland links Mennonite virtues to the Nazi ideology of a super race. Her ideological agenda gets in the way of her literary ambition."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD PACKING...","review":"It's tough to review this CD purchase for the primary cuts I purchased it for were not included.

As her skills become well know she starts to worry that maybe she's building a reputation as the village 'bycicle' ... course that sure doesn't stop her from enjoying the fruits of nature ....To make matters worse she then moves in with a nutbag of a psychlogist as his housekeeper .. and then the rest of the village prctically moves in with her as well .... I did not like this book because the nutbag doctor is such a crazy that there is no way I as the reader can hope to even closely identify with the character or get into the story ....I didn't even like Robin because this is one girl that just can't keep her mouth shut .... at least not for more than one or two pages ......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content but I didn't know it was homemade","review":"I agree this had useful content - especially the day planning section. However it is - how do I put this - cheesy looking. It looks totally homemade. Different fonts on different pages give it a very amateur appearance.

LOL that's women studies fanatic for you.Regardless, I liked this book because for once the main character was standing up to the conventions of the society. And I wanted to slap the male lead more than once, but what can I say... double standards and women. Either way, the book grabbed my attention and held it because I wanted to know who was the culprit! I do have to tell you, I got my suspicions about halfway, maybe even earlier, in the book and I was right.Good read if you want some relaxing reading, without having to think too much.

There are no such things as bad professors, just bad students. No matter how well you think you tried to take notes and be an \\"active listener,\\" you apparently just weren't trying hard enough! If you get a bad grade on a test, why, the professor NEVER could have supplied you with unclear, badly written questions, or even quizzed you on material you didn't cover! It's all YOUR fault!

The characters are real and people you know. The troubled protagonist, Claude, is sympathetic. Why not? There's something of him in all of us. Unfortunately, the book falls apart when he enlists as a doughboy and ships to France.Cather once stated that she experienced everything that ever went into her writing by the time she was 15. Clearly that didn't include the Western Front. The second half of the book, based on her research and interviews with WWI vets, is not her experience and it shows. The events and descriptions are shallow and superficial, and felt more like an outline, without flesh and blood. The book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Ours","review":"Numerous typo errors. Don't think anyone proof read the text. This is definitely not the copy one should buy.

If you need someone to retype great classics in the future, please call me. The typos were rampant and made it hard to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but still very good","review":"Nothing can compare with Cather's O, PIONEERS, or even her SONG OF THE LARK, but this book is pretty darn close. The writing is the same--good--as in her other books, but the one thing I DID like better about ONE OF OURS is the fact that it explores a more psychological aspect of the main character---especially that of someone during the WWI period. As with all Cather's books, they are crafted well. A few may find her a little too wordy, but consider that these were written in a time when there was no TV, few movies, and barely any radio. It's what people wanted back then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story/Terrible edition","review":"I was shocked by the shoddy formatting of this book. Text begins and ends with little logic. It looked like a problem between two computer programs, and was extremely distracting. The large format of the book was also very clumsy. Buy a different edition of this moving Cather work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID ANYONE PROOF READ??","review":"THIS STORY LINE AND WRITING ARE GREAT, BUT THE BOOK IS A TOTAL MESS.

And the comments that the tin (so unique and special) is rusting the tub (which is easy to remove). Use the salts and put the tin on your counter top before you step into this great stress reliever. I had injured my back badly and have used this product for over two years and find it to be wonderful and affordable. At just $10.00 try it for yourself.

Try it you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I generally like Burt's Bees products as well, however, this product is awful.

This was a surprising find as it really did seem to have therapeutic properties and left me feeling refreshed after a hot soak. I have fibromyalgia so I'm always on the look out for products that ease some of the symptoms I deal with on a daily basis. This product is one I will add to my arsenal and encourage others to do the same. (*NOTE: I did get a bit of a burning sensation on my legs after using this product, but it went away in approximately two hours. Not painful, but slightly unpleasant and unexpected. My guess would be it may have been part of the 'therapeutic' action working in my muscles.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for sore muscles","review":"This product works absolute wonders on sore muscles. I use it after strenuous workouts or anytime my muscles ache. It affects a very noticeable difference, and 99% of the time my muscles do not hurt anymore by the time I get out of the bath. That is awesome!! It also works great when I have a sore neck, which I get occasionally simply from being at the computer too much. It has a lemony-menthol type of smell to it, which I do not find offensive, but as others have noted it was not intended to be a \\"foo foo\\", perfume-laden bath product. I have yet to find any other soak, salts or lotion that work as well on sore muscles as this product does."},{"rating":"1","title":"a strong bite to this one!","review":"This is a really strong medicinal-smelling product. I almost was overcome when I prised the can lid off. It feels good in the bath but I was not looking for such an odor....kind of puts me off my bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for a cold? Or the flu?","review":"The salts smell like a white or yellow cough drop. If you smell them straight out of the tin, it definitely burns your nose. When they say therapeutic, they mean it. Don't buy these if you just want a nice, lemon-scented bath salt. I will be using them on the event that I get sick, but for everyday, they are horrible and the scent stays with you.Also, you will need a can opener (like, the same as you'd use to open paint cans) to get into the package. Then, inside the metal can is a bag of the salts. The can rusts (I had a ring on my tub when I picked it up), so you may want to cover the bottom with tape or nail polish, or permanently keep it in a cupboard away from water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I was really excited when I ordered this product.

Jung, founder of analytical psychology, the author argues that Ancient Egypt was a great coherent yet primitive society. Divided in three parts, this book first outlines the main historical events of the Egyptian kingdoms through chronological sequence of the royal dinasties.

I really like this film, in spite of some of the implausable ideas like a single person being able to arm our nuclear arsenal. However, this particular video being sold (which I bought and have just now viewed) is MASSACRED! It looks & sounds like someone set up a camcorder in their living room & taped the movie off their TV. The sound is TERRIBLE, the framing cuts off any captions & subtitles, and, to add insult to injury, they CUT OUT the last 10 minutes of the film showing the journey back to the survivors in Antartica -- it ends with the world being destroyed by the nuclear explosions!

My 5 stars are for the movie and the 156 minute disc version from Acme-TV, not for the shortened disc versions that run at 108 minutes and cropped at 4:3 pan and scan.

Thank you Goosebumps for putting that smile on my daughter's face while challenging her mind to expand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap for a Reason","review":"The Wolfcraft table is one of the cheapest tables you will find and for good reason. The parts are ill fitting and poorly designed. The guides move independently from each other making alignment difficult, and the clear plastic safety cover all but falls off with a little bump. Here are my recommendations, if you want the capabilities of a table at this price, find a high quality edge guide and make a jig or two, and if you really want a table and the convenience it provides, consider looking at the $230 model from Kreg (its well worth the upgrade)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Help for Real Parents","review":"As a parent, I've read lots of parenting books. Most of them seem to tell you what to think and what to do, and often give advice that doesn't really fit for me or my children. But this one encourages you to think for yourself, and to really observe and understand your child, to figure out what works with him or her. I love it. Reading it is like having a chance to talk things over with someone who really knows what being a parent is like. I felt very helped by it, and very much liked the authors respectful tone.All this, and it's short, and easily readible - very important for tired, busy parents!I think this is a wonderful book is perfect for mothers and fathers who have a child up to three years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel alive again...","review":"This album has made me alive again.

Mr. Williams has thoroughly researched each of these myths and exposes them for what they are. And with the computer explosion of the last 10 years,it seems that most of these myths,legends,etc. will be with us for a long time to come. Also he properly criticizes the Christian media for helping to spread some of these myths. Doesn't anybody ever check the source of these things?? An informative yet fun book to read. Would be great for a Sunday School class to spend some time studying. Pastors too,should read this book. A source for many sermons I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy Lifestyle","review":"The massager, being soft, flexable has made it possible for me to exercise,stretch and strengthen my skin, blood flow and muscles.

The original (which is almost impossible to find) consisted of 11 tracks and was first released in 1996 with a different album cover. All copies now in print have the extra 2 \\"bonus\\" tracks (track 10 - \\"Redemption Songs\\", and track 13 - \\"The Last Picture Show\\"). Personally, I could have done without both of them, especially \\"Redemption Songs\\", now the album's only dud. Despite these two rating-lowering additions, the third volume of the Cafe Del Mar series is a worthy addition to the music libraries of ambient/chillout compilation fans and should not be missed.4/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled, this is not trance","review":"this cd is not what it would appear to be. it is not trance and has nothing to do with energy 52's cafe del mar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"road\\" tires for a mountain bike!","review":"I use these tires on my drop-bar fixed-gear MTB conversion during the spring, summer, and fall months. They're not \\"slick\\", but the tread is flexible and the sidewalls supple. The tires are comfortable and easy enough to propel that this became my go-to bike for anything from my 7-mile commute, to 25-mile club rides, to 60-mile gravel rides. One nice thing about wider tires is that they take longer to wear out, but I'll definitely buy another set once these do. The tan sidewalls make them look classier than other MTB-sized tires in my opinion, and I'm happy that Panaracer still makes quality tires in this style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light reading, font size inflated to fill the volume.","review":"This book consists of three columns per page with such a large font that there are usually four to six words per line. Talk about an inefficient reading format, two columns would have reduced eye shift going from line to line. It's as if the publisher was trying to turn an eighty page book into it's present 135 page form. And there are very few diagrams; most of the illustrations are photos with little information.Hoping to find a compendium of performance how-to's for 1969-1989 911s, I discovered it highlights 1969-73 only, with the author's 1970 as the main subject. It's more of a step-by-step description of what the author had done to his vehicle.I wish this book were titled \\"My odyssey building up a 911S\\" instead of \\"Porsche 911 Performance.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain-4","review":"Great first steps or basic information for building a better Porsche.

Since lamour died he has been one of my favortie writers but im starting to get away from his series books and going for his new character books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many flashbacks","review":"I agree with Morris. In all of his recent books, Johnstone seems to be running out of material and filling out his stories with excessive retelling of what has gone on in previous books in a series. This seems to apply to all of his past series and looks like 30% plus is flashbacks (retelling segments of previous books) where they are obviously used as page fillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of people slept on this one...","review":"This Blac Monks joint was unreal.

Wait I think I've got it.","review":"Jecks is certainly prolific and has many books to his credit now but when the word jail slips in instead of gaol, I begin to wonder how well researched these novels are. Well we start going down a convoluted plot and when it seems likely that one will never guess from clues whom we have as the culprit, process of elimination of characters that we have met leaves the solution very evident too early. Once you figure out the whodunit, because there are not enough red herrings for a reader, though certainly for our heroes, waiting for those heros to catch up is quite painful. Cadfael, where are you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The very misunderstood bully","review":"This book occurs in the same timeframe as \\"A Dog on Barkham Street\\". It is how Martin Hastings, the bully in both books, sees life. At the beginning of the book, Martin was being his ususal \\"bully\\" self and then he starts to shape up. Towards the end of the book I realized he was just misunderstood. It is a good book to see how a bully feels. You should read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summer read for a 9 year old - IAB","review":"This is a story about a boy who everyone thinks is a bully but I think he is nice. His name is Martin Hastings. People keep pushing Martin and he get really mad. He has one sister named Marietta and a dog named Rufus. I decided to write about this book because it is kind of like my life. I have a dog like Martin and I sometimes get in fights with my friends but I don't mean to. I think all children would like this book because it goes through a boys life and it shows how he changes from a bully to a nice kid. In one part Rufus is taken away because Martin was naughty. Martin gets in a lot of fights. In one fight with his neighbor Edward, it ends up with Edward running away. The book ends happily because Edwards mother finds him. From this Martin learns to be nicer to other people. I give this book 5 stars - it is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Torked it's Copy Protected","review":"There are zillions of people out there like me who don't upload songs on peer sites for stealing.

After the worldwide massave message A Rush Of The Blood To The Head has brought from the band, they really have done it again with another very soulful track. Chris Martin & company's latest Speed Of Sound, the lead-off single from the bands third release X&Y; is a remarkable uplifting feeling of a song. It is just great to listen to and is just a pure delight. The feeling is similarly showcased as a mix from other great singles like Clocks, and Trouble, but it is just captured so well from the alternative feelings. It is just one of the best tracks released so far this year.Song: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Coldplay","review":"Quality music. If you like Coldplay this CD is a must have for your collection. They have their own uniqueness and they remain wonderfully consistant.

First of all, eventhough this concert took place in 1992 in Hamburg, Germany, this new special edition DVD was released in 2005, utilizing High-Definition wide-screen transfer, as well as remastered Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound, with multiple camera editing. Fine. But what about the performance? A masterpiece. The original band members were at their peak, as well as band leader Mick Hucknall. The stage presence and musicianship is just superb. This show performance is much better than the \\"Live in London\\" DVD, and just as lively and outstanding as the \\"Live in Sicily\\" DVD. I enjoy live performances and this DVD does it all. It will make your Home Theater system outshine and clearly demostrate that Simply Red crosses all boundaries and feelings with enduring musicianship. As you can tell, it is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor video editing","review":"this concert is very hard to watch due to the scene changes every 2 seconds. i bought his other dvd's hoping this would change, however it's the same crap on those shows too...don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gong - 'Shamal' (Caroline)","review":"Originally released in 1976,after both Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth had jumped the mother Gongship,drummer Pierre Moerlen(R.I.P.)had virtually taken over the band.This CD reissue simply didn't do much for me,however four(4)of these tracks are performed live on the 2005 archive release Gong-'Live In Sherwood Forest,1975'(see my review)where guitarist Steve Hillage rejoins the the cosmic clan for a brief tour.Those four cuts are \\"Wingful Of Eyes\\",\\"Chandra\\",the semi-trippin' \\"Cat In Clark's Shoes\\" and the jazzy title track \\"Shamal\\".Pretty much for Gong completists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb example of lost-in-space music.","review":"I was alway mystified about this album.

Since the bag material is not at all stiff, (in fact it is rather flimsy) I would not feel comfortable bicycling with my \\"wallet, keys, & cell phone\\" in this bag as the description suggests. The closure flap is held by only buckle strap in the middle, a design flaw which could allow items to slip right out of the sides.I couldn't use this bag, so I returned it.

Amazon return process was quick and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubtedly the Jimi-Hendrix of the Voice","review":"This was Peter Hammill's second solo album and first after the demise of Van der Graaf Generator in 1972. The recording contains performances from all members of Van der Graaf as it appears that some of the songs were intended for use by the band. The album contains a variety of excellent music; psychedelic (German Overalls), folk (What's it Worth), ballad (Easy to Slip Away) and one of the darkest progressive rock tunes ever written (In the) Black Room. Very sinister, indeed. Lyrically, Hammill is extremely introspective. These lyrics are generally bleak, however the album ends (somewhat) positively with the final verses of Black Room, although Hammill admits that there are still choices ahead of him. Great lyrics, great songwriting and one of the most impassioned vocalists in Rock Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok if you are like in love with tirck other wise no","review":"There are Three good songs on this entire album F***in' around, D.O.D.D.

Well back to the cd, there aint really anything that u can feel, its just like the same ol junk, nothin original, just annoying.

GO BUY THAT TUPAC CD PEACE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sickens Me","review":"Alright, honestly. Something has to be pointed out here. Trick Daddy and Lil Jons cover of Crazy Train IS NOT in the least bit creative. Crazy Train was a classic song, and all they did was take the beginning riff, make it electronic, put it over a sample, loop is for 4 minutes and throw some mindless \\"Yeah, What, Okays\\" into the mix. ANYBODY could do that. Is it really excruciatingly painful to write your own song, instead of ripping off everybody elses music and sticking your own crap on top? Or how about forming a coherent sentence? The yeahs, whats and okays get old very fast. And yes...I do realize he had to get permission to do this song, and I cant believe that the record label let him do it.

Trick Daddy does have some more songs with a good beat but those two songs are really the only upbeat songs on it. Not to say because they are slower R&B/hiphop sounding that they are bad.

Now that's what I call a WIN WIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, this book takes forever!!","review":"I must agree with the other reviewers -- this book is good, however, it moves so slow. Like another reviewer, the only reason I finished it was to see what happened with the ghost.Also, another problem I had was when Mereli lost her virginity. (If she did! Ms. Coffman doesn't really say yay or nay.) There was nothing to lead up to such an interlude. Also, we didn't get to know Meleri's thoughts on losing her virginity.I will say though the book got better after the first 225 pages. But even though, I was yawning throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Read, Pretty Good Story With a Ghost","review":"I won't comment about the entire book because Ms. Klausner did a good job of it. What bothered were inconsistencies in the book. Passages that were obviosuly placed at the wrong place in the book. Some ideas were began but never fully developed and further pursued. At certain points I had to stop and go back and re-read. It is never explained why Melari never met Philip the night she was supposed to do so. Also, Melari never told Robert that Philip had come by while he was away from home. Parts of this were not very clear, although I did enjoy the story. It was not one of those \\"I hate you\\" sort of stories between hero and heroine which I absolutely despise. The lead chearacters have disagreements but this \\"hate\\" stuff turns me off. This book doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disliked this book","review":"This was the only Elaine Coffman I have ever read so I cannot speak for her other books but I thought these caracters were poorly developed. It was almost as if the story was being related by an adolescent girl. The main caracters jump from tangent to tangent. There were all sorts of dangling plot lines and personality shifts. I just plain didn't like it. Unfortunately I bought 2 of her other books at the same time because I thought they might be related. I will force myself to read them to be fair but I am not looking forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"The story was a great idea, but the execution was miserable. The only reason I finished the book was to find out what happened with the ghost. Spelling errors are unacceptable in published work.

They are white frosted bags. The outside of the box that they came shipped in also says they are clear. As a result, these bags can not be used in jurisdictions that require that recycled waste, newspapers, etc., must be in clear plastic bags. You can not see through these bags. These bags are being returned. This is the second time this has happened, but with a different vendor. I don't understand how some vendors can market and advertise an item without first examining the item. This results in wasted shipping costs and wasted time."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the answers I wanted when I was 5. Finally!","review":"If you're tired of \\"you just have to believe it\\" or \\"you can't ask those question\\" while you ponder the questions of God and the Universe you'll find comfort in this book. While it deals with God and science, it feels neither religious or scientific, yet also is both. For someone who comes to it knowling nothing, the presentation communicated with beauty and ease of understanding. While you are given an amazing number of previously elusive answers, you are left inspired to know more. WHile I have delved into the books he suggested as well as others, this remains the most affecting core read.

I checked it out & it was the first & BEST book I have read concerning the Kaballah. It opens the door to understanding like no other. Sheinkin has a way to just transfer this knowledge in a simplistic manner, be it from a story, parable, or direct explanation. The editor- Edward Hoffman also notes that Sheinkin excelled in how he could convey things easily to others. I have a copy of the original red cover 1986 edition, as well as the newer purple cover edition (of which I have loaned out to a church member who upon starting it, said Wow! It is so profound!. And it was Hoffman's 'The Way of Splendor' which was my second book on the Kaballah. If you should want, you can always check your local library & read both first, but then I am sure you will want to buy your own copy of both so you can have them handy.

This was by far the best book out there - it follows a logical sequence, grouping stitches into family types filled with detailed pictures and examples. I returned it to the library and quickly purchased it. I'm still learning, but I have been able to create some basic embellishments for my crafts and feel pretty comfortable choosing which stitches will bring the effect I want to the design. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginner Book","review":"The instructions for the different stitches in this book are clear and easy to understand and they can be applied to almost any needleart kit or project.

If you have an imaginative eye that can see beyond the one and only redundant charming but boring cross stitch, this is the book for you. I highly reccomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Vegan Baker","review":"First, this looks to be an excellent book -- if -- you eat eggs and dairy. If you follow a plant based diet, this is not the book for you. There are handful - count maybe 5 - recipes that don't have eggs and dairy. It is possible to substitute Earth Balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs, if you want to bother. For some reason I thought that because it has Buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant-based baking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bread Book","review":"As a bread baking book excellent.

As a first time bread baker I know I made a number of \\"mistakes.\\" I ended up with delicious hot loaves and our house is perfumed with the orange peel and cinnamon that was in the dough. When Ed Brown writes that his recipes have a wide margin for error he is right. This is a wonderful book, written in a warm and gentle spirit.For the novice baker this book is just the thing. My advice - don't use a machine to handle the dough, at least at first. I feel it's important to know how the dough feels at the different stages of preparation. The kneading is my favorite part! Also - study the basic recipe, read it through a few times before starting if you are a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"My old reliable","review":"I am an avid cook; and I work mostly from scratch, but Ed Brown's book (1970 edition) is my favorite resource for bread, quick breads, and desserts.

With that said I baked it for over a hour and a half and it was still pretty mushy. Since I was pairing this with chili, I just put a slice of the bread in the bottom of the chili bowl so the sogginess wasn't as noticeable. If I make this again, I'll try and tweak ingredients and proportions to see if that helps the consistency. Anyone else make this? I'd like some hints. In any case I do love the fact that most of the pastry recipes use molasses, brown sugar and honey instead of refined white sugar.Other than the cornbread mishap, This book truly is a bread bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classc","review":"This is a classic for home bakers.

Upon first purchasing this gem with its gently textured cover and hand drawn sketches, I fell in love with the poetry that Edward Espe Brown, the author, offered in the opening of this cookbook.His words, insights, and even the recipes themselves carry with them a humbleness and gratitude towards cooking, food, and life.I'm amazed to say that only last week did I actually used one of the recipes (page 100, Bran Muffins) and it was scrumptious--not to mention helpful in getting things flowing (if you know what I mean!).I intend to use many more recipes in the upcoming months. Next on the list is Corn Muffins (still on page 100--I figure why mess with a good thing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad to see it available on ebook format","review":"I had this book way back when it first came out...and gave it away, lost it, or moved without it.

In addition, with the one we bought, the animals get stuck on the arm as they pass it, rendering the whole thing motionless.

We were also disappointed that the strings the animals dangle from are so short and that the animals' faces aren't turned downward for babies to see. We're taking it back tomorrow. It's a shame, because it's really cute.

I was duly impressed with the author's ability to tell the story of what happened - the key discussions, decisions, participants, etc. without boring the reader. You can tell that Dr. Bainton possesses a deep understanding of this era.I highly recommend this book to anyone hoping to learn more about this important part of European (and Christian church) history.

Each start with a yoga section, and you immediately learn the instructors are quite spiritual and in tune with themselves.Hip Hop abs is a fun routine, and will have you sweating ten times more than Cardio Cabaret, which is less cardio and more flirty little jazz moves. Both routines are great fun, but are inappropriately labeled. Hip Hop abs will get your heart rate up further and give you more of a fat burn, but is very light on \\"hip hop\\". Cardio cabaret doesn't elevate the heart enough, but is a fun little routine.The end of hip hop abs is an abs routine on the mat, which I really enjoy. Cabaret ends with a ballet portion that I find difficult because it requires lots of balance and coordination.Overall I really like these dvds and they are so fun I don't realize how fast time is going.

While the H:TLJ Companion is detailed and has in depth interviews with both lead actors (Sorbo & Hurst) we pretty much get Lucy Lawless in Xena's Companion, and that's it. While Miss Lawless is stunning and a wonderful actress as Xena her in book comments aren't enough to hold the episode guide together. I, personally, would have loved to hear from Renee O'Conner (Gabrielle) on many of the key episodes she and Lawless did together. Admittedly, the production notes and comments on costumes and background information is intriguing -- but also flawed. Now that \\"Xena, Warrior Princess\\" is heading into its fifth season let's hope fans get a more up to date companion book ... and one that is a bit more accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source and refrerence material","review":"This books gives you a wonderful and in depth look at the beginning of the great show.

I can understand the cult following, because his songs are not always immediately accessible, not being strictly in the verse-chorus-verse format and not giving up their melodic intricacies at a cursory listen. In this way, his solo work reminds me a lot of Peter Murphy's. My favorite here is the delectable \\"Ophelia\\" with its poetic lyric and simple yet inspiring melody.

Much of the book was writen in a form of a women's ponderings with no real frame of referance to work from. I feel that this is because of the education of the author. When the author actually did give framework like when she was with her grandson and how he looked at the world with fresh eyes it was easy to relate and understand where she was comeing from.

These include the victories of the British archers at Crecy and Agincourt, as well as the French victory over the British at Hastings that permanently changed the government of England.This book is a detailed study of weapons, tactics and strategy from that time. It concentrates mostly on the European armies but includes such battles as the Siege of Constantinople when the Turkish Sultan Mehmet II essentially ended the Byzantine empire.The selection of chapter titles gives a good summary of what the book is teaching: The Role of Infantry, Mounted Warfare, Command and Control, Siege Techniques, and Naval Warfare. The book is beautifully illustrated, including several drawings and illustrations created specially for this edition. The authors are a mixture of British and American switers and professors specializing in the warfare of this time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY","review":"Web site showed item as available. Bought for someone that needed this product. It didn't ship right away as indicated on web site and not one form of communication from this company. Poor and unacceptable service. Price is good but if they can't supply the product what good are they. Find somewhere else to buy. If you buy here you are just wasting time and energy as you will have to fight to undo the order. Their web site now says the order will ship in 7 - 10 days more so the order can't be canceled.

I hoped for concrete advice regarding parasites and some other health concerns and felt this book was lacking. For someone new to herbs it offers guidance that is beneficial but I found myself frustrated that it was repeating very basic information that I know (ginger for digestion, dandelion good tonic, echinacea for immune system) and not getting into the more specific information I would like in a health reference for my cats. It also does not go into what herbs are toxic to cats, another thing that I feel is vitally important to have in any book on herbal cat care. If you are new to herbs and want to start learning, this is an easy to read book, but if you have any specific concerns or want more in depth information this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Dither, Do it.","review":"I bought this in vinyl form back a long time ago.

I have an enclosed shower and, when used daily after my shower, they really help prevent soap scum buildup and hard water stains on my tile and glass. However, those \\"other\\" brands have such heavy fumes that I can't stand using them. I spray this stuff when I am still in the shower, and it's just too small of a space to be in with all those fumes! Mrs. Meyers Clean Shower is light and fresh and it doesn't fume me out of the bathroom. One bottle does not last a long time though. If I'm lucky, it lasts for about 2 weeks (but me and my husband use it, and sometimes my husband showers twice a day).

Healthier than other sprays, inoffensive smell, really keeps the stall clean.

The computer throws balls through your defenders, receivers and scat-back will break 6-7 tackles on the way to the endzone and your receivers with 99 speed will be run down by the computers linebacker with speed rated at 84. Corners randomly run away from receivers leaving them wide open for long touchdown passes.......consistently. You can have a receiver double-teamed and they will both just run away from the reciever. Litterally...that is not an exaggeration. No play action or nothing...........just run towards the line of scrimmage. It has to be some kind of glitch in the game. If all that was already said was not bad enough, it freezes up in the second half of the spring game..........consistently. I exchanged a copy for another copy that does the exact same thing. EA dropped the ball on this one!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Return '07 & Keep Playing '06","review":"The graphics, playbooks, and many other game features seem to be slightly improved (not $50 worth though) but the controls are horrible. They've eliminated the 2005 classic control option. Both new control options have eliminated the ability to switch which player you control in 2 directions - example: you're controlling the middle linebacker & want to switch to the right linebacker at the line of scrimmage. To do that, you've got to scroll through all eleven players to get back to the ROLB, and hope you don't scroll too far or you have to start over. You've also got to hope that your opponent doesn't hike the ball while you're scrolling - funny, the people I play online aren't likely to wait until I'm controlling the guy I want. This may not seem like a big deal, but for me it makes the game almost unplayable online.Don't they play-test these things?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This game is the worst of all the previous NCAA football games at least since 2002.

The most glaring example of this was the third story, \\"The Tragical Historie of the Jiril's Players\\"--which was really, really good (pretty funny, too)...until the ending! I mean, the build-up is great, but you're so amused and interested in the Players, you kinda wish they'd play a larger role in the outcome! Oh, well.

Donnybrook is one of those bands who know how to write songs with attitude. You can't help but feel like a badass when you're listening to this album - it's full of well thought lyrics, fast riffs, and crushing breakdowns. And the album's sound...wow. It has this warm, full sound, like it was recorded in the perfect room. There's even faint hints of rock and blues riffs in some songs, making the band sound like their own throughout the entire record. This is a must-have for any hardcore fan's collection, because it reminds us how classic hardcore is really done. Top songs include \\"Read 'em and Weep\\", \\"Check Your Chest\\", \\"Down for the Core\\", and \\"Techno-Logic Kill\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not A & E","review":"This is a very interesting set of dvd's but it is not the Richard Kiley, Jean Simmons series that was on A & E"},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof of the Bible Truths","review":"Here is real evidence that the mysteries of the Bible actually happened!

The death and funeral would be tied into the ongoing story, a dimension they got away from in the second season. Otherwise the show is... near excellent.

They COULD just up and release the second season on DVD. But, depending on the demand and the timing of the release, they might not get the incredibly high initial sales that they would expect from this, the second of a highly popular set of high-yield DVD sales. Coming on the heels of the cult-gone-mainstream popularity of the first DVD, they are intentionally delaying the release of the second DVD until word of mouth and re-watchings of the first DVD (out of sheer boredom) have increased even further the already sizable audience waiting with baited breath for this release.Think about it, people Where's the bottom line here? Do you think it's tremendously difficult to put this video onto DVD? Do you think they don't have any money to press the DVD? Ship the DVD? Then why the heck hasn't it been released yet?

It marks a major departure from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, if not in style, at least in the quality of the music. It also is a long cry from the gutsy roots rock that was part of the collabrative work done with Billy Bragg. I am really glad I listened to this one first and didn't drop the $15 on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?????","review":"I was a big fan of Wilco's until \\"Yankee Foxtrot Hotel blah blah blah..\\"whatever. After reading the first couple of reviews of this album in some major magazines it sounded like Jeff Tweedy was getting back to some serious songwriting with hooks and a melody. Not true. This album again shows a great band getting worse on every level. I have listen to this album a dozen times, because that's what they say, \\"repeat listening and it will suck you in\\". Well it sucked me in and spat me back out disapointed. Now I'm stuck with another $14.99 c.d. that if I return for store credit I only get something like $9.99. Thanks jeff I will never ever buy one of your c.d.s again. I had a religious experience when I saw Wilco in L.A. on the Being There tour.

After all, what music lover wants recycled songs and ideas? That being said, I think Wilco pulled off a great follow-up to an even greater album with their latest release. My first impression was that Ghost seemed a bit disjointed in its song selections, but after further listens, it seems to work (excluding the end of \\"Less Than You Think\\"). I like the mix of bluesy piano and acoustic guitar throughout, and without the feedback and experimental noises found in YHF. Great tracks such as \\"Hell Is Chrome\\", \\"Handshake Drugs\\", \\"Company In My Back\\", and \\"I'm A Wheel\\" are textbook Wilco, but it's the tracks such as \\"Spiders\\", \\"Muzzle Of Bees\\", \\"Theologians\\", and the very Beatle-esque \\"Hummingbird\\" that are a bit of a departure and really seem to make Ghost work. Bottom line: it's the perfect evolution for a band that is currently one of America's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal but very different from YHF","review":"A strong and diverse recording, I've found new things I like about different tunes on every listen.

I love the music, but I was a bit disappointed that the record did not come with a CD or MP3 download of the songs. Especially since it cost like $24. Also, the record is a bit annoying because there are 2 records and each side only has 3 songs. So I'm constantly having to flip them over. So now I've gone ahead and ordered the CD as well. As for the music, I think it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Tough Listen","review":"I love Wilco and their music. I think they're innovative and very talented, however, A Ghost is Born doesn't reflect that so much. This album is quite slow making it a rough to listen to.

Give me Being There or YHF anyday.PS - Keep your hand on the volume on your stereo because of the inconsistent levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. wilco has been reborn","review":"A mere ghost of what they once were (the only remaining members from their first cd are john stiratt and jeff tweedy), wilco has, against all of my expectations put out an album that rivals yankee hotel foxtrot, which is, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums ever.Filled with allegories for drug use, tweedy's lyrics explor things that other songwrtiters leave untouchted. His oft amusical guitar solos push the boundries of what music is. Wilco has always been reinventing rock music while at the same time drawing from the greatws :talking heads, beatles, etc. Wilco is one of the few truly indipendent bands still left in the world. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect another Yankee Hotel Foxtrot","review":"I've been a Wilcoe fan for awhile now, and I am especially fond of the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot album. So, when this album came out I rushed to buy it and pop it in. I was looking to find another album similar to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and when I didn't find this I was disappointed. However, after several listenings I fell in love with A Ghost Is Born. With deep lyrics as well as incredible music, Wilco surpassed my expectations. This album is definitely top notch!And so, I recommend this with very high marks, but I warn you not to listen to it expecting Yankee Hotel Foxtrot 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gem","review":"Let's cut the comparison to \\"Foxtrot\\" and just enjoy.

COME BACK JAY BENNETT!!!! Wthout Jay to temper Jeff's musical ramblings, the album comes off sounding less like the typical Wilco magic, and more like Tweedy's bedroom 4-track solo project. With Damon Gough singing. ahem.3.) The guitar work is gorgeous- at times, that is. Hearing Jeff shred it up Neil Young style in \\"Hell is Chrome\\" is truly a transcendent, beautiful moment. Doesn't make up for the rest of the tune (which, I might add, was better when Counting Crows did it- it was called \\"Long December\\"...), and in the end, sitting throught a whole tune for 12-20 seconds of guitar genius just gets stale.4.) \\"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9!\\" .....Ummm... did I hear that right? Don't expect any lyrical genius here. Apparently, the sort of ethereal lyrical beauty of \\"Via Chicago\\" and \\"Ashes...\\" is a thing of the past.I want my Wilco back."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disapointing","review":"Sorry, this sounds like unfinished demo tapes.The songs work much better on Kicking Television."},{"rating":"1","title":"soon to be heard in elevators around the world","review":"I love Tweedy but this is just weak.

It is obvious that Tweedy and his cohorts are musically and lyrically talented, but for some reason seem to think that making noise is more expressive than writing a song that might actually be coherent and have a point. IMHO A.M. is twice the record that YHFT or Ghost could even hope to be. For those of you that say that a band like Wilco cannot stay static and must progess musically, I offer the example of the Jayhawks for a band that can remain true to its genre while experimenting with new and different sounds. (For example, listen to Tomorrow the Green Grass and then Sound of Lies--completely different sounds, same genre, all incredible music). I guess Wilco is catering to the critics, but to that I say: critics don't buy records--consumers do.I couldn't reccomend this album any less. I wish I could get my $14 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor is naked","review":"Quite frankly, this is the most disappointing album I have listened to in a long time. Amazon and others all recommended this album as some sort of transcendent masterpiece. Also, I have always liked Wilco, especially in some of his folksier modes such as his work on Arlo Guthrie's unfinished work.That being said, this was nearly unlistenable. Not one track stands out as being worth the listen, and the drone the end is completely terrible. If you are unsure about this album whatsoever, I urge you very strongly not to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was all downhill from YHF","review":"They peaked with YHF and now we're all seeing what happens when a brilliant idea is stretched a little thin.Sorry guys...I hate to be the untrendy square guy but...this record sucks.

This album has all the musicality of a dentist's drill; unfortunately, it's not as entertaining. Most of the songs are just self-indulgent noise. One song is 15 minutes of self-indulgent noise, I guess you're supposed to call that experimental. It makes you wonder if the band has completely run out of good ideas, could be a sign of the end. I felt like I was being insulted for having purchased it. There are lots of other bands out there making better music, lots of other albums worth exploring and spending your time and money on. This is humorless nonsense. One star for a couple of actual songs, and even those were not anything special."},{"rating":"2","title":"changing their tune","review":"It took me a while to warm up to their newest cd. I really miss the old Wilco. YFH and this....well even starting with Summerteeth, are much more poppy. I really love the harder edgier sounds of A.M. and Being There. I get slightly frustrated at the way they recorded the volume on this album. The lyrics on some of the songs are sooo low, you have to turn the volume us really high only to then turn it down when they decide to bang on their instruments. This is definately not all the songs. There are a few great songs, tracks 5 and 6 to name a couple. There sound is more like the beatles.I still love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilco's sound continues to evolve","review":"Much like \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", \\"A Ghost Is Born\\" contains catchy tunes like \\"The Late Greats\\" and \\"Theologians\\" as well as songs that take a few plays before they begin to grow on the listener. Of the twang that once pervaded Wilco's music, only the barest hints are present. And (just as in YHF) certain tracks seem designed to challenge the listener's patience, as when the enjoyable \\"Handshake Drugs\\" ends in two minutes of dissonance. However, the lyrics are almost as downtrodden as those of 1999's \\"Summerteeth\\". Even the album's most whimsical and upbeat song, \\"The Late Greats\\", ends with a sad hint at greatness and joy left unfulfilled. Tweedy's musical and poetic skills have reached a new high point with this release, even as his new material covers the same old themes of emptiness and frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"I'm a wilco fan....and I'll admit, even for me it took a few listens.

I played it in my car for a week, but just couldn't get over the self-indulgence of Tweedy and crew. If you like Wilco, you may want to borrow this album for a while & decide whether to buy it. If you are a new fan, start with Being There and skip this one. I hope this is not a sign of things to come from this otherwise great band"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Tweedy Channels John Lennon!","review":"In this day & age, I truly find it almost impossible to find such a treasure out there in musicland. Thank you, Jeff Tweedy & Wilco. A GHOST IS BORN is an unbelievable follow-up to the devastation of YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT. Above and by far the VERY best album of '04...a real gem that won't get old with repeated listens...my only gripe would be the second to last song, \\"Less Than You Think\\" which goes overboard with the overlong static bit, but nonetheless...just an awesome album. Take a few listens, and you're bound to see my reference to the Tweedy/Lennon vocals connection - it's hard to miss. It's Tweedy's voice, but man, Lennon's so right in there, too.. it doesn't leave the listener however with a distinct feeling that that was Tweedy's concious intent; the impression being more that the recordings just brought that aspect out, which just makes repeatedly listenings only all the more wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilco is amazing","review":"Wilco blew fans away with \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,\\" a love it or hate it affair. Most loved it and embraced the new direction of a great band. I thought it was one of the best albums I'd ever heard. \\"A Ghost is Born\\" comes close, but is not quite as good as YHF.

Tweedy and pals continue in the rich vien they began mining as far back as AM and struck gold with Yanke Hotel Foxtrot. While it's not immediediatly as earcatching as it's predecessor it is a real gem that continues to establish itself after repeated listens. From the fun romp punk blitzieg of \\"I'm a wheel\\" the bouncy hook of \\"Hummingbird\\" and rich and compelling \\"Theologians\\" the disk ebb and flows with different musical experimentation that the Wilco boys have made their own. Perhaps they may have went a bit too far with the twelve minute drone which is ostentatious to say the least, Jeff obviously had his reasons (and the headaches to fuel it)for it's inclusion but it's a long way from the albums finest moment.Be sure not to miss the hidden gem \\"The late greats\\" which is a witty, catchy way to wind up the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better every time I play it","review":"This is a very solid CD.

Reading the Intelligent reviews of this Band's Art and Mythology only gives one the illusion that They are doing something Important and Poetic, something much more Incredible and Mature than anyone else who has ever lived, especially all the Dumb rock bands of the past. They apparently have Genius and Vision and don't have to worry about coming up with any good hooks, beautiful melodies, insightful lyrics, or much else--but nevertheless, this Album is probably Brilliant, according to seemingly everyone else. It has Shredding guitar solos(NOT by Nels Cline, in response to another reviewer), after all, and Funny Noises, just like YHF, so it's definitely a Masterpiece.I don't know why anyone wastes their time with this smug, mediocre band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Jay Bennett came on board after A.M and you can hear the incredible contribution he made in producing and playing in the awesome Being There and Summerteeth. However, the press blew it. Here were Wilco's Sergeant Pepper's/Abbey Road back in '96 and '99 and the press missed it. Realizing their mistake a few years later, the press helped exagerrate the whole record company firing Wilco nonsense and then rated YHF and A Ghost is Born as the greatest things they'd ever heard. Get real!! By this time, gone was Ken Coomer's relaxed drum beats and of course Jay Bennett's absolute genius (both fired), and now what you're left with is a bunch of noise with a bit of music thrown in. Spare yourself this garbage, and start from the beginning with A.M. and stop with Summerteeth or Mermaid Avenues."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound of a band wanking its fans","review":"If you thought Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was a mass of ridiculous, unlistenable, pretentious screeching and wanking, then check this baby out. And likewise, check out the legions of devoted and blinded \\"fans\\" genuflecting to the supposed \\"genius\\" of Jeff Tweedy in their reviews here. Personally, I think Amazon's reviews of Wilco albums are among the highest points of hilarity available on the web.For a band that shot its wad with \\"Being There\\" like ten years ago or something, this emperor's had less and less clothes each time I look. The clever lyrics are gone. Certain talented band members are gone. The super songwriting is gone. Even the covers are beginning to look similar in every way: bland, uninspired, and capital-P PRETENTIOUS. How artsy of them.I am so nauseated by this CD that I never want to hear it again, and anyone who wants to get my copy, feel free to email me before I trade it in for something interesting.A bad, bad band."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING FOR INTELLECTS ONLY","review":"IF YOUR A CASHIER AT WALMART THEN YOU BETTER PASS THIS HIGH PIECE OF ARTWORK BUY...IF YOUR A BURGER FLIPPER AT McDONALD'S MAY I SUGGEST BUYING THE LATEST BRITNEY SPEARS CD...IF YOUR AN INTELLECT THEN I SUGGEST BUYING THIS HIGH PIECE OF ART...MY ONLY BEEF ABOUT THIS CD IT'S NOT ACCESSIBLE ENOUGH...YANKEE HOTEL WAS VERY ACCESSIBLE...THIS CD DOES HAVE A THEME AND THE THEME ALL THE SONGS ARE RELATED TO THE ASPECT OF BEING DEAD OR GHOSTLIKE...IT'S REALLY HIGH ART BUT NOT ACCESSIBLE ENOUGH TO BE PLAYED ON THE RADIO...WILCO OR REALLY JEFF TWEEDY SINCE IT'S APPARENT IT'S NOT REALLY A BAND...ANYWAY IT SEEMS JEFF IS SUFFERING FROM A SLIGHT CASE OF SELF INDULGENCE...BUT US INTELLECTS WILL LOVE IT FOR THE REMINDER OF OUR LIVES UNTIL WE BECOME DEAD OR GHOSTLIKE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... but hold off.","review":"This album is one of Wilco's best, if not the best. But don't spend twice as much as you need to on this unless you are an avid collector. The bonus tracks can be attained via Wilco's website (www.wilcoworld.net) as a free EP if you own the basic version of the album.That said... \\"Panthers\\" is one of Wilco's most interesting compositions and the live tracks are outstanding (as always). \\"Kicking Television\\" is an R.E.M. style rocker that is sure to please most Wilco fans.But, for most of you, know that you'll get all of this for the same price as the original version of A Ghost is Born."},{"rating":"2","title":"full of surprises","review":"This band never stops. Every c.d. is more powerful than the one before. I admit I'm a total fan, but I have hated every new Wilco c.d. when it came out. I was nervous when I first sat down to listen to Ghost is Born. And my fears were realized. I hated it. The techno sound of \\"Spiders,\\" the astoundingly long piece of noise at the end of \\"Less than you Think,\\" the absence of recurring catchy coruses, the moving songs that end when you want more... I was despondent. Was this the end of Wilco? But then, on second hearing, on third hearing,on fourth hearing, Tweedy and Wilco pulled me into their mad and beautiful whirlwind. Astounding guitar riffs, complex instrumentation, and yes, really really catchy tunes, even if they are not packaged in a linear commercial way. And layers of meaning thrown in the mix. Listen to this album, and keep listening. Wilco gives us the best of both worlds--Rock and Roll experimentation combined with music that will make you want to dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than you think","review":"I hated this cd when I first heard it, now however, it has become one of my all time fav's. If you are expecting YHF part 2 (like me) you will be dissapointed, until the second or third listen when songs like \\"Handshake Drugs\\" \\"The Late Greats\\" and the brilliant, beautiful and extremely catchy \\"Hummingbird\\" start growing on you. To keep this short, if you like Wilco enough to hear them experimenting and taking some chances, you won't be dissapointed with this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want another YHF..thats your first problem.","review":"The first thing you notice about this new release from Wilco is the reviews . People either love it or they are disappointed. You will love Ghost if you appreciate the freshness of it, the very same freshness to approach and song creation that made YHF so unique for its time. You'll be disappointed if all you want is a rehash of YHF. But is that a very fair desire?Ghost has the same melodic beautifull moments of YHF but it also has more moments of sonic discordance. This CD makes you stop and think. It questions your expectations. and in doing so delivers something that is rich and unique.People shuffle out parts of CD's they don't enjoy all the time. In this case that's unfortunate if your so inclined after giving Ghost a listen. Its only after repeated listenings that the subtle aspects come forward. I can see someday that Wilco may just open a CD with a sound and it just continues from there.One big work or art."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Think I'm Done with Wilco","review":"I've tried really hard to like this album, and YHF as well. But I just can't. I've seen the emporer's new clothes and I don't like them. I'm not a closed minded person who only listens to one kind of music, but I just can't take this. And I won't apologize for admitting that I like alt.country music, which Wilco has departed from completely. The last 2 albums are just experiments in noise, coupled with barely audible depressed sounding lyrics. If that's your thing then go listen to Radiohead or Beck's last album Sea Change. Didn't UT and then Wilco start out to get away from this kind of drivel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G!","review":"As much as I wanted to like this album as much as I've grown to dislike it. There is something missing and I can't really say what it is. Maybe the music wasn't complete or maybe the lyrics were half-assed written or something!Really, if you are not a diehard Wilco fan, skip this album. Try any of their earlier works, which are more accessible and easy on the ears.Terribly disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Solidly disappointing","review":"I love A.M., but this album seems very garage-band quality. A Ghost is Born has nothing original or unique, and not much of what made me like Wilco originally. I just don't find static and feedback very enjoyable to listen to. Overall very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"This album is a severe disappointment after the amazing Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.

They mailed this one in.Suggest earlier releases Being There or Summer Teeth for those Walmart and MickyD listeners who prefer consciousness.If you are a psycho mellon intellectual who prefers a little music thrown in with your \\"where did all the time go\\" droning and thumping noises, you'll probably enjoy this. Careful not to burn too much energy searching for something that ain't there, though.Tweedy is getting tired. I hope he's gonna be alright. We need him."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best","review":"Wilco has done it again. A Ghost Is Born is a logical and deeper musical step beyond 2002's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Jeff Tweedy's minimal, relaxed vocal delivery meshes beautifully with expansive and even more experimental music. The craftsmanship of these songs is excellent-each is unique-and though they are long songs, none are boring. Where YHF was more acoustic, Ghost is more plugged in. The album is a fusion of rock, folk, alt-country, and even a hint at some southern blues and gospel. It's not a trainwreck of music though-and it's not one of these styles over another-they all fit together, with a near-flawlessness.If you're looking for cookie cutter, radio friendly sing along songs, this album is not for you. If you're looking for some of today's most creative and original music, then this album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Jeff Tweedy once again goes outside the box to produce another extraordinary album. For me, especially with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born, it takes a few listens to realize the brilliance of the albums. A Ghost is Born is not just 'different' -- it covers new musical territories that, frankly, I thought wasn't possible today.Wilco should be celebrated for its creativity and willingness to push the envelope. I encourage you to keep this disc in your car and play it a few times . . . soon you'll realize that this band is something special . . . something worth appreciating and celebrating.I can't wait for the next Wilco album. I buy anything Tweedy puts out. He is in a good place.I also can't wait for Tweedy and the boys to go on another 'fishing trip' to produce another Golden Smog album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Journey","review":"A Ghost is born is one of those journeys that you fall down, crack open your head, get up, go on and struggle all the way. However, you look back and strangely enjoy and feel better in retrospect. My advice is that if you are a Wilco fan or just looking for a new CD, go to their website, take the test drive and make your own decision. After about the third time, I was hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest Wilco","review":"Wilco has done some good albums, especially during the Jay Bennett era. This album ranks with A.M. as their weakest. Try Summerteeth or Yankee Hotel Foxtrot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I really loved this movie!

Then I rented it, loved it, and bought it!I relate to Donna Jensen's (Gwyneth Paltrow) drive and hunger to succeed in life. Her quest is very moving.The film is funny and entertaining! You may even shed a tear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluff, but fun!","review":"What can I say, I like Gwyneth Paltrow. The movie is light and funny, and includes Christina Applegate and Candice Bergen, two more of my favorites. This movie is not brain food, but when I am looking for something to make me smile, the outakes during the credits will do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential - but got REALLY clunky","review":"Fluff piece that should have been a lot more fun than it was. Paltrow is fine, Myers, Applegate, Preston, and especially Bergen, have some nice moments. But the direction lags. Some funny moments could have been really funny - but they weren't. A real problem with pace here. In better hands and with a tighter script, this could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"View of the Slop","review":"Gwyneth Paltrow stars as Donna, a small-town girl who dreams of escaping the banality of rural living. Dumped by her boyfriend, Donna hooks up with a new bland guy and learns how be a stewardess.I found \\"View\\" to be a real let down. Gwyneth, was cute, Mike Myers was oddly endearing, but I HATED the premise, and the romance was just BOR-ring. I also hate, hate, hate stories where the heroine 'gives up her career' for a man. The authors tried to pull the impact of the 'self-sacrificing heroine stereotype,' by giving us a 'surprise' at the ending, but I'm not buying it. It came off WAY too contrived. Also, what with making her boyfriend a lawyer? Is it too much to let him remain a lifeguard, and let Paltrow make the bucks? This is the 21rst century after all.A disappointing movie which delivers drivel, instead of laughs, filled with annoying stereotypes and and questionable message. Ech..."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible service","review":"Awful experience buying from Movie Mars. The first movie they sent didn't work.

I'll never buy from them again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Can't believe Gwyneth Paltrow did this thing. I kept waiting for some irony. This is straight-ahead, nothing post-modern about it. As such, it's a throwback to the madcap comedies of Marilyn Monroe. Christina Applegate's role is one dimensional, as is Mike Myers'. The script is sort of barfable. Is this supposed to be Austin Powers for women?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you see this movie, bring your barf bag","review":"\\"View From the Top\\" is easily one of the finest examples of money-driven filmmaking yet. Despite the good leads, (Gwyneth Paltrow and Mark Ruffalo) sitting through this movie is less appealing than snorting carbon monoxide. The script was probably written by primates and edited by a chicken, and directed by a lobster who has been trained to push \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". While this is a bravura piece of filmmaking for a lobster, it is still more mind-numbing then the religious channel. Not even the considerable talents of Mike Meyers can bring this film from the jaws of hell. Avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Gweneth fans only","review":"Fans of Gweneth Paltrow will enjoy this film but I found it very disappointing. Her performance was great, but the cliche-ridden script was so dull and uninspired and the story was so predictable that I never actually laughed at any point in the film. Too bad, as the cast is incredible--Mike Myers, for example, who is terrifically funny but just so-so in this film; Candice Bergen, who did her best with very poor material. What this movie really suffers from is some very poor writing! It's one of those \\"this could have been a great movie, if only...\\" experiences. Skip this one, and rent the video/DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"This was a dreadful movie. With this cast, I expected more--not a lot but at least one laugh. It was a complete waste of time. Couldn't believe Gwyneth agreed to be in this nothing movie. The best part of this fiasco was the soundtrack. Really awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad, but Mike Meyers was hilarious","review":"I watched this film on tv very late at night while I was surfing channels. I'm very glad I didn't pay to rent this, it was horrible. Most of the jokes were not funny and were thrown in for cheap laughs. Also, Gwyneth Paltrow was a very poor choice for the lead role. I think Kate Hudson or Cameron Diaz would have been much better, however, I don't think even they could have saved this bad film. At times I wasn't sure if this was supposed to even be a comedy. In the beginning, it seemed like it was supposed to be funny that Paltrow's character wanted to be a stuartess, but then it's supposed to be serious. Although this movie was very bad, every scene with Mike Meyers was very funny. His character had a lazy eye and he had an erratic temper that often caused hilarious scenarios. If your a Meyers fan, you'd like him in this film, but you most likely will find this movie to be an un-funny chick-flick with bad writing and casting."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I rented this movie which was a bomb at the box office but since Gwyneth is such a big star it doesn't really matter now does it? What a horrible script! Who greenlighted this movie? Just because there is a top star starring in it that doesn't save it from a bad script. Its an inspiring story gone bad. The script is awful, the plot is horrible, and the acting is mediocre. Ick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb. Just plain dumb.","review":"I actually watched this movie on a airplane. It only had 1 funny scene in it, and the plot was pointless. The only reason I watched it was because on a 10 hr 45min flight what else am I supposed to do? The reason I gave this movie an extra star was because the story was kind of intriguing and that's about it. This movie made Gwyneth Paltrow loook terrible and Mike Myers was stupid let alone funny. Bottom Line: Don't waste your time or money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes, this was frightening!!","review":"It's amazing how some movies get made these days, especially this one. I felt compelled to write a review after my girlfriend made me watch this horrid, horrid movie. Seriously, is this really the same Gwyneth Paltrow who starred in quality movies like \\"Shakespeare in Love\\"and \\"Sliding Doors\\"? Was she hurting for money... if so there are better ways. I'm all about silly/stupid movies but this movie isn't remotely funny. Mike Meyers gave me about two chuckles with the lazy eye gag.. which was repeated waaaay too many times.Ladies, if you're looking for a good comedy to watch with your boyfriend, please try \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About a Boy\\". Those are both suprisingly witty and funny and actually have something to say with some interesting characters. I assure you, you will both like those. This movie, however, goes on my top ten worst movies of all time, right above \\"Batman and Robin\\". I'm still having nightmares about it... the horror, the horror!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"View From the Top","review":"Well...What kind of a moron gave this piece of crap story the green light.

I usually watch historical films and documentaries so would not normally recommend this type of film. But there is a certain \\"tongue in cheek\\" aspect to the whole production that clearly says \\"do not take this seriously\\".

And the movie is pretty short so you have plenty of time left over for other Friday night plans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gwyney divy","review":"I like Gwyneth and Christina, and this is a fun chick flick with a message, and a minimal sexy (swimsuit).

It's quirky and funny. Paltrow is good with comedy as she is with drama. I liked her character Donna, who wants to get out of her small town by being a stewardess with the local airlines.

The comedic performance of all cast members and particularly the three primary actresses were outstanding: Gwyneth Paltrow (Donna), Christina Applegate (Christine), Kelly Preston (Sherry), plus comedic performances by Candice Bergen and Mike Myers. But don't expect too many belly-laughs. Instead, you'll just be smiling throughout the whole film, especially if you remember any of those \`coffee, tea or me' United, Western, PSA, and American \\"Stews\\" back during that era.

I also don't know if I've ever seen such a lame movie before. I've seen bad movies, unfortunately, way too many, but this isn't bad. It's....just nothing. A whisp, a breeze, a slight disturbance of the atmosphere, then gone. 79 minutes (jeez, double feautures used to have two films longer than that) yet too long at that. A cast of competent actors try to breathe life into this corpse, but cannot do it. The cliches come tumbling out one on top of the other, the surprises are nil, the characters are barely one-dimensional, the few laughs milked long after the teat is dry. Not worth a lengthy review. Not worth much of anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you only like chicks in short shirts and bikinis","review":"This movie makes no sense at all--a weak plot-it is plain stupid-great if you like looking at some real foxy actresses in minis or bikinis-I could look at this with the sound off and it would not matter--the humor is weak and Patrow is foxy as ever but acting is terrible-there are alot of foxy girls in this movie but thats about it--extras are stupid--I say--rent it and forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Gwyneth Paltrow, otherwise a fabulous actress, is completely wrong for her character, and for this film in general. The film is not as funny as I hoped it would be, or as funny as it could've been. The plot feels forced at times, and there seem to be a whole lot of 'discontinued characters,' making it a very unsatisfying story on the whole. If you stick around till the bloopers at the closing credit, you will find that many of the funnier, more interesting scenes have unfortunately and incomprehensibly been cut out from the final movie. A waste of time, and a waste of the actors, with Mike Myers being the only highlight here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A View from the Bottom","review":"This is potentially the worst movie I have ever made it all the way through. Usually I can spot the really bad ones early on. This one tricked me - I blame it on the cast. On paper, this cast is amazing. I thought for sure the movie would turn around. I just cannot imagine a comedic mind like Mike Myers looking at this script and agreeing to see this movie, let alone be in it. I would like to find the studio person who signed off on this project and ask him/her to super size my cheesburger meal. I feel like 87 minutes was just stolen from life - and I want them back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit silly, but cute ;)","review":"The pace was upbeat; the color was vibrant; and the characters, although sugar-coated, were each blessed by the director with their own personality. The theme of the film was a heavy one thru, \\"Aim high, and never give up your dream!\\". Fortunately, such a 'serious' message wasn't in conflict with the 'feel good' nature of this movie at all. Because whenever things took a down turn, and just when our protagonist, the beautiful Miss G, was about do lose her dream, the director's invincible hand would always come to the rescue and to straighten things up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"This was a cute movie. I saw it on TV, so I'm sure it was edited, but what I saw was good. I really had no idea what type of movie it was going to be, but there was nothing else on yesterday afternoon, so I decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised!This is a feel-good comedy starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Christina Applegate, and Mike Myers. You could wonder how a movie about flight attendants could be good, but this one pulled it off. If you go into it expecting nothing, as I did, you should have no problem coming away from watching it feeling like you haven't wasted 2 hours of your life. I thought it was refreshing and I recommend it to anyone who loves movies that mean nothing and have happy endings!I plan to buy it so I can see the unedited version and because I think it will make an excellent addition to my collection which includes other feel-good girlie movies such as Legally Blonde 1 and 2 and Where the Heart is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Job","review":"I ran across this movie while browsing through Encore film selections and almost exited past it. Yet, after watching just a few minutes, the film reminded me of when I wanted to be an airline stewardess more than anything else in life, back in the 50s. So, I savored many parts of the movie due to a major case of nostalgia.This film, believe it or not, does not make one feel stupid for watching. You just need a sense of fun.

Nevertheless, his unique bass style, imitated by many in the early 80s, was used to great effect on this album. He also proved himself more than capable of developing complete tracks (he plays all the other instruments as well as getting some help from other former band members of Japan) and writing. To say his style is unusual would be an understatement. This is an amazing album which reminds one of Percy Jones' bass work in the 70s. A thoroughly enjoyable \`weird' album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"B-rate movie","review":"I gave this movie a high rating movie not because it's a great movie but because it's fun to watch.

Not only was he in it, but also Larry Hagman, the actress who played Shirley on Laverne & Shirley, another actor I recognized from the 8 of Us, and a song writer some of my friends like. Seeing people who would be big in the 80's in a low quality b rate movie made the movie more enjoyable-particularly Larry Hagman because this had to have been a real low point in his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:An awful movie whose terrible production values preclude a \\"so bad it's good\\" effect, Beware!

Common pathologies of each system or organ is described sometimes with nice colored pictures. Explanations are very simple and easy to understand. Each system is first explained in terms of structure and physiology and than followings chapters in that section takes on pathologies of the system or its components, number of chapters depending on the system complexity. It is a perfect book for pathology or parallel book with physiology to understand physiology with its applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"This theme is so cute, and it isn't too babyish or busy. We will be able to keep the room decorated this way for quite some time! It is also unisex, so if you plan on using the nursery for baby #2 it works perfectly eliminating the need to redecorate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute border","review":"Border looks adorable with baby blue wall color. It was easy to apply. But you need to soak it much longer than the 10 seconds they recommend (until you feel some of the paste). We had leftover border and will use the cutouts for decorations, bulletin board, lampshade, etc. The plaid patterns are great to mix and match, esp if you don't want to spend the money on the crib bedding set! Very gender neutral. All I would need to do is repaint the wall color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measurement please","review":"I don't understand how babiesR'us expects customers to buy this border online, without specifying the dimensions ( lenght and width)!!!!!

We had no problems getting the border to stick (we were sure to soak it for a good 40 seconds in warm water first). The border looks wonderful in our nursery and goes perfectly with our theme of baby jungle animals. We are having a boy and the colors match well with a boy's room. We are gifting a border to a friend who is also having a baby boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lunchbag","review":"This is a great lunchbag. My daughter loves it. The strap means no having to hold it while walking to school. We don't have any trouble keeping stuff cold and we live in the desert (Phoenix, AZ) We just put in an ice stick. We love the size. My wife likes that a large odd shaped item will still fit as it is soft and can flex outward. She also likes that it is staying clean. I love that you don't see any other kids with it and it is so dang cute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunch Bag","review":"I love the look of this it is very unique, That's all I can really say that's a positive. That's why I am very disappointed in this product. It really should be called just a bag. The top has the cute flap but that is all it has to keep the food cold or even in the bag. The compartment is big enough for food and drink but they won't stay cold because it doesn't seal it in. If you don't need to pack cold items this would be perfect. Instead of using this as my daughters lunch box for school I use it to pack snacks in for the car ride home from school since crackers don't need to be cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag!","review":"My daughter loves Scooby-Doo and loves this lunch bag. The seller sent is very quickly and we received it in just a couple days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you waste your time listening to this?","review":"Looking at the reviews other amazon customers wrote about this album astounds me. So much so that I can grasp why wars break out and people generally disagree; how can some find this pleasureable and others completely deplorable? I don't get it. At the time I bought this I was really into finding \\"new\\" artists and giving them a chance. \\"Chameleon in the shadow\\" and \\"Silent Corner\\" were very different from what I had been listening to, and after a couple weeks I found them to be rather engaging. I've had \\"Future Now\\" for over a year and I still can't get into it, after listening to it today for probably the fifth time I don't think I'll wasted any more of my time with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment if you're looking for the classics","review":"If you're looking for original classics such as Gazebo's 80's hit \\"Masterpiece\\", then skip right over this CD since both versions on the disc of this song are bad remixes produced especially for this compilation sometime in the mid-nineties which are way over-produced. Let's face it, classics from the 80's were meant to stay in that decade. Other better Gazebo compilations exist, notably \\"The Collection\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done remixes","review":"When I first got this cd I was very disspointed becuase all the songs were re-recorded and remixed in 1994 and I expected the orignals but after finally getting the orignals on cd I realized that many of these tracks are actually really well mixed and quite beautiful. I recommend this album for all Gazebo / Modern talking / Italo fans.Thx, Kreemy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This is my second purchase of an egg poacher, having purchased a less expensive one a few months ago. My first purchase didn't work well from day one. Even with cooking spray, the eggs stick and I have to use a knife to get them out. I finally took the plunge and got the more expensive Demeyere. What a pleasure! The eggs just slip out. I am so pleased. The eggs are perfect in shape and are cooked evenly. Cleanup is a breeze. I highly recommend this poacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite as good as I would have hoped","review":"Poaching is done in water. You are not poaching an egg when you must, or it will really stick, use oil or butter to cook the eggs. I believe I will go back to POACHING eggs and leave this form of frying to people who can't cook. Pan seem ok to fry eggs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at Poaching, bad at flavor","review":"Item was purchased for me as a Christmas gift from another site. It's a very nice poacher, but I'll swear to my grave the flavor and aroma of the eggs is affected by the non-stick coating. Was hoping maybe through multiple uses; heating, cooling, and hand cleaning would \\"break in\\" the cups, but the awful metallic/chemical flavor is still there. Can't believe I'm the first one to say something about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Induction cooking and this Great Egg Poacher","review":"I want to crow about this egg poacher. \\"Cock-A-doodle-do\\"........We have just purchased an induction cooking range and I had to purchase new cookware. We love poached eggs and have had everything from a tacky light weight aluminum to an electric cackling hen egg poacher. We are so thrilled with this item. I could tell when I unpacked it from the box that it was quality. We fill the pan with approx 1\\" of water, spray the cups, break the eggs in the cups, place on the lid, which is glass and one can watch the eggs cook without constantly lifting lid to check on them, start the induction on high, and as soon as it starts boiling we set timer at 5 minutes and turn the heat down to six. The eggs are perfect for us. Whites are firm and yellow still runny. Would recommend to anyone who loves poached eggs. The egg slide out with no residue left in cups. Clean up is a breeze.Nancy in Alabama"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Poached Eggs","review":"This egg poacher is so easy to use and delivers perfect poached eggs every time. The 4 cups are coated with a non-stick surface which lets the eggs slide right out onto your plate - and clean-up is a snap. The metal handles that you use to pick up the cups are removable making them easy to clean. The glass lid is nice because you can see the eggs cooking. To use the pan, I fill it half full of water; put the cups in the rack that fits onto the pan; and, turn the stove on high. I put a little butter in each cup I'm using. Once that's melted and the water is starting to boil, I put the eggs in, season them, put the lid on, and time them for 2 minutes 40 seconds (I like my eggs a little runny). When the timer goes off, I take the pan off the stove, pick the cups out of the pan, and slide the eggs right out of the cups into my bowl. Takes about 5 minutes for the entire operation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleans great","review":"I labored over which pan to buy as our old one was worn out. The cups clean easily and the eggs don't stick! The pan has a nice heft to it and the water heats quickly. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"$'s Do NOT Equal Quality","review":"The people who have reviewed this pan have been too generous with the praise. There are four SERIOUS problems with this pan:(1) The handle of the pan gets extremely hot. This is simply not acceptable on a \\"professional\\" grade pan these days.(2) The handle of the lid get very hot. The heat is conducted though the screw that is exposed toward the cooking side of the lid.(3) The lid is an amateur design. Not only does the lid handle get hot, but the handle assembly will fill up with water when put in a dishwasher. Note that the unit (minus the cups) is rated as dishwasher safe. This is not true.(4) The pan does NOT cook the eggs evenly (with all cups in place and filled). You will get very inconsistent eggs in every batch.This pan is somewhat dangerous nor is it consistent enough for restaurant use. An inexpensive Faberware pan from target works much better for home use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poached Egg Fan","review":"The Demeyere 4-Cup Egg Poacher is the real deal. Metal cups with a non-stick surface. The poaching system is removable, so the heavy pan and glass cover can be used for other cooking needs. I swabbed little vegetable oil in each cup and used a small spatula to help remove the poached egg from each cup.Not cheap, but, as others have said, you get what you pay for.The Demeyere is definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sailing cookbook for both the head and the stomach.","review":"This book contains some very practical on-board recipes as well as some very useful information on the stocking of a nautical galley and the storage and stowage of food on board.

But, Raw Silk's 'Do It to The Music' and Main Thing by Shot are worth the price of the CD alone, unless you find the vinyl versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOWS THE LID OFF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT","review":"Lifton and Mitchell do a great job of not only explaining the vast problems with capital punishment - from its bias against blacks to its immorality - but they also delve into the psyche of everyone involved. Whether you are pro-death penalty or a strong opponent, this book opens your eyes to everything that is wrong with capital punishment.But, you also learn why you either favor or object to the practice though detailed psychiatric analysis that most people don't even consider when weighing in on the issue.Sure, the authors are fierce death penatly opponents, but that does not stop them from putting a critical eye on both sides of the debate and providing strong arguments for the end of this process."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THE PAPERBACK","review":"I am primarily offended that the authors and Amazon publish the almost the exact same book in both hardback and paperback with different titles in order to sucker folks into buying both. Amazon outright recommends the purchase of both books - but you should only buy the paperback. It has all the text of the more expensive hardback plus one additional chapter.The book graphically displays some of the problems with the justice system; it fails, however, to examine the proponents' take on the death penalty. By failing to make such an examination, people with little or no opinion or those who are pro-death penalty will likely make changes to their political thought without the necessary logical underpinnings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosie is the best","review":"Having been called Rosie all my life, I saw the ROSIE WORLD and said how bad can it be? It is a book written in 1914 but it could have been written today. Rosie takes care of her family and life goes on. If you want a book to escape all the problems of your life, this is it. It is a simple time, happy and sad. Any one named Rosie or knows one should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yowza!","review":"So I saw these guys live and was quite surprised.

I owned one for several years. The joint between the hose & the threads came loose, and would spin, so I was not able to thread it in tightly. There is no o-ring above the threads, it does not seal well. The hose is too soft and flexible, makes for inaccurate readings.I just bought a Lisle 20250 tester and am very pleased with it. It was a great day when I threw this K-D tester in the trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahistorical","review":"My comment applies to the publisher's blurb not the volume itself. To claim that Wellhausen's contribution is comparable to Einstein's to physics shows just how unworldly and abstracted from ordinary academic standards traditional liberal theology has become. It is pure, hollow hyperbole. Wellhausen is not only hopelessly dated, his predictions discredited, he's obsolete - his only value is as the marker to a grandiose historical misturn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a 23 minute promo video....","review":"Buyer beware, this is only a 23 minute promotional video for a festival that took place 4 years ago.$15.99 is pretty darn costly for such a short video.Gothicfest is basically (1) full length SLICK IDIOT performance and (1) full length HANZEL UND GRETYL performance... with a few brief interviews and behind-the-scenes footage.Since my name is plastered all over this release, I feel that I have the right to let my feelings known.I believe the majority of this footage has been on YouTube (for free) since 2006.

Is it possible this is not the best choice for my first exposure to Thomsen? I have never had such trouble getting into a book before.

Steve Hillage was for a few brief years a hero of mine and live he could certainly play his guitar. However Green is terrible and marked my parting of the way with all things gongy and silly.The lyrics are embarrassing, I'm taking utter toss. This albumb was so bad I swapped my limited addition green vinyl version for a couple of joints worth of cheap moroccan ( a much better deal)There is nothing close to the great sound produced during Fish Rising, it just carries on like a Valium induced depression until the final side were we are insulted by the magical ohm riff. After this LP I straighten out a lot and now I cannot tolerate anything vaguely gongy with the exception of camembert electric and fish rising. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this one unless you really are a hopeless bong fiend with no life to go back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic document of swirling space rock","review":"though 'Fish Rising' might be called Steve Hillage's finest solo album, it bears remarkable influence from Gong and contains most of the Gong lineup, relying on their pool of resources to perform that album, with composition ranging back to his days with Khan. this album , however, after finding his footing with 'L' and 'motivation rising' finds Hillage's compositional skill flowering with a consistently balanced performance as well as dynamic and progressively spacey instrumentation throughout on synthesizer and his wonderful and amazing guitar work. all the songs are strong and enhance the total sequence and progression of the music on this cd. this is another landmark in the field of space rock and is practically the blueprint for the career of the contemporary space/psychedelic band Ozric Tentacles. a stratospheric performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Hillage - 'Green' (Caroline)","review":"Originally released in 1978, as 'Green' was Hillage's fourth solo effort. Good thinking man's music, it was produced by Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. Tracks I dug the most were \\"Sea Nature\\", \\"U.F.O. Over Paris\\", \\"Crystal City\\" (check out the Bowie-like vocals) and \\"The Glorious OM Riff\\". Noticed that his collaborator and partner in System 7, keyboardist Miquette Giraudy appears on this reissue. Nice progressive / art rock title to check out when you can.

I liked the characters and their growing relationship. Both were admirable people who were perfect for each other. I liked that the hero saw beyond the surface to the true beauty of the heroine...even if she was named Hebe! Yes, the plot may have been somewhat contrived but I think the character development more than made up for it. Believe me, I've read many Regencies and this one is quite enjoyable.

Basically, the premise is that they are making a movie about nudists. The acting is poor and the storyline is well, non-exisitent.

I will probably be able to rig it by sewing on some added Velcro, but would strongly recommend that you hand-wash and line dry, don't even let the dryer look at the wet item! :) Since I was really impressed with the idea of a washable hamper at the time of purchase we will not be buying one for Baby #2 when the time comes."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WASHABLE!!!","review":"We purchased this hamper for our son's nursery and I recently washed it for the first time.

Broad, exotic and unjustifiable generalizations mainly made to resemble the wisdom of an alien culture at less than a careful examination. This author aspires to be nothing but a profound and well camoflauged nuisance. We all had to learn to avoid such in college as we learned to avoid the kid in the neighborhood who talked you into getting into trouble, and avoided it because he was set to ditch completely when he saw the trouble coming.

Persons who buy paperbacks have as great a need for the appurtenances of scholarship as hardback buyers. Further it seems a travesty to publish a book with a revisionist flavor and leave out the underpinnings of the argument, a statement of sources. Not to mention splitting the book in two to gouge the US reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Detail","review":"Overall the amount of detail put into this book is way too much. I'm an accountant who loves reading reading economic and accounting books but this book bored me to tears. I understand the author had information that no other author has had on the Rothschild's but we did not need to know every single bond price and transaction they ever made. He jumps around a lot and it makes it too hard to follow or stay interested in. Too much information is not always a good thing. In my opinion this was a poorly written book and I will never read another Ferguson book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the casual reader","review":"This book is not for the casual reader. I might have enjoyed this book more if I were a historian or an economist and had a vast knowledge and interest in both of these subjects. That being said, I found the book not interesting enough to finish reading. Instead of being given a summary of the overall strategies and business relationships developed by this famous family, I seemingly had to read every detail about every individual loan the family ever made. If you like reading accounting books, maybe this is your cup of tea.To me this book is analogous to a three hour movie that should have been a properly edited two hour movie. I prefer the writing style of economist/historian William Engdahl, Pat Buchanan or Gore Vidal. They have a talent for telling history in a concise and informative way that the average reader can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I can say nothing more than has already been said by individuals with much greater credentials than my own that have placed their 'golden seal of approval on the cover', other than this tome is easy to follow even for the lay reader on this grandiose family narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Rothchild Vol 1","review":"How totally ignorant is it that Volume 2 can be purchased for the Kindle when Volume 1 can't be purchased for the Kindle ?

The cross piece in the back that fits in the middle of back in the pictures has a tendency to work it's way up my back to the point where it almost comes up above my collar. I bought the separate belt loop to anchor the magazine side to my belt, and it still does it. I have played with the balancing of the holster itself, tilting it at various angles, and nothing seems to work. I think this is a design flaw that can not be fixed. While the holster is wearable, and reasonably comfortable when it is placed properly on the back, I am constantly have to adjust it, pulling the back down and re-positioning it. I have stopped wearing it, and have gone to a Milt Sparks IWB holster, which is more satisfactory than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice holster, minor alignment gripe","review":"It is a nice, sturdy holster that gets a lot of wear.

Ross Jackson has created nothing short of a masterpiece. While reading, I tend to become overwhelmed of the magnitude of the events occurring at this time. Ross allows the reader to feel the emotions within Sir Francis Bacon's circumstances. I am very hesitant on spending much on a book, but this book is well worth the price. I suppose it's a way of saying \\"thank you\\" for such a splendid work. From start to finish (which I have a few chapters left!), Ross keeps the intensity of Francis' situations. I have yet to purchase the companion guide, but will happen in good time. To Mr. Jackson, Thank you for this wonderful work. You have done this world a great service.

I've been a Pound Puppies fan since I was little, and to have at least of piece of that on DVD is very cool. The story's fun, and as a kid (and even now) the characters are lively and enjoyable.There wasn't anything amazing about the DVD, but one of the features I liked (that isn't present on all DVDs) was the direct play. No pesky button pushing. They haven't done anything fancy with the animation but, being as it was released in 1988, the quality isn't bad anyway. It's as I remember it, and it's fun to hear the voices again and reconnect with the characters.A great movie for fans, young and old, as well as those who haven't seen it yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great gift idea for children","review":"When my daughter was young, this was one of her favorite movies.

If your goal is to learn a network stack on an embedded processor (In particular the PIC), this is not a bad book as source code is included.

I will return this ring most likely. If it were centered it would be pretty but you can see a very slight glue edge. As I said for the price if the face were in the center I would keep the ring.

Maybe the shedding phase is over for now. With the rubber brush I got tons of fur off but that was earlier in the summer.

He didn't like it at first-be very careful to use it gently, with very little pressure so as not to pull to hard on their fur or hurt their bones. Avoid bony areas, use on fleshy sides, stomach and tail.Made a big difference and I was a skeptic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly effective!","review":"This tool is easy to use and very, very effective at removing loose hair from my American Shorthairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!!!!!","review":"My Husband has terrible allergies. Since using this tool, it has significantly cut down on our cat's shedding. Plus our cat loves it. I would recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I really like the Furminator de-shedding tool for cats. I have a long-haired cat that is constantly getting knots in his fur. I've had the product for about three weeks, and it has really done what it promised. The only piece of advice I would give is only use it on cats for about 5 minutes at a time. My cat gets irritated at me if I use it more than that, because it really does pull the loose fur, and I believe it does cause him a little discomfort. He loves to be brushed, so his irritation has to be from the pulling. He tolerates it well for 3 to 5 minutes though, and I manage to get lots of fur off of him in that small amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"I wish I'd had this years ago. I'm constantly brushing my two cats and the first time I used the FURminator I was shocked beyond words at how much hair came off of them. The cats really enjoy it - whenever I'm combing one, the other is right there waiting for his/her turn. The biggest plus of all is they haven't hacked up any hairballs since I started using it. Every cat owner should have this!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have two cats. One has very thick, long hair that mats very easily and he was leaving hair all over the house from his shedding. The other one has somewhat long hair that is silky and doesn't mat at all and doesn't shed too much. The furminator works great on the thick-haired cat. It gets out the dead hair that is trapped. The first time I used it I had a pile of hair as big as the cat. I can use it once a week and not have hair everywhere from his shedding. On the other cat it just kind of skims over the top and doesn't seem to get much hair out. So it really depends on the kind of hair that your cat has. I have tried lots of grooming tools and this is the best one I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DesheddingTool","review":"This is the best deshedding tool I have tried.

We had seen furminators in the store but they were like 30-50 dollars and that is ridiculous for a brush. We had heard that it really worked, but was skeptical. Finally, I saw this one for 15 and thought why not try it. Got it and tried it. AMAZING. I have never seen so much hair come off an animal. That is a double edged sword. SO much hair comes out that if you are not prepared, it gets everywhere. I would also recommend using two people to control the animal and keep it from eating the hair or use a vacuum while using the brush. But great for removing hair. Also noticed that it is kinda sharp and if you do it too hard it can scratch the animal, so be gentle and you will never worry about shedding again.

He wasn't crazy about regular cat brushes. He would always bite me when I tried to use them! When I got this thing, he became my best friend. It was crazy how a normally ornery cat would turn into the LOVIEST cat in the world when I used this on him. Only draw back is now that I have been doing this, he cleans himself less. Does anyone else have this problem? I would have to \\"furminate\\" him several times a week to keep him from shedding so much.

Sometimes I'll catch giant tumbleweeds of fur if a wind passes through the house......SO I decided that I need some type of grooming tool for my cat to tame the gray hairs always flying all over the place (including in my mouth and face when I kiss him or hug him). This product is truly fabulous. I've seen SO much hair come off of him that we thought he lost some weight but he just kinda lost another half a cat because of all the hair that came off! There's no hair around the house (or in my mouth and face) & he enjoys being brushed because it's like he's getting his back scratched. I've had my cat over 1 year and I wish I knew about the FURminator when he was a kitten! Highly recommend this product to EVERYONE with a cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing WORKS","review":"Hands down the best cat brush I've ever used. My Stepdad recommended I try it after he had such great success on our elderly Labrador. It worked just as well on my cats - after the first time using it on my two girls, I had two enormous piles of hair, pretty much the same size as the cats. It seems to pull up a lot of the undercoat, which makes it ideal for Spring & Summer. And since we live in LA, where most of the older homes don't have AC, keeping the kitties cool is a priority. Each time we've used it since then, we still pull up a lot of hair, but that first time was by far the most astounding. It's especially helpful on my longer haired kitty.One word of advice - be gentle as you're using it - the edge is more firm/sharp than your run of the mill cat brush, so your kitty might be turned off if you push too hard. Just go easy and make long steady strokes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional product, it works!","review":"I am a pet groomer and we sell a \\"Furminator Package\\"... It sells itself! We leave a furminator comb near the front check in so we can do a demo. When offering the \\"furminator package\\" (which includes the Furminator Shampoo and Conditioner; the conditioner leaves you with hands covered in undercoat as you massage it in, its great stuff!) we walk up to the dog and take just one brush stroke with the comb and the amount of undercoat it gets makes the clients excited. Once they get the package, they are repeat customers and repeatedly ask for the service. Reports of clients are off the charts with so much less hair.Bonus: the undercoat is usually dull and frizzy...the top coat is usually shiny, this allows for super soft, ultimately touchable and longer clean-feeling coats on both dogs and cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a WINNER!","review":"I usually dont write reviews, but I do read them.

I use the small one all the time. Love it. Nothing better for fine cat hair. Will say non of my cats are very happy to get brushed, but they ALL love not having to groom so much. I see less hairball vomit, and they actually seem happier (the furminator is doing all their grooming work, so they have more time to be cats) and healthier. The dog version is great too, but I found my dogs don't have much of an under coat (both terrier x's) so the furminator just sticks to their guard hairs. If I had a dog with an undercoat, though, I'd be singing praises. Good product. Beware, however, replacement blades are expensive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but kind of pricey.....","review":"This is one nice brush, and the Cat even seems to enjoy us using it.

Yes.","review":"The furminator is without a doubt the best cat brush I have ever used. It works very well, much better than standard cat brushes or static mittens or any of that stuff. However, please don't buy this thing expecting that your cat will miraculously stop shedding. It just doesn't happen. It took me about 10 days of daily brushing (multiple times when possible) to get my cats to the point where they were \\"clean\\". The first few days get them used to the feeling and give you time to find the right angle and stroke so your cat doesn't yowl and turn and bite you, or run away from home because it thinks you are given to torture. Not that this happened with my cats, but you never know... Anyway, after the trial period, it is much easier to get at them because they are used to the metal and in some cases they even learn to love it. Once you have thoroughly \\"de-shedded?\\" your cat, once or twice a week maintenance is all that's required.

I was a bit nervous about spending $30 on a brush, but this product has tons of awesome reviews. I had it for several day and it didn't do anything. It didn't remove any more fur than a regular brush. The cats didn't like how rough I had to be to remove any fur. In fact, I have a retractable travel brush that works WAY better than this, and my cats love it.Upon closer inspection I realized it was just a blade from an electric clipper attached to a stick. Seriously, take a close look. If this works for your pet, buy your favorite shaver blade and glue it to a stick and you'll save your self a some money.

Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat hates it, but I love it.","review":"Okay, so here's the thing. I love this thing because it takes so much hair off of my cat. So much hair, that sometimes I wonder whether it's gripping and pulling out loose hairs or if its also shearing off the undercoat with the semi-sharp edges between the tines of the comb. I could comb my cat forever, and the quantity of fur coming off of him never decreases. Also, I haven't really noticed less cat hair around the apartment. He never coughs up hairballs (as far as I know) so that's not really an issue for me either.My cat, as my title suggests, hates the comb, but will tolerate it as long as I follow the comb with a massaging hand.

This had never been a problem before.I'd work the mats out, only for them to return. A couple were so bad they had to be cut out. There was one so tight I couldn't cut or work it out. It had to have been painful for him.As soon as the weather warmed up, I had to have him shaved (At the cost of $120). That one mat was so bad, it left a longterm \\"bruise\\" in his fur/skin. It's been almost a year since and the matting has not returned. I have not used the Furminator in that time either.The only thing different in our lives was the use of the Furminator. So my guess is that it caused this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do much but annoy the cat","review":"I get about as much excess fur off my long-haired cat with his slicker brush, and he enjoys that.

Our 7 yr. old yellow lab has always had a problem with her under coat not sheddiing and just sort of clumping on her body until it fell off.

Thank you furminator!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the one groomer my cat likes","review":"I received the Furminator grooming tool for catsFURminator deShedding Tool with 1-3/4-Inch Edge for Catstwo days ago and have used it three times on my two cats. One is a short haired white cat whose fur is always on everything. It is already noticeably better now for our clothes and furniture. The other cat is a long haired cat who for 13 years has hated being brushed. This is the first grooming tool she has tolerated ....not for extended periods of time, but at least for five minutes or so. It has been enough to get a good head start on reducing her shedding as well. This product is worth every penny of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"My cat loves it. I could never get her to sit still when I brushed her, but with the FURminator, she lays down and purrs. It did take a couple of times for her to just lay there. At first, she would walk away and come back over and over again. After about 3 sessions, she stays put. I always get so much hair off of her (DSH)! Now, when we pet her, there isn't hair flying around. I can wear black pants and not worry (too much) about her rubbing up against my legs. The FURminator has really decreased the amount of hair floating around our house.After FURminating, you will definately need to vacuum the area!I was hesitant to purchase this tool because of the price and I wondered if my cat would really sit still long enough for me to use it. It is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cat tool I ever bought!","review":"The FURminator really works! Wish I had owned one years ago!

It wasn't.I really like the brand, but this particular product was staticky, so the fur stuck to it and to my hand, which made it really hard to use. While it worked for getting out some of the fur, the short teeth seemed to really irritate my cat, to the point where he tried to bite me (the one I tried before didn't have either of those problems).

Highly recommended. Use in an enclosed space to ease the cleanup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terminator vs furminator","review":"I have 2 cats, one long-haired and one short-haired. My long-haired one used to leave huge chunks of hair laying around and she would produce good size hairballs. After using the Furminator a few times, she literally shrank in size, and the amount of fur she sheds and the hairballs she produce are greatly minimized. $21 for a brush seems expensive - it's not. I've recommended this to all my other friends that live with cats. It saves you time on cleaning up and it saves your cat from throwing up. Where hairball medications and food supposed to reduce hairballs have done nothing, the Furminator has become a Terminator of fur and hairballs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for short-hairs, either!","review":"I have two short-hair cats, both less than a year, and goodness does this thing pick up hair. It's not terribly dramatic with my tabby, but oh my, the hair it pulls from my tuxedo is amazing. It is very static-y, but I've discovered that if I pull it off with a paper towel or just hold it in my hand, it doesn't float everywhere.He likes being brushed in general and likes this, but seems to have less of a tolerance for it than his regular brush. He never stays still for very long when you're trying to brush or pet him, but he stays still slightly less for the FURminator. All in all though it does get an impressive amount of hair. As for the claim that it prevents shedding, I haven't seen much of that-but maybe I would if my tuxedo would stay still long enough for me to get enough hair off of him then he wouldn't have much left to leave on my couch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"My vet recommended this comb to help eliminate shedding and hairballs.

A little expensive, but worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable !","review":"For those who say the product is overpriced...who knows what they paid for it? I paid $34.99 at Petsmart and felt that it was well worth the money. The cost on Amazon makes it a great deal. You can spend $15.00 on a brush that does next to nothing. I took it out of the package and began to groom my cat immediately (medium long coat). He LOVED it. He was rolling on his back and laying side to side so I could comb him all over. He never did this with the regular comb. I could make a sweater out of the fur it removed using it the first time and it's not even shedding season yet! Just the effort in vacuuming and elimiating hairballs for the cat makes it well worth the cost. It's funny how those who complain about the cost don't mention any benefit to their poor kitty! You just can't satisfy some people..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all cat/dog owners","review":"I have two cats - one with short hair and the other with medium to long hair. We also have hardwoods throughout the main living area of the house and cat hair just floats EVERYWHERE. The final piece that convinced us to do something about the floating hair is a baby who will be crawling soon and I\\"m sure trying to eat the cute floating tufts of cat hair.Enter the FURminator. It's made quite a difference, and my cats love it. One of the cats doesn't even like to be petted, but will tolerate the furminator. We've only used it for about a week so I'm not 100% sure of its overall effectiveness, but I do know that when I pet the cats hair no longer flies off them as it once did.Sure, it's much more expensive than your typical cat brush, but in just three combings the FURminator pulls more hair off than with 30 minutes of combing with a traditional cat brush. You'd be a fool not to get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"This thing is unbelievable. We have two long haired cats, and have never seen anything that worked like this. And to top it off, they love the thing, they roll around and purr, even turn up their belly to de-fur. This is probably the best pet tool I've ever seen after 25 years of long haired dogs & cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, this one's tricky!","review":"Wooo boy! I wasn't sure what to expect with this product, but it has turned out to be a little more time consuming and work intensive than I imagined it would be. Maybe it's just the temperament of my cats, but they didn't want to sit still for the brushing. This wouldn't be too bad, except that the tool is unwieldy and heavy. I also had to stop several times to clear the hair in order for it to be effective.The brushing surface isn't very wide so I couldn't cover but one small area at a time. So, between convincing my cats to cooperate, stopping to clear the hair from the tool, and the time it took to actually get used to the tool while brushing the whole cat, there was a definite learning curve!I will say this, though. It most certainly does remove hair that I had no idea could be removed and I easily had another cat's worth of hair when I was done! Uh, and use this tool outside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing works!","review":"I was skepitical when I saw this. But I have to say that it really does work. I have a long haired cat. I used this for several minutes and I never stopped getting hair from my cat. It seems to work like thining sizzors.I wondered if I kept using this on my cat in one sitting, if he would eventually be bald. I cant say that all the sheding has stopped, but perhaps I dont use it as often as I should.A wonderful product that I would certainly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This tool is AMAZING. First you have to brush your cat with your old brush until you're certain you've gotten all the loose fur off. THEN you use the Furminator and your mind gets blown.

We have a shorthair cat and I thought this wouldn't do much, but I got a lot of hair off of him. Be careful to not overdo it, as it can probably irritate the skin if done too often. Be gentle and remove the hair out of the blade after each stroke. I was going to get the knock-off but decided to go for the real thing and I'm very satisfied with the results. This should cut back on the hair on our clothes and on the hairballs in the tummy!

She loves it and will sit for me as long as it takes for me to finish. I tried using it on my small dog as well and he has such sensitive skin he cries when I use it on him. So if your animal has sensitive skin I wouldn't recommend buying this. But otherwise, it isn't a bad tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"This comb rakes out the undercoat and generally makes your cats shed less, and works pretty much exactly as advertised. In a word of advice, make sure to either use the FURminator outside or when you're going to vacuum anyway since it produces a lot of hair, and if it's not cleaned up quickly, cats can become interested in it, which leads to hairballs. I've noticed that it's most efficient when used after my cats have dried out from a bath.Despite what other reviews may indicate, if your cat doesn't like being groomed with other brushes, they're probably not going to like being groomed with this one. Also, it may be a good idea to wear glasses or something else to keep the fur out of your eyes since small bits of it will invariably float up around you. But if you can deal with the minor annoyances, you'll be much better off for using this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"Removes a lot of hair and cat loves it!

Not sure how it works but it only removes the dead hair.Would I buy it again and recommend it to others: YES"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the other devices we've tried","review":"While this device does work well with two of our cats it remains somewhat of a problem with the third who still bites after about three minutes of its use.

I hate giving the hairball medicine, and it's so nice to be able to prevent the hairballs. I brush both my cats very gently every day, for just a few minutes. They both purr and roll around so I can get every spot. I don't let them rub their faces on the FURminator- I turn the blade around and use the backside of the handle if they want a face rub. I've heard it can take the whiskers off if you use it on the face. I hope it works as well for your kitties as it does for mine. Bonus- my home is much cleaner too. Other deshedding tools just don't compare in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, my cats don't","review":"This FURminator works great! The thing is, my cats won't let me use it on them. Two of my cats love to be brushed (the third can't be bothered) but no matter how gentle I am they won't stick around for the FURminator. But it really does work. Lots of excess hair in just a moment, and a moment is all I get. They do like the ZoomGroom (also available on Amazon) and it will get quite a bit of hair off of them. I've tried with the FURminator for about a month now and two or three swipes is all I get. Maybe if your cats are more laid back than mine they will go for it. Like I said, it really works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Furminator!","review":"This worked very well, although the packaging of the product does not prepare you for how much hair will fly all over, but that's not the seller's fault.

Came to find it here, and to see how it's been reviewed, and was pleasantly surprised with both reviews and prices. Our cat is weird about brushes, so I was also very relieved to find that she really enjoys this, and it takes up so much of her fur!! The only drawback is that it doesn't have that self-cleaning button to push collected hair off the blades, but that's my own fault for not looking more closely. Still, it does not impact the effectiveness of the brush. I definetely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS that GOOD!","review":"Believe what they say...my parents swear by this brush in the larger size for their dog, and it removed GOBS of hair from my small, clean, well-groomed indoor cat.

In about 15 minutes I had a ball of fur that could fill a half gallon jug container. It was astonishing. Now with all her gray hairs less, she looks healthier and is certainly happier. Being a \`fairly wild' cat, she likes getting her fur brushed out. I don't know why I had not seen this product before, but it works very, very well.

I have to work a little slower with this than a rubber brush, so they get impatient. And I have one that just can't seem to get used to it. I think her skin is just to sensitive. For her, I will stick to using a shedding blade which is the only thing I have found that even comes close to doing the job that this thing doea.And if you can brush your cat outside...you might want to consider it.

The smell is less intense and we can all deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"Although my Calico cat does not care to be brushed, I still get her to sit down and put up with this brush. The product does everything that it promises. The one thing I really noticed is that I can pick up my cat without being covered with fur for the first time! This brush is so good that I order another one for my grandmother. I also refused to buy this anywhere else because Amazon has the lowest price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shedding Comb out there","review":"All I can say is you must purchase this comb to believe it. Please comb outside or on a bare floor as hair gets everywhere. It you comb outside make sure it is not a windy day or hair will be everywhere. My cats actually love this comb, they don't complain until I get to their stomach. No other grooming tool is needed. My cats are short hair; I can imagine this being a little uncomfortable for long-haired cats, but I'm not sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"This is the best item I have purchased in a long time. Having 1 dog and 2 cats inside the house most of the time, there is ALOT of hair. Normal brushing helped some, but not near enough. Even after the first time of using, the quantitiy of hair was at least half. Now after a few brushings with Furminator the house is liveable--much less hair. I am very impressed with the results and it works fine on my medium size dog. All the animals love it. My cats purr the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Fablulous Product","review":"Stop wasting your time with other combs/brushes...This is THE ONE! You will be vacuuming after each use of this product, so get ready to work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It DOES live up to the hype!","review":"Wow what a great tool. Not only does it remove bags full of hair from my long-haired girl cat, but it remove incredible amounts of hair from both my short-hair cats, too!A friend tried it on her two dogs - a Greyhound and a Beagle - and is now buying THREE FURminators -- one for herself and two as gifts.This is a GREAT product that lives up to the hype. Well worth the money if you are tired of chasing pet hair all over the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"difficult to use. Used it until the cat would'nt hold still anymore and did not notice any difference in shedding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"I used the Furminator on two different cats - one with Maine Coon-like long hair and the other short. Notwithstanding that both cats equally despise this brush (but love their regular brush) it seems to work a lot better on the short hair. The LH cat, OTOH, it pulls out the tufts of hair that I wouldn't get with the regular brush, but the cat still walks around with poofs of her fur flying everywhere because the Furminator just doesn't grab the hair the way the regular brush does.I wasn't impressed with this product and was even less impressed with the obvious price gouging going on. It's just *not* worth the money because I see no discernible difference between this cutesy named product versus a regular wire brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"This product has a razor like base and it doesn't deshed the fur, it actually cuts it, take a piece of dental floss and put it between the grates and pull, it cuts like a razor, BAD PRODUCT, don't waste your money, and on top of that, once you open the package you can't return it...so much for the retailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"best deshedding brush ever","review":"i've had many pets in my life and have tried many brushes and this is the best one so far.it's no wonder it's a bit pricey but a great price on amazon. in the pet store it was $10 more. if you have shedding problems with your pets, this is the product to beat. i bought htis one for a new stray we brought in and she absolutely love's being brushed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for shedding cats","review":"We have 2 cats and the furminator is great. One is not a fan of it but then he is very flighty, he does not like being picked up, fidgets alot, and is generally does not like being brushed. In the right mood he will allow you to brush him and will tolerate the furminator. The other cat absolutely loves it, I often have problems getting his back and one side as he rolls over on his side followed by rolling on his back so you can brush his stomach all while purring up a storm. Normally this cat will tolerate a brush on this back but that is it, he won't let you brush his stomach. He also is a shedding factory leaving white cat hair everywhere. The furminator takes out so much dead hair and helps alot with the shedding, we just have to make sure we have a small waste basket near by to collect all of the hair that comes out of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tool - one of the best!","review":"This is a wonderful tool, particularly for grooming the undercoats of our 3 cats. One of the most effective we've owned. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pet Hair Brush EVER!","review":"This is not just a comb or brush for cat 7 dog hair, it is a highly effective desheading tool that I tell all my friends and family about. I LOVE THE FURMINATOR!!! MY CATS LOVE THE FURMINATOR! It feels good on their coats (I have long haired & short haired cats) while I brush them and gets A TON of hair off. Afterward my cats dont shead! Seriously! I was getting annoyed with the loose cat hair everywhere, the hairballs and the constant sheading when I pet my cats- NO MORE! It REALLY works! They shead MUCH less and love being brushed. I only brush them once a week. I saw the Furminator at Target for $50! I paid $10 on Amazon! If you buy this brush for your cat or dog get ready for your life to change drastically :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FURminator is an excellent deshedding tool for cats","review":"I heard about the FURminator from someone by chance. They have a persian cat and they were explaining how they use it to comb their cat's hair. It helps the cat by keeping it from shedding less which in turn helps to reduce hairballs. I have severals cats so I decided to give it a try. It works great. The cats enjoy being \\"combed\\" and it works just like it describes. Don't apply too much pressure and you will want to comb your cat somewhere you don't mind getting fur. I kept a trash bag and vacuum near by for easy clean up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says!","review":"I purchased both a dog and a cat FURminator when a friend, who has three cats, raved about it . She paid three times as much as what Amazon offered the same items for. I received the items in two days and my son's dog loves it. She even lets us comb her tail and she turns from side to side so we comb her thighs. My other son has the white cat in his townhouse and it has significantly reduced the shedding over his black decor! He also has allergies so getting rid of flying fur is an added plus. I highly recommend this product. It does what it illustrates and says."},{"rating":"2","title":"the FURminator de-Shedding Tool is great","review":"The FURminator de Shedding Tool with 1-3/4-Inch Edge for Cats is an excellent tool for combing your cat.

It does a great job removing excess hair.It is priced well below pet shop prices ...a good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sent a knock off brand.....","review":"They send a knock off brand one to me. Some no name de-shedding tool. It looks similar and has the same 1.75'' edge. But really? You cant send what you advertise? It still works and I'm not gonna bother sending it back and waste more money on shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"furminator","review":"the furminator works great on both my long haired and short haired cats. Before using I did not realize how much excess fur my short haired cat had. My long haired turkish angora no longer gets matted or dreads in her fur. She doesn't much like being furminated but she tolerates it. I would guess that there is 1/2 as much cat hair around my house since I started furminating my cats on a regular basis. I highly reccomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"furminator","review":"Great product for pets. This is one for cats and does a better job with getting rid of extra fur than any other product I've tried. Also good to see fleas and ticks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Removes a LOT of hair, and they don't seem to mind","review":"The FURminator has drastically cut down on the amount of shed hair around the house. I also haven't seen any hairballs lately, but it's too soon to tell if that's a real effect of the FURminator. I find I have to use it at about once a week in order to keep my cats from shedding. It works much better than the other deshedding tools I've tried. I've been using it for about a month now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best money spent on a pet item ever!","review":"My cat sheds like crazy. He is a short haired cat and the only animal in the house but everything I own has cat hair somewhere. It even makes it way out to the car. While searching around for recommended pet brushes, I ran into the Furminator.....I, of course, balked at the price -- that is a lot of money to me for a brush BUT I bit the bullet and ordered anyway.I received the brush today and I LOVE it! The amount of fur it removes is simply amazing. I was careful not to brush too roughly but I would think anyone with a brain would get that it is a hard metal brush and not to brush too hard. The cat loved it and I love the fact that I get to greatly reduce the hair in my house. Definitely recommend this to anyone with an animal that sheds at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me!","review":"Our domestic shorthair orange tabby had a really thick undercoat and we would raise clouds of hair just when we petted him. We tried every kind of brush, the only one that did anything at all was a slicker. Then we saw the FURminator in our local pet store. I was so desperate I plunked down $35.00 for it (definitely buy it on Amazon!), but I never regretted it. Our cat loved being groomed with it, and we would get tons of fur off, much more than the slicker. I would then use the slicker to clean off whatever loose fur was left. The big boy always felt so proud of himself when we were done! We just got a pair of brothers, also orange tabbies, and I noticed they shed a lot too. As soon as they are more used to their new home, I'll try it on them.I think this tool works best on cats that have a lot of underfur. Go easy with it at first until you see how your cat likes it. It is sharp. Ours liked to be groomed quite firmly with this, as his undercoat was very thick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wonder Comb","review":"The comb is a very good product for my long haired cat. I was leary on spending that kind of money on a comb but after using it, I was convinced it was a good purchase. I depend heavily on product reviews and the reviews were very favorable. If you are wondering if you should spend the money, I'd say do it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat screamed bloody murder when I used this on her","review":"I was not impressed. I was very gentle with this item, it ripped the fur out of the coat and I have three longhairs - One Maine Coon and two non-descript. I returned this piece for my money back. I returned to the brush that two of them love mild or rough on their bodies - they flip on their tummies for the rubber one (Kong Zoom Groom For Cats) - it collects hair, but gets dirty. I think this comb would be great, but the first cat stopped this short and when I picked it back up she ran under the bed. It might work on thin hair (Siamese or others), but the Maine Coon said NO WAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only product that works!","review":"We have 2 dogs and a cat and have tried other brushes, but none even compare to the FURminator! It takes out more hair than you can imagine and definitely lessens shedding. Highly recommended! My pets don't mind it at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great brush! My only minor con is the price.","review":"I would definitely recommend the FURminator. It works and delivers as promised. Compared to the brush I was using before there was no comparison. I would barely get any hair off my cat with the old one, with the FURminator I was able to get a whole shopping bag's worth of hair off my cat.My cat seemed to like it a little at first, but he got a little restless after a while. My cat is a little jumpy to begin with so I would expect calmer cats won't be bothered by it much.My only minor complaint about this product is that it's a little pricey considering it's basically a metal fine toothed comb attached to a soft grip plastic handle. Cheap materials, I think it should be at least 5-10 dollars cheaper easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really all I expected","review":"After reading all the other reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on this... but it wasn't 'all that' for me and my long haired cats. The Furminator took off less fur than the wire brush I had already been using! Maybe it has to do with they type of hair/fur, who knows? Obviously it works great for some people, but it wasn't worth $20 to me. I'll be passing it on to a friend in hopes they have better luck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too painful! My cat won't let me brush him...","review":"I was really excited about this brush but my cat freaks out every time I approach him with it. At first he would let me brush him a little, but with each use he got more and more upset. It really seems to \\"pull\\" his fur out, which can leave him looking groomed, at least the parts I can get to before he starts clawing the heck out of me! He has never responded to brushing like this before and it is obviously painful, no matter how gentle I try to be. I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my kitties","review":"I was very excited to get one of these since the reviews were pretty good. I have two cats, a Birman which has a very, very fine medium length fur and a non-breed short hair who has fine fur.I knew that the comb would be a bit heavy as opposed to a regular comb or brush but it is sort of uncomfortable using it on a small animal such as an 8 and 13 pound cat. It worked okay on the short hair but when I used it on the Birman the fur flies everywhere with each and every stroke! I also noticed that it actually cuts the fur shorter rather than remove the undercoat so I stopped using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only my cat loved it, too","review":"This thing works GREAT! It's amazing how much fur comes off my kitty. The only problem is that I have to chase her around the house or hold her still as she struggles to get away. I can tell it doesn't hurt her but she does NOT like it (and cat owners know- if the cat doesn't like it, it ain't happening). At least she doesn't attack it or growl like with her old brush. I end up doing the brushing in spurts of a minute or two at a time, but they are very effective minutes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Furminator","review":"It is ok. The price is way too high for the performance it provides. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I bought this after reading the other reviews.

I use it on my three Siamese cats and it has cut down on their shedding by at least 70%. After using it a few times, they now love it as well (at first they weren't too excited about it, it's metal so be gentle if your cats are use to a soft brush or no brushing at all).In the Pet stores they are priced even higher (PetCo & PetSmart charge like $36 for it in their stores locally here I saw, but less on their site, still it's cheaper to get it here).I think the small blue one might sell even cheaper and it's the right size for cats, so if you want to save maybe a few more bucks you can get the Small Blue one instead of the Purple cat one. They are the same tool, just different widths.Anyway, this product is AMAZING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you want a bald cat?","review":"I bought this brush after several family members raved about it. I have a long haired cat who loves to be brushed. I was brushing her last night (like I would regularly do) and the brushing left a large bald spot on her back. She purred the entire time, so I know she was not in pain. I am horrified that a product made for cats would be this harsh. No wonder it's called a \\"deShedding Tool\\" - she can't shed if she has no fur! I would not recommend this product unless you want a bald pet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST brush on the market!","review":"We have TWO Persians and this brush, believe me, is the BEST one on the market! However, do NOT follow the directions that indicate you can brush the cat inside as long as you do so in an area that is vacuumable. This DEFINITELY has to be used outside. You won't believe the hair that comes out with this thing and honestly, it will go everywhere if you use it inside. Neighbors might not like your cat's hair blowing around in their yard, but the birds will love using it in their nests! Can't say enough good about this thing but one thing's for sure. No more furrballs in this house! HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does furniture and rugs too","review":"I feel a little silly reviewing the Furminator, like I'm pitching for a television ad. But last year we took in two strays that at eight weeks old looked like domestic short-hairs, but eventually their Maine Coon heritage asserted itself. I've never had to live with so much fur in my household!This brush does a great job on the cats, and the cats like being brushed with it. But what I really like is that it works just as well on furniture and rugs. If your upholstery has a nap, the brush pulls up all the embedded fur. Faster and easier than hauling out the vacuum! (For smooth fabrics, just slip on a rubber kitchen glove and wipe the fur away.) Last night I discovered entirely by accident that an area rug with short, dense fibers has been harboring fur for years in places my vacuum apparently doesn't reach, even though I have a Hoover Windtunnel. A few swipes with the Furminator and all is well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"My FURminator just arrived, and i had to give it a try. My cat absolutely loves it! She wouldn't sit still with other brushes, but I read such great reviews about this one that I had to see if it would work. I just spent about 2 minutes brushing her, and she turned over, purring louder than ever. This one is totally a keeper....I will throw the rest out. And hopefully it will reduce the amount of fur around the rest of my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"product very good - cat not loving it as much as I hoped","review":"My cat has long hair and is a wimp when it comes to nail clipping or grooming . She has never had a bath is 16 years old but - she has always been like this - I do not know if she has super tender spots on her body but she does let me use it on certain areas but not on her rear or legs ..sometimes she allows me to do a little on her tummy .It works good - I just don't realize sometimes when it going catch on a a tough little knot in her fur. She gets miffed and that session is over .... but I am glad I bought it even if I though at first it was too much due to the shipping up here to canada ,thats about it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for shedding cats who don't like to be brushed","review":"We have two year-old cats who are brother and sister. The girl cat will let you brush her with a slicker brush sometimes, but the boy cat usually tries to bite and runs away. It is always a chore to brush him. As they have been growing out of their kitten fur and losing their winter coats, I was finding handfuls of fur everywhere around the house and getting rather frustrated.This brush is definitely different that most cat brushes and performs as well as the ads claim. I have removed multiple handfuls of hair from both cats and have noticed significantly less fur around the house. The boy cat had trouble with a couple of hairballs previously, but has been hairball free since I have been able to brush him with this brush.

The movies on this disc don't look much better than the ones I taped off television... a decade ago. I would send mine back, but I'd already opened it before I discovered what a ripoof this was.

Like the others, it shows a perspective on the city that most are not able to get with clear pictures on large pages. Along comes google and bing with aeriel and bird's eye views of all these locations for free online and the value of the book is somewhat diminished. The benefits it retains are:-short paragraphs giving historical or descriptive commentary on the photographs,-the fact that the views are selected by the photographer & a local author who knows the city/area (rather than the unguided tour from google & bing).-an historical photographic record of the area (google & bing update their pictures periodically and are meant to be as current as possible).It, like the others, are interesting books to have, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but flawed","review":"Good book, with great photos, as is to be expected. Generally does a good job of depicting LA's expanse, and its widely varying areas, with one exception; oddly, there is absolutely nothing about the beach towns: Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach.

Very good nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I grew up in a suburb of Los Angeles and this brings back so many good memories.

Although I have never had such experiences in my own life as these characters have had, the character development in this book was amazing. I have never felt for characters as I do for Willie, Patty and Jonathan. I was angered by Sylvia, saddened and scared senseless by Rick and touched by Willie. I almost told my husband about something Willie did before I remembered he was a character. I am still emotionally stirred since this morning in the coffee shop. I can't wait to read Lisa Tucker's other books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"Once more, Lisa Tucker delights me. With another tale flavored with music and motherhood, Mrs. Tucker peels back the skin of Patty Tucker, young mother and singer with the Patty Tucker Band, a floundering jazz quartet turned pop band. Patty needs this job, this chance. She's not the girl she once was. She has a new voice now, a mother's wail, loud enough, strong enough to shout down the moon.Don't miss this. Patty Tucker is someone you want to meet. She'll be with me always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"SHOUT DOWN THE MOON is not just a fantastic story, it is also fabulously written. Lisa Tucker does an amazing job of narrating Patty Taylor's life while maintaining an appropriate balance of narration and feelings. After reading THE SONG READER I could not wait until Lisa Tucker's next novel was released, and now that I have also read SHOUT DOWN THE MOON I am even more excited for her third novel. Well done!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A love story to jazz, motherhood, and second chances","review":"I really love this book. I love Patty, a singer, a mother, and someone who is trying to make a new life for herself. I know very little about music, especially jazz, but Tucker was able to bring me into Patty's world with her beautiful writing. From the very first page, I was totally hooked. I shared this book with my husband who loved it even more than I did. He CRIED at the end! I have recommended this book to all my friends, male and female."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shout Down the Moon is a great read!","review":"This is a great book and the characters are both real and believable. Lisa's ability to write and successly accomplish character development are amazing. You really feel like you are a part of the book and want to keep reading to see what happens next. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story about a mother's love for her child","review":"I picked up this book after I read a great review of it in People magazine. I knew it would be a good read, but I didn't expect to fall in love with the characters the way I did. Patty, the main character, is brave and real and truly inspiring for all of us single mothers. She will do anything for Willie, even \\"shout down the moon\\" to keep him safe. Their relationship is tender and beautiful while still being realistic--quite an accomplishment. Lisa Tucker knows how to write children that act like children, not as mouthpieces for things the author couldn't make the story say.Now I'm off to go read Tucker's first novel, The Song Reader. If it's even half as good as this one, I've found a new writer for my favorite list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another finely crafted page-turner from Lisa Tucker","review":"Lisa Tucker's second novel, Shout Down the Moon, delivers on the promise her first novel, The Song Reader, held out of a powerful new voice on the literary landscape. Tucker's characters are multi-dimensional, and unflinchingly portrayed. As in The Song Reader, the main characters in Shout Down the Moon are working class, contending with the joys and sorrows of life in the best way that they can. It is all too rare to see characters from contemporary rural and smalltown America as lovingly and respectfully portrayed.Not only do the characters draw in the reader, the plot of Shout Down the Moon flows so effortlessly that you cannot help but keep turning the pages to see what happens next. I loved this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"Like The Song Reader, this tale revolves around music (my other passion in life). Patty is a singer touring with a band that looks at her as a meal ticket...and someone who is not serious about music. Patty also has a toddler son, Willie, whose father has just been released from prison and is on parole. He is determined to have Patty and Willie at any cost.Lisa Tucker continues to create marvelously complex relationships, unique characters and lyrical words. I can hardly wait for her next book....but, from what I understand, it will be 2005 before I get to read another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Overall Read","review":"This book started off a little slowly, but once I got into a few chapters, I really started to enjoy it. Some of the relationships were a bit predictable but emotionally moving just the same. I loved Patty's character by the end of it.

But READ THE BOOK. The movie left out lots of important people, and most of where Mr.Brooke comes, its actually, Laurie in the book. But the movie is superb!!! If you like the movie, you will definitly love the book. In the movie there is no Bess, Rob, Josie, Laurie, Amy....all the important people. I like the way the movie was produced. But I think my imagination was much better. I don't want to sound negative, this movie is worth more than 10 stars, but my personal opinion is of not of that deal. My Parents loved that movie, and I think they're ready to give thousand stars. Any ALCOTT books and movies are a great deal reading and watching!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"heartwarming, simple, and true to the book","review":"This is a well done version of Little Men that stays true to the book with one exception: Mr. Brooke. As someone else notes, it is Laurie that does most of what Brooke does in the movie. The children are excellent in the film and it has a lot of good messages. It is not high action or modern, but it is true to the heart of the actual book. It's worth a rental for sure! I just read the book and then watched this and liked both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I was very excited when LITTLE MEN came out, but my excitment soon changed to dismay. This beloved classic was minpulated horribly. The acting is terrible and the portrayls of the characters are horrible. All in all a terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Pass","review":"I can't recommend this film. If you are expecting a continuation of \\"Little Women\\", you won't find it here. We learn nothing of Marmie, Laruie, etc. The movie focuses on ONE boy character (a 14 year old orphan from Boston) and all the mischief he gets into. How he hurts the other boys, burns down the house, plays with knives, etc. The ending is major cheese and Mariel Hemmingway as Joe? No. The film doesn't explore her relationship with her husband (German professor, what's his name). Was this film made for TV? Its of an average TV movie quality. On the other hand, it has no sex, language, etc. So if you are looking for something to watch with your 10 year olds, you might give it a whirl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like Jo Bhaer.","review":"This movie was a grave disappointment to me, but perhaps that is because I first saw the television series \\"Little Men\\" (now available here at amazon.com on VHS/DVD). I thought Mariel Hemingway's portrayal of Jo Bhaer was deplorable - no emotion, no spunk...no personality. The boys were entertaining at times, but with Jo being so bland and cardboard-like, the movie was terrible. I recommend purchasing the TV show \\"Little Men,\\" but beware that there is no Fritz Bhaer on the show. Being a L.M. Alcott enthusiast, I actually did not mind the elimination of Fritz, especially since his \\"replacement\\" is a much better fit for Jo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"I thought it started off a little slow and I was tempted to turn it off, but I gave it a chance. After I got into the film, I really liked it. Jo is a great role model in this film, opening her heart and home to these children..if only more people cared about our youth these days, what a difference it would make. Dan was a cutie and made me cry at the end when he sang! All in all, it was a good family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"The movie was great! I really enjoyed watching Ben Cook as Dan sing at the end. It was really good and I wish everyone could watch this funny and sweet story of friendship and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"great beginners book","review":"I found Herbal Dog Care to be a great beginner's book for using herbs and natural pet care. However, if you're an experienced herbalist like myself, it leaves you wanting a lot more from Dr. Kidd. I thought he could have gone a lot more in depth with the cause and treatment of different ailments. I'm also a little disappointed that Herbal Dog Care is pretty much identical to Herbal Cat Care. I wish I knew that before buying both. It is obvious, though, that Dr. Kidd is very passionate about herbs and animals. Very easy and enjoyable read. Great introductory information to help you take care of your furry loves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent with a noticeable omission","review":"I liked this book and how it traced Lee's research into the straight lead. Yet the crucial mistake Teri Tom makes is not posting a video of her performing the straight lead or including some kind of cd-rom. Pictures of her doing each step of the straight lead is all well and good, but her timing, her speed, and so much more do not show up in static pictures. If she is really interested in preserving Bruce Lee's life work, she should release a seminar video for sale. Not everyone can trek down to CA to see her do a seminar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversimplistic Diatribe","review":"This book is a great dissapointment. If this were your only exposure to JKD, you might think the entire fighting sytle consisted of trying to sucker punch your opponent. Tom's opinions on other JKD styles, and Wing Chun is disparaging and at times fraught with a lack of understanding bordering on ignorance. The political motivations behind Tom's work seem to revolve more around mud-slinging and selling her new book/issues of 'Black Belt\\" magazine than teaching the best that she can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with what I hoped to be an excellent read.","review":"When I saw that Teri Tom had written an entire book on one punch I had to get it. I was looking forward to what was sure to be a thoroughly researched, thoughtful book. I was quickly and frequently disappointed. Frustrated was more like it. Many of Tom's explanations were wrong. Those errors involved physics and anatomy. I also had the impression that she was trying to prove a point about Bruce Lee. I think the book would have come across as more professional and objective if Tom had stuck to the technique and avoided the politics.Teri did do a good job explaining how to perform the punch. Her physics and anatomical errors have no effect on her explanations on how to correctly perform the straight lead. The errors were about why the punch is effective. If that won't frustrate you, go ahead and get the book, it does illustrate the punch well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't take it seriously","review":"There are a number of pictures in this text that show Ms. Tom giving a \\"proper\\" execution of the straight lead in which her waist is over-rotated and her leading shoulder is over-extended. To put it simply, if she really punched at a serious opponent like that, she'd be thrown or put into a joint lock so fast she wouldn't know what hit her. God help her if she ever fights a Xing-Yi or Wing Tsun stylist - they'd blast through her lead without a second thought.Accompanying pictures of Ted Wong in the text reveal Tom's straight lead to be improperly executed (which can be confirmed by finding pictures of Bruce Lee himself demonstrating the straight lead).To be fair, the amount of information in this book is pretty well-written and is balanced with some decent drills and advice. However, I find it very hard to take this book seriously, since the author is obviously executing the move at the heart of her thesis incorrectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning JKD into a cult...","review":"Ted Wong is not Bruce Lee. His student is trying to perform Bruce Lee's system without Bruce Lee's physical attributes. Trying to use Bruce's personal system, unchanged from the 60's, in today's environment is not going to be effective. It's amusing to note that Bruce Lee was constantly revising his training to be more effective and efficient, yet some people want to take a snapshot of his development at the point where he died, and then never change it again. Can anyone seriously believe that he had finished developing the system? There is no telling what JKD would look like today if Bruce had not tragically died so young.Also, the author's backhanded reference to Dan Inosanto in a negative light hints at an agenda, especially since he has been instrumental in promoting Bruce Lee's system and philosophy for over 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"In-depth book on really just one move!","review":"The best book I have on Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do. Throwing a Straight Lead is not easy and this book breaks it down into the scientific sections that comprise it.The \\"stuff\\" she cannot cover adequately she tells you upfront. The pictures are good, but you really need to read\\\\reread into what is presented. She comments heavy, so you can look up the resources yourself. Some of the books she had access to are way out of print or are going for several hundred dollars on Amazon.-Ouch. Her attention to detail is incredible. You'll want to re-read this book and put in a Bruce Lee DVD and watch it frame by frame.--She even tells you how many minutes into a movie you want to go to see a particular move. I am hoping she follows this book up with one on footwork. She covers a lot on footwork, but admits real early on that it is an entire subject all on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Resource","review":"This book covers more detail on the lead hand straight punch than any publication that I have ever seen. The information is given in a clear concise manner and will leave you with a new found respect for Bruce Lee and his scientific approach to fighting. Not only does this book provide an in depth analysis of the lead hand straight punch. It provides incredible insight into the resources that Bruce Lee had and the way that he used them. You may know that Bruce Lee had a vast personal library at his disposal. This book will give you a glimpse of how it influenced him."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jab vs. The Straight Lead of JKD","review":"I break down the book's weaknesses here. Here's an excerpt, and the rest of the article is in the link:Having just read The Straight Lead by Teri Tom, I was compelled to write about \\"The Boxing Jab.\\" The straight lead works as a more powerful jab than the boxing jab, and it indeed has more reach than the classic boxing jab. The problem is that the straight lead serves no additional function from a \`regular jab' than to make up for its lack of power in the wrist (as the straight lead's form is to not turn the wrist) with explosive hip rotation. JKD people tend to overstate the effectiveness of hip rotation in the jab, simultaneously underestimating the effectiveness of shifting weight and the dynamics of not rotating the hip with the jab.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Fuss Over It","review":"I love dissecting punching physics.

It's just a basic punch!","review":"Almost 200 pages dedicated to one punch? It's nothing more than a lead jab! There's nothing mystical about it and it can easily be defended by parrying and retreating or sidestepping and countering with kicks, punches or a takedown! What's the big deal?

Ted Wong represents the best in JKD and Ms.Tom is a direct student. She elected to address the politically charged debate between original and concepts JKD, but that's O.K. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Buy the book not for the political statement but the fact that she presents specific information exactly as it occurred. Plus, and this is a biggie, the book is endorsed by Bruce Lee's family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistent Quality","review":"Steve Diggle is an extremely underrated songwriter & this is an extremely likeable collection of songs.

This is a deeply personal story that will likely bring tears to your eyes. The 1975 World Series, Carlton Fisk, Fidel Castro and Senator George McGovern all play a role in this story.

This sounds like a typical love story and that maybe true but not many can match Margo Mcquire's ability to develop characters that are lovable, believable and unforgetable. I enjoyed this book as much as The Bride Hunt, while the Bride Hunt involved much more adventure this one (The Perfect seduction) captured the struggle of two people who would not otherwise concider the other as a friend let alone a mate. The many emotions you encountered during the story keep you engaged and unable to put it down, for example, when Kate is obducted and in the prossess of being raped (I was outraged) then as Kate hides under the cart to concel her shame and grief, I felt extreme sadness. Later things change for Kate and one can not help but feel happy and hopeful for her fate.

No big deal, we went to the store to pick up new batteries (which were $5.99). So we were both disappointed when the toy still did NOTHING. What a waste of time and money.

I am very happy with this belt, wear it for about 10 hours a day. I could not still be working 9 hour days if it wasn't for this product. I even wear it around the house. The product appears to be good on the size. I am 5'3 and now 124 lbs. I wear the belt on the second hook now, although I'm transitioning to the third hook, but its still too big. Wardrobe choices are limited because of the straps in the front ; although, I've been able to use clothing tape to hide the straps with some shirts. I recommend that you wear a tank top underneath for more comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected....","review":"Nine years ago when I had my second child I had the type that went over and under my belly...which was great but of course I've since given it away. With this child, I decided to buy this adjustable prenatal cradle and it was okay...yes, it supported the weight of my belly but didn't give me enough back support that I required and to add to that it wasn't really user-friendly (so to speak), meaning it only had 3 choices to choose from to adjust for size...once you've outgrown the last eye & hook because you estimate the size you'll get but don't expect to exceed that size, it's useless....the previous one I had (9 yrs ago) was velcro style which held up wonderfully and I wish I would've stuck with that same style which would've saved me some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prenatal cradle","review":"The small size indicates it fits up to 175 lbs however my daughter weighed 150 when we got this and it was too tight.

I wish I had used it with my 1st pregnancy. I wear it all of the time unless I'm sleeping. I have fewer contractions and zero back pain. The pelvic pressure is very minimal. I travel for a living and this has allowed me to do my normal daily activities without pain. I also like to walk, typically 2 to 3 miles at a time. At 37 weeks, I can still walk and not have pelvic pressure or pain. I recommend this to everyone. The only negative is I had to reinforce the straps. The straps started to pull away from the band. I did buy the correct size. I'm not sure if it's b/c I wear it ALL of the time. Even with this negative, I still recommend it. I also wish I would have bought 2.

But I notice a difference when I wear it vs nothing and so i keep it on all the time except when sleeping.4 stars for quality and value, not 5 b/c of the pain I still have though it may be more me than the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's only okay","review":"I bought the prenatal cradle because I had been having problems with SPD during pregnancy. This product does provide some support for the belly, but I'm not convinced that it makes that much difference.

In my opinion, it's just not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely violent, yet extremely well done...","review":"In some ways, it's too bad this movie is so damn violent. I say that because it's so well written, and the dialogue, in particular, is so good, that I found this movie got better the more times I watched it. It's just the violence that makes it hard to see repeatedly, for me anyway. I really hated this movie when I first saw it, but repeated viewings have changed my mind. If you can stomach extreme violence, definitely see this film. And, if you hate it at first, see it a couple more times. There is some great filmmaking here, though depending on your tastes, you might not see it at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Looked Better!","review":"This is one of my Favorite Movies and when I bought my PS3 this was going to be my first Blu-Ray, but the local store didn't have it.Finally got it, and man was worth it!

Superb DVD Set!!:)","review":"An awesome , disturbing , and non-stop action film. It is Quentin Tarantino's true best film and has excellent talent. Buy this DVD , right now. The plot is about an old thug (Tierney) and his big-mouthed son (Penn) who hire six thiefs to go on a jewel heist , they are : Mr. Blue (Bunker) , Mr. Pink (Buscemi) ,Mr. White (Keital) , Mr. Blonde (Madsen) , Mr. Orange (Roth) andMr. Brown (Tarantino). But everything goes wrong! Starring: Harvey Keital , Tim Roth , Chris Penn , Steve Buscemi , Lawrence Tierney , Eddie Bunker , Quentin Tarantino , Rich Turner , StevenWright , and Michael Madsen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Let the \\"Dogs\\" Out?","review":"Before Quentin Tarantino made \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and became the most overhyped filmmaker on the planet (THREE movies in TEN years, please!) he made his ambitious low budget directorial debut with help from Harvey Kietel and one of the best casts ever assembled for a crime picture. Kietel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Penn and Michael Madsen ALL give first rate performances that are all completely different. Roth is haunted, Buscemi is manic, Madsen is amazingly menacing, Penn is slimy and Kietel is the \\"moral\\" center around which the rest revolve. Tarrantino gets inside the criminal mind so completely, it is difficult to imagine that he was not himself one once. The screenplay is brilliant, full of snappy dialog and witty reparte. The action is quick and bloody and the ending is a classic.Overall, along with \\"Pulp Fiction\\" this is one of the best crime films ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE I EVER SAW","review":"An intriquet story of six robbers and the two people who set it up. Tarantino is the best at what he does; writing, starring, and directing great stories about not-so-average events. This film has outstanding performances by Tim Roth (my personal favorite actor), Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, and the other Reservoir Dogs. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"Watch this movie is is great! I'm not some picky movie nut but I know what I like and what I don't like and i liked everything about this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still kicks ...","review":"Still engrossing and gross after all these years. This DVD edition is amazing it gives so much information and the crystal clear format is remarkable. I mean you almost feel like you have an ear in your hand covered in blood it is so clear.This movie is not for the faint of heart but the story is stil strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reservoir Dogs","review":"First off if you don't like much blood/violence or cussing in a movie, then by all means stray far away from this one. On the other hand if you don't mind, then I recommend this movie to anyone who's got about an hour or two to blow. Starting the movie with a pleasant conversation about the Madonna song 'Like A Virgin' and Mr. Pink's views on tipping at a resteraunt then going straight into the bloody massacre that occurs after a robbery goes wrong, this movie gets your attention from start to finish. The concept of having flashbacks explaining character backgrounds or scenes from the robbery add greatly to the effectiveness of this movie. With a well executed plot and the great acting, this is one that will be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This movie is probably up there in one of my favorites. This is a great movie about a robbery gone wrong. Quentin Terantino's great dialogue brought this movie together with his great skill in directing. This movie is very special because unlike much other bank robbery movies, this doesn't focus on the reward(example: money). This movie is made so the viewer watches the act of everything going on, everything that is in between the actual robbery. It's like reading in between the lines, but Terantino gives the viewer the image. This new kind of image creates a brillant film, which i thought had one of the most creative endings. *NO SPOILERS DONT WORRY* My favorite part in this movie is in the beginning of the movie when Steve Buscemi gives the whole speech on tipping...that was just some top notch dialogue. Overall this movie is a hit. This movie more than worthy to be in any person's dvd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie. Quentin Tarantino's Best.","review":"I found \\"Dogs\\" much better than \\"Pulp Fiction\\". \\"Dogs\\" was very well acted by all involved.

The Dolby Digital 5.1 was great with a nice envelope screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie","review":"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen. It has Tarantino's trademark of mixing the story up and creating a very good movie. You'll end up watching it more than once. Like (Pulp Fiction) and all his other movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man cannot live on blood alone","review":"Well, if you like to watch people bleeding for 100 minutes, then this is the movie for you. I thought this was going to be a good caper story about a heist gone wrong. Yes, it was about a heist gone wrong, but it wasn't very good. The big mystery didn't keep me in much suspense, because Tarantino gave it away 20 minutes before the movie ended! The characters were all 2-dimensional. I could basically predict each character's move after watching the first scene. I would recommend \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\" way over this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full frame is the best version","review":"The best way to view this movie is watch the \\"Full frame\\" version on side B.

I had good expectations for Reservoir Dogs since I really like Kill Bill, both volumes. After the first twenty or so minutes of characters jabbering amongst themselves, I was ready for a wild explosion of engaging action: it didn't happen. My experience of the movie: chatty, claustrophobic, full of blowhards. Couldn't wait for the end. Was glad when the end credits started to roll signifying that I didn't have to watch two more minutes of movie as indicated on the timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please check what you are purchasing carfully","review":"According to Amazon:Other Formats: VHS, DVD widescreen with DTS Stereo, DVDDTS is not a DVD Stereo format.DTS is for 5.1 and 6.1 surround sound on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"After the initial 1/2 hour of this movie, I just kept waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen but it never came. I'd love to know how many times I thought to myself, \\"When the &%$# are they going to get out of this \\"warehouse\\"? And that was after another unfortunately long and boring scene in the restaurant! The entire premise of the movie seems to be nothing more than a venue for Tarantino to indulge us all in terrible \\"one-liners\\". This ranks right up there with Super Troopers (which I actually mailed to someone - I was that eager to get rid of it)! I think I'll give this one away too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift Item/wrong version, TWICE","review":"I ordered the original version from the website, but the \\"10th anniversary edition\\" arrived. Contacted Amazon, another was sent but it was also the special edition. In an email I was told that labels would be mailed to me to return the first one, but as it turned out I needed to return both. I waited too long for those labels which never came, and in hindsight, I should have used the Returns section of the website. I returned both movies, paid postage, insurance, and delivery confirmation; I expected a partial refund. Still haven't heard anything. This basically is a review of Amazon Customer Service,and if I could give it \\"0\\" stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't keep my attention","review":"This movie just couldn't keep my attention, I didn't 'get' it. I love QT movies so we gave it a chance but I found myself reading a book during the movie because it lost my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Extreme violence","review":"If you aren't up for watching a policeman being tortured, this is not your film. I know people who loved it, and if you enjoy the genre, it's as good as it gets. For my part, I wish I had never seen it. It was too stressful and the violence too pointless for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great crime drama","review":"A crew of criminals rip off a diamond merchant. The cops intervene far more quickly than seems natural. Were the robbers set up? That's the question left for the survivors to puzzle out as they rendezvous back at their meeting place.Writer/director Quentin Tarentino has clearly learned the lesson that a basic, straightforward narrative gains intrinsic interest from a skilled skewing of narrative. What seems like an uncomplicated crime story gains new and unexpected levels because Tarentino chooses to shoot events in an unconventional order, often producing surprising juxtapositions. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the 90's.","review":"Reservoir Dogs is a classic. Quentin Tarantino sure knows how to write and direct a movie. Amazing debut. Buy it and enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good movie ,overall=Mediocre","review":"Quentin Tarantino made his film debut with this low-budget,violent,and outrageous black comedy about a group a thieves that hide out in a warehouse and then try to figure what happened in the bank heist. The cast is good with Harvey Keitel,Tim Roth,Steve Buscemi(all three appeared in Tarantino's second and better movie Pulp Fiction),Michael Madsen,Chris Penn,and veteran actor Lawrence Tierney. The only reason this mediocre movie gets 2 stars is because the classic EAR scene. Quentin Tarantino second feature Pulp Fiction was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, WRONG ITEM!!!!","review":"This is an awesome movie, I already own it. I bought it again because I wanted the collector's case, that looks like a gasoline container. BECAUSE THE PICTURES ON AMAZON indicated it was the gas container cover I figured they weren't lying. So I get the DVD and it's a regular plastic case. I WANT TO CUT OFF AMAZON'S EAR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated!!!","review":"I've been in a Tarantino mood after seeing Django Unchained. I watched this for the first time last night, and I didn't care for it. That ending was pitiful. After a jewel robbery goes wrong, the thieves believe one of them is a cop. Too much standing around and cussing, not enough action. I would not recommend RESERVOIR DOGS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding- 'nuff said","review":"Blew me away! The cast, the plot-line, the camera-work, THE DIALOGUE! Can you get much cooler? Tarantino has done some crap & his acting abilities are very suspect, but here- astounding. The squeemish who cringe at the violence fail to grasp it's necessity, as well as the secondary role it plays in a movie about human interaction. For a 100 different reasons, one of the best-constructed modern movies I've seen in recent memory. If you haven't seen it, rent it. If you have seen it, buy it. If you already own it, watch it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's NOT THAT VIOLENT!","review":"I'll keep you for only a minute. For a discussion of this film's virtues/demerits, read other comments. I just want to say that most of the violence is implied, it's offscreen. True, we sit through a LOT of bleeding, but the actual violence quotient is much lower than it is in most blockbuster action films. The word: no explosions, 3 people shot on camera. All else is in your mind, you sick b----ds.It's also one of the most riveting movies ever. I was slack-jawed after the opening scene, and stayed that way. The ONLY reason to skip this if you hate crime drama. Fans of Scorsese or \\"Usual Suspects\\" type stuff should get off on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - BAD DVD Sound","review":"Don't get my rating wrong-this is a 5 star movie, but the sound is horrible. And I've tried this DVD on a number of players and sound systems with all the bells and whistles. I also have a friend with the same DVD who sares this complaint.For instance, one can't hear what finally happens to Mr. Pink. If I had not seen it in a movie theater, I would have thought there was a different ending. ...you can clearly hear what happens to Mr. Pink on the VHS version!!!I'm surprised someone seemingly as meticulous as Quentin Tarentino would let such [stuff] slip by.Hopefully, the 10th anniversary edition will correct the soundtrack.If it does, I'll sell this sub-par one off toward its purchase.This is a great movie for all the reasons the other reviewers site."},{"rating":"1","title":"DELIVERED A DIFFERENT VERSION = NO SPECIAL PACKAGING","review":"i was most let down upon recieving the dvd, as it wasnt the i pictured...i got just the 2 disc version, no special edition packaging and no extra gifts = matches..this was a major let down to me ,as im a dvd collector..from now on i will e-mail amazon before ordering to agree it is the item pictured."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT FILM, BUT PICTURE ON SPECIAL EDITION IS TERRIBLE","review":"The picture quality of this new special edition DVD is soft to the point that it looks like the film has been exposed to light. The sound is fine, yet - like a previous reviewer - I found myself constantly fiddling with the colour, contrast and brightness buttons. And to no avail.Of the 250 plus DVDs in my collection this print of Reservoir Dogs easily rates as one of the worst three. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a rip-off","review":"Quentin Tarantino doesn't have a creative bone in his body. All he did was rip off the Hong Kong movie, \\"City on Fire\\" and added his crappy dialogue.I could steal any number of ideas from different movies and make them into my own. However, it does not make me a film-making genius as people seem to believe Tarantino is...."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GORY, BUT BORING.","review":"This movie is not gross, or shocking, or cutting edge. It's a boring guys fantasy about what it would be like to be somebody with nuts. THAT SUMS UP THE QT experiance.... The revenge fantasies of a nerd, who thinks he's a tough guy now that he lives in LA, had a hair transplant and rips off finer movies plot structures. Too bad the films he makes get so much hype, when Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde etc, were all better movies than his. Hell. I'd rather watch the muppets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychopath Chic","review":"If you've seen Scarface, Casino, Pulp Fiction, Boondock Saints, or countless others of the genre, then you don't need to see this one. The bad guys are once again totally hip - way cooler than the cops or ordinary citizens - this time wearing shades and matching dark suits with skinny ties and lapels, like some kind of '70's new wave band. These way cool guys go on to rob, murder, mutilate a cop, and leave a companion to bleed for the entire movie.It's as if there is a contest between directors of this genre to see who can show the most depraved characters, or who can use the F-word the most time in 5 minutes of dialogue.Other than the slick clothes, Steve Buscemi's character is virtually interchangeable with the one in Fargo, except that this time he likes the DeFranco Family rather than Jose Feliciano.This movie is cliche and disgusting at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG VERSION!!","review":"The movie itself is great! If you're gonna buy this just based on the movie, then by all means. You're not gonna regret it.HOWEVER, if you're buying this expecting a Gas Can Version of the DVD, think again. It is not the tin casing that is displayed in the product details. I received the wrong version, that is, the normal DVD casing, the first time round. When Amazon sent me a replacement shipment, I still got the wrong version. So DON'T BUY THIS if you're expecting the brilliant-looking Gas Can Edition as displayed in the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie that started Quentin Tarantino","review":"Reservoir Dogs has some great acting by Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buschemi. Six perfect killers are hired to pull of the single perfect diamond heist. The heist explodes into a bloody ambushand they soon relize one of them is a police informer. But which one? Quentin Tarantino's first and possibly best movie to date. Includes the infamous ear scene, Steve Buschemi's convincing lecture about tipping, and award worthy performances by both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Blu-Ray transfer of Tarantino's classic!","review":"I was debating whether to double-dip on the BD version of this movie, then I popped in my DVD version of the movie and realized that the answer is an astounding YES! Now I'm kicking myself for not getting it sooner. The BD version is spectacular in it's picture quality. It looks as if the movie was a recent theatrical release...mind you this movie is 15 years old! Quentin Tarantino's first film has never looked better. This is the one that gave birth to a new genre of film making. Can't wait for Pulp Fiction on BD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"torture as comedy","review":"I'll never forget the (very long) torture scene: ear cut off, victim doused in gasoline--and hearing young men in the audience laughing like it was a Woody Allen comedy.

I think someone had a bunch of stage blood to use before it went bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting, unsatisfying","review":"The ONLY reason this video is in my home is because it is my husband's video. The movie lacks a plot, or any real substance. The level of violence is completely unneccessary and gory. Despite starring some of Hollywood's heavyweights, it is a true let-down. If you are looking for action, appropriate violence and a REAl plot, investigate Tarantino's masterful \\"True Romance.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Viciously black brilliance","review":"Quentin Tarantino's blood spattered tragicomic tale of a robbery gone wrong still leaves an impression every time I see it. Top drawer acting by Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi. A few lapses in logic creep in here and there, but you'll still be gripped by the rest of the film. Kinda functions like a play, most of the movie takes place in one location,where everyone involved in the robbery tries to figure out what had gone wrong. Everyone who is in the movie dies except for maybe seven people. No women in at all in the film, either. Just slick villains who lose control over a tense situation. Strong stomachs are advised for certain scenes, and an ability to not be offended easily might help. The kids would love it, but this is a very adult affair. A keeper, worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Flashy as Tarntino's other films, but still very good","review":"This may be Tarantino's most serious film. I say serious, because most of his films always have a sense of irony and humor under evry theme. This still has alot of humor and irony, but it is far more tragic than his other films. This is also far less flashy than his next two crime epics. Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown both have visuals to die for, and this one is far more restrained. This is bloody. Very bloody. It is also very hard to view at times (more or less because of what you don't see, as oposed to what you do see), yet it is always very striking and potent. Violence is glamorized, but it is also given as a very realistic fact of society. The film does seem to drag towards the end, but it still is a very excellent debut from an obviously promising director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resevoir Dogs","review":"Resevoir Dogs, in my opinion, is one of Tarantino's best films, if not his best. I have heard many people complain about the ending, well what do they want? Do they want a clean, simple, expected ending? I sure didn't want that. And if anything, what makes Quentin Tarantino's movies so unique is the way at the end he always gives you something that you never expected on seeing. It gives a definite realism to the characters and the plot which he quickly wraps you up in throughout the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I don't want to be Mr. Pink\\"","review":"A classic, and every connoisseur of modern film should own it. Tarantino's best film so far, 'Reservoir Dogs' has the human comedy of 'Pulp Fiction' without the contrived coolness of the later film. The characters are superb, and it's enthralling to watch the friendship between Mr. Orange and Mr. White develop throughout the film. Mr. Blonde is Michael Madsen's best role to date, and he comes across as a genuine psycho; especially during the notorious ear-removal scene - which, despite what the moral majority (and the censors) would have you think, doesn't feature any explicit violence at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Guys","review":"Resevoir Dogs was a knockout! I thouroughly enjoyed its creativity from the very first scene on. Quentin Tarantino's clout is so noticeable in all of his movies, but he really hit it big with this one. The movies that he writes and directs (True Romance, Jackie Brown) all have such dynamic characters and actors that portray them. It is truly fascinating to watch a Tarantino film. This one took the cake though. The resevoir dogs really were tough. Steve Buscemi stole the show as Mr Pink. Tim Roth also did a fantastic performance. All of them did though. It was just an amazing movie that is probably most enjoyable (as all Tarantino films are) in a college group of friends. This is not a kid movie at all. Its R rating reflects strong graphic violence and pervasive strong language. If you can overlook that however, you're in for a real treat with Resevoir Dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and intense film; Tarrantino's first triumph","review":"This is a film about a robbery gone bad. Now some of the robbers are dead, missing, and the rest are confused. Now they have to find out one thing: who is the person working with the cops? Who is the rat? This is one of Quentin Tarrantino's best movies. With brilliant performances from Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, and even Tarrantino himself. A shocking an intense movie that won at the Sundance Film Festival and gave Tarrantino his big break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminals are not interesting, and neither is this film","review":"Structurally, this film is great at demonstrating how bits of restaurant conversation are made manifest in the later actions of its characters. Well, big deal. These characters are more boring than even some of my relatives. When all the blood has coagulated and all the shouting is over you'll feel blessed relief. Will Tarantino ever make a movie without handguns as his central prop? I suspect a lot of us would like to see him try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bonus Disc EVER","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Quentin Tarantino, and I think this movie is great. Except for the second disc. The second disc is just full of so much CRAP! 15 second soundbites, interviews with people you have never heard of, people reading reviews of the movie aloud, chapters of books?! Who the HELL is gonna sit there and read the squished text of chapters of books on a tv screen? Not me. And the K-Billy interactive radio is pretty pathetic, except for the last button. And the poster gallery....it only has 3 posters! And the style guide doesn't exist...you'll see what I mean. Avoid buying this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarantino masterpiece","review":"Written by QT in 3 weeks, this tight drama revolves around a botched robbery you never see on screen, and don't need to. It's all about the character reaction after the fact. Nice, plausible twist at the end. You need this in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Version of Tarantino's classic 1992 debut crime thriller...","review":"If you are a fan of this film, but the 15th anniversary edition now. I don't care if you already own the original DVD version or the 10th anniversary, this has far better picture quality and the audio is better. The extras are pretty much the same as the ones on the 10th, although the 10th has a little more. Anyways this is the third time I have bought this movie on DVD and its worth every dime. Best version of Reservoir Dogs on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar at best","review":"A little while back, a friend of mine offered to let me borrow Pulp Fiction. I watched it and loved it. Then she let me borrow Jackie Brown, which I also loved. I figured, \\"Hey, I like Tarantino movies, so I should go out and buy Reservoir Dogs!\\" Err, bad decision.The movie's violence didn't gross me out or offend me in anyway, as it has others which was the reason for their bad reviews, but the movie itself just wasn't good enough for me. The characters were all boring and I could care less about any of them. The dialogue is nowhere near as good as any of Tarantino's later films and the pace of the movie is slower than Pulp Fiction which is a full hour longer than this movie. I tried watching this movie again and again but it just got worse each time.I say, rent Reservoir Dogs first. If you like other Tarantino movies, you might like this. But then again you might hate it like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated.","review":"After the success of 1994's \\"Pulp Fiction\\", Quentin Tarantino fans scrambled around to find \\"Reservoir Dogs\\".Too bad for the rest of us they found it.Tarantino is an over-rated director who cobbled together a decent story for \\"Pulp Fiction\\", and was lucky to not butcher \\"jackie brown\\", which was based on a good Elmore Leonard novel. In \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" his short-comings as a writer and a director are obvious- the story is dull and long, and Taratino's characters are boring. Yep, boring. Does anyone honestly care what happens to these guys?A better question is this- Do Tarantino's films actually have real characters, or are they just a bunch of wierd guys who like saying the f-word, over and over and over? After hearing some obsenity 15,000 times the shock value really does wear off.Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cool Movie\\" for Lame People","review":"It's sad, but if you look at it, Tarentino was a big spike of hype because NOTHING ELSE was happening. This guy made a career by ripping off and disecting finer films and he still sucks. THE WORST, being his own, ugly cameo roles, which slow movies to absolute halts. His sickening, saddening ego must be vanquished, so that actual, cool and less pathetically juvenile films can be made again. Good hair implants though, DUDE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repulsive at best","review":"Having previously purchased \\"Jackie Brown\\"...a film with a wonderful plot and some redeeming value...I thought I would give another Quentin Tarantino picture a try. As this is the movie that supposedly started off his successful career, I figured this was a great place to start.What a repulsive piece of celluloid this movie turned out to be. Violence in a movie for a reason is one thing. Violence for shock value is quite another. There doesn't really seem to be any reason for this movie to exist except to disgust the viewer with it repugnant bloodshed.This is the kind of movie which really makes me question as to whether Hollywood DOES have some responsibility toward desensitizing weak individuals into replicating such violent acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY Is This Movie So Popular?","review":"Is it its' own publicity? Is it a rite of passage to hip-hopping youth? WHY is this movie so popular. I could'nt STAND it! All it is guys in black suits talking like gangsters and puking up potential tag-lines in every seen. This is nothing compared to 'Pulp Fiction', which relies more on its' content, story and puzzle-like directing effect. THIS movie reminds me of drama class in college when everybody wants to be sophisticated and well-dressed with a gun and a New Yawk accent. Theres' nothing special about it, don't believe the hype cause thats' all it is...hype. Steve Buscemi's performance I thought was some of the worst acting in a big-production movie I've ever seen, I'd rank this right up there with Kung Fu Shuffle and Big Momma's House...save it for double-feature night in Da Bronx."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie and features but....","review":"First let me set this clear this a great movie but i ordered this new off of amazon and when i first got it i thought it was new but once i took off the plastic wrapping and stickers the case looked smudged and used. when i opened it and took disk 1 out i saw there was huges scratches all over the bottom of it and when i put it in too see if it works it skiped a lot wich made it unwatchable. so this sucks because i paid money for a new dvd and got what a quess a used dvd which is broken. not happy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarantino at His Best","review":"This is Tarantino at his best. A strong dialogue driven character piece that involves amazing actors in outlandish situations. The dialogue is crisp, the direction astounds and the story involving. There are scenes that make you squirm and there are scenes that make you laugh. Overall, an enjoyable experience...The opening shot alone with the \\"dogs\\" around the table discussing tips and Madonna sets the tone for an amazing movie to come. The disection of the crime and the organization that goes through it as well as many of the surprise twists keep you on your feet till the very last \\"shot\\".A great debut for a great career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reservoir Dogs","review":"Four Perfect Killers. One easy Heist. One Rat.Listen, RD is a great movie. It has flaws, but thats ok. It has ultracool dialogue, hong-kong style violence, and references to the hong-kong and american crime movies that writer-director Tarantino grew up with. The film opens with Tarantino himself showing just how cool his writing can be as he explains his interpretation of madodnna's Like a virgin to the rest of the team.Then it cuts to the aftermath of the heist, where the four remaining criminals try to work out who set them up.With a cast that does the dialogue justice, at the end we are surprrised to find that some of these ultra cool killers affect us more than we expected.I didnt love this as much as i did the later Pulp Fiction, but its still a great movie by a guy who obviously loves great movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"harsh story","review":"I watched both discs of the ten years DVD set and like deleted scenes when I am trying to remember how the characters were dealing with being in the middle of a rock and roll soundtrack that ruthlessly exploits how people in a society of copycat crimes can be disappointed by people who are lawless, nameless, and getting caught because they were set up. Somebody who is afraid he is going to die gets to live as long as the movie keeps everybody interested in what is going to happen to these guys. The guys who made this movie were having so much fun that I stopped listening to the commentary when an actor complained about sweating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another tino hit","review":"This for me was a great film and would of made five stars, The reason i gave it four stars is because the twist it had quite fusstrated me but still a good twist. This movie is top class tarantino stuff and has some pure quilty parts in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Classic","review":"A great all around movie, though not for the kids - there's a lot of gratuitous violence. It puts a new twist on the old cops and robbers theme. If you like this, you'll also love Killing Zoe, Ronin, and Heat (this movie is in a class of its own)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie. Great DVD.","review":"I am a true fan of Quentin Tarentino myself and I believe that this is a truely excellent film. Considering that it only had a budget of $900,000 they did a darn good job. Pulp Fiction is still my all-time Tarentino favorite, but this is a close second. We have some great sequences, great performances, a little bit of violence, and a lot of blood. A true classic.The Special Edition DVD (released 2002), features some very informative stuff on the making of the film and the commencement of Tarentino's career. This is a large improvement from the original release. The covers are kinda neat too, and it doesn't matter which one you get. The extras are all the same.This release is strongly recommended. You should also see: Pulp Fiction, True Romance & Jackie Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor 10th Ann. DVD","review":"I was so happy to finally get the 10th Ann. version home and into my DVD, because frankly it is a movie that I can watch multiple times and still find new things in it. And also there was a commentary track on it, oh and there is one, but it is a \\"Interview\\" style commentary track, using past interviews with cast and crew. Not what I was expecting, would have loved to have had the Director commenting on the film as it played out in front of him, like in other DVD's. So again I am let down by a great movie that has been moved to DVD with not much more than archived material."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a dog eat dog world","review":"This movie is fantastic. Word around the camp fire is Tarantino is going to release a Special Edition of Reservoir Dogs on DVD with commentary and other cool extras. This movie has great acting, great dialogue, great performances and alot of twists and turns that will make your head spin. Not to mention the soundtrack is awesome. If you like violence this is the movie to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say?","review":"This movie get's worse everytime I watch it. Nobody in real life swears like these guys, I don't care if you're in the Mafia, you don't say walk around every 2 seconds going F--k This, F--k That!The only performances I like in this film is Steve Buscemi as the humerous Mr.Pink and Tim Roth's character, who ends up the rat.I thought the scene where Mr.Pink is running from the police is one of the greatest in the film.Bottom line: Some good acting, but lacks what I liked in Pulp Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reservoir dogs","review":"Classic Tarantino film.

Man, whoever gave this movie a rating of classic couldn't be more wrong. Don't get me wrong this movie was full of talent, but the movie itself was just horrible. We jump from the events prior to the diamond heist to the chaos that followed after. We didn't get to see the actual heist or the crews shootout with the cops just them talk about it. I don't know about you, but I personally would rather see the action for myself.Another reason why i disliked this film was beacuse it left to many questions unanswered, like what how and when did Mr. Blue get killed. And Mr. Brown's deaf was so unbelievable. One minute his driving the getaway car and the next he's dead? HORRIBLE FILM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Script,, Useless Violence","review":"I found the movie rather pointless....the script was definitely canned, it felt like I was watching a play. It never drew me into it, and most of it is set in an empty warehouse, which left nothing but the script to carry it. I also felt they were having blood just for blood's sake....the point of the movie? The cops are [jerks], gangsters are [jerks]---the whole world is full of [jerks]? That's great, Sherlock, how long did it take you to figure that one out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars","review":"What is it all about? Endless violence and brutality form the beginning to the end. Looks like certain public simply can't get themselves entertained other than watching people being tortured. Maybe that's why there were always crowds at public executions in the past, to titillate that basic instinct of watching others suffer as this is the funniest thing for certain people? Thanks to Tarantino, we can enjoy it at the comfort of our homes. I wish humanity would prevail even for those who award this sadistic masterpiece the title of the best movie of all times - one can only wonder what they compare it with...Concluding that this is for those who enjoy watching brutality, extreme violence and generally the worst in human kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"I walked out during the torture scene","review":"I have only walked out of a very few movies in my life, but this one takes the prize.

I think the film I turned in for my 7th grade English project was better than this. If I could go back in time I would go back to when I was about to rent this movie and then punch myself in the stomach and steal my wallet. At least it wasn't as bad as Inkheart. That movie was horrible. But I would rather watch Hannah Montana season 1 than waste my time on Reservoir Dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"It's amazing what ten years can do to a film. What was fresh and unique in 1992 is now overdone cliche in 2002. The true test to any film is how well it stands the test of time, and this film cannot stand well at all. The scenes are cumbersome and contrived. The acting is forced, and the violence is comically overdone, but not to the film's benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie I've ever seen.","review":"This movie is one of the greatest pieces of film ever made. Its dialoge is the most realistic I have ever heard on film and the acting is way above what you see in any film in the past decade.

It gets better every time you watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic film","review":"This movie is a rare example of \\"quality\\" film making.

The film is over-matted at 2.32:1 and despite what the widescreen format should do, this actually cuts off some of the top and bottom of the screen.Proof - watch the beginning of Chapter 2 on the Pan & Scan side, then watch it on the widescreen side. Harvey Keitel's head is almost completely cut off the bottom of the screen on the widescreen side. We hear him talking, but only see the top of his hair and occasionally his eyes. It's terrible when taking into consideration that his entire face can be seen on the Pan & Scan side. Why was the movie incorrectly formatted this way? I'll be waiting to rebuy this if and when they re-release it properly.It's still a great movie though and definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant film","review":"I'm not going to restate everything that's been mentioned in previous reviews. I believe this film to be excellent, and while it may seem like the plot is thin, it really isn't; it focuses on adding to the characters' depth. I really enjoyed the fact that the actual theft isn't shown, viewers only get some of the snippets occuring beforehand and then the main storyline afterwards. Plus, the fact that 80% of the movie takes place in the warehouse shows that you don't need a high budget and crazy scene changes to make a movie effective.What got me most after watching Reservoir Dogs was the ending. It's extremely powerful, and leaves the viewer contemplating the movie for hours after watching it. All in all, it's the perfect balance of satisfaction and a craving for more. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sold As Advertised :-(","review":"The film is advertised on Amazon as a special edition coming in unique \\"special edition\\" packaging.

This reveiw is of the Special Edition DVD box set release of the film.Listen to me carefully when I say this: THIS BOX SET COLLECTS FOUR IDENTICAL 2-DISC DVD RELEASES OF RESERVOIR DOGS. The ONLY DIFFRENCE between these 4 copies are their BOX COVERS. Content wise the discs are the same.It was a blatant enough move to release diffrent covers for the same movie, that's an obvious grab at your wallet from ARTISAN ENTERTAINMENT. But to then release a oh-so-holy box set collecting the covers is taking it a step too far. It's best to avoid collections like this at all costs, let's not make it into a trend.

It was in fact his debut movie as a writer and director.The story line in this flick makes it one of his best. The creativity used in unfolding the story is so unique that this movie gets stuck in your head for years to come. I've never seen any movie like along the lines of plot development. Certainly one of the top ten robbery movies ever made.The acting is phenomenal as well. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi give performances that are worthy of awards. Quentin does a good job limit his role as well.From the opening scene to the closing scene you're constantly entertained. There is some conversations that take place that seem to be just a waste of time, but in the end, it is the only way you get to understand the characters, and take a break from the action. Legendary movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reservoir Dogs","review":"A brilliant, brutal heist film focusing on the before and after rather than the act itself, Tarantino's darkly funny \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" was the most auspicious debut of the 1990s, brought to life through the efforts of Keitel, who was impressed with the unconventional script. Tarantino peppers his film with pop-culture references, salty dialogue, and flashbacks that not only heighten suspense but fill in the back stories of his key characters. Keitel, Roth, Buscemi, Chris Penn, and Michael Madsen really run with their roles as bickering psychopaths. Great use of \`70's period music as well- anyone remember \\"Stuck In The Middle With You?\\" At once graphically violent and darkly funny, \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" has one hell of a bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright Blu-ray","review":"This is a decent transfure for being an older film, most sceens look clean, but the disk is a bit lacking in extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"All my friends hyped this movie up.

You will have to take a leap of faith, because it isn't known in the USA, but you will be richly rewarded. The director, Antonio Hernández, is a master filmmaker and the film is exceptional in every way - the cinematography, the editing, the music, all create a truly gorgeous experience (and the anamorphic widescreen transfer is perfect). The acting is sublime: in addition to Sbaraglia, Fernando Fernán Gómez and Geraldine Chaplin give great performances as his parents.

Busting the unrealistic self-image sold to (or stuffed into) us by media and corporations is a great intention. But the book runs to the opposite extreme. Its main message repeated over and over is \\"Whatever you are - that's normal. Don't do anything, trust you body in its candy cravings and food selection and be happy, even if you ARE looking like a space-porker.\\" Excuse me, but our modern environment, food quality and living habits are far, far away from being normal. And to restore the balance, to get close to a slight resemblance of normal the huge work needs to be done, including strict restraining yourself from over-eating over-processed over-refined food and getting a lot and lot of exercise.

I had the lunchbox, the figures, and the VHS'. When i saw that the new tv series and toy line was coming out, i was extactic. Then i watched the show and bought the figures, only to learn they were [bad]. At first, the figures are amazing; they have great detail and an awesome look. Then, when you actually try to play with one, you realize how the arms only move at the shoulder and the legs can only move at the hip (there's no joint at the elbow or knee so it's really hard to have them fight each other realistically). Okay, a setback, but I keep playing. As Leo's sword hits Shredder as the first blow, i noticed his weapon was some sort of flimsy, soft plastic that would bend with the touch of a finger. This, along with all the other complaints i have about the figures, caused me to never really use them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-U-R-T-L-E Power","review":"TMNT was one o' tha most classic fads to ever hit the great state o' TeXaZ.

It sticks to the facts, dispells some rumors, and gives everyone who reads it some of idea of this actor's full body of work.

He didn't love it then of course, but after we got home he started to really enjoy it. He lost interest for a while and when he rediscovered it I discovered the mouse had broken during the time no one was playing with it. It can click, but won't move the \\"cursor\\" on the screen up, down, left or right making most of the activities useless. And of course when I called vtech it's now a discontinued product and we can't get it fixed for replace. They are sending a new toy at the same value (24.99) but well, my son likes THIS one, not a different toy. I'm very disappointed and probably won't be buying another vtech toy if this is how durable they all are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fun for my 2 year old","review":"This was a Chirstmas present for my little boy and has become ones of his faves. He enjoys the music and the sounds from the Thomas the Train show and has already started to recognize some letters and numbers. I love that he has started to become acquainted with the mouse and basic computer operations. This toy has quite a few different activities and games-my son loves them! The only downfall is that in order to do the activities- you have to either push the Activities button and enter the number of the activity or push the numbers at the top. My son is not able to do this without assistance so if he plays by himself he gets a little frustrated and turns it off. It would be nice if the keys did more when not in activity mode. Overall I would recommend for 2-4 year olds especially if they love Thomas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Two Year Old Loves It!","review":"My son's grandpa bought this toy for him while he was spending some time in the hospital. He was there for 7 days and he played with this computer the whole time! He loved it. He is 2 1/2 and he loves the games.

He has definitely gotten a lot of good out of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimilist production pales in comparison with others.","review":"Sets and costumes are minimal, little more than limbo sets enhanced with lighting. Andrew Davis's conducting is slow paced, dry, lacking in nuance or excitement. Technical quality of picture and sound, however, are excellent. If you must have a DVD version of this opera, go ahead and purchase. Otherwise, better to wait for the filmed version, with the Wiener Philharmoniker, James Levine conducting, directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle. So much more exciting visually and musically, with principals Tatiana Troyanos, Carol Neblett, Catherine Malfitano, Anne Howels, Eric Tappy and Kurt Rydl. Hopefully this version will be released on DVD soon, and worth waiting for. Otherwise, try and get a used copy on LD or simply order on VHS!Update: I see that the Ponnelle filmed version is in fact now available so I recommend that as the better option!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book...","review":"Different history for sure.

There was one thing that really bothered me with this book and the one prior. Why is it that Rain is always sleeping with someone? Corbette, Roy, and later that red-headed doofus in the third book. She comes off as quite a slut; kinda like a cheap, stupid, nasty version of Cathy. I didn't like Rain and I don't know why this book was ever published..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book.","review":"This book (like most written by VC Andrews) is terrific. Even though she passed away, the outlines and story ideas she left behind guarantee many more wonderful books to come. I think the writer the family selected has continued the tradition begun by Viriginia Andrews. I definitly recommend this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo! Hiss! to V.C. ghostwriters on this one!!!!!","review":"\\"Lightning Strikes\\" is the second installment in the Hudson series. I really had a hard time getting into this second installment....not only were the characters pretty dull and boring...but Rain disappoints me with her behavior with the men she encounters along her journey in London."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This book was one of the most laughable I have ever read. It wasn't nearly as bad as any of Mr. Neiderman's newer works (April Shadows, Secrets in the Attic, etc) and had SOME traces of VCA elements in it. But still, this book was rather subpar, as was the rest of the series. Mental illness is made light of, and Rain's grandaunt and uncle are just creepy, and what great-uncle does with a servant... well, given the campiness of this book, it shouldn't be surprising. The \\"secrets\\" in this book fall flat, and aren't really intriguing, with a completely disappointing and predictable conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE USUAL","review":"Any VC Andrews/Ghostwriter reader knows the scenario: one talented young female, shadowy mansions, a change in economic status and of course, incest. I really didn't like the way Roy put on that stupid phony act (p. 321) of not knowing who Rain was. I agree that it does insult the readers' intelligence. That part really turned me off. You knew right off the bat Rain and Roy would become lovers. How much do you want to bet by the next installment Rain has Roy's love child? One can bet she has a Roy, Jr. or a girl with a nature themed name. The Rain series would have been good if Rain and Roy had kept their relationship fraternal as they were raised like siblings. With VC Andrews/GW, these kinds of incestuous and quasi-incestuous unions are standard fare. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting back to basics...","review":"This book is one of the few recent releases under the V.C. Andrews name that wasn't completely predictable. While the themes are generally the same, the path the author was going down wasn't always obvious. It kept you interested in what was going to happen to Rain next.Hopefully the next novel continues down these lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad ... Why It's Almost Painful...","review":"Not bad in a good way either. Rain is a character of minimal personality. Likely someone our MALE ghost writer has fantasized up for lonely nights judging from her busy pants-dropping schedule that was so detailed in the book.Funny how every second book the character has to have sex with their step-brother... It is so disgustingly Dawn/Jimmy. In fact, the whole series is of an African American version of Dawn! Purely predictable, yet still trashy! I don't know how on earth that the ghost writer will manage to ever top this stench pit called the Hudson series, but all the same I will eagerly waste my 8.00 for a copy just to observe it's tackiness..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"This book follows the formulaic Andrews/ghostwriter pattern. I did hope Rain would have more sense than to sleep with Randy and Roy. I was hoping this series would take a different turn from the usual. Rain was a much more appealing character, so I had hoped for her to make more informed decisions instead of becoming just another cliche Andrews/Ghostwritten character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightening Keeps Striking","review":"All of VC Andrews books revisit the same themes: incest between siblings, a female protagonist who has an artistic aptitude - Cathy a dancer (Dollangager series), the aptly named Melody a musician, Raven sang (Runaway series) and Misty of the Wildflowers series like Melody, was also musical. Rain, the newest protagonist revisits all of these themes and parallel concepts by having an aptitude for acting and by having feelings for her half brother. The only departure from the Cliche Andrews or vintage Andrews, if you will, is that this is the first interracial character. That adds an interesting new element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as the first one","review":"I felt the book was okay, but was slow in some areas and predictable in other areas. There should have been more said about the dead child in the English household. However, the novel laid the foundation for the battle to come in the third novel, which I am highly anticipating. Good book, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I agree with all the negative reviews. I'm tired of brother-sister or half-brother/half-sister unions. I'm also tired of people raised as siblings ending up in the sack. The thing I found most distateful about this book was Roy's stupid phony act of not knowing who Rain was when they finally (and you knew they would) slept together. It was so stupid, phony, contrived and such an insult to all readers' intelligence. Get an umbrella for the RAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"It's been said that all VC Andrews books are predictable. They are. I didn't like the way Rain ended up sleeping with Roy. They were raised like siblings. It insults your intelligence when Roy puts on that stupid act of not knowing who Rain is when they sleep together. It is a tired old story. VC Andrews books are pretty much all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Well, I know I'm in the minority here. But a real history of the connection between music and race in America is something that it desperately needed. One might expect an academic historian to have provided that. But this book is NOT a good history - it's highly impressionistic and rather anecdotal and full of ideas that aren't exactly explained. It jumps around from chapter to chapter making much of the impressions that the author has about the 'hidden' messages within songs, but I'm afraid that he states rather than argues or proves his case. I hope someone out there DOES write the book that's needed. In the meantime this one is interesting if the style doesn't bother you too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I've had several different kinds of banana nut coffee, have LOVED them all and was SO excited to get this 4 pack of coffee beans!!

Due to its short length, it was more like an infomercial than a serious travel video. While it provides highlights on a few sites in Istanbul, I was hoping for something that would have had more substance. It seems that you need to purchase two or three videos to get a fuller picture and some of the videos appear to have repeated information.

First, I like that it has alot of room. It matches my stroller and is easy to organize items. I like the credit card organizer.However, as my son has gotten bigger and we are carrying even more stuff around, this bag does not expand at all. The bag also does not fit under the stroller (Graco brand also) very well. It usually ends up sticking out the back because once the bag is full, it won't easily get into the bottom of the stroller. In addition, the bag is difficult to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag","review":"I saw these stocked in my store when I was registering. It is very pretty and has lots of space.

This is a pity because it's one of Jane Russell's funnier and sexier films, though she wrote in her autobiography that she didn't much care for it. The famous \\"Lookin' for Trouble\\" sequence at the end of the movie was actually filmed at a middle distance to satisfy the censors, and Russell rejected the original outfit she was supposed to wear as being altogether too revealing. (Two different versions of this sequence, shot at closer range, have recently leaked out, and it's much to be hoped that they'll be included in a future legitimate DVD release.) By the way, if you want to see that original outfit, there's a photo of it in Russell's autobiography - this reviewer doesn't really think it shows any more than the one she actually wore, but your mileage may vary!Watch for Kim Novak in an uncredited cameo as a fashion model(her first onscreen appearance)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Issued on CD","review":"Au contraire...Brian May's Starfleet Project WAS issued on CD by EMI, in 1992 as a combo with Brian May's \\"Back to The Light\\" 2 CD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc Errors","review":"Just a warning, a UK buyer of this MOD disc has said there are multiple disc errors making the film unplayable as it skips and freezes.

The first time I used it, I noticed that the ground pepper was so much more aromatic than with my old mill so I really think it makes a difference.The mill itself is solidly built and sturdy and the grinding mechanism operates smoothly. Turning the crank just a few times produces a good quantity of perfectly ground pepper quickly and easily.While the Atlas is a bit more expensive than many other mills on the market, its sheer elegance combined with its functionality and its projected longevity make it a worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep in My Heart Movie","review":"I am an old movie(musicals) buff.

Another solution involved UNinstalling the original Battlefield 2 (with Special Forces), but we were uncertain whether my account would be lost. So we are now returning this expansion pack.

It's been 3 days and they claimed that I will have something in 24 hours. Even though I can log in to send them emails and check the status of my problem, when I try to log onto their EA download manager it says that there isn't an account with that email address. It's the same email address!!! In short, I paid $15.00 for this game and got nothing more than a box without any software.

So if you and your siblings play, or you have more than one Alias, you can only play any of the bonus content on one of them.Not to mention, EA's website has some serious problems, and out of all of the games I've registered, this one has been by far, hands down, the WORST.

But Winston goes to such extremes to differentiate his style from Guaraldi's that all the charm and spontaneity of the original music is lost in the chaos of rearrangement. If you're a Winston fan and have never heard Guaraldi (although it's hard to imagine that you haven't, given the ubiquitous success of \\"Linus and Lucy\\"), you might want to buy this.

I am 7 mos. pregnant with twins and I am carrying 40 extra lbs - all in the belly. I am still doing a lot of walking, and the cradle definitely helps. It does not completely eliminate back pain. But on the days I am on my feet all day, I feel much better if I wear the prenatal cradle. I also get very sore from sitting in front of my computer, and the cradle actually helps a bit with that too.The downside is that the straps are actually visible with almost everything I wear - except tops or sweaters with a crew neck. Anything with a v-neck or a boat neck leaves the straps exposed. Even a tank top does not cover the straps, as they are designed to criss-cross at the center of the chest. But it's a small price to pay for pain management.By the way, based on other reviews I read, I bought a size up (eg, I bought a medium even though the size-chart indicated I would be a small) and it fits fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as much support as it claims","review":"This product received great reviews, however, when I received it and tried it on, all the bells and whistles carried no support.

Did not work for me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great product","review":"I am in the 3rd trimester of my 2nd pregnancy and needed something to support me while I chased my toddler, took walks, and cleaned the house. The first time I put the cradle on it seemed like it wasn't tight enough to make much of a difference. I am quite short (under 5'-- I have a hell of a time getting maternity anything to fit me properly) and the over-the-shoulder straps felt too loose. However, after I wore it all day to run errands on foot (walked quite a bit) and took my son to the playground, I noticed a considerable difference from the previous times I had done the same amount of activity without the cradle. To my delight, the usual pains that I felt after sitting a while at the end of the day and the next morning were not there. I would definitely recommend this product to other pregnant women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sized correctly","review":"When I purchased this I was not even in the weight range. I am now 5lbs into the weight range and it is too tight. The other issue is that I am petite and the straps on the side are too long. While it relieves some pressure off my lower back I feel more pain in my upper back. I don't like it and could not recommend it, especially if you are a petite person. Also you have to safety pin it to your bra so that it is not exposed out of your top. Besides wearing a regular round neck t-shirt there are no other tops/sweaters/blouses you can wear with the cradle unless you pin down the straps."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"This item is not for me. I am a small framed person expecting twins. I also work full time outside the home and was advised to purchase this product to help me make it to my due date and still work. I have been experiencing a lot of pressure in my tail bone and was anxious to receive this item. There were no directions as to how to put it on so I winged it.

It wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I never thought I would wear anything like this. This is my first pregnancy and I found myself needing some support. This cradle belt does help with supporting my back. I would rather wear this then have the pain of my back. The only problem that I have with it is that it's hard to wear my clothes with it without wearing a high neck tank top or a button down shirt. The crisscross in the front shows with everything. What I wear is built around this belt. It limits my wardrobe tremendously but the support is great and I'm grateful. If you plan to purchase this item just know you may need to adjust your wardrobe and purchase high neck tank tops or wear the ones you have backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"Most uncomfortable thing I put on during pregnancy.

I found that my 5'2\\" 36HH short and curvy frame (size 14 during pregnancy) didn't get any support from this. the straps around the chest were tight and cut into my chest. the belt itself was too big under my belly even on the tightest settings. Bummer, I was looking forward to a belt with support that also let me sit easily. Also, it pinched my bump in a weird way making it look like a saggy beer belly rather than a kid. :( Luckily Amazon makes returns easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit","review":"The straps that go along your ribs and between your breasts were REALLY tight! The part that fits under your belly didn't fit me until I was 6 months pregnant and I'm carrying twins. The fit of this thing was really strange to me since I weighed 120 lbs before pregnancy and my upper body is pretty small. The only part of me that seems really big is my belly and that is the part of the prenatal cradle that was loose. My midwife recommended this and I've heard from other woman that they loved theirs, so maybe it just wasn't for me:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worried, but pleasantly surprised!","review":"I am a full figured girl who found out she was having twins, and my doctor recomended this type of band specifically. When I came on here to look I was a bit worried about getting it since there are a few negative reviews about the feel of the support bands and how they look under clothes.While I will admit there are a couple of issues with low or wide cut necklines since the chest straps are a bit in the way, a simple pin eliminates the issue and takes less than a minute. I have started wearing a tank top underneath the straps just in case it starts to get uncomfortable, but it is more of a precaution than a need.That being said - I LOVE the support! I was only just starting to get a bit of pressure and this band elinimates it. Also makes me stand a bit straighter so my back - I'm assuming - will hurt less later on, added bonus is it accentuates my belly so nobody has that curious, 'are you expecting', look on their face anymore :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful for back support but not wearable as white fabric shows","review":"I got it and was really excited to use for my back support as I reached 8 months pregnancy.

I have had severe PSD with this pregnancy, and this product was recommended by several people including a CNM and an OB. I was well within in the weight/size guidelines for the medium that I purchased. Yet, the lower support band was so stiff and thick that it cut into my skin and was painfully uncomfortable. The straps were way too long and the X that should have crossed in the center of my chest was way up by my collarbone. Even after trying to move everything around so that it was properly positioned, I had no support at all from the product.

Their subsequent albums lacked all those glorious rough spots, I think, but maybe I'm wrong. This album has all those elements that have become their trademark sound. I used to describe Monster Magnet in this way: Monster Magnet are to metal, what The Butthole Surfers are to punk-rock. Both bands rely heavier on psychedelia, than anything else. Imagine Pink Floyd in Pompeii while Mt. Vesuvius explodes and vomits lava all over the place. I saw Monster Magnet about 8 or 9 years ago in a tiny smoke filled club. All I could remember, really, aside from them sounding very much like they did on this album, was that there was a Caveman in the audience.

Then I picked this one up and when I finished it I was depressed for a week. It is so incredibly tragic. If you're depressed or can't take hard reality don't read this book. It is beautiful, but so so depressing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugo Mistake","review":"While Victor Hugo's genius is obvious as one progresses through The Hunchback of Notre Dame, I nevertheless finished with the impression that he was overwhelmed with this piece. What starts very promisingly is concluded awkwardly. The climax hinges on a foolish miscommunication between liberating vagabonds and the heroic Quasimodo, both of whom are working to save unfortunate Esmeralda. Opposing forces share the same benevolent intentions, depriving readers of a dramatic contest between good and evil. It is unclear what Hugo intends to achieve with Esmerlada's estrangement from and epic reunion with her mother, given their ensuing fates. That said, the story's moral is communicated forcefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for Kids","review":"If you are the kind of person who likes scary-romantic stories, you're the person who'd probably like this book! I suggest you try it out. There are a few sad parts in this book, although it is a very good story.- 8yr old homeschool student, California"},{"rating":"2","title":"Except for a few digressions, a good read","review":"This book reads like an opera - big themes, unrequited love, a disfigured protagonist, and unrealistic situations. In the end, I have to say it is a really good book. Be warned, however, that there are a couple of chapters that could literally be thrown away without anyone ever noticing. Hugo has a nasty habit of digressing for about 30 or 40 pages at a time. You've got to just grit your teeth and plow through those sections, the rest of the book is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Young Teens Point of View","review":"I enjoyed this book. Victor Hugo is an excellent author and is very good at describing things so that you can actually picture them in your mind. The characters in this book are very enticing and mysterious. I felt at times like I was right there with Quasimodo (the main character) and other characters like Esmerelda and Claude Frollo. The movie based on this book leaves some very important scenes out and Victor Hugo writes those scenes so well that no one should miss out on reading them. From the very beginning I was drawn in by curiosity. Hugo has a way of writing that makes you want to find out what comes next. It is almost as if I couldn't wait till I could get home and just read for hours. I recommend that anyone who would like to read a very well written book that can help to improve his or her vocabulary and that also would be very enjoyable should read this novel by Victor Hugo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame","review":"This was a great and marvelous classic. I was not dissapointed after reading it, and I am very choosy about books. The Disney Movie does not give it justice, and the book and movies differ dramatically. This is a sweet, sad, and witty book about a poor deformed waif, a dazzling gypsy dancer, a self righteous soldier, a jealous priest, a rather witty and sinicle poet, a goat the accomplice, and the mystery that enfolds them all. If you want an adventure, a romance, and an incredible realistic account of 15th century Paris, then read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Title Would Have Worked for Us","review":"This epic tragedy pits a beautiful, earthbound angel against a venal, earthbound devil, and is set amid the squalor of Medieval Paris. Our protagonists alternately dance and skulk through the chapters, leading to a desperate and heart-wrenching conclusion. Could our angel be a witch; could our devil redeem himself? We desperately hope for any outcome other than the one we fear, and we cannot believe that Hugo would taunt us with such elemental beauty, and then destroy it before our eyes. My only complaint is not with Hugo, but with the translation of the title. Why couldn't we anglophones be trusted with \\"Notre Dame of Paris?\\" The book is less about Quasimodo than about the conflict between Medieval Paris's lofty aspirations for man and the depredations of daily life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Footnotes do not work","review":"Do not buy this Kindle edition. Notwithstanding the fact that it is published by a major publisher, the footnotes do not work. The little numbers appears in the text, but clicking on them is impossible and there is no way to get to the footnote text (except by manually setting a bookmark for each note). This is the type of poor formatting one frequently finds on public domain titles, but this is not a public demand title (because it is a recent translation).

There was never a better reason for abridged versions than the full text of this book. Read a shortened version, see the movie anything, but don't put yourself through the torture of reading this. I did, and as a result I have developed a hunch on my own back from cringing at the sheer volume of absolutely pointless prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for young children","review":"This is not a book you should have a young reader read on their own. Though the writing is at their level (2nd-4th grade) the content is not. I can appreciate that it is a classic tale that shows the life and characters of the age in which the story is set, it is not something you want your child reading on their own. It shows the cruelty of people, the evil darkness of others and then ends in a hopeless tragedy. Though an adult can understand the complexity of the tragedy and find a sad beauty in it, not a child of this age range, on their own. I would only recommend this book as a read aloud. My daughter was very upset by the ending and I regret giving her the book to read. She is 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It!","review":"This book stands as one of my favorites.

A third reaso that liked the Hunchback was because of how exiting it was when Quasi was duking it out with his \\"dad\\" and how they were both trying to kill each other even though they were \\"father\\" and son.

The replacement was also defective due to a different sheet feeder problem. Another hour on the phone. They sent me another reconditioned one. It's sheet feeder worked but by now the printer software was so screwed up on my computer I had to pay a PC tech to come and sort it out, which cost more than the printer! He said the HP printer software doesn't uninstall correctly. However, he sorted it out and I'm using the printer.

Once you clear the jam and close the cover, you must wait for the printer to complete and run through a maddeningly lengthy (45+ seconds!!) rumination of self-tests and gyrations -- we joked that it brings to mind an obnoxious dog slurping away at its you-know-what.I have owned several HP printers, and they have been durable and trouble free.

Basically they last a year until they start having feed problems. Warranty support is non-existent. Ink is exorbitantly priced. Software is bloatware that comes with all sorts of add-ins you will never use.

As I remember receiving a replacement from HP was not too difficult.However, I would not recommend this printer for the following reasons:- The application crashes and often requires rebooting to work.- It frequently creates PDF that will not open. Acrobat says the file is damaged.- The sheet feeder works poorly. It reports a paper jam for no reason and the scans are very crooked.- The \\"Digital Filing\\" has connection problems. It often takes a few tries to scan directly to a network location.- The process of scanning is slow and will sometimes fail.

Further, rather that being \\"archival\\" the colors fade quickly, in mere months exposed to flourescent lighting.

Technical Support in India was difficult to understand, and after 1.75 hours, gave up and sent us another machine. Machine #2 had a fax hardware failure during installation. Again, Tech support spent another 1.5 hours, gave up and sent machine #3. Machine #3 had the same fax hardware failure. Our \\"Case Manager\\" sent us a \\"sister\\" model (#7780), and guess what? - Same fax failure. We can't be the only customers who've reported this fax issue, but HP swears we're the only ones...We're so fed up, we don't know whether to send all four machines back for a refund, or just be lazy, keep the machine and buy a separate fax machine somewhere else.

After spending a few hours on the phone with different gentlemen from India, they finally agreed to send me a new power supply.It worked good for a few months but then started getting a constant error that the back door was open. Apparently this is a common problem with no solution. I cleaned the connectors many times and it would print 10 pages and then say the door was open.Also the drivers are poorly written. I go to print 50 pages and it will print them out of order - or print 1/2 page on one piece of paper and then the other 1/2 on another piece of paper.I paid a premium for this printer because i thought I was buying a quality product.

The result was almost dangerous, as the driver side mat would often partially slide over the gas pedal. For me, this was a deal-breaker. I drove with these mats for a month, and ultimately threw them away in favor of a new set of OEM floor mats from the dealership.

Obviously this was some sort of a ground/maintenance mishap. Another shot shows an F4F Wildcat-not F6F Hellcat--against a carrier's island. I can never understand why books are published with detracting errors like this in them.I would have liked more descriptive text attached to the photos. What happened to the crew?

Crazy looney-toon, cussing and screaming and yelling and scratching and flying off into tantrums over everything.To top it off, the narrator is also the worst, so the combination was mind numbing. Educated prosecutors and judges, even in Texas, don't say \\"fahr\\" for fire. And, unfortunately, that was a word often spoken in this miserable excuse for a book.

He's picked up in a different city after all of these years but he somehow convinces jealous prosecutors that he's the real victim and that she killed them herself.Drama was supposed to occur at that point but instead we got more random anger and cursing.

Her anecdotes on her burgeoning affinity for cooking, interning in the White House, and falling in love with her first apartment are so riddled with her no B.S. humor that it's quite a feat to tear the book from your hands.Like in her essay entitled \\"Rapture\\" in which she discusses the magical powers of getting lost in a book, if you're like me, you too can be submerged in the spellbinding anecdotes of Ephron's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"dismal, stereotypical view of women","review":"I read the first 50 pages and was bored out of my mind as well as appalled at the content. Obviously this woman and the women who like this stuff have no self-esteem to think of their lives as more than hours of waxing and makeup and PURSES. My god, get over it and start living a life. I'll continue my life by not finishing this book - I have better things to do with my time that to waste it on women who waste their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get my hair done twice a week...","review":"because I can't afford to! The way Nora Ephron talks about how she MUST spend money on ridiculous things like manicures and twice weekly blow dry and styles makes me angry and frustrated.I work very hard and enjoy the things I buy and the luxuries I indulge, however the financial level Nora Ephron lives at (and then whines and complains about in this book) is totally out of the abilities of most women in this world. It makes me want to vomit, not laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Save your money and check this one out of the library if you are curious. Unless you are from NYC, you won't get most of the essays - they are shallow and NYC-centric. The best by far is the title essay. I expected a lot more from this author than this book. I immeidately donated it to the local book sale -- look for it soon on the sale table at your bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for a couple chapters that were amusing","review":"A few chapters were amusing. It started out promising. But, I would recommend borrowing this from a library. There's only a few funny parts in the book.

Are you kidding me? I had high hopes that this book would give a funny spin to the unfunny prospect of aging. Instead, I find myself disappointed and annoyed by the constant \\"Poor me, I'm rich and famous and it takes more time and money to be perfect\\" attitude. I don't know about the rest of you, but it's hard for me to identify with someone who leads a life of such privileged consumption.

I would highly recommend her- fabulous author and very poignant"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Aftermath Of Fifty","review":"Oh, I enjoyed this book. I had to find a quiet corner to read this book because I kept giggling and smiling to myself. When I found myself laughing out loud at the candid humour of the lines, I knew I had to hide somewhere where no one could see me laughing to myself. Ah, it's so true - how we ladies would slog in front of the mirror sometimes just to feel confident stepping out of the house. I would recommend this book to my friends who are fifty and above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"Oh (pause) My (longer pause) Goodness (sigh). Nora Ephron is a wonderful writer who should never be permitted to read aloud, let alone be recorded doing so. She has horrible reading voice - it's very dull which, I am guessing, is why she chooses to Over Emphasize Every Single Word In The Book as though each word was followed by and exclamation mark! My usual enjoyment of her writing forced me to listen to this through chapter three and then I just found myself teetering between wanting to fall asleep or simply scream at her Exclamation! Point! Style! Of! Reading! That accompanied by her dull, yes Du u uu uu ull!!!! tone made this audio book impossible to finish. Sorry Nora, next time you make an audio book, ask Meg Ryan to record it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent pretension","review":"I cannot believe this book was published. The author comes off as a shallow idiot who actually expects readers to enjoy/sympathize with/relate to her writing about her vapid life. She has nothing new to say and doesn't say anything well. She whines about getting old. She's also cushioned against many of the problems of the elderly due to her wealth. Since this book was a complete waste of my time, the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it's short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading","review":"The book was purchased as a gift to my wife. She absolutely loved it! Since reading the book she has told many other women they need to order and read this novel. She hopes Nora Ephron will continue writing and publishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewitching","review":"It's fitting that Nora Ephron wrote \\"Bewitched\\" as she's a writer whose prose cast a magical spell. This charming, sad, sweet, funny book is crafted by a sensitive, passionate and wildly- observant person who truly loves life and feels loss profoundly.Nora Ephron doesn't claim to have any magic answers; she simply carries on and does her best.

She's a great writer but I don't see the point of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow that wasn't funny","review":"I had never read Nora Ephron or heard of her. She wrote the screenplay for When Harry Met Sally...which I never saw. But I'm pretty sure she was on The Colbert Report when this book came out and somehow the title stuck.Unfortunately, the title is so good the rest of the book falls short in comparison.A collection of humorist essays on being a woman is not new. Nor does Ephron review the subject in new light. Her writing is brief and extremely simple. Each essay begins and ends without substance. I didn't laugh, but I blame Erma Bombeck for this. Some female humorists are just too classic to compete with."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel bad about the time I wasted reading this book","review":"OK, sure, here and there a funny line or two. But basically, this is pseudo-intellectual kvetching, just like her movies. Oy! The poor rich Manhattanite who spends too much on face creams and dental care. We should all be so stressed. And she got paid for this, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so short","review":"Pleasant little read, \\"little\\" being the operative word...

About the time that 'Heartburn' came out, I was enduring my own. I love her writing style & dry wit. She is my kind of writer & I will be 1st in line to purchase anything new she creates.Being a 'woman of a certain age', I empathized w/ the feeling sorry for one's neck. One can only hope that there are a lot of 'Richard's'(from Ally McBeal) who enjoy touching the wattle of one's neck.Nora rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"This book was a complete disappointment.

After reading these reviews I will call tomorrow and tell them to put the book back into circulation. I am older than Nora, not as wealthy by far as Nora, do not live in NYC, and do not think that I would find anything funny, uplifting or profound in her book. Glad I read these reviews before running to the library to pick up the book. I think perhaps the funniest thing about this book is the title. I do love that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My neck hurts too","review":"I gotta tell you... my neck hurts too and I'm a man. But i don't charge you $19.95 to tell you about it. This is just a bunch of navel gazing and picking the lint out of it. And after reading it for an hour my neck got stiff.So the title should have been... \\"My Neck Hurts and So Will Yours After Reading My Book (Even If You Are A Man)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Writing","review":"This was the first thing I'd ever read by Ephron. It will be the last. I am shocked that someone with such a great reputation could produce such mediocrity. It's not clever, it's not intelligent, it's not original. I only read a few essays and couldn't take it anymore. The one positive is that I borrowed it from the library, so it didn't cost me anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold as NEW.","review":"I ordered this book, advertised as NEW, and, unfortunately, did not open or check it until yesterday. There are two spots on opening pages and in the upper right hand corner is printed, in pencil, Jane J. There is also faint spotting on the last two pages. I need to give this book as a gift tomorrow and I am greatly disturbed at my findings. It was a serendipitous happening that this request for report arrived when it did. Too bad I didn't check the book upon receipt. Now I have to decide whether to give a damaged gift on time, or wait for a replacemment and be late with my gift.I am unhappy about this.Diana Parham"},{"rating":"2","title":"I WILL NEVER FEEL BAD ABOUT MY NECK...THANKS TO NORA","review":"Necks, hair, lips, legs, eyebrows, nails, tummies -- Nora Ephron doesn't miss a female body part in this funny, friendly collection of personal essays. If you are one of the dozen or so people who have NOT read this book yet, I highly recommend it. It's perfect for the beach, a lazy afternoon, or read aloud to a friend who needs a laugh. My favorite essays covered the absurd expense of being an urban woman, thoughts on why JFK didn't sleep with the author, and a love letter to the author's favorite apartment. As an author myself, the quality of Ephron's prose was not lost on me. In fact, I enjoyed this collection so much, I've vowed to read humorous essays all summer. Thank you, Nora Ephron. I hope you will be writing regardless of what happens...to your neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel bad about buying this book","review":"While the author may be a respected writer, this book is a poor example of her work. She rambles on about nothing, drops names and brags about herself and her finances. Where are her \\"thoughts on being a woman\\" when she rambles on about her high priced apartment? It was not insightful, not funny and really not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Nora?","review":"I am sorry I wasted my money on this book. I looked forward to reading this book and bought it the first day it was available. I am fifty and thought I could use a light read and a little laughter. What I ended up with were the boring ramblings of Nora's life. I felt like she threw together a few days of journaling and published it. I didn't laugh out loud once. Let's be real we have all heard funny stories about hair in wrong places and mid life short term memory. I kept waiting for something funny and it just went on and on and on......."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Feel Bad about My Neck","review":"What started out to be a funny, light read turned out to be bitterness about aging. Yes, aging can be hell if you haven't developed your spiritual self and realized that everything material is temporary. I am reminded of the line from the song THE ROSE, \\"it's the soul afraid of dying that never learned to live.\\" I scanned much of this book because I found it pretty shallow. Nora, don't try to apply your thoughts to everyone. I am 71 and I value the wisdom of old age much more than a flawless neck. In spite of your age, you still have a lot to learn. It can be the most fun you've ever had in your 60+ years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the fun read I expected","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I expected so much more from this book.

Sorry, no recommendation from me on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evelyn Miles (Melbourne, Australia)","review":"Whilst Nora may be a good script writer, this book is so poorly written it was difficult to imagine a person of such diversity and journalistic background could write such dribble. I purchased this book after reading many reviews and some by celebrities, so I guess it is who you know not how good you write! The content is poorly structured and has no gripping point or even highlights to reflect on. I am disappointed I puchased the book and certainly will not be passing it on to friends or recommending it in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total ripoff","review":"I have never felt compelled to write a review until I finished this book!

It was an insult to read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for MY neck","review":"After seeing Ms. Ephron on the Oprah show, I was led to believe this book would make me laugh and get over my own worry about aging...Instead, it made me sad and I felt melancholy for days after reading it..It was an ok book, about how much money she had and divorce and death, not at all what I thought it was...Definitely not the typical American women that I am familiar with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compelled to finish","review":"I was looking for some light humor to keep me entertained over a rainy weekend. I read the reviews on this book and it sounded like just what I was looking for. As others have said, the first chapter had some laugh out loud lines. After that, I just could not force myself to read much more. Life is too short to waste on boring books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Let me say first...I love Nora Ephron! However, I was so hopeful that I would greatly enjoy this book and felt so disappointed when I read it. In fact, I didn't finish the book because it did not hold my interest beyond about 35 pages. I kept reading only because I thought it might get better. I wish I would have enjoyed it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ten bucks worth","review":"I'm annoyed with myself that I paid over ten bucks at Sam's for something that I read in one sitting and that offered minimal humor and little insight into aging or anything else. Just about any woman of a certain age with some writing skill could have written this slim book -- though most could not have written the irrelevant, boring, and overlong section on the travails of owning an apartment in New York. But an unknown author with the same skills and ideas would not have had such a skimpy book published. Nora Ephron is a very funny woman who writes charming screenplays and articles, but as another reviewer pointed out, once you've heard her speak you don't need to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapppointing","review":"A few good things, but she's lost her edge AND I find it impossible to identify AT ALL with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there, Botoxed, massaged, PT-ed...Plus I've never made $150,000+ per year so I feel like I live in another cosmos.Besides, I live in France, where real faces are appreciated.constance rodrigue"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was disappointing","review":"I did not find this book amusing. The title led me to believe that I would relate to this author and what she had to say. Ms. Sphron focuses on being disorganized, which I'm not, so it's just a difference in our ersonalities, I guess, that caused me to be disappointed with this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit yer whining","review":"Although this book has been touted as hilarious and so trendy, I found it overwhelmingly boring. I saw the author on Oprah and thought it might be a good laugh, but, no! Got really tired of all her whining. But, so many books right now are being published that are nothing but somebody whining about their life. I just think it is really sad what popular literature has come to. I haven't recommended this book to anyone and won't. Thank goodness I got it from the library or I would be really ticked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nora should stick to novels and screenplays","review":"I feel bad about the money I spent on this book. Nora Ephron is a genious when it comes to observing and writing about other people in modern society, but this collection of essays falls completely flat if one is to believe it is about thoughts on being a middle-aged woman. She makes a couple of good observational hits, but the majority of it is too personalized and elitist. How many of her readership can truly understand and relate to living in New York and being a successful journalist, author, and producer? I wanted to read and laugh about the inevitable things that happen to women as we age and be able to relate to my sisterhood around the world and throughout time. Ms. Ephron includes too much fluff from her own unique life circumstances here to accomplish this. This book just demonstrates that even the most talented writers cannot be successful in every genre they attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Feel Bad About My Bald Head","review":"From a man's perspective, this book gave me some insight into the mind of the greater sex but mostly made me knowingly smile and appreciate that I'm not one of them. This book is a soul exposing memoir, a self-deprecating look at aging, and a scattering bit of good advice from one of our countries most talented and witty journalists and screenwrites. The author makes us realize that although we may come from different backgrounds we are a lot more alike than different and adding humor to serious issues such as aging and death perhaps are the best way to deal with them. Lastly, I might add that as different as the sexes may be in displaying their vanity, their reactions to aging are really not all that different."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY REVIEW","review":"I FOUND THIS BOOK ENJOYABLE.

This book is a quick (I read the entire book in one sitting) and fun read. Basically a series of essays on a variety of subjects, (purses, lipstick, NY apartments, divorce, kids, etc). I didn't find the stories depressing. They are written in a light fun manner. This is not heavy literature or an in depth psychological discussion. Its just observations about her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Nora Ephron","review":"The last time I read Nora Ephron was \\"Heartburn,\\" and I loved it. That was years ago, and I can't imagine why I didn't read all her books back then. But that just means I can enjoy them now.

It's a collection of stories about her life (which are supposed to ultimately show her thoughts on getting older), but there's no cohesion amongst them and I finished most of the stories thinking \\"Um, okay, that was random... Why do I care?\\" She never seemed to take the stories as far as she should have. They could have been really great, hilarious anecdotes, but because of the way they were told, I was left less than amused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wit and Honesty","review":"I'm a big fan of Nora Ephron's films, but haven't read any of her books until now. I wasn't surprised that I found her style so engaging. She is a master of writing simply yet with incredible depth at the same time. Perhaps I've been trained by her films to want a lot of witty lines, zingers so to speak, and was a bit disappointed that my mind sometimes wandered when reading. This definitely wasn't a page-turner, but I found her honesty and insights delightful.

Nora Ephron has that knack of hitting the jugular with her verbal scalpel, leaving only attractive scars. Laughter lines are the only visible damage, this is a book worth swallowing your ego and pomposity to get through. Don't read it on a train or bus, other women will start examining your crow's feet and doubt your sanity when they see the title.

I feel the seller should warn the buyer if they do not have the book shown, and will be replacing it with a lesser book.

Alas, this compilation is too much Nora and not enough Everywoman. Her essay about her neck and her ruminations about her handbag have hilarious and insightful moments, offering universal truths we all can identify with. Alas, there are too many specifics about Nora's life that we can't identify with: her endless & dull apartment saga, and those endless & dull cooking references. Plus, her not-so-subtle hints that she's made bales of money get awfully tiring. You obviously want to tell us, just come out with it: How rich are you? Overall, her essays have a sad tone, and many feel like she just banged them out. Her \\"Crazy Salad,\\" now decades old, showed such crisp wit and compelling promise. This is not a fitting tombstone piece from such a talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Dig Ephron","review":"I've been a fan of Nora Ephron's work for a long time and this is her finest written work ever. Written in short, easy, highly amusing little chapter-vignettes, it's a fast read but not a shallow one. While Ephron's little anecdotes may be not-terribly-deep there's a true wisdom at play here,. from a lady who's loved and lost more than once.I especially like the last half of the book. If you dive into this make sure you continue reading because the best stuff isn't up front.Another hilarious book related to mid life is Race You To The Fountain of Youth. Also told in short, pithy chapters, it may not be as deep as Ephron's book but is outrageously humorous.Race You to the Fountain of Youth: I'm Not Dead Yet (But parts of me are going fast)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the Sally Army...","review":"...because you can pick up a book like this for free and read the whole depressing thing while sitting in someone's old rocker ($15 bucks as is) waiting for your adored partner to scan the back, front and sides of every vintage phonograph album in every box in the store. Damn. To think some people spent twenty dollars for this colossal waste of time. It wasn't funny. It wasn't insightful. It wasn't honest. And it short changed her fans (I know she has fans, how else would something like Sleepless in Seattle get considered a \\"classic\\" romantic comedy?) something fierce. Next time I find myself rocking away in the used book corner, I'll do myself a favor and read something like the Celestine Prophesy. Could it be worse?

I'd suggest going to the library for this one - it's certainly not a great addition to your own personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I found this book boring after the first chapter. I gave it away and would not recommend you buy it. It's highly overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty little book about the passage of time","review":"I Feel Bad About My Neck contains all of the things that Nora Ephron finds lamentable about growing older. This book is just as funny as you would expect from the same woman who gave us When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle. It also contains sage advice and witty commentary about everyday life. Ephron's discussions include everything from why you should buy and not rent to the pitfalls of owning too many skincare products. It's also less than two hundred pages and a very fast and upbeat read. I think this book is good for women any age, so don't be discouraged into thinking it's going to be a depressing rant about downside of getting older. Instead, Ephron gives us an inside look into her thoughts on the passage of time from someone who's been there and done that. This would be a great book to read in the bathtub or nail salon when you're relaxing and in the mood for a chuckle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Feel Bad About My Neck - Book Review","review":"Well....

Half of it could apply to anyone not just women.

As a humor writer myself, I decided to give it a try on my new Kindle. Well, I am so glad I did. I loved it. I could read a couple chapters at a time and go back to my work and then come back to it, since the story was made up of individual humorous essays.

For the rest of us, it is a scream, absolutely hilarious and too, too true.From pithy observations about the scourge of the Aging Neck (hence the title) to a chapter on the Empty Nest that had me shrieking aloud with laughter, this book tells it like it is, whether or not we LIKE it like it is.Written with all of Ephron's skill, all her beautifully timed wording and her absolute perfection at punchlines, this is a truly funny book to read if, like me, you occasionally take yourself too seriously and think you are the ONLY ONE to bemoan her lost youth and to fear The Loathed Mirror. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"Ever since Heartburn (the book) I have been a rabid fan of Ephron's, purchasing and greedily devouring previous books she had written and waiting anxiously for the next.

Cry WAH-Wah-Wah all the way home.Manhattan matrons with little else to do but Lunch with the Ladies may be amused, but Ephron's purportedly funny stuff is so out-of-touch an affront to the majority of American women of this-certain-age as to be callous and nauseating. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhh, To Be Young Again.","review":"A funny, quick read. The book will resonate more with the ever-wrinkling Baby Boomers than the Generation X, Y, Z or whatever the heck the younger age groups are being labeled nowadays. I doubt very much if my twenty-year-old self would have found most of Ms. Ephron observations to be amusing or worth my attention.

She is honest about the difficulties and cost of 'maintenance' in the later years. And in fact she confirms a piece of wisdom once transmitted me to by Rabbi Eliezer( Lou) Jacob who when asked at the age of eighty- eight , how he feels today , said \\"Better than I will tomorrow.\\"At the same time her feisty spirit does give a strong sense that there is no need to raise one's hands in surrender at the passing of sixty.

I had hoped to find equally amusing insights on womanhood beyond the superficial. Oops. Instead I finished knowing more about her purses and food and an outrageously expensive apartment than I ever cared to know. This is the state of publishing I suppose. You need to be famous already to be able to write about your purse and your hair and your apartment and believe that others will care. Maybe I feel this way because I listened to it during the recession, but it let me down. I found it out of touch and self-indulgent. Give me the joys of age, the real meaning of womanhood that goes beyond what a man thinks of you. What happened to true feminism in this country, at any age? No matter the strides, it comes down to what's on the outside. Inner beauty? We all know what that is code for.

No one cares if you hate the time it takes to get a manicure, most of us don't care or will never see your manicure, please don't bore us any further with your petty whining. This book depressed me.

But this book talks about living in NY experiences (which I appreciate very much as I love NY), but can't relate to it. Also, it's a priveledged life, again, someting I can't relate to.

Parts of it are funny, but its overall tone is pretty cynical, especially if you compare it to, say, \\"Sleeping in Seattle.\\" It lacks balance. Ultimately, it just ends up being a harangue about aging, which does have its drawbacks (I know, I'm 63), but which also brings some great stuff (wisdom, humor, self acceptance, etc.), which is lacking in this book.

I'm glad I didn't spend the money, and instead got it from the library. I expected a very funny book that would be filled with wisdom and wit. Instead I found a slightly funny book that lacked originality and really had nothing to say. It would be too harsh to call it self-indulgent, but in a way it was. So she had a rent-controlled apartment that she loved, so parenting has changed, and so she has to dye her hair (often). Yawn yawn.As someone who is just a few years younger than Nora (ok 10), I am her \\"target\\" audience and was primed for a good read.

The last chapter of this book depressed me so much - I just turned 60 and it made me feel like there's no reason to go on. I wonder why the mood of the book changed so much in that last chapter. The book was all fluff and no meaningful in the least. it's hard to feel sorry for someone who can pay $10,000 for an apartment if she wanted to. I felt like she was trying to sound like someone out of the bohemian '60's, naming specialty stores around her and dropping names of people constantly. I wish I could get my money back.

Only by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross are we able to stand before our Creator, redeemed, bought with the blood Christ shed on the cross.

But to call \\"Tokyo Story\\" one of the best films of all time is a total insult to the many, many much, much better movies and filmmakers out there. The story can touch the human heart, but the presentation is excruciatingly slow and boring and you'll feel like pulling your hair out after the first 20 minutes.

Hat's off to the folks responsible for this essential compilation of some of the finest spoken performances I have ever heard.

The box contains a large booklet with rare photo's and additional info, as well as an unpublished piece. Each cd box, contain small booklets with even more rare photo's of Burroughs through out his life. This is a genius time machine. No distracting music.

John has no axe to grind and no interest to protect, unlike Burroughs other editors (heir, adopted son). The list of what was buried with William is worth the CD alone. Although John says that he was with William when Burroughs died, he means it in a zen way. He was not there, but no one was closer to WSB than Giorno (except for those that inherited the money). Buy it now if you really like the old man. It is boring, for sure, but Burroughs voice is worth a few dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am someone who believes the best way to appreciate Burroughs, is to hear him read his own work.

Hilarity and an unofficial social experiment are sure to ensue, right?Wrong. Not only is this book fraught with grammatical and spelling errors, but the writing feels like an intelligent 7th grader's and there is not one original thought in the entire 384 pages. Patricia, Patty, and Paul all speak like they're from a bad 50's sitcom, with stupid nicknames, a horribly dated way of speaking, and humorless, stupid jokes. Furthermore, the main characters are offensively anti-blonde: if you were to change every blonde reference to a skin color or sexual preference reference, this novel would never have made it to bookshelves.

That was in the notes on the bottom of a page concerning the pluralism of Islam stated by Baxter. Page 95.

If one is interested in the development of ideas about Mesoamerica in the early 20th century, this is a useful book. If one wants to find out about those civilizations, however, this is NOT the book to read. Many of Spinden's ideas were proven wrong in the 1930s; by 2000, the number of errors in the book is enormous. There has been much fieldwork, decipherment, and other research on these cultures in recent decades.

They later went on to release two of the best female fronted albums of all time (Live Through This & Celebrity Skin). Unfortunately, this album isn't nearly as good as the other two, and is a real let down.The songs are either too short or too long and in general are pretty tuneless. A lot of people have posted messages saying it sounds really heavy, but it's more dull than loud. Despite the songs sounding rather bad, the lyrical content is as good as ever. The lyrics cannot be faulted and neither can the vocals. If there's anything that stands out in this album, it's the amazing growls provided by Courtney.The only songs which stand out slightly to me are \\"Teenage Whore\\" and \\"Good Sister/Bad Sister\\", but even these are quite poor. I recommend you buy Hole's other albums and stay away from \\"Pretty On The Inside\\" unless you're a devoted fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-produce please!","review":"Don't get me wrong...I love Hole.

It is simply four untalented musicians getting a record deal with the help from the front woman's fatherand recorded an album with half finished songs under their belt.the songwriting is poor. the musicianship is also bad and the sound overall really really bad. Courtney's lyrics are often shallow and often doesn't demonstrate anything. Her vocals are copying everything from other female artists. This just shows us that Courtney and her group couldn't do a thing themselves so on later albums they would hire songwriters to write their albums. Overall a poor effort that should belong in the garbage instead on a shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Chandler","review":"I did not even know Courtney had a singing career.

I'd like to say that this is an album that may take some getting used to. Especially tracks like \\"Teenage Whore,\\" \\"Mrs. Jones,\\" and \\"Berry\\" - All of those might be too rough for the average listener...I say give it a chance!

Not glossy pop and pretty. Not Pantera screaming. Right in between with the perfect lyrics and rage to carry these songs along.Produced by Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon, this is a wonderful hard rock album. Much different in respects to the later attempts by this same band. No pop, just pure punk. With lyrics of poision laced with girls, fairies, clouds, glitter, rot, wings, and other things that you'd never expect to hear on an album so hard.If you were to review these lyrics, you would see how her own husband used some of her early work for insperation on his later, post-Nevermind, effort \\"In Utero.\\"A great album for anybody who loves rock music"},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, this album does change lives....","review":"....this is not a quilt of \\"SONGS\\"-its one Whole piece. its so beautiful. i know every single chord, snarl, gasp, and beat. its thrashy, and you have to either brace yourself and swallow it Whole, or you can try to spit it out even though the bitter after taste will still be there. but, dont we all want it pretty Inside of us? more sample lyrics: \\"good sister/ bad sister...suck up on the dregs sister. scar tissue blood blister, tell me what you want sister. ill be the biggest scar in your back. run down and jagged and naked and black.....you want her on the bed with her legs wide open and her eyes all spread....slut kiss girl, wont you promise her smack, is she pretty on the inside, is she pretty from the back?.....on acid stars, you're getting there...\\" xoxo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here she comes her pants undone all waste and void...","review":"Hole's first album \\"Pretty on the Inside\\" is completley void of any Kurt Cobain references, and I must say, I appreciate that. Sadly anything after this record always brings up Cobain. Hole is NOT all about Kurt, Courtney has many other inspirtations.All three of Hole's albums are so uniquely different. Courtney's lyrics are straight-foward and she tells it like it is. This album is pure grime, and is NOT for the weak at heart. Purely raged by anger, songs like \\"Teenage Whore\\" and \\"Pretty on the Inside\\" explode in your face.NO glossy production, just Courtney and the gang playing pure punk. The scene of female rock is DEAD in the 00's. There's nothing out there. So you have to go back in time and discover Hole. Usually mainstream means pretty much fabricated garbage by record companies, and even if Hole is the most popular hard rock female band, they truly deliver with their own creative standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"someone new!","review":"If you've never listened to Jack Penate - do give him a try.

This isn't very helpful. You might pick up something if it were in slow motion (probably not even then), but what you really need is a good explanation before hand - which you don't get. At one point he suggests visualizing the chord shapes while practicing the scales, but doesn't really explain why that would be helpful. He also shows some licks, which just sound like noise to me (boring heavy metal noodling). I found the guitar louder than the talking so I needed to turn down the sound with the exercises and turn it up for the voice. Also, just from a personal preference perspective - why do we need distortion on the guitar? It just makes it sound more like noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Ordered","review":"I ordered White Diamonds EAU de Parfum and received EAU de Toilette. This product came from Target.

There is also information about each winery, such as their production capacity, contact information, including website addresses.There are no photographs in this guide, just illustrated maps. I found the descriptions of the scent and flavor of each wine designed more for the wine drinker, and not a novice wanting to learn about wine.Having lived in South America for a small time, I have to say that South America has wonderful resources, and we should help them out by trying out their wines too.

This is it.","review":"Buy it now.I'm pretty sure this is their first large indie release (Matador) and everything before this was on Chicago's Drag City records which was mostly one-off seven-inches.There is nothing bad about this album aside from some obvious comparisons to the Fall (I think the band hates them for stuff like \\"Two States\\"), but even though Mark E. Smith despises Pavement he ought to be emboldened by the fact that such a clever little American band of smart rockers can carry the Fall's torch (during \\"Slanted\\" anyhow).Decades from now, cool kids who love guitar rock will pull out their parents' old CDs, find \\"Slanted and Enchanted\\" and start forming way-cool bands as a renaissance of indie-rock flowers all over the world (well, I hope my as-of-yet-unconceived son/daughter decides to, anyhow).Don't miss this record.

Virtually every song is a classic, with the best of the bunch being \\"Trigger Cut\\", \\"In The Mouth A Desert\\", \\"Conduit For Sale\\", \\"Zurich Is Stained\\", and \\"Here\\". The key to the album's power is the wild abandon with which it's pulled off; it really does sound like it was recorded in your neighboor's garage by a bunch of no good slacker kids (and in fact it was if you happened to be living in Stockton, CA at the time). Look beyond the fuzz of the 4-track and the $20 used amp static and you'll find what is destined to be remembered as one of the definitive works of 20th century underground culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pavement makes muzak out of noise out of muzak.","review":"This album is the greatest.

This album captures (and pretty much created) the indie scene of the early to mid-late 90s and its influences can be seen abound. The songs on S+E are brilliant...they may be sloppy and incoherent...but they are brilliant and frankly just plain fun to listen to. The lyrics (some containing meaning and some pure gibberish) make a statement: put the music first. This is incredibly poigniant because the time period before this album came out was marked by so called \\"profound statements\\" in music that, after hearing the same messages on the radio over and over, become meaningless.

What a pity. I would have welcomed good arguments that proves this album is not a zeigeist defining one in the 90's pop music. Mentioning Matchbox 20 on this board shows the reviewer appreciate meager music that is highly produced and overtly comercialized. Please bear in mind that the Pavement's music greatly influenced the mainstream music from underground with no marketing or PR forces that accompany bands like Matchbox 20. And Santana is not the only real Latin music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe \\"the\\" album of the decade?","review":"The peak, for me, on this one is \\"No Life Singed Her.\\" It's the kind of song, like others on this album, that expresses what we can't express vocally (hence music). The strength of this album is the ability of Pavement to juxtapose calm lyrics and slashing, ripping guitar noise. In other words, taking the experiments of Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth and transforming them into gripping and deeply emotional sounds. It's impossible to play \\"Perfum-V\\" and \\"No Life Singed Her\\" loud enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Overrated","review":"Hailed by many as the album of the 90s, S&E is really just a dissonant hodgepodge of subpar musicianship and angsty, overrraught lyrics. It's easy to crown an album and ride a bandwagon, but as the domino effect of fans undulate into a bedlam of uninformed fans, the musical merit is obtusely recognized, and for the most part, unjustified. Regarded as a paternal album in the indie world, S&E is merely a slanted effort at a disenchanted work, rendering a beloved album that garnered immense praise for nothing. Steve Malkmus' drawling lyrics are the first exhumation of Lou Reed's lyrically potent delivery in the 90s. But Lou Reed invented his own style, and his sui generis recordings are still readily available. Try The Velvet Underground or The Pixies for real musical forerunners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Bielagus","review":"I bought this album for \\"Chesley's Little Wrists\\" but then was sorely disappointed.

Word is bond, know what I'm sayin'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"Usually the essential recordings are exactly that, but this album just sucks. Forget about clever lyrics and sonic guitar sounds, this is simply hard to listen to. Buy it if you're curious about how bad it is. I give this album 2 stars only because they managed to get signed.

Maybe the others aren't so bad, but this one really sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated for the sake of being an american band","review":"Don't take me wrong. Pavement is such a good band. They've got plenty of good stuff but most of it happens not to be in this album. Except for a couple of songs (Here, Zurich is Stained) S&E; is mediocre and misguided.Now, I imagine that some critics of some very well-known american magazines needed a band from their own country to hail as an all-time-best, so they could feel better when confronted to the fact that, during most of the 90s and early 00s, american music scene has been way poorer than the vibrant music scene in Europe, particularly in the UK.So these few critics blinded themselves of any real criteria when reviewing Pavement music and, carried away by the ideal of The American Band Of Their Youth that proved they were part of something important, ramdomly chose the band's first and worst album as their holy grial of american indie music.

This book has more action than any of the others. I hate to say it, but V.C. Andrew's writers repeat the same nonsense in each series. There's always a few nutballs running around in the family, one moment they are normal, or at least semi, and the next moment they are crazier than Ted Bundy. Of course we all knew that Austin and Rain were going to have a baby girl, V.C. Andrew's books aren't usually about boys.

The bones cards were helpful, although I later purchased the Barron's Anatomy Cards and found them to be more helpful (in color and include all body systems). The muscle cards were useless to me because they have each muscle isolated on its own card. Useless for a lab practical in which you have to identify muscles on a model - lying next to or underneath other muscles. It's too bad the author couldn't have included cards with all the muscles of a particular area together - muscles of the deep anterior forearm, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"-Not Real Pictures","review":"Well i was anticipating better pictures, along the lines of computer generated, kind of like what you see in a text book.

Calls to Imation tech support was no help, since the unsympathetic rep said their warranty does not cover physical damage. Terrific.You would think they would do impact testing on the device before releasing such a low-quality, shoddy product. Would definitely not recommend.

Past couple of years have been loving stride piano.This book is one of my favorites. Mind you, the selections require hard work. If you are an intermediate-levelpianist, this is too difficult. I started with Viper Drag around Halloween. It's a great one and all ofFats' works allow for lots of interpretation, esp.Viper. I have a fuzzy memory of an old video featuring a viperslinking around and then in middle section he meets a lady-friend-viper & they strut together. Programatic piece, it is. Yes, there are some editorial mishaps around which one can \\"cover\\". Break the left hand 10th or & do what you have to do to play and enjoy these. Fats wouldn't mind. I've checked variousrecordings of Fats playing some of these pieces and he never played them the same twice. The player just has to pick a tempo s/he can manage. This book will be very much enjoyed & played by a stride player.

Nobody likes the old croakers more than I do, but this one was mainly amusing himself.

But stating the conditions of the country that bad is sometimes quite far fetch. Most probably it is just to spice up the book for sales. Not all third world countries that bad for example getting away from problems with the law by bribing them. You may get in more trouble if you try to bribe the men in the uniform. That is the mentality of the first world countries. First world countries looking down at the third world countries. It is as if the people there aren't civilized yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adventure Travel in the Third World Hype","review":"The newest entry into self-pretentious bombastic absorption is the collaboration of promoters Mr. Randall, and Mr. Perrin. These two people seem to have come out of nowhere and presented themselves as the grandiloquence of third world travel.

It was an interestig book to read. I like how Mary Rodgers made the book exciting and hulirous. My favorite part of the book was whenthe mom and the girl changed bodys . The interesting thing that I like was when the girl was in her mom's body. She to go to school, because they were going to talk about Anabel.However, the book didn't have enough information. The author didn't explain things very well. I didn'tlike the ending. Overall, I liked the book very much. I would recommed this book to kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Your Freak Flag Fly","review":"Many more people have probably seen one of the three movie versions of Freaky Friday than have read the book.

Well now you don't have to wonder, you can know. This book tells the story of how a young girl Annabel Andrews becomes her mother for a day. Now she has the problem of finding her body with her mother inside of it, to turn them back. I didn't like Freaky friday, because it is the kind of book babies would read. It was boring. One bit I liked was when Annabel had to go and alk about herself to the school. I would recommend this novel for about 9 year olds. It is the kind of book parents could read to their kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Old Fashion","review":"I think that this book is bad. It is WAY to old.

I think, and this is just one opinion, the word \\"complete\\" in the title is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Vague","review":"I thought this book was too vague. I bought it in search of solid advice but was disappointed. For example, regarding whether or not to get the flu shot. Or for a specific brand for prenatal vitamins. No straight forward answer.I was behind shocked on pg 228 where they stated that schools do not allow kids that are not vaccinated, nor \\"most pediatrician.\\" WTF!!!! And that not vaccinating our kids is a public health concern.And, oh yeah, those personal stories ... not everyone can just put in new floors on a whim t/o their home! Just and idea of the budget one would have to do some of the things mentioned in this book.If you are already buying mostly/all organics in food and cleaning products, then you will not find much new here. For someone transitioning to this lifestyle, they may get more use out of this book.I am returning this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book hoping that it would provide realistic advice. Instead, the statements made in this book are unsubstantiated (the authors do not point to any scientific studies to back up their claims), and often directly contradict advice held by the mainstream medical community. My immediate reaction after reading this book 3 months into my pregnancy? The feeling that as a pregnant women living in a city, I am screwed no matter what I decide to do. If I decide to swim indoors for exercise to avoid exposure to air pollution which could result from running outside, well, that's a bad idea. If I decide to continue to work full time in an office environment, resulting in exposure to computers, printers, and copiers, that's a bad idea too.My advice is to steer clear of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was terrible / unrealistic!","review":"I was handed down this book from another pregnant mother. I agree with another poster that this book creates a culture of fear. I have been trying to buy organic when I can, such as milk, meat, cleaners and a few facial products, but I just cannot afford to buy everything organic, not to mention not everything organic is necessarily available where I live. This book is informative, but extremely over the top. I felt like it told you that everything in your house, your products, produce, etc. has toxins that can cause cancer. I took the book to my OB and she told me that regular produce is healthy, just make sure to wash them and to stop reading the book! If you can afford to replace everything you own, or to only buy organic, then you might like this book. If you are easily worried, then I would refrain from buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best!","review":"Rani Arbo has a voice like velvet. This is one of my alltime favorite albums.

As the title of this brief review states - I hope this lens is the only exception to Tamron's quality lenses.The cons: 1. Zooming ring is very stiff, so much so that it becomes a real problem; 2. Lack of sharpness, regardless of focusing mode. I shot a few hundred images with this lens and all looked too soft; 3. Most images came out darker or lighter than what you would've expected, regardless of WB or exposure settings. 4. Grainy pictures even in perfect shooting conditions. And lastly there was 0 pop to the images - even a picturesque scene would look dull and flat.This lens needs to be redesigned from the ground up IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"The book arrived very soon, within 3-4 working days and was in good condition as described with highlighting in yellow.

Hau'ofa spares no one--he skews expats, aid workers and his fellow Polynesians with equal glee. If you live in or have ever lived in the islands, you'll love this. If you want to learn what Polynesia is really like, this book is for you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Island Life - as seen by a Pacific Islander","review":"A fabulous collection of short stories that more or less piece together to create a fully formed humorous novella. The author spares no-one with his cruel wit and sharp eye for the details of some of the more outrageous aspects of colonialism in the troubled paradise that is the Pacific. The finger of fun is pointed at locals and expatriates alike but what is especially refreshing is that this time it is a Pacific islander that is doing the pointing and not some foppish Englishman (Somerset Maughan) or frazzled American (Paul Theroux). For too long it has been the expats writing about the locals and this book is a great step forward and should be an inspiration for local writers wherever they may be. And best of all, you suspect that most of what he writes about isn't that far from reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda predictable","review":"The preview of the movie was better than the movie.

It is well researched and has lots of historical information, but it is dry and somewhat repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature analysis and unresearched conclusions","review":"Ms Diane Ackerman is not ready yet to write on love and call it a natural history of love.She has put together what people say at cocktail parties and then gives it an aura with a little poetic prose.A 400 page book which pretends to be a treatise on love has no mention of the Kama Sutra!She has't obviously heard of Parvati, the Goddess of love.A reference to some obscure anthropological study doesn't make the book a serious study.I would call this a passable Cornel University term paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negatory.","review":"Just started Diane Ackerman's, _Natural History of Love_. I find it practically insufferable, but will give it a little more time, or will skip around some. The writing itself has nothing to commend it and the Western, late twentieth century, cultural/psycho-theraputic-ethno-centricity is uninteresting to the extreme.I've recently finished Alain de Botton's _On Love_, am reading Plato's _Phaedrus_, and thought this might be, uh, right up my alley.Negatory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true treasure & a staple of your library","review":"This book is amazing. If you haven't read Ackerman before, I suggest starting with _A Natural History of the Senses_. Then read this book. Ackerman is a very talented writer. Even if the subject isn't entirely interesting, her words and their rhythms are. This subject, however, is very interesting. Ackerman muses on myths (such as Dido) and history (such as Napoleon and Josephine), but also explores instincts and preferences (why women love horses and the influence of pheromones). This book is romantic, historical, sexual, poetic, challenging, and completely beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The history book your teacher won't let you read.","review":"A Natural History of Love is just that. A wonderfull collection of the past 3000 years of love. The interesting parts of this book are sometimes what you will learn about historical figures that you have read about in thier profession, but not in thier private life. The author is very well educated, and her education, flair, and soul is put into her writing. This book is for any history lover, or for any lover in general"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love through the ages...","review":"This book is not only a natural history of love, but also an important look at the psychological development of Western man. Ackerman doesn't really delve into Eastern or tribal love rites (only briefly and then simply by conjecture at the beginning). She does go in depth into the phenomina of Courtly Love. I particularly enjoyed a few Greek and Egyptian love poems written thousands of years ago. It makes one realize that even though technology advances, empires rise and fall, the fundimental nature or human psyche---particularly in regards to love, is a classic and timeless pursuit. This book made me want to love more deeply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curled forever.","review":"When we \\" tried\\" to put the line on our trolling rods/reels penn 301s.

It is not responsive and it is not accurate no matter how you change the settings for it.

This mouse will quickly be replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jitteriest wireless mouse ever!","review":"I recently bought this mouse as a package with the wireless Comfort Keyboard 4000. I should have listened to my inner voice which cautioned against Microsoft. This mouse jitters the cursor all over the place. Sometimes it moves quickly then stops then jumps again. It is especially frustrating when the cursor is close to where you want it and you move the mouse just a little and the cursor jumps past the desired position. New batters don't help. Changing the channel as per troubleshooting manual doesn't help. Changing the USB input as per the troubleshooting manual doesn't help. My son and his friends hate the keyboard for game playing and I hate it for frequently announcing poor signal strength although the receiver is only a foot away and new batteries and changing the USB input doesn't help. The Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse costing about half as much that I had before (disabled by a spilled soft drink) were far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this mouse!","review":"This mouse worked well for a couple of months but I began experiencing low battery signal messages, low signal quality messages (even though the receiver is less than a foot away and I replaced the batteries many times).

Having used the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse in the past, I expected a similar setup where the USB transmitter fits into the bottom of the mouse and saves space. No such luck. I now wish I had researched for a truly wireless mouse, 'coz this one just doesn't help.

Even with brand new batteries, the cursor movement doesn't sync well with mouse movement.- It gets lots of low signal warnings, even with new batteries.- The mouse feels uncomfortable and clumsy, I have to give my wrist a break every 20 minutes.- Feels like the mouse was designed and made by amateur engineers.- There is a huge wired receiver you plug into USB. So you actually have 2 mouses on your desk. But even with such a large receiver the signal sucks.- The generic mouse I've used at work for 3 years works better than this.- I am replacing this mouse 6 months after buying a new one, even though I wanted to replace it within the first month.- The middle mouse button doesn't respond well when I push it during gaming, so I can't use it and the button is wasted.PROS:- NONE, I hate this mouse and am angry I wasted money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy mouse losses signal pritty often","review":"I have been using this mouse for the past one week and i hate it already, the grip of the mouse is good but for moving the mouse you feel it is heavy becoz may be using 2 batteries but still it losses the signal and it won't work on any surface means on a cloth or on a sofa cloth i mean my prevoius optical mouse use to work on almost any surface this is kind of crazy with this mouse..... and most importantly i don't like the left side button the extra button will get clicked if you try to lift the mouse and when you are browsing something it goes to the back page...iam annoyed with this mouse and iam trying to get a new one..... if you want a lighter mouse which doesn't loss signal and which can be worked on any surface i do not do not suggest you this mouse ......... well the final decision is on you guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"It may have been a fluke, because Microsoft is generally a good company, but the thing never worked out of the box.

It just \\"feels\\" awful. I was thinking something was wrong with my PC so I hooked up another mouse. So I began doing a lot of troubleshooting. The problem was this piece of crap. It rarely responds to a click in one try, so you end up hammering away at the button with your finger like a woodpecker. Sometimes it moves the cursor when you move the mouse, sometimes it doesn't. Basically it makes everything you do more difficult.Buy ANYTHING else. It certainly couldn't be any worse. Even as I'm selecting the number of stars to give for the attributes this hunk of trash is making me hit the link over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately a Microsoft product","review":"There is no doubt this is a Microsoft product. It stops working for no apparent reason, and works again after you reboot the computer, which of course, has to be a hard shutdown as the mouse doesn't work. Somehow it also screws up any other mouse as it doesn't help to change mice or unplug and try to use my mouse touch pad as nothing works once it shuts down. I have needlessly replaced the batteries four times to make sure it wasn't them. Since it has an invisible laser, you can't tell if it simply shut down, died or what. The only cure has been to keep rebooting the computer which is, as we all know, very frustrating, especially since I can't save anything. I have been reading about 'sleep' problems and although I don't have the same symptoms, it does seem like it quits working when I leave and come back, giving it time to try to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"mouse","review":"The mouse seems to lose connection very easily.

Secondly, the scroll wheel only works with about half the software on my PC. I've ordered a non-microsoft mouse to replace it. Nothing I've read online seems to fix it. And the people who keep tinkering with your bluetooth signal and software: You are wasting your time. It's not bluetooth. That's why it isn't called a bluetooth device.

After trying every ambidextrous mouse I could find in the local electronics stores, this one was the most comfortable. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little tricky to pick up to shift position. I may scuff the lower edges to make picking up easier.Be aware it is a little taller than most mice and tends to hold your hand up a bit higher. I felt this was more comfortable than smaller lower mice. It fits my average male sized hand well.The left and right buttons are well placed and easy to hit with thumb and edge of ring finger.From closed box to customized buttons working for my left hand was just a few minutes, most of which was the time it took to load the software.Overall an excellent buy.

The right one requires a complete change in hand position to access, while the left one is too easy to accidently hit and make you go to the previous page. My biggest complaint about this item is since it is a wirelees mouse, I don't understand why the USB reciever hangs off of a 3 foot long cord. My other cordless mice all used a small USB Dongle that was only ablut 1.5 to 2 inches long. this one uses a reciever the size of the actual mouse attached to a 3 foot cord.I bought this with the intent of eliminating the wires, not adding to them.

The result is that both side buttons get activated at the same time. The same holds true for the sideways scrolling. When scrolling sideway you need to stabilize the mouse from moving sideways and you wind up hitting one of the side buttons at the same time.

Microsoft mice have usually been pretty good, but this one falls a bit short, I think.First of all, the right side button is completely inaccessible, unless you purchase a 3rd party flaming hoop and jump through it.The left side buttons are accessible, but not comfortably so.The biggest problem I've had with this mouse is it will periodically develop an electronic spasm when you try to move it, or it thinks the pointer arrow's active part isn't the tip any longer, but rather somewhere around the middle of the mouse arrow. On top of that, it takes three clicks of the mouse to accomplish one click while it is in this spastic mode (and no, this isn't battery related).I think Microsoft generally makes good mice.

Frequent signal failure. Cursor jumps. Sudden speed up. Worst thing is the scroll wheel. On both mice it got increasingly harder to turn, resulting in inadvertent clicks, data loss, and other problems. I thought the wheel was dirty, and discovered there is no way to actually open the mouse. Eventually the thing became completely unusable, and I pried the top and bottom apart, thus destroying it, but I didn't care about that anymore. To my surprise, the wheel was not dirty at all. However, what I discovered is the thin layer of lubricant that goes between the scroll wheel and its hub was viscous and sticky, and that was what made the wheel hard to turn. The lubricant, in other words, was some form of glue. So, big congratulations to the Microsoft engineers (and you know what else they make) for their thoughtful design. I'm out $100 on both rodents, and MS gets no more $$ from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly good mouse.... poorly designed receiver.","review":"Bought this to replace my ailing Logitech wireless laser mouse.

This is a known issue with newer Intellipoint versions and Microsoft does not seem to care.I uninstalled the software and the flicker went away. However... there is still a slight, but definite, delay when you push the middle button (scroll wheel)to pan. When you do this about every 10 seconds a half second delay is not acceptable. Again a known issue (Google it) and Microsoft doesn't seem to care.Long story short... CAD people don't buy! If you do you'll be glad it's wireless.

I know the story behind this movie well - have read and followed it sionce childhood. This movie does not remotely follow the historical events. It is a complete departure from history. This movie is also a hard-line feministic film that tries to take the original story and turn it into a father-daughter rape story - and this is complete fiction and a true shame to cast this conjured garbage about a historical event and real people.

Also, the changing from color to black and white again and again, while i get what it's supposed to represent (B&W being the point of view of the 'spirit'), was annoying and over-used. But, in the end, it all comes down to the terrible, all-tied-up-in-a-neat-little-bow ending that was a sorry excuse for an explanation for the hauntings.

No recommendation in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and confusing","review":"This movie really made no sense. First off, there is no haunting. Second, there's no witch. Third, if the incidents were caused by a poltergeist, (i.e., the girl herself) why in the world was she torturing herself at first and not the person she really wanted revenge on. And why would it take a year after the first \\"incident\\" for the poltergeist attacks to occur. The opening, with the modern girl running in the woods from something was way too long and set the tone of the film: a lot of cheesy quasi terror scenes that don't make much sense and end up being boring. I love haunted house stories, but this was not one of those. There are far better haunting stories on Discovery's \\"A Haunting\\" series. Why is it that big budget films always seem to have lousy lame scripts which the directors try to compensate for by overproduction?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It put me to sleep!","review":"I usually don't fall asleep during Horror movies but this one bored me to death.After reading The Bell Witch An American Haunting compiled by Brent Monahan,I realize they could have made it really scary.They took some lines verbatim from the book but they left out too much of the truly horrifying.The book put together by Brent Monahan is an old manuscript of the strange events witnessed by Richard Powell,the local school teacher at the time in Adams,Tennessee.Brent Monahan kept this transcript intact with no literary changes.It is exceptionally scary!Hopefully someone will remake the movie.I should have rented this one before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Ending","review":"Sad to see an American Folklore turned into a writers therapy session to deal with childhood trauma's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, this movie is terrible","review":"I'm sorry to tell you that this movie was completely disappointing and I walked away feeling stupider than when I started.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty forgettable...","review":"I liked the 1818 setting, but this movie just isn't worth watching multiple times. \\"An American Haunting\\" gives off that witchy-feel to it. It has a certain element of creepiness, except the thing is, it's not really scary. At all. It seems like some of the scenes where the invisible entity attacks the girl are trying to be as outrageous as the 1973 horror classic \\"The Exorcist\\". I didn't like how it shows the modern-day sequences, either. That was pretty cheesy and poorly acted. There are a few pros, but there are more cons. It was a poorly directed film. That's what I have to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd !","review":"We hated to see such great actors in this annoyingly filmed and absurd story....... based on a \\"true story\\".Well thats a weak use of the English Language since the Bell Ghost of Tennessee \\"legend\\" is yet another of those urban myths that has pretty much been determined to be yet another hoax of history like the Ammityville house and scores of other \\"true haunting\\" stories.Even as fiction it is repetitive and annoying with the \\"flying demon POV\\" angles that become comical more than haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Haunting","review":"I liked the movie a lot. The book of the accounts, however doesn't have much in common with this movie though. For instance the witch did pull the covers off Betsy, and slap her and pull her hair at first, same with John, but slowly she calmed down, and at times was friendly to them. Years and years of this supposedly. Also no where that I read ever mentioned the sexual abuse, although I suppose it tidied up the ending explanation wise neatly for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"The ending of this movie spoiled the movie beacuse it started of fairly well with some scary effects. Unfortunately, the movie exploits the Bell witch legend ONLY to make the claim that it was based on a true story. Whenever, Hollywood bases anything on a true story it ALWAYS means \\"We'll butcher the true story/legend to make a quick buck!\\"In the end of the movie the Bell witch says that she never cursed John Bell. The filmakers opted for a more ridiculous ending which did not even involve a real ghost. After all, how can an entity be a ghost if the person is still alive?To summarize, there's a witch that doesn't even cast a stone, much less a spell, a useless present-day story addon, and a schitzophrenic pseudo-ghost. The real legend of the Bell witch is scarier and more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAME to ALL involved with this TRIPE!","review":"For as long as I can remember I have known the legend of The Bell Witch; starting with my Mama reading it to me before I could even read myself.

The previous product (I found an old bottle during a move) kept my glass shower and tile clean and clear...the new formula however makes the shower glass streaky, there is now a white residue buildup on the tile that is not all soap, I think it is partially cleaner.

I would love for them to return to their original formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Formula not Good","review":"I wish I would have listened to the other more recent reviews about the new formula. I was able to tolerate the smell of ylang ylang with the old formula, it didn't smell too bad to me. At least it kept the shower clean. After starting with a clean shower of course. But this new formula not only smells bad (like a wet diaper) but it doesn't keep the shower clean. It's funny because everyday, I spray it on the shower, I'm hoping that it will smell better today. I gave it two starts because it does keep the silver chrome? part of the the shower nice and shiny but the rest looks dull and streaky. So disappointing...I have 7 bottles left. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't take the smell!","review":"I bought this stuff hoping to love it since it is supposed to be nontoxic and ecofriendly. I love daily shower cleaners but was always worrying about the chemicals. I do not see how something with such an overpowering smell as Method Daily Shower Cleaner can be good for you. Luckily I tried it first in my downstairs bathroom and not in the bathroom which is attached to my bedroom. I have had a headache since using it, have tried running the fan, running the shower and still it smells.

The smell is gross to me, and really lingers (all that hot steam), and after a while started to give me a headache. So I used it less and less, but then my shower was harder to clean. Yes, even spraying it every 3 days, and sparsely, helped with soap scum. But, my dog! that smell :-( For some reason I thought Method was specific to Target, and that this product was the only - not so! Duh. I found an Arm & Hammer version at Safeway - much better smell (kinda sweet and candy-like, and not great) and also works. I think there was another brand on the shelf which I will smell/try when I run out of my A&H. I DO like other Method products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New formula is awful!!! (October 3,2011)","review":"Have been using Method Daily shower spray for years and loved it. My last \\"subscribe and save\\" shipment arrived with new bottle design and a\\"new formula\\". This new formula is horrible. It leaves what looks like water streaks on all the surfaces in my shower. I hate it and now have 7 bottles of something that I will not use--not to mention being out what I paid for this shipment. I cannot believe that the company actually thought this was an improvement!! Did they not test it on some real showers??? Please bring back the old formula!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Other scent options, please!","review":"Love how it works.

It doesn't leave spots or residue and seems to fight some of the pink tint that hard water leaves on my white grout lines. The only thing I don't like about the Method shower spray is that it has a fairly heavy floral scent. I would prefer something lightly scented, or unscented.All in all...a great price on a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell is nauseating and gave me a headache","review":"I was eager to try this product because it is nontoxic and ecofriendly, but used it only once. My shower had been freshly cleaned, so I don't know whether it worked or not. I just know that the smell was so bad that I will not try it again. It left me feeling nauseous with a headache which is not how I want to feel fresh out of the shower.If you have even a slight sensitivy to smells, don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smell is overwhelming","review":"I generally love Method products, but the smell of this spray is just sickening. The only way I can stand to use it is if I spray the shower area, immediately leave the bathroom and shut the door (and make sure I've used the bathroom beforehand so I don't have to go in it for another couple of hours). The spray appears to *work* just fine, but the smell of it shouldn't be so noxious that I can't casually spray it on and do things in the bathroom at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff Works","review":"The smell is not very great, but after a timeyou get used to it.Good product, I will buy more."},{"rating":"1","title":"New formula stinks!","review":"I have been using this cleaner for a couple of years and loved it until I received my latest order.

The other product had a fume after spraying that my husband and I did not like. I am so glad that I found this at the Target store because this spray works as well, but doesn't have that chemical-based smell. After about a week of using this spray, quite a bit of the soap scum on the tub door was breaking down, and the bath tub floor remained dirt free. I have only been using this for a week now, but I'm already seeing the value of this product. My husband and I really like this alternative to cleaning the tub using elbow grease, and the added benefit is that we don't have to deal with that terrible fume. Thank goodness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well - if you like the smell","review":"I have been using this product for about 6 months now and it definitely works. I have glass shower doors that show every water spot if I don't wipe them down every time, and this product has been working very well on them. Simply spray and it cleans off scum with time. It does have a strong odor, which I happen to like. If you are sensitive to that sort of thing, I probably wouldn't recommend it. It would be nice if they came out with an unscented version some day. Or at least one that isn't quite as heavy. I usually run my bathroom vent after spraying it, which seems to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"PeeeUuuuuu! The new formula stinks","review":"We've been using this product for a couple of years now and really learned to love it. The ylang-ylang scent took us a while to get used to, but once we did we really liked it. (It's a strong scent and it reminded me of a spa we used to go to that used a lot of evergreen scents all around - a nice smell once you get used to it.) Anyway, we got our last shipment of 8 bottles a week or so ago and this new formula stinks - literally. I think it smells like old fish, my husband thinks it smells more industrial, but whatever it is, it's not good. I have to agree with the other reviewers that it also doesn't work as well. We cancelled our automatic shipments and will now look for something else. Bummer. We love method products in general, but the remaining 7 bottles will just go in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my shower door sticky, not clean","review":"I don't really like the smell of this product but I would deal with it as long as the product does a good job.

I'll sticky with my seventh generation products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know why people are complaining about the smell","review":"Because it smells great and it actually works.

I was very disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous stinky","review":"It seems like a good idea...an environmentally-friendly daily shower spray that saves you the work of scrubbing the yuck off of your shower. And maybe -- maybe -- with a less offensive odor this product might be worth it. I'm not sure if this stuff is what Ylang Ylang really is supposed to smell like, but after enthusiastically spraying my double-shower with Method Daily Shower Spray, what I've got is a bathroom that now smells like a tank of wet diapers steeped in a cubic yard of rotting gardenias. Unfortunately, this was after giving my daughter a bedtime shower, which means I'm periodically gagging as I check in on the bathroom to see if the stink has dissipated enough for me to get some sleep. Thank goodness my bathroom has both a window and a fan. I've also tried running the shower a few minutes to rinse the product away, but it hasn't helped yet. If they come out with an unscented version of this product, I'll give it another try, but this stinky one is going to be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"METHOD SHOWER CLAEANER","review":"IT'S WORKS REALLY GOOD AND SMELLS REALY GOOD IT'S ONE OF BETTER PRODUCTS I'VE TRYED, I WOULD TELL ANYBODY TO TRY THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"not received","review":"I ordered this product, but never received it--don't know what happened.

I've read almost all books on the West Coast punk/hardcore scene, from \\"Hardcore California\\" to \\"Make the Music Go Bang...\\".This book draws a rough but complete enough picture ofwhat went on. I especially liked that most interviewees were pretty open and their stories had a personal feeling and not a waxed, \\"glorious LA-punk scene\\" ambience.Some of the other reviews posted here state that the book does not contain enough information on the hardcore movement. This might be true, but this is a book on LA punk, not LA hardcore. LA hardcore came out of punk and I do think that this is something that the reader of \\"Neutron Bomb\\" can clearly understand. Appreciate this book for what it is and not for what you think it should be.\\"We Got the Neutron Bomb\\" serves both a historical and literary purpose very well and truly fills a gap for those who want to know more about the greatest punk scene ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As an important figure in the early LA punk scene, Brendan Mullen theoretically would have amounted to an ideal figure to recount its history. Alas, he and co-author Spitz fall short of the mark, though to be fair, this may have owed more to their publisher. What should have been colorful anecdotes are compressed into blips that barely make an impression. The lingering after-effect, on finishing this book, is that it follows too closely in format the superior \\"Please Kill Me,\\" which largely concerned the NYC punk scene -- and that in turn reflects poorly on the scene in LA, as if that, like this book, followed too closely the scene in NYC. Not true! The LA scene awaits a better recounting. But \\"Neutron Bomb,\\" although seriously lacking, it still a decent place to begin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated By Some...","review":"One thing that really comes through is that the people who put this \\"book\\" together are clearly jealous of the NYC punk scene, and the resultant book \\"Please Kill Me\\". They have reason to be: \\"Please Kill Me\\" is better edited and much more thorough...There are some great bands in here including X, the Runaways, Black Flag and Social Distortion, but their stories are glossed over, and told haphazardly--with a lot of the facts left out...That might've been (sort of) okay, but the book just isn't very entertaining. And, frankly, I felt ripped off....If the L.A. scene was indeed the equal of the NYC scene, this isn't the book that proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is Bomb","review":"This book was one of the great punk rock history books I've ever come across. I'm an avid reader of books that recall scene's and reading it in the way that Spitz and Mullen put it together was simply remarkable.The story flowed so smoothly with people who were actually THERE giving the story. Sure, a couple people weren't involved, but yu know what, the story is STILL told.

The History of Punk in LA! Man that sounded great. What I found was half the book was dedicated to the Glitz scene of the 70's. This book talked as much about disco and glitz as it did punk. I remember punk being hardcore, in your face agression coming from bands like TSOL, Black Flag, Fear, etc. These bands were covered as an afterthought. Instead I read all about how punk evolved from homosexuals and gay art. Gay art? Lots of coverage about Darby Crash but most focused on him being a closet homosexual. I was hoping for more info on the hardcore movement and reading about concerts at the Olympic Auditorium. Like I said, I was disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This is a pathetic book. Although the LA punk scene had undeniable impact, and its history was certainly worth writing, this book makes a deservice when it attempts to undermine all the importance of New York's punk scene to overrate LA' scene.

Determined to experience the black experience in all of its glory, he heads to Harlem where he reinvents himself as Malik, an around the way boy. He boards with socialite Carmen England, a woman who seemingly knows all the right people. Continuing his facade with the friends he makes and with Carmen, he is forced to make a decision about who he is when he meets Kyra, the daughter of a well-to-do family.Brian Keith Jackson unravels Mason's story through admirable prose. The Queen of Harlem is embedded with lessons about finding oneself and about the masks people sometimes hide behind.

The story will keep you turning the pages until you get to the end. And what an ending ... I was stunned. I had to read it again. Jackson's use of similes was great.

Not one with Christmas songs, but rather, actual songs about the Winter Solstice: the dark season, the return of the light, and the winter season. This is it! It is perfect! The songs have a wonderful earthy feel to them; they really get you in the mood for enjoying the winter season. The album has lots of songs on it, so you really get your money's worth and the songs have lots of variation and interest to them. There are some spoken words throughout that really help set an overall tone of reverence and enjoyment of the season. I love this CD and it will become an auditory staple in this Humanist/Pagan household every time the wheel turns to the dark time of the year! Thank you so much to the artists for creating such a wonderful work of musical art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Samples PLease.","review":"I'd be nice if this album had audio samples to listen to before buying.If someone would put them on the page it be appreciated.Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Elizabethan Romance","review":"I ordered this book because of my interest in all things Elizabeth Tudor. She only ended up playing a minor role, but the author does a good job writing an interesting story; I finished it in less than two hours, so it certainly held my attention. The heroine was an admirable one-- strong and interesting-- but I'd say the hero was a bit weak. I was fine with the Cinderella-esque mould, with a likeable heroine trapped with a vindictive stepsister and stepmother. I'd say once Sybil made her big gesture of vengeance, however, the book took a downward turn. I was not so inclined to buy Curran's change of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Victorian Encyclopedia","review":"I bought this encyclopedia when I got older and started realizing everything that I truly loved was Victorian in style.This is a great read. You can flip open to any page and learn something interesting and/or awesome.

And 2) there's not really any pictures, which kind of bummed me out. It's a great book as it is, but with pictures, it could've taken over mankind!All in all, if you're thinking about buying this book, but aren't sure whether to put it in your cart or just in your wishlist, definitely put it in your cart!

Fairly light weight plastic handles do feel a touch flimsy and the blades themselves are not incredibly sharp, but again for the novice or otherwise non-professional chef these are hardly concerns - certainly given the price point. If your concern is durability I would likely look elsewhere; indeed the knives themselves do their job and no problems have yet arisen however they do occasionally feel (as well as look) relatively cheap. The only other minor complaint would be the sort of unnecessary items that come with it. While it is great to find a set of knives with a 10\\" chef knife, cleaver, and what could otherwise be described a machete - I certainly did not need the included potato peeler.

It holds her attention & doesn't have anything that makes me worry about her seeing it.To me it falls short of the best Sesame Street DVDs for early watchers. The song writing isn't quite as strong. Too many have Big Bird as their subject matter. The audio on 3-4 songs is sub-par -- distorted from the level being too high or poorly mixed for depth. A surround sound system has to be set to \\"music\\" instead of \\"movie\\" or the sound is really flat. The vocals on the country style Wheels on my Feet sound like city-folk playing ya-hoo country. (the great Wavin' Goodbye To You With My Heart on Sing Yourself Silly shows how well the Sesame Street crew can do this style). This reads like harsh treatment, but I think the DVD is a notch below the best or even what they could have done with the chosen songs.[review edited from first version]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This dvd is great.

This book was so highly rated, I assumed that it was bound to get better, even though it started off as dull as can be. But apart from a few insightful paragraphs on the nature of the Kingdom of God, I was utterly disappointed. I'm not saying the man is a fool, but I am saying this book is not for everybody. If you don't enjoy the first few pages, be warned, it does not get better. And some of the assumptions made will not be appreciated by fundamentalists, conservatives, evangelicals or even moderates (for example, the impossibility of miracles).This book is heavy reading, for those who enjoy liberal academic theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough, Comprehensive, Relevant, Excellent!","review":"Hans Kung writes as one thoroughly committed to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. However, unlike some Christian writers, Kung writes with an intellectual depth and honesty that is refreshing. Kung does not shy away from bringing the Christian message into a living dialogue with modern scholarship, the other world religions, and the real challenges facing the human race today. I take issue with his sometimes-unconditional acceptance of higher Biblical criticism. However, as a Christian, I contend that Kung provides a true, relevant, and comprehensive analysis of the Christian faith for our time. A must-read for any serious theologian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Küng gives the Christian faith some modern zeal","review":"Küng is an amazing author and his perspective is quite envigorating. I came across this book during a time in my life when I was about to give up my Christian faith. It brought me into a fresh, living perspective and out of narrow fundamentalism once and for all. Though in his examination of Jesus' time, he tends to be too stereotypical in typecasting groups in the Jesus' time, it is an amazing paradigm to view Jesus from. I would criticize the overly eschatalogical vision he has of Jesus that he seems to get from Schweitzer. Lastly, his understanding of being a Christian as being radically human is beautiful and moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST LIKE YOU WERE IN THIS MAGICAL LAND. .","review":"ITS AMAZING THE PICTURE DR RAMPA CAN PAINT WITH A PEN. . .The story told is so life like that you can almostimagine you were in Tibet experiencing adventure with the authorI first read THE THIRD EYE by Rampa about l5 years ago and I've been searching for other works by him ever since...and now I've found one I really like even better than THE THIRD EYE.In addition to the story itself another thing I liked about this edition of a long out of print book was its large, easy to read, type.

The problem is that it is a really tight mechanism. If there was a spring (there is not) it would be too strong.The cage is enough for 2 teaspoons of loose leaf tea, which is usually fine, but if you ever want to serve more than 2.5 coffee mugs of tea you have to do the whole thing more than once.The rim bent the first time I opened it. I didn't even touch the rim. Fortunately, you can bend it back fairly easily.Overall, it does the job it claims to do. The cage has very fine holes which is definitely good.

Makes it very easy to enjoy loose leaf teas without the hassle.The trick is to use it like a scoop/spoon and make sure no bits of tea leaves are left on the surfaces that end up clamping together when they close. Otherwise, the thing doesn't seal all the way, and lots of bits of tea leak out. But as long as you make sure it closes right, this thing is great.You sometimes still get a little bit of leakage through the mesh with finer teas, but not enough to really be bothersome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I ordered two of these and one of them broke with the first use.

This is a little harder to get closed without stray tea leaves holding it open a little bit. It also leaves more tea particles in the cup than the other style does.It has a tenancy to bend a little bit pretty easily so that you have to bend it back to get the top and bottom circles to meet up with each other.Isn't horrible, but there are better choices out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tea ball","review":"I've been using this tea ball for a year now. It sits in cups of tea all day every day and there are no signs of rusting or joint loosening and it still has a nice tight seal to keep the tea inside.

Ugh, just such a hassle and poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as well as I hoped","review":"For a cheapy, it performs the job it was intended to. However, this product has two major flaws. First, it requires a uncomfortably forceful squeeze to open. Second, since it will not lock into an open position, liquid will stand in the rim of the ball and cause it to rust. If you're willing to dry it after you wash it, and you have decent strength in your hands; then this will work fine for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective, for less money than the ones at the store","review":"I like this infuser. I think it really does the job for a great price. The ones at the supermarket are double or triple, and work the same. I think this is good value for the money. If you want something more sophisticated as perhaps a tea connoisseur would, buy something more expensive, but for basic use to have a cup of tea in the morning, it's really good. I drink all sorts of tea very often, it's a staple drink in my house, and I look the taste of loose leaf teas. This lets me enjoy that.

That Spanish Fly drug was laughable (and I don't mean that in a complimentary way)--the story utterly forgettable.I am deeply resentful. Some of these authors are praised to beat the band, but they don't have the books to back up this praise.This book had no plot. It was just an excuse for the characters to have sex, sex, sex.

They have turned out to be a pretty good item though. I can usually get through cleaning one gun with just one patch and a rag. The design of the patch allows you to attach it to your cleaning tool and adjust it to fit the bore pretty easily. When one part of the patch gets dirty just reattach in a different hole and there is more clean areas of the patch to use. I also flip the patch over to use the other side of it as well. I've used other thinner patches but end up using a whole lot more of them because they are not as substantial as the Otis ones. Overall, I would say these patches are worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well.","review":"I give this product 5 stars because it performs flawlessly. I have been using Otis cleaning products for about a year now and these patches meet all my expectations. When coupled with the Otis bore solvent and brushes I can get my barrels spotless with only a few patches, maximum,I really enjoy that one patch can be used six times. This product even comes in a clear plastic, reclosable container that can be reused afterwards.I recommend these to anyone who asks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced standard patches with holes poked in them","review":"After receiving these I see that they are nothing more than regular old cleaning patches (that can be purchased for much less) with small holes cut in them.

The folks at Cameta Camera always have great deals, and everything I buy from them is as advertised, plus the transactions are always fast and smooth. I would definitely recommend this lens if you're on a budget (as most of us are). Truly, the image quality I've come away with from this lens far surpasses the stigma placed on low priced glass.

It arrived as promised, packaged well, but upon inspection there was a visible defect on the interior of the lens glass. No amount of cleaning could get rid of it. No problem - I sent for a replacement. Because of Amazon's return process it was easy to send the first one back and order another (the only reason I gave it one star). The second one was on our doorstep within four days. Again, package intact, but a very similiar situation with the second one except this \\"smudge\\" on the inside was longer - almost all the way across the lens. I also returned the second lens and got a full refund with no problems. I bought the Tamron based on the reviews, but there are obviously some quality control issues. I'm looking at the Sony or Sigma badged lenses now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for our Nikon D3100","review":"I'm an amateur when it comes to cameras, and I bought this lens based on the reviews I read here on Amazon. We recently bought a Nikon D3100 Digital SLR camera that came with an 18-35 mm lens, but quickly realized we needed a bigger lens for bird watching, and our children's sports and other activities.This Tamron 70-300 mm Zoom lens works perfectly with our camera, and takes amazing photos. It is quick to autofocus, and takes clear photos even from far away. The only complaint I have is that the motor is a little loud, which can scare wildlife, and sometimes the lens wants to focus on items other than what you're trying to photograph.I'm still learning about my camera and this lens, but overall I am very pleased with the way the lens works and especially with the price. I would certainly buy it again if I were shopping for a zoom lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use","review":"I bought this to use with my Pentax K20D dslr camera.

The pictures turned out perfect,it was like I was right next to them. I have had a manual slr camera in the past and used a 500mm lens, the lens bulky and heavy this lens is lightweight and easy to use.I would recommend this lens to anyone one who likes to get close-up and personal to their subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value in this updated design.","review":"The new Di lenses from Tamron are designed to work well with digital cameras, although those with the Di will work for 35mm as well (Di-II only work with smaller, APS-C chip size digital cameras). This is an improvement on the fine 70-300 LD (Low Dispersion glass) design. The major improvements in this lens are in the coatings, to help reduce any color bias, and minimize reflections. Additionally, lens manufacturers are doing more inside the barrels to reduce reflections.Like the older LD design, the new lens has a close-up mode (not strictly \\"macro\\") position that allows images 1/2 lifesize on the negative. That's about twice the size of most 300mm zooms lacking this feature.If you're buying this for one of the new Sony Alpha series, this might be your best bet. The Tamron will include a 6-year USA warranty. It also includes the lens hood. The Sony 75-300 is repackaging of the older Konica-Minolta 75-300 lens, a lens that hit the market before any KM digital SLRs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value in this updated design.","review":"The new Di lenses from Tamron are designed to work well with digital cameras, although those with the Di will work for 35mm as well (Di-II only work with smaller, APS-C chip size digital cameras).

Try to focus...and it wont, either manually or autofocus. Built cheaply as well. Should have known better. First time I have ever bought a cheap lens. As they say...you get what you pay for. Well, this one I really did get what I paid for. I cannot recommend this to anyone. And yes...I have used Canon EOS cameras and lenses for 25 years or so. I had one of their first EOS-1 film cameras.

Fully extended this thing is huge! It works well at capturing those long distance natures shots, yet they can tend to be very grainy at a full zoom. I have also noticed a bit of \\"purple fringing\\" on high contrast shots as well. The price alone makes it a great buy for someone starting out with Dslr photography, I know it has helped me. I would like to see a lower F stop at this price point but I know that is asking a bit much. The macro feature on the lense however works amazing. I took several pictures in a natural outdoor light of things around the yard and had to take a second look at what the closeup was! It got THAT close to the object."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it for the price and quality","review":"I was reluctant at first to buy this lens.

Generally I don't listen to what everyone has to say... I should have. This lens is not even close to Nikon quality...Duh! Still for $200 I thought it would fit my budget and photography skill. It is noisy and it takes longer to adjust with the auto focus on. I think I should have practiced more on some \\"not so important\\" shots first before relying on it for a special event. The lens adapter shown on the advertisement was junk. Very misleading. Now I'm stuck with a lens that's noisy and generally stays out of focus for even slow moving shots. I suppose that is why lens cost $500+ for quality and a piece of mind. I already have a 200mm but thought this might get me a little closer to the action. It only got me closer to an empty wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like purple fringe, buy this!","review":"I like the macro portion of this lens.

I would not recommend this lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky and Soft","review":"Bought this for my son as a backup to his Sony 75-300 that has become difficult to zoom because of a dirty environment. He uses it for rodeo photography with his old Alpha 100. Has been a good business for 5 years but dirt is a problem and most shops don't want to clean a Sony lens. The Sony is still working fine but is harder to zoom because of built up dust.Thought we would take a chance on this lens and just replace it every couple of years because of the dust. Reviews looked OK but the Tamron lens doesn't work for us.Compared even to the (used gummy) Sony lens it was sticky and especially hard to zoom near the 300mm range. This may be OK for still nature shots but it kills fast moving sports action shots when you have to make the camera twitch to zoom in. Also compared to the modest Sony 70-300 the Tamron 70-300 was noticeably softer in the same shooting conditions. I would gauge it at about 30% softer.We returned it. Wish it would have been more serviceable."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAMRON AF 70-300mm","review":"Am very pleased with the lens and the speed of delivery.

These are great lenses that I would have died for way back in the 1960s when I first started in photography. I have to laugh when I hear some people complain about one thing or another about this lens.

It's alright for shooting still shots, but certainly not any moving ones. The lens focuses VERY slowly and often has trouble detecting contrast. It gets totally lost and then the only way to recover it is by fixing it on manual focus. I have used the canon equivalent and had a much better experience with that one. I would not buy this lens if you are planning to be a professional photographer. It isn't reliable enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This item was just what I was looking for. Works great with my girlfriends camera. She absolutely loves it. Stock lens just wasn't good enough. Packaged nicely and came early."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful chromatic abberation","review":"As they say, you get what you pay for. This is true for lenses. The chromatic abberation on this lens is very bad, to the point where it ruins the shot, as it is very difficult to remove even with Photoshop/Lightroom. There is chromatic abberation throughout the range and view, even in the very middle. I know it is a cheap lens, but this one aspect of it makes it not worth it for me at least. The sharpness is about average. Focus is loud and slow. The construction quality is very cheap. Even though there is very little, if any, barrel creep (lens extending under its own weight), as it is very light, the barrel is very choppy - it does not rotate smoothly. The switches have a very tacky and cheap feeling. I would recommend pitching in more and avoiding this lens, or getting a legacy Minolta on eBay."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this lens","review":"With the rotating front lens when you focus the use of a polarizing filter is a 3 step process. I like this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not perfect","review":"I got this lens because I do a lot of bird photography, and the difference between a 200 mm telephoto and a 300 mm is significant. Overall, the quality is excellent. My only problem - which doesn't matter much in my shooting - is that the actual racking out of the lens is not as smooth as you get from the \\"brand\\" specific lenses. There is a slight catch around 180-200 mm that keeps it from being totally smooth. Pictures taken across the entire range look fine, no distortion, and enlargements are sharp. I was limited on how much I could spend, and this lens came in on the low end of that, which makes it great for my purposes. If you are zooming while shooting and that is critical, this may not be for you, but if like me you set and then shoot, this is a great lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargin, great lens.","review":"Couldn't resist the price. I have no regrets about buying this. That being said, it is a great lens for someone with a steady hand. I think that the next lens I buy, I will opt for the VC and USM. Just a personal preference. But I still love this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dual function lens","review":"I wanted a new macro and telephoto lens for my Sony Alpha 100 but couldn't afford to buy both. But with this lens, a flip of the switch allows you to take some very nice close-up shots and the telephoto focus is very clear for a 300mm. I am very pleased with the performance and the price. I will try other Tamron lens now that I have seen what this one is capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lens @ low price for beginners","review":"I did go through a lot of reviews of this lens specially the negative ones. However as a beginner I felt the minute details the reviewers were considering was hardly a concern for beginners like me. Moreover a good lens to put into use for learning telephotography and macro mode before delving into the high class lenses which are way too costly...It does autofocus with my Nikon D5100 which makes it even more special at this low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap for a REASON","review":"I bought this lens as a hobby piece for when I am at football games or just casually shooting (I have a Canon 40d). After less than a month, the auto focus began grinding, and eventually stopped working completely. I returned it and got another..... BAD DECISION! Same problem in only a couple of weeks. In my opinion, if you want a casual telephoto photography, or just want to break away from your 18-55, go with the canon 55-250 IS. I have it now and it is a much Sharper, and better built lens. I hope this helps you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"The lens has absolutely terrible purple fringing, the worst I've ever seen. Fairly soft focus as well. For the price it isn't bad I suppose, but I'd look at other offerings such as the Sigma...I have no experience with the Sigma but am tempted to order it and sell this one. This lens is usable, it does focus with a D40 and is very inexpensive, but not sharp enough for me nor can I accept the purple fringing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens for the price","review":"I ordered this lens so that I could take zoom photos at airshows and also try to catch those wily hummingbirds on the fly.It is a decent lens. It doens't focus very quickly - and at times has trouble finding what you want - as many of these new, less expensive lenses do. It's also far louder than the nikon lenses.I am happy with it - and would recommend it for amateurs and more - not a pro-level lens though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!!!","review":"For what you pay you get a great value. This lens was purchased to replace my Pentax 100-300mm which broke. This lens is far superior. I am using this lens as a stop-gap/learning tool until I can both afford and justify getting something more high end.This lens does like a lot of light and will cast a shadow using the built in flash, especially with the lens hood attached. The macro function works well. I have coupled it with close-up filters and gotten good results.I would have only given this a 3 star compared to some of the other lenses I use but when you factor in the price, it goes to 5. You will be pleased with this piece of glass as long you remember that it is not pro-grade. Nor was it intended to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens for the price","review":"I found this to be a very good lens for the amount of money I paid.

Lots and lots of aviation pics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lens on a budget","review":"Bought this lens for my Canon Digital Rebel XTi. Works very well and generally happy with it. It is NOT an IS lens so low light shots or tight zoom photography defininitely requires a tripod. Very good results in bright daylight but if you don't have a rock solid steady hand you might want to consider an IS lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than O.K.","review":"This is a well built lens with less than ideal performance. From time to time it will surprise you with an acceptible picture (close to very good) but never great. With bright light, a tripod and a frozen bird you may get a great picture. I will continue to use and study this lens but it will not be my primary 300mm telephoto. The Canon IS 300mm will be in my bag. It's o.k. to use this lens to learn camera and lens technique and develope good photography habits. But if you can afford the Canon 70mm-300mm with IS get that instead.Update: After using this lens for several months now, I would like adjust my previous rating of this lens. Perhaps I have developed better lens and camera habits and techniques..... you think. My pictures quality has drasticly improved with this lens. If this lens had IS or VC I would rate a 5 star.

I like it and so should you, I thought after buying this lens that it would be practical to try it out for $144.00 before shelling out $550.00 for the canon, looks like I'm not I'm happy with this lens Tamaron did the job right on this one.

Tamron AF 70-300m is a good tool for those who are looking for inexpensive but powerful lens to do portrait pictures. I successfully used this lens to shoot a fashion show of my daughter. I was unable sit close to the stage but 2x zoom of Tamron AF 70-300m makes possible to do good pictures. The lens quite heavy and you need to consider to have a tripod or use something to support your camera. The quality of the pictures under low light conditions was unacceptable and one need to use a powerful flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am loving it","review":"Great product given the price. Can take pictures in a crowd without being noticed or distrubing the rythm of the audience. Its a good buy for an amateur photographer like myself.

It's not a professional piece of equipment, but damn close to it considering the incredibly low price. A great lens to learn with and have fun with while also providing the opportunity for some intriguing and very good photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good value","review":"For the money, this is a very good lens. I took some really good images with this lens. Eventually, I did upgrade to the Pentax 55-300 but that's not disparaging this lens. It is a very nice entry level supper telelphoto zoom. Living in the Seattle area, I needed a weather resistant lens to go with my weather resistant camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for money big zoom","review":"I have owned this lens for about 3 years. It's been an excellent choice. I got it for an unrepeatable bargain price too. Combined with my trusty K100D, it has enabled me to take some amazing wildlife shots, as well as fantastic airshow pictures. The adverse comments about image quality are not borne out by my own experience. This is a great piece of kit for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens for the price","review":"So far I've liked it. Been highly useful at sporting events. Taking wildlife with the macro has been great. My only complaint is it's a little stiff when rotating to zoom or zoom out. Overall I'm satisfied for the price I got it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is absolutely the best lens you can get for the price! Nothing else even comes close to matching. It works perfectly with my Nikon d3100. The other day I almost got pictures of two bald eagles attacking a seagull... the lens zoomed in great and saw them, unfortunately my dumb self forgot to put in an SD card. But the lens is AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamron AF 70-300 lens from Amazon","review":"Great lens for the price. Photos are crisp and clear however at the end of the focal length of the lens camera needs to be mounted to get clear shots as there is no vibration reduction and shots at or near 300 mm are easily blurred. The macro settings allow for great diversity in shooting. The gap between the 35mm - 55mm lens and the 70mm- 300mm is significant in that for normal shooting of vacation type photos will require numerous lens changes. I have a 55mm to 300mm Nikon lens that solves the problem. In comparing the clarity and ease of use of this lens with the Nikon lens for the price I do not see a great deal of difference. The Nikon lens does not have the macro settings while the Tamron does not have VR. It all tends to be a tradeoff. I use both lenses frequently and they are excellent for the photos they are designed to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of zoom, but make sure you have the room","review":"I bought this lens to go with my Tamron DI 17-35mm lens, and have been impressed by both so far. I was contemplating a 50-200mm lens that had a shorter barrel, but opted for this one instead. It's got 50% more reach to get some great shots. Plus, it has a true macro function, where-as other lenses in this range only mimic macro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the price","review":"I read a lot of criticism on motor noise but have to ask what does that matter if you are not taking video where it might be heard. I know I like the macro and enjoy the added distance for taking photos, I am still getting use to the lens though so will probably update this again later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful light-weight zoom & great value","review":"I picked up this lens a few years ago when I went digital and switched from Minolta SLRs to Canon. For the price, and for a nice outdoor/daylight lens, it's hard to beat. If you expect to take low-light photos with this hand-held, you will be disappointed. But I needed a lightweight lens to be carried around outdoors, and I don't really have to worry all that much about dinging it up. It's tack sharp, holding up to some of my more expensive Canon glass. I can even hand-hold it at 300mm at 1/100 sec without much worry (better at 1/250), and my upper-body strength is probably average for a female photographer.As I said, if you're looking for a low-light lens, this is not it. It is slowish, but especially in low-light. The macro option is nice, but the switch can be hard to turn on and off without taking it off my camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tamron AF 70-300mm for my Nikon d5100 is awesome!","review":"I am a novice in the field of photography so I need all the help I can get. I did the online research and determined the Tamron AF 70-300mm for my Nikon would be the best option for my skills and budget. I absolutely love the ease of use and the exceptional quality of the photographs. In only a few weeks I've taken thousands of great shots while camping and hiking. It has made me look at nature in a whole new way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent value and very good quality","review":"PROS:* Very good image quality for the price* Manual focus is easy to useCONS:* All controls are still (maybe they'll loosen with use)* Can't switch out of Macro zoom level until focus is beyond ~1 meter* Front of lens barrel rotates with focus - harder to use polarize or half-high filters* Focus motor is slow* Focus motor is LOUD (compared to Nikon's)All told, even though numerically there are more Cons than Pros, in terms of usability and quality, the Pros far outweigh the Cons. The only reason to not get this lens if you're looking for a 70-300 AF-S lens is if you can afford or are willing to spend three times as much for the Nikon 70-300 VR lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got this for D40x , too much CA","review":"I waited a whole week with anticipation for this lens. Now after trying for 2 days I'm very disappointed.I have a Sigma 70-300 for my D70 (which works great) but can't work with my D40x so I ordered the Tamron because I heard it was pretty good. It shoots far and is about the same softness as the Sigma and would be a great lens but the CA (color fringing) is terrible. I live near the ocean and take lots of photos of ocean activities, surfing, canoe races etc. Purple color fringing was a big problem. Had to use photoshop to remove it, too much work.I have owned Tamron lenses in the past with film SLRs and they were wonderful, but not this one.Would I recommend this to anyone? Only if they can't or don't want to spend the money for the Nikon 70-300mm. I wish that I would have gotten the Nikon or Sigma with HSM.

As an adult, I couldn't help but look up Mr. Paul's masterpiece here on Amazon. Delivery day was a treat, and as I flipped through the pages, I could vividly remember why I was so excited about paleontology when I was a kid. The illustrations are top notch (the best in the field, IMHO), and the science is solid (though a bit dense for youngsters). When I have children of my own, I hope they'll appreciate how lucky they are to have this resource available to satiate their probable paleo-madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Excellent, informed and documented piece of work. Illustrations are as informative as they are entertaining, and Dr. Paul's background and bibliography is an exhaustive list of where to go to be respected and informed in the paleontology world. This book, combined with Rex Appeal by Peter Larsen are all you need to learn all you'd want about predatory dinosaurs of Mesozoic times. Was an excellent source, along with Rex Appeal and personal interviews with the late Jim Madsen, for the creation of my own book, Allosaurus Modernis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book, if you can find it...","review":"Someone mentioned to me that this book was out of print. It was hard to believe, but it seems to be true. Slightly outdated now, this remains one of the best books I've ever seen on the subject. It includes everything from detailed dimensions, distributions, and timelines of the carnivores to Greg Paul's acclaimed technical drawings of the skeletons. This, incidentally, is one of the books Crichton drew from in writing Jurassic Park. The worst of it is, Paul had intended to write a series of volumes, moving from predators to sauropods, ceratopsians, stegosaurs, hadrosaurs, etc. That was ten years ago. I'm hoping that he'll eventually continue the series, creating a complete encyclopaedia of technical, yet easily read books. If you can track this one down, you'll be pleased with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Dinosaur Book for both Beginners and Professionals","review":"Predatory Dinosaurs of the World is an excellent for anybody who has an interest in dinosaurs and art. It is lavishly illustrated and is a good source for dinosaur facts.Some of the ideas are out of date and Paul has since changed his views. And some of the ideas are still considered controversial. But all in all it is a very good, interesting book for pros and amateurs. It meets all of the critera for a good book with its illustrations, information, funness to read and references. A must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the serious dinosaur enthusiast","review":"Never before have I read such a comprehensive study of dinosaur anatomy and behavior as was compiled for this book. Where most books (even Bakker's _The Dinosaur Heresies_) on serious dinosaur studies borrow from the past to complete a picture of the present theories of dinosaurs, Paul literally threw everything out the window and started from scratch to put together new theories of lines of evolution, dinosaur locomotion, and even going so far as to build a completely new system of taxonomy for the great beasts. Some of his thoughts are sadly mistaken, but the rest of this book is such a gem that it should be on all paleontologist's shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gray - Stll the man","review":"David Gray was the 'next big thing' when this debut was released in 1993, and at the time was given glowing reviews by all who listened.The album 'A Century Ends' is quite simply a masterpiece, and more impressive since its a debut.

Every song manages to be filled with poetry, emotion and intensity that strengthen upon repeated listenings. He himself claimed that he went into the studio and simply \\"sang his head off\\", and that raw consistent energy is evident throughout. (In many ways it is grounded in the same spirit as Van Morrison's \\"Astral Weeks\\"). The beauty of David Gray's songs are that they feel as though he is singing them directly to you each time. One of my all time favourite albums from one of my favourite artists. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely compelling","review":"This, David's first album, is an excellent introduction to his unique brand of folk rock. However, as good as the album is, the tracks are 10 times better heard live from the man himself. One of the best live acts I know, and (luckily) a frequent visitor to these shores.

The real downside is that these super aliens use conventional weapons; no lasers or special bombs. The movie is mostly gun play.

To say this book was kind of unhelpful would be like saying a PI is kind of slow - if you catch my drift. When it comes to going into mind-numbing detail over useless minutia, I've got to hand it to Scott Mueller.

The chocolate flavor is almost like melted fudge ice cream, even when blended with water. I have a calorie requirement where 1 bag of this product is great for breakfast but other suggestions to use half the product are great also. You'll get half as many calories and protien, but your product will last twice as long.I like this product so much (losing 10lbs, not water weight so far) on my journey to get back to slim that I've subscribed to receive a variety pack every 60 days (of 60 pieces) at a discounted rate.

We purchased it as our big \\"Santa\\" gift to my daughter for Christmas. It arrived quickly and was extremely easy to put together.

It is definitely a toy and sound like one. Overall, though, we're happy with our purchase.Update....we had twin boys last year. This toy is the first thing the (now) one year-olds want to see when they wake up and run in the play room. They love banging on it and making \\"music\\" and the keys are not too loud as to drive everyone crazy. It is apparently sturdy enough to handle the delightful hammering of two small boys. We still love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed Mom","review":"I was so excited when my son received this as a birthday gift and he loves to sit and bang on it for a few minutes at a time. But when I tried to play some of the songs for him from the Songbook, I couldn't even recognize the songs half the time because the piano is so off key. Particularly the E. I was further disappointed with the songbook because it doesn't feature notes, just large color circles with the letter of the key in the middle that don't quite fit over the staff, so if you are interested in your child learning to read music, this will not be very useful. We are not planning to keep the piano, I'm just looking for a replacement (perhaps a keyboard) so that I can make the switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be recalled","review":"My 2-year old daughter wanted this for Christmas so we got it from a local store -in the box, never saw it out on the floor. What a mistake! It sounds terrible! It is so off-tune one wonders if the makers had ever heard a piano before. ALSO, the construction is crap. Screw-in legs for a top-heavy thing like this... they NEVER stay tightened. I'm always expecting it to come crashing down when she's playing it - which is rarely.

This piano is very cute, but we cannot get pass the AWFUL sound. The sound resembles that of a piano, but thats as close as it gets. If we had to do it again, we would not purchase this item.

It's written by a parent educator who is obviously a loving mother, too. I found the ideas to be realistic and do-able. Kid Cooperation is also fun to read - It made me laugh and cry, and helped me understand myself. Do yourself a favor and buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It's about obedience, not about cooperation. It gives tips how to make kids obey your rules. The author is against spanking and yelling, but it's OK for she to use your authority over kids to force them to obey you She mostly recommends technics of punishments and rewards, although she mentioned such things like Natural Consequences, Anger Management, Active Listening, and such.

I want good, sound advice from someone who knows that no kid or parent is ALWAYS perfect.The first turn-off for me in this book was a \\"quiz\\" that's supposed to tell you what kind of parenting style you have. All this did was put the \\"good\\" parents and the \\"bad\\" parents in two separate piles with praise going to the \\"good\\" or Balanced Parents -- \\"oh you perfect little parents, you've done your homework and shouldn't even be reading this book!\\"I think this author needs a few more parenting classes herself!Do yourself a favor.

Their parents were nagging, pleading, threatening, or waffling. I wanted to carry a stack of Kid Cooperation books in my backpack and start handing them out left and right.Parenting is not always easy, but with the right tools, it can be joyful and peaceful -- Cooperative!

It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"The only reason I haven't given this book five stars is because I haven't finished it. Raising little adults isn't the easiest. You have to allow them to be kids, but also set boundaries. After my second child, I turned into a yeller. It became so taxing on my system, let alone upsetting my girls.

This book uses a very similar philosophy, but uses many \\"real life\\" examples involving kids of various ages, particularly younger kids. It has provided me with a whole book full of different ideas to try, many of them broadly applicable to many different situations, which is wonderful. There's no assumption that one perfect method will work for every child (which is never true).If you want more reading on the kind of principles and thinking that go into this kind of firm flexible parenting you might try Kids are Worth It, but this is sufficient unto itself for giving parents practical ways to be good, sane parents with responsible, thinking kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is great!","review":"I loved this book!

I have towed a 27' and a 30' RV using the bags and they work great. With the rear coils the back end of the truck was very low even with the weight dist hitch. Adding these brings the rear end up and makes towing a lot easier. The install was easy for me. You do not need to take the coil off on the Dodge. I just jacked the truck up by the frame so the spring extended, took the tire off and was able to push the bag into the spring. Probably took me two hours start to finish for both sides. I would definately recommend. I have been towing with them inflated to 25lbs and I leave them at 15 for normal driving to stiffen the rear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent","review":"It takes longer then 1 hour to install it but over all it's not to bad.

Mechanism works well as expected. A friend said he didn't know they still sell these old CD plalyers as he uses an Ipod dock. I find the sound quality slightly better than an Ipod dock. This CD player will handle MP3 music computer recorded in the data mode, which means that an ordinary CD can handle about 3 to 4 hours of songs. The shuffle mode works on data MP3 CDs. My only complaint, is that the CD player only shuffles one CD at a time. I would prefer to have it shuffle several times and then rotate to another CD. Also be careful when inserting the CD, as sloppy quick insertion can cause a jam up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cd Changer for the Price!!","review":"I purchased two of these after reading the reviews.

I haven't had the opportunity to check out any MP3 CDs yet. The price makes this cd changer a great value. Would recommend this item to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good, but there's one fatal flaw...","review":"For some inexplicable reason, the shuffle-play feature is severely handicapped. Not only must you activate it from the remote (there is no button on the player's control panel to do this), but it will only shuffle tracks on one CD at a time! If this is important to you, beware: you CANNOT shuffle a random mix of tracks from all the CDs in the carousel. Otherwise this appears to be a fine machine for the price, but I must be able to shuffle amongst all the CDs so that was a dealbreaker for me, and I had to return it.

After 2 weeks it wouldn't play the cd I selected and would constantly default to cd#1. I then had a problem getting it to play after I had turned it on. The only thing it did well was to open and close. Once I got it to play it sounded fine, but it was just a series of frustrations getting this unit to work. I have just returned it for a refund as I couldn't get a replacement on this item.

To their credit they called me the same day, telling me that if I shipped it cross country to CA, that they would repair it and send it back. I had discarded the packaging materials, so I took the unit to the UPS store, and was informed it would cost me $42.00 to box and ship this to CA. Not worth it for something with a retail cost of $120. I sent Teac another e-mail informing them of the cost to ship this. No effort on their part to take ownership of the cost to make this right.BTW for those of you who like the multi-disk random shuffle - I discovered that this unit will not perform that function. It will only shuffle on one disk at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Purchase","review":"This CD player is cheap and Hums Loud also skips on CD's even after cleaning CD's and player lens.

Wife opened it on Christmas morning, everything worked, easy setup. Had music all day for the 1st time in a long while. No problems with occasional use over the next 3-4 weeks. 3 days ago, turned it on as usual and noticed noisy hum from unit. Now will not even recognize the presence of a CD in the carousel, including CDs it played w/o difficulty a few days before. Also, unit quit responding to the remote at the same time. Icing on the cake - 30 day return expired 5 days ago. Will return/replace anyway, but doubt I'll replace it with a Teac unit. I've been through 3 Sony home CD players, and each of them had intermittent problems with skipping during random tracks/disks, so no more Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite after 2 hours","review":"The player worked for about 3 hours, then the remote stopped working. I put in new batteries and still no luck. I did not know whether it was a defective remote or if the sensor on the unit was defective, so I returned the unit. I later ordered a Yamaha CD player and am pleased with it.I have used TEAC products before and had no problems, but I didn't want to take a chance on another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Didn't work at all. Returned it and ordered the Sony. Too bad, my previous Teac lasted 18 years. I don't know if it's poor QC or hidden shipping damage, but it's the first device I've ever received that didn't work at all. The lights would come on but that was it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp 5-CD Carousel Changer","review":"I bought this unit after searching for weeks for a multi-CD player with decent sound and its own speakers. The surround sound is very nice but the thump-thump from the extra bass speaker is too much for the type of music I play, so I turn it off. I also turned off the flashing lights. I don't have any MP3's (whatever they are) and I already have a very good tape player. There are several unused (not needed) features but the CD's sound really good and I can hear them all the way to the kitchen. This unit serves my limited purposes very well. I like the size too."},{"rating":"2","title":"works but mp3 problem","review":"play cd ok but can't get mp3 to work.

Smartest move for me, the oversampling, especially on my own cd-r, and cd-rw recordings is much better by far. Reads and plays the discs that the old player would skip over. I also like the full complement of both analog, and digital outputs. So far I like it real well. I can recommend it to anyone looking for a quality player at a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"cd player","review":"needed a replacement player to play christmas music. we had a teac b/4. easy hook up and go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money ... and time","review":"As a fan of classic house, you can only be disappointed by this performance from Dimitri. It's slow and totally lacks this \\"je ne sais quoi\\" that makes you get up and move. It's not deep and sounds like it got stuck in a bad TV series from the 70s. Using old school beats as a base is great...as long as it's just a base! Dimitri has done nothing here that takes it to the next level, it just doesn't do it. It's quite far off what I was expecting in terms of excitement..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disc One Will Rock You - Disc Two - Not So Much","review":"The title says it all.

And when I get back into the exercise kick, this is the first video I grab. It is under 30 minutes.It's not all that difficult. It is a great energy boost, not to mention good for your ego too! My only gripe is, there is no way to tell what the equivalent is in \\"Miles walked\\", or calories burned. Other than that, I think it's a great video for anyone,(except for the lean & mean). They would not be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"this tape is not ADVANCED !!!","review":"I feel so ripped off by this video!! It purports to be advanced, yet is far easier than the two other Sansone videos I have (2 mile walk and walk aerobics). The exercisers in the video are all at least 50 lbs overweight, but for anyone with at least a basic level of fitness, this tape is laughable. It consists of walking in place and doing arm movements for 30 minutes. There are none of the staples of her other videos like kickbacks, grapevines, sidesteps, etc.I don't have the beginner tape in this series, but I imagine the 'exercises' consist of sitting on your couch and having a donut!!If you are"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her tapes are the best!","review":"To me, this tape goes at a bit, just a bit, of a faster pace then her other ones. But it's good because it is challenging when you need it! Maybe you might have more time on the weekends or a day you are off. I use a different tape each day according to the time I have and the way I feel. Leslie goes at a good pace on all her tapes and you don't have to kill yourself. With her tapes you work at your own pace. She is very warm and human and so are the people in the tapes. I highly recommend them; forget jogging or walking outside -- use these tapes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie Sansone is the best!","review":"This is one of Leslie Sansone's older videos. I love this one. Not only does it involve walking, but it involves a lot of upper body motion that keeps your heart rate up, and keeps you sweating. Leslie has a wonderful way of keeping you motivated with her upbeat attitude. She consistently changes the routine with easy to follow steps that leave you feeling great after a workout. Leslie Sansone and this video are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I've worn dozens of holsters over the years.

You just need to know what you are getting into. The enclosed instructions were fairly complete. The instruction do contain a web address where you can watch an 8 minute video of the installation process that goes into much more detail. Do yourself a favor and watch the video at least once. You will get a lot of good tips (such as spraying your finger tips with the included solution to prevent the parts from sticking to your hand) and feel a lot more confident when you do the installation.I had to ding the product one star because the spray bottle broke early in the installation. By the way, you can buy an additional bottle of solution from the company for a small fee. Having more of the solution will yield better results than not having enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't throw away your receipt!","review":"Product looks as if it would work well. HOWEVER, I ran into problems during installation and needed replacement parts. They were quite helpful initially with email but when I had to phone customer service they would not help unless I had the original sales receipt. So I now have a partially installed shield on the front of my iPod, with one corner sticking up,and a back without installation fluid with which to instal it. I can be treated badly for free; why should I pay for the priveledge? I'd probably give the product 5 stars if I could install it but feel generous with the 2 stars considering their customer service policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents should read this book!","review":"As a parent of two children (now grown and successful), I look back to when they were in school and remember the concerns I had about their progress in learning to read and write. It goes without saying that most parents want their children to do well in school. Being a good reader is certainly a critical factor in how well a child learns any subject. Ms. Hurford's book, \\"To Read or Not to Read\\", provides invaluable and interesting information for parents about the process of learning to read. It is not just a good reference on dyslexia but also it contains background on testing children to help identify possible reading problems. Parents who have the slightest concern about their children's reading will gain insight from this book. As an added bonus, the portions of the book with short episodes about famous dyslexics are fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent collection of writings discussing Biblical Counseling","review":"Pretty good book.

Packed with lots of great photos from golf's past, I think this must be a real must buy for fans of the game everywhere. Also loved the interesting chapters on old Scottish golf including Tom Morris, Bobby Jones and US golf plus Ladies on the Links.

It also tells about a lot of excercises to help you write in general, which a mediocre writer might find useful. The 50 sample essays are usually from students who got into some of the top schools, such as Cornell. Some of them are really good, but a lot of them aren't (this might raise your confidence). It has some of the essays in the back graded by admissions officers with a few lines of comment. Basically, this is a good book to get, but 90% of it is available for free on the essayedge editing website. I see no reason to pay for it if they make it available for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start for Traveller/Space creation","review":"I bought this book mainly for the world creation tools. Lots of cool stuff on star and world creation, though it's spread out a bit. Would be nice if there were some pages in the back with all the tables you use for rolling up stuff in one place. The main information on the scout corp. is great! Already gave me a couple of scenario ideas. My only beef with the book is the lack of forms. I'm trying to put together a relational database of Traveller based space/planetary info and it's slow going, having to go through every page to find the type of info that needs to be stored. Working from a paper form with all the fields already defined is much easier. Oh well, I find futzing around with stuff like this more fun than actually playing the game. Go figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Traveller Scout and World-Building Resource","review":"Though I am not a user of the GURPS system, First In is a valuable supplemental resource for the Original Traveller Universe. I use my copy in conjunction withTraveller: Science-Fiction Adventure in the Far Future (Book 1 Characters and Combat),Traveller: Science-Fiction Adventure in the Far Future (Book 3 Worlds and Adventures)andTraveller Book 6: Scouts. It is highly useful for providing the additional level of detail which has become a hallmark of theGURPS Traveller: Science Fiction Adventure in the Far Future (GURPS Traveller)series. Well worth the original $20.95 cover price, and perhaps even a bit more, as this book has now been out of print for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read with likable characters","review":"This was the first of Van Wormer's books I've read and I'm about to place an order for a few more. Her writing style is light and easy to read - perfect to curl up with during the hectic holidays. Her book Expose was fast paced, and the main character Sally is easy to like. Unlike some other contemporary authors, Van Wormer doesn't bog us down with the main character's beauty and elegance. We get to know Sally through her dialog rather than with a mental image of her physique. That's refreshing! As a writer myself, I could identify with Sally and it's obvious that Van Wormer's spent time in the publishing world. I found the two concurrent plots not always in sync but I was relieved at the end of the book - I'm not putting any plot spoilers here, though! Suffice to say that I want to read more about Sally, Cassy, Alexandra, and the rest. I like Van Wormer's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a Disappointment!","review":"I usually love her books, but for some reason, I just couldn't empathize with the protagonist. What a drip! Maybe, it's because she's not a superwoman like Cassie Cochran, et al, but I just didn't care about the story. Please, go back to the West End stories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, if not my favorite Van Wormer","review":"LVW is always good at making believable heroines, and Sally is no exception. Maybe that's why I felt uneasy at the romance between her and Spencer. As Sally states, they both have to 'grow up', and their explosive passion is causing them to rush into an intense relationship. On the other hand, that LVW can have me worry about a ficitonal character says a lot for her writing ability. On the lighter side, I always enjoy reading about the DBS crowd. Although Cassy is a bit too perfect , Alexandra has shaped up well as news diva with nerves of steel. Favorite remains \\"Jury Duty\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the trick!","review":"I used the Braun cordless curling iron throughout my 2 week trip to Europe. I wanted to avoid bringing converters and plugs and transformers and this really did the trick. I only used one butane fuel cartridge and still have fuel left over. I have medium long hair and it is very thick. The iron does not heat up as hot as the one I use at home but it certainly curls the hair. It comes with a brush attachment, which is also handy. I plan to use this for all my overseas trips.

It is ridiculous that it is $15 on here. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book the Police Didn't Want Released","review":"This is probably my favorite true crime book. I remember when it was released and there was a media uproar over it being too sensational. The claim was that Mr. Williams was trying to profit from murder. I then knew I had to read it because obviously there was information that officials didn't want released. Stephen Williams outlines how Karla got such a sweet deal and manages to avoid the same penalties as her husband. This book is an attempt to help the victims find justice. Justice they were denied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satan has offspring and they live in Canada!!!","review":"Chilling, disturbing, compelling, intriguing. These are just some of the adjectives I'm choosing to describe Stephen Williams account of the Bernardo/Holmolka murder case.Several times, I found myself having to put the book down simply because of the horror these two people acted upon. However, I continued to come back--in part because of William's straigh-forward, almost journalistic approach to telling their horrific story.I've done some research on this case, and from what I can tell, William's account is the most accurate. I would most certainly recommend this book for people interested in true crimes. When I finished the book, I felt I had ample facts and evidence to draw my conclusions about both Karla and Paul -- I conclude, that Karla despite her obvious, outward beauty, and Paul, her pradatory, punk husband, both are pure evil and the devil incarnate.Fabulously disturbing read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very poorly written.","review":"I've given this book a 1-star because I couldn't give it a 0-star. This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. Although the subject matter is compelling, the writing is putrid. The author -- if one can call him that -- doesn't use transitions. That he doesn't use them to connect paragraphs is bad enough, but he doesn't even use them to connect images, scenes, actions, and ideas within paragraphs. Consequently, the narrative is extremely jarring. On nearly every page, I found myself wondering, \\"What the heck is he talking about now?\\"After awhile it got so frustrating that I threw the book out and purchased one on the same topic by a different author. Any other author has to be better! Don't editors read books before they publish them? I read 7th grade English papers when I was a teacher with better organized thoughts than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about a couple of sick bastards","review":"A book about a couple of sick bastards and a major screw up on the part of everyone from the cops to the Canadian court system. God help us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted Misogyny","review":"Having read the prior two books on this subject, I found this book to be a sad commentary on the author's misogyny. The book clearly is slanted to place the blame for these crimes squarely on Karla Holmolka. The author does not take into account and often omits details which lead Holmolka to be part of these crimes. The blame for the deaths of the two young women belongs squarely on Paul Bernardo. Before Stephen Williams writes a book he needs to get educated on the reality of violence against women, domestic violence and misogyny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"I am still waiting to receive this product, since 3/9/07!!! Very hard to rate something you are still waiting on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Modern Female Demon","review":"Stephen Williams has done an incredible job with his research. Kudos! I must admit that there were times I was tempted to abandon reading because of the uncomfortable reality that Women are indeed capable of being evil, sexual, predators. If you are interested in getting the facts........this is the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible Darkness","review":"WOW! I had never heard this story, before I had gotten the book. I could not put this book down. The true shock of what Paul and Karla is almost to hard to believe. The one thing is how Karla came off as such a victim. She was truley as sick as Paul was. I was shocked to learn she only got twleve years, and already out. The police dropped the ball more than one time in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocker","review":"This is a very good book!

His brainless rantings may be the result of rage fueled by something in his personal life perhaps?I'm not a great fan of Microsofts business ethic, but the author is narrow minded, unable to reason or dicuss.

They have garden carts, bicycle-drawn carts, a wheelchair cart, a tea cart, a dog/goat cart, and one 2-wheel pony or horse cart. The designs are simple and basic, and the step by step instructions appear to be easy to follow. These are basic, usable carts, not fancy or sophisticated.I was actually looking for a book about how to build nice horse carts and wagons, so this was not really what I was looking for. I will keep the book for now, however, because the one horse cart they do have may be a good first project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distory a Disappointment","review":"There were a few funny insults in this book, but most were neither funny nor interesting.

After a fewchapters, I was so mentally exhausted trying to absorb the concepts as presented, I hadto just put it down and go do something else for a while. The rythm of the writing goes somethinglike this. \\"OK do this, but don't do that, but now be careful about this unless you do that first,etc. etc. It is clear that the writer has a lot of knowledge, but in my view the average reader willnot be able to access what he is trying to convey.

There are some good ideas that you can gleen from this text but overall I would save the money and avoid it for other more professionally written books (ie. Schwager stuff). Reading this tome is akin to wading through a quagmire of well meaning but ill structured ideas and concepts. I kept thinking that Farley is writing in a schizophrenic, stream-of-conciseness style as the text wandered aimlessly. Randomly, good ideas would jump disjointedly from the droning text and I would highlight them but in the end though, it was a chore to finish, and a book not enjoyed is hard to follow and retain. Sorry Farley."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Swinging than Trading","review":"I found this book a huge disapointment. It is a cluttered collection of old time chart theory expressed in endless verbocity. This book could well be titled \\"Never use 50 words when 500 will do\\". There is lots of warm and fuzzy language such as \\"letting your left and right brain connect\\" and \\"feeling for the space of emptiness\\". HAS THIS GUY EVER TRADED!!There is no original research and no objective measurement or system testing of the various strategies discussed. That the author claims to have \\"discovered\\" some new arcane theory of market pattern is simply not substantiated.I have never even thought of returning a book to Amazon before but this one made me do it!!!.

The number of pages in the book could have been cut by half easily. It was a hard book to follow.

Obviously, often you don't understand what the autor means.There may be something interesting inside but it's definitely unreadable.I have to recognize that it's the worst compared to other books I've bought (Alexander Elder, Martin Pring, Steeve Nison, Van Tharp, Mark Douglas, Jake Bernstein).I cannot understand other reviews giving 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opprobium for this Abundant Obfuscation","review":"A very badly written book, filled with conjecture, backed up by no research whatsover. The author blathers on about patterns retracing back to Fib numbers, yet offers no proof other than the occasional \\"well chosen example.\\" In fact, the month I was reading this book, there was an article in Active Trader magazine which went through thousands of charts and showed that retracements do not magically fall to magic numbers. This book reads like an astrological textbook.Reader after reader talks about how they have had to go through it again and again. That's because it's a.) poorly written, b.) illogically ordered and c.) the damn charts are often on the wrong page. And the way this guy draws trendlines -- jeez, they could be anywhere!Color me not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but not Practical","review":"You can't automate much of these suggestions and, as a result, you can't backtest their performance. I think that most traders use computer scanning to find candidates so this book won't help. If you trade just a few stocks, commodities, etc., these might help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a fine work for mature traders","review":"This is for the serious student, and doesn't read like the typical comic book. The effort is worthwhile and has great impact on trading performance and bottom line. I found it full of detailed content and strategy. Clearly not for the impatient reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXPANDING THE ENVELOPE OF SWING TRADING","review":"... Mr. Farley has written a text which offers new insights into trading and expands the concept of how to view price movements and crowd behaviors. The book is not for those who want a quick read in between their favorite television shows. Rather, it is a valid text for students of the art and offers many exciting and unique approaches to trading and analyzing the probability of a given trade. I heartily recommend it for serious traders and offer this one tidbit for those who don't bother to absorb what Mr. Farley has proffered: it will be a pleasure doing business with you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Struggle to Read","review":"While this book seems to contain some helpful information, the author wrote it so poorly that it becomes very difficult to follow. Mr. Farley seems to make point after point without trying to make connections between them and in an extremely laborious style. Of the books I have read on this subject, this one is clearly the most difficult to read, and I doubt that the information it provides is worth the effort.I would focus my efforts elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much time was spent editing this book?","review":"Farley covers a ton of ground in this book but it is simply a horrible read. It seems like he sat down and wrote the 400+ pages without any outline. He is all over the place. The subject headings mean almost nothing. He will write a few lines on the specified topic but start to wander off and end up on a topic he has already mentioned half a dozen times.This guy also needs a thesaurus. He seems to have a very limited vocabulary and by the end of the book you are left wondering why he can't mention an indicator without calling it \\"classic\\" or go a paragraph without explaining the market using the words \\"greed\\" and \\"fear.\\" Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying this book is not a great investment","review":"This book is poorly written: it is unfocused and repetitive. In addition, I am not convinced its content is scientifically sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging...and Outstanding","review":"This book challenges the reader to absorb its extremely detailed analysis and information. I bought it back in January and am still absorbing the material. Don't try to read it in one sitting or even in a series of sittings. The best approach is to take a few of its many bullet points and apply it daily to your chart analysis. The results can be extremely enlightening.Its refreshing that a new book on trading could have such a positive impact on me. It has resolved a number of personal issues that had undermined my trading for years. I am greatly indebted to the author for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant Garbage, Clasic Waist","review":"I give this book a minus ten (the lowest)rating. My personal opinion about the book is very simple: that it LIES, and IT LIES A LOT.It is advertized BY THE AUTHOR that this book presents:* Dozens of specific trading strategies.......******** The 7 Bells....The fact is that there is nothing specific about anything in this book. THE REASON??? According to the author and his hired \\"defender(s)\\": THE MARKET IS SO \\"VOLATILE\\", SO \\"DYNAMIC\\", the \\"MASTER\\" IS INCAPABLE OF defining anything specifics, let alone any \\"SPECIFIC TRADING STRATEGIES\\". Then what people should call the advertizing??According to their line of explanations as presented in the book and by some of the \\"reviewers\\" on this web site, if you bring in 1000 stock charts, the \\"master\\" can manufacture 1000 bells for ya. I call it a classic laughingstock. So good luck to anyone who wishes to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not wish this book on my enemies!","review":"It hurts me every time I think about the dough I spent to buy this book. I thought it would have all I need to start learning how to trade the right way! I said \\"Learning!\\"In the beginning, I thought I was not smart enough to read this book... I bought other books like Tony Oz's and others! They were easy to follow... Then I did some trading on my own with small positions. Then I decided to tackle this book again! Maybe I got a little smarter! Guess what, I realized then that this book is nothing but a poor attempt to show off. No substance! No skill!Save your money. If you insist, give me your money and I will show you a trick or two :-)PS. There is no holly grail in trading. It is all about money mgmt and execution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Farley..Master of Great Confusion","review":"I bought this book last week based on some reviews i read, apparently i guessed i was fully mislead, i have been in the stock market for a while now and have read so many books, but by far, this is the worst and most confusing piece i ever read, the book contained a lot of jargons that might impress the novice without really bringing meaning to the lessons,there were too many repetitions, the charts were confusing and i see know reason why the book had over 400 pages. i do not recommend this book in any form, not for the beginner or experienced investor, its is a waste of money and valuable time and i do commend \\"Jerry P\\" for being honest and objective with his review of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very long and confusing book","review":"I am very disapointed at this book. The author goes around in circles forever not making any point clear. I spent over 150 hours on this book. Did I learn anything of value? Unfortunately the answer is no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try and try again, or Cry and cry again?","review":"There's no question in my mind that the author has an incredible amount of knowledge about trading. The book does give \\"some\\" good pointers. However, reading through it is probably one of the most painful experiences I have ever encountered. I've been trading for some time and have read several books on trading and technical analysis. But this has got to be the worse I have ever read. Most, if not all, the chapters/sections in this book had to be re-read at least 2 to 3 times. What the hell was the editor/pulisher thinking about when they decided to release this book? If you cutout half of the BS and the proverbial trading jargon/slang, you'd probably have a half decent book with insightful info. You would also have a book that is at least 250 pages light.I'm throwing in the towel. I decided not to even keep it as a reference because it is just so incomprehensible. I'm returning mine asap.Sorry Farley!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A 'Classic' Bubble","review":"We all witnessed a period of stock market bubble. This book can be viewed as a mouldy residual, a truely worst residual from that period. If you ever spent any time on internet stock message boards, and felt disgusted by those greed, fears, hypes and whining, you will find out that all those emotional garbages again in this book, only dressed in various kind of uncommon 'terminologies' which the author even does not understand himself. Apparently, those web messageboard posters and that kind of mentality are exactly the target and intended audiences of this author. In this sense, the best I could say about this book is that I consider it a product of that peiord and phenomena in stock market history. If anyone has to call it a 'classic', then I could only consider it a 'classic' bubble, at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"I smell a rat","review":"Something tells me all those five star reviews were written by the same person. The big question is (All you Sherlock Holmeses out there): who?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Master Swing Trader","review":"The topics covered in the book are indeed varied to the extent that certainly the major swing trade techniques are identified. This is not an introductory text on the subject and is not necessarily useful as a reference due to the lack of specific examples and guidance. As simple as it may seem, a better reference on the subject of technical analysis and swing trading techniques is Technical Analysis for Dummies. While the mathematics for a vast majority of the techiques presented in the text may appear dry and uninteresting, more sample problems and a \\"big picture\\" approach would certainly have helped this book get the point across to the trader who wants to employ any number of methods to minimize the emotion factor when trading stocks. Leave this book on the bookseller's shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be clasified as FICTION","review":"Is any truth in this book? I don't think so! My only advice is: DON'T WASTE ANY TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK, UNLESS IF YOU WISH TO KNOW HOW TO WRITE FICTIONS IN THIS FIELD.Added: After submitting this review, I noticed another hyping review just posted. I add the following comments: ANY CLAIM MUST BE BASED ON FACTS. That so called 'very useful 7 bells' are never properly specified, in the traditional spirit of Edwards & Magee, as well as required for any responsible writers. In today's computer age, a reasonable question should also be asked: What is the percentage rates of success for any patterns, indicators, or any other means. Of course, if the writer could not define his/her 'useful pattern' in specific terms, then you have to use your full imagination learned from the Emporer's New Clothes to 'GUESS' what the writer is talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitive Prerequisite","review":"I actually rate this book at -5 starts. I believe that it is absolutely necessary for anyone who wish to start reading this \\"book\\" to read (or re-read) the story \\"The Emperor's New Suit\\" by Hans Christian Andersen first.I believe that most honest people would feel outrageous by this kind of BS and total waists of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a total waste of money and time....","review":"This is most awful book I have ever read on any subject. The style, if you can call that, is total rambling, repeating vague and general statements over and over. Every page is filled with that kind of garbage.I had to read and read sentences and paragraphs several times to make some sense out of them, with little success. How can anyone rate this book 4 or 5 stars and call it excellent work.The impressive looking charts are over-complicated, confusing and mostly meaningless.This was a frustrating reading, especially that I wasted so much time trying to understand something that wasn't there....What a rip!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW...just wow","review":"What a horrible book.

I tried reading it many times, but always end up putting it down. There's a lot of content in the book, but it's scattered everywhere. This book is not well organized. My train of thought keeps getting interrupted by the ordering, reordering and repeating of topics. I can hardly keep my concentration. His sentences are very cryptic. Information does not flow well in his writing style. I also feel that the book is very wordy and repetitive. It can be cut down to 1/3, and still probably retain the same amount of information.One thing I find very odd is that this book is very highly rated (4-5 stars) when it first came out. But now, bad reviews are popping up at an alarming rate. I suspect that someone might have been stuffing the ballot when the book first came out to boost its sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words, too little editing","review":"This book suffers greatly for lack of good editing. Too many arcane terms are used throughout, with no definitions. Too many run-on phrases are used to name concepts with little clarification. It's very difficult to get what the author is trying to say. Then it gets repetitive, as if repeating the same gibberish would bring clarity. I was disappointed. I found it verbose, poorly written and having little to add to the mountain of books on technical analysis. I would expect a better offering from McGraw Hill. Mr. Farley should make sure that a good editor is assigned to his next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writer","review":"It is amazing to me that the many page book is so full of information worded to never say anything. After every paragraph I ask myself what the heck did he just say, and although with effort it is understandable the reader has to work much harder than should be necessary. The material covered is not that complicated. It is just very poorly writen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing writing","review":"I was looking forward to this book as I follow his trading writings in \\"Real Money\\" and he puts forward good stuff there.However there is a \\"style\\" to his writing in this book that makes the content difficult to follow. His sentences are truncated and tend to flip from idea to idea all within a single paragraph, such that you need to keep going back and reread in order to follow what he is trying to say. From Real Money I know he is very knowledgable about swing trading, but you will find this book frustrating. Maybe it required a better editor. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance","review":"There are some good principles in the book, but its way to easy to get lost in all of the repetition and blandness.

I can't imagine what their editors were doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very disciplined approach","review":"Mr. Farley has written a very comprehensive book, full of technical knowledge that he's very well translated into understandable trading strategies. Unlike some other writers in this field, his concepts are consistant with little ambiguity and no hidden ego. He tries to make the reader understand the science of charting from the inside out. He stresses discipline and detachment, and letting the numbers be your guide. This leads to a style that will get you out of a bad trade more quickly and let you safely find exit points for your winners. If you use his ideas with discipline, you'll buy and sell at the right time, and know when to get out - you'll make money and avoid very bad situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great trader horrible book.","review":"Alan knows short-term trading in and out.

Better yet, read something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of educated talk, but it just doesn't contain anything useful","review":"One big dissappointment.Let me repeat again what others have already mentioned here in the comments: you won't get anything useful out of this book. The author gives you the impression he's got a whole new toolkit of swing trading techniques to show you, but you won't get anything. There are some set-ups mentioned in this book, but they're not even supported by backtests or other evidence.For this price, and 400 pages with tons of graphs, I expected a lot more. The writing style of this author can be called frustrating at least.There are much better books out there on chart patterns or swing trading (Elder, Weinstein, Appel, Link, ...).I'm sorry if this review sounds too negative, but these are my exact feelings after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Solid Trading Book","review":"I only gave it 4 stars cuz nothing \\"blew me away\\" but I thought it was good. Very packed with info. Half the book is basic knowledge, followed chapters for each of the bar patterns he likes and finally 30 rules he likes. Over 400 pages. Many pics of charts which help show concepts being discussed. Mostly the same stuff found in other books but i find that it never hurts to hear another point of view.

The pretentious writing style has eluded me and probably quite a few other readers.After a last try in sloughing off the hype, I do not see any real substance apart from the artful adorning of commonplace technical analysis terms.

I think he should have hired some other professional writers to rewrite the whole book, really !!I am feeling very frustrated as today has been the third week I attempted to read through some chapters but decided to give up. Don't understand why he could have chosen a simpler way to make the reader understood the concept yet instead, intended to put some weird and hard-to-understand sentences pages by pages in this book to block the readers ??There is no rating below 1, otherwise I want to give a zero to warn this author.

Yet there is nothing, not a single \\"bell\\" is defined in any way, even not defined loosely.

I've traded professionally on the PHLX, been trading full-time from home for over 3 years, and read close to 20 related books. If you are new to trading, I recommend Alexander Elder and/or Van Tharpe. Beyond that, read Larry Williams, Linda Rashke, Larry Connors, John R. Hill (publisher of Futures Truth magazine), and John Murphy. For fun, read any of Jack Schwager's \\"Market Wizard\\" books (the first is the best).

Save your money buy something with real stats and no ego, like Nison, Bulkowski, or Murphy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Informative...","review":"This book is a work of art and an informative read. It accomplishes what other books about trading try to do but fail: provide behind the scenes information about trading stocks and how you can take advantage of common price patterns. It also shows how individual traders can trade like members of the institutional firms. Ever wonder how they make money in the stock market? Read this book and learn to trade for a living.

I find a lot information useful. But where is the beef? After finishing the last page, a young trader wouldn't understand what he should do next.

Question: did this book add anything new to what I already know? the answer: not much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Reading this book is simply tedious. I am only half way through it but it is just too tough to actually keep reading. Every sentence is a command, i.e. - follow the indicator, wait for the turn, buy the strength...There are no two sentences that actually relate to one another, just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

It's the best read for experienced traders. Dr Elder's 2 excellent books make a nice foundation before picking up this text. This book really marks the next step in knowledge development.Farley has tremendous insight into the forces that move the markets. I keep the book by my trading screen at all times. I see the market swing (trend-range, expansion-contraction, etc)he talks all the time now. Amazing stuff. This guy has a better handle on the trading flow than anyone else I've ever read. The book offers the tough path because the author shows how the cards are stacked against us. But it also gives sage advice on overcoming those obstacles and getting consistant performance. There's a reason some readers go through this book multiple times, while others can't get through the first chapter. The reality trip is overwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This One","review":"This book is one of the worst I've read on trading. Be warned, it will be a nightmare to read if you are a novice. If you are advanced on this topic, you will quickly realize that it leads the reader from one dead end to another. Too many words and too much filler makes the whole thing unprofessional. It has the feel as if it was put together in a haphazard way - paragraph after paragraph full of general statements on trading that often don't even fit together. It's very important to keep in mind that a LOT of these authors of trading books make a living off of selling trading books, DVDs, and subscriptions. Because, frankly, they can't make a living from trading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a MUST READ","review":"I got more out of this book than all of the other books I have read put together. I've seen Alan in person and he clearly knows what he is talking about. I can tell you he puts his heart and soul into his work and his teachings. This is a must read for any trader.

Just try to follow one so-called \\"concept\\" appeared in this book, and you would soon find out that NOTHING in this book, or NOTHING from this author's mouth, has a meaning that common sense understood.

Unfortunately, it does make the book a challenge to read.However, opening my copy at random, across two pages I count 13 paragraphs, of which nine contain one or more highlighted sentences. The book is densely packed with actionable and accurate information.The combination of endless subject-verb sentence structure, along with the fact that Farley wrote for experienced traders and therefore doesn't waste time explaining what the reader ought to already know, makes this book inappropriate for new traders.But it's a virtual goldmine for experienced traders.

Hurricane Katrina ?I'm sorry but rather than see some systematic application of quantitative techniques, all I felt I got was an in your face, throw the book of trading indicators at a price movement and then see what sticks.

On the one hand, we have obvious shills, whose generic 5-star reviews don't even come close to passing the smell test. On the other, there are tons of single-review bashers who can barely grasp the English language. The tells are that they are all short reviews and chronically misspell the same words: \\"waist\\" for \\"waste,\\" and \\"starts\\" for \\"stars.\\" Very bizarre.For those who care, the truth is that the author is in fact a terrible writer and trader.

They have a million indicators on them and lines drawn everywhere. Read the reviews carefully, the good reviews are written by friends of the author and other people featured on his website.

The other reviews are very accurate. The book is deep, complicated and jammed with unique trading strategies, wisdom and concepts. It also takes quite a bit of commitment from the reader. But I believe it is well worth your time and energy. It is the type of book you will come back to many times a year (for many years to come), because much of this material cannot be found anywhere else.This is also one of the few books which teaches TA for both swing trading and day trading.

The author takes us on a grand tour of Spain and introduces us to the bullfight and the encierro--where he runs only inches ahead of the 6 killer bulls and 8 steers through Pamplona's narrow cobblestone streets.We can almost taste the rich Basque food and the sangria as the Festival takes place all around us. It's an easy read and there are 16 pages of color photos of the corrida, the run and the Festival. The book's epilogue is an informative guide that gives suggestions regarding how to run in the encierro."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointing.....","review":"Running with the Bulls starts with an enticing prologue that seems to set a wonderfully exciting pace for the book. But it quickly cuts off into nothing more than the author's travel journal about how he spent his summer vacation in Spain.The cover photo is amazing, but unfortunately it's the only good photo in the book.

It is intended to discredit American Middle East specialists and, if possible, discontinue funding for teaching and training a new generation of such specialists in this country. That message is subdued in the book but explicitly stated in an op-ed Kramer wrote for the Wall Street Journal.For an extremely balanced review which notes where Kramer is correct but also his overstatements and highly selective representation of the opinions of some to whom he refers, see the review by F.

If not emptied soon -> build up of mold. Emptying would be very cumbersome. 3. Cleaning of the inner unit is practically impossible (with many cravisses and corners and requires screw driver).

That meant that the unit would not work, because it thought the water had run dry. I tried switching the 'refill' light off, but it repeatedly just switched itself back on again.

I popped it in my computer to play for my kids and the computer crashed and rebooted. Seriously. Twice. Also, interestingly enough, above the barcode it says, \\"Manufactured by Amazon.com\\" Anyway, just thought I'd share this information because it certainly isn't clearly explained in the product info.

The software bundled with Toast 8 for burning vinyl is called Spin Doctor and will probably suffice for a lot of people. I have many 16 channel recordings that I wanted to get the best sound from them, and Spin Doctor falls very short. I purchased Sound Studio 3 and the difference is like a transistor radio verses stereo in my opinion. Toast 8 seems to be excellent for DVD and CD to MP3 and relitively easy to use.

This was supposed to make my life easy. I bought it so that I could transfer stuff from my TiVo to DVD and to my iPhone. So far I have been able to do the latter with moderate success... it takes a long time and the quality isn't particularly good. As for the former, I have tried various fixes and options, but it still takes over 2 hours to burn a 90 minute movie, and that's after the hour it takes to download it from TiVo. And I've burned 3 disks exactly the same, but only 1 of them actually worked.Now, of course, they are releasing version 9... so I'm doubly pissed since I just bought 8 last month.

It does what it's supposed to do (and, I imagine, a lot simpler than TiVo's Windows version), although don't expect to transfer a movie to to DVD in an hour. For me to move a two-hour movie to my Mac took about two hours itself, and burning it to a DVD took three to four hours. (But then, I only have an 800 Mhz Power Mac G4, not exactly a speed demon in this day and age.) Once it finished, however, the final product was as good as could be expected for a bad print of a 1942 film recorded off of cable. I was skeptical, but the DVD played fine (and with no loss of quality) in my 6-year-old Sony DVD player.

Gun ownership there is totally banned and anyone who uses a gun to defend themselves against an intruder in their home faces prosecution for the ownership and use of that gun.I think it is significant that two of the glowing comments on the back of the book jacket are from an ex-president and a senator who were known for their lack of respect for the laws of our nation.I have read my last R.

No real effort is made by the author to give the characters believable motivation.

This is a vanity project of the author. It was not written to entertain, but to push a message. Fine if you are writing a speech, not so fine if you are selling your work to public that believes it is buying an entertaining book. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that was looking for an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration with a Capital \\"F\\"","review":"AAAHHHHHH!!!! I never thought I'd get to the end of this one. Usually a Richard North Patterson fan, I was surprised (not pleasantly) that this book resembled the Energizer Bunny in that it \\"kept going and going and going\\". While the storyline was great and the characters were likable, I found myself saying, \\"just vote on the legislation and put us out of our misery\\". I MADE myself finish this book because I kept thinking the end would justify the means, unfortunately when I turned the last page I just cheered out of simple and utter relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balance of political correctness","review":"Even with a skilled author, this book doesn't fulfill its' potential because it is locked into a specific political dogma. The events portrayed are unbelievable and the 'bad' characters too sterotypical. Although I agree with the author's theme that gun control in the US is a farce, it would have been much more effective to make such a case without allowing the constraints of politics to become an interference. However, if you consider yourself an entrenched political liberal or a socialist, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with his views but couldn't make it through the book","review":"This was an all-time snoozer. I listened to the first 3 cds of 5 on a long car trip and it's a wonder I didn't pass out and crash. Cardboard characters, convoluted (and silly) plot-even the abridged audiobook was too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too biased","review":"This is only the second book I have started and not been able to finish. Patterson is so busy preaching his gospel the story is not interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Exactly a Novel","review":"I have never before read a novel by a popular author that was so totally dependent on the reader's commitment to the same political and social agenda as its' author. I have enjoyed earlier works by Patterson, but had read not the 2 prior books of this apparent trilogy; if I had, I would probably have skipped this one. It would have been more honest to present it as a clearly political tome, to warn away those who prefer not to be bludgeoned on every page by an author's attempt to \\"educate\\" the reader as to the \\"correct\\" political and social views. This made the book somewhat tedious, and far from a truly original and entertaining read. No doubt this is my own fault, in that I rarely read book blurbs. Had I been aware of its' 2 big fans, I would not have purchased it. For those who do not share the agenda of Senator Ted Kennedy, or the Clintons, I would advise that you not waste time or money on this offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falters then falls flat","review":"I've been a Richard North Patterson fan for years, so I was sickeningly disappointed with \\"Balance of Power\\". Overall it was a good story idea presented weakly and very unrealistically. I expected much more of a plot, better development and more interesting characters - and was disappointed on all points. The writing sounded forced, the dialogue like a bad movie and the action predictable and telegraphed way ahead. There were no surprises, and the ending felt like Patterson just ran out of enthusiasm for his own story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balance of Power: Guns and NRA","review":"So appropriate right now, 2013. A must for everyone to read. Gives arguments for both sides but is so obviously on the right side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy, liberal tract.","review":"I was hoping for a legal & political thriller (a la John Grisham, one of my favorite authors). Instead I got a preachy, liberal tract. While I am politically conservative, I am also pro-gun control and therefore supportive of that same position taken by book's main character, President Kilcannon. But after the first few chapters I was ready to get a gun and shoot him myself. And while this may sound trivial, every white male character in this book is either a scum-bag or the victim of a white male scum-bag, while heroic women & minorities leap from every corner. Although I am also a white male as well, all I expect in my books is a realistic mix characters - some good & some bad & most a little of each, regardless of their gender or race. I tried to keep an open mind & stay with it, but I finally had to put it away unfinished. Very disappointing. Patterson ain't no Grisham..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore...","review":"I agree with the message Patterson was trying to deliver (I am much in favor of stricter gun control), but this book was so long, drawn out, depressing, and dry - I started to wish I'd never heard of guns or gun control. It was painful trying to force myself to finish this book. I felt like I was watching one of those poorly-done TV documentaries - when you might as well be listening to your most pathetically dull high school teacher. On the other hand, my mom thought it was a fabulous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I am ...ah was a fan of Patterson. I looked forward to a good read and was treated to a harangue on gun control.It was like being repeatedly pounded on the head with a mallet. The good guys and especially the bad guys (gun nuts) are painted with such broad strokes they are caricatures existing just to deliver a sermon.Surely, Patterson is skilled enough to deliver his message without being boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring political propaganda","review":"I will never buy another book by this author.I didn't even finish this one after realizing that it was just a tedious recital of the author's ideological views with a thin veneer of fiction. Whether or not one agrees with his views, it was deceptive to promote this book as an entertaining mystery story. I feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumped the shark","review":"There are two brothers. Both enter politics. One is assassinated; the second is shot and wounded then become President. He marries and on his wedding day his new wife's mother, sister and niece are all murdered by gun violence. The pact with the reader is shattered, and Patterson jumps the shark. So the remained of this strange book is a joke. Too weird to review, much less publish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Claptrap","review":"I picked this book at random from the library shelf and it only took me 30 pages to realize this was some liberal, gun-hating author's attempt at political commentary. It is to fiction what NPR is to news - completely biased. I'm tempted to renew it, just to keep it off the library shelf for as long as possible. Oh well, at least it's in the Fiction aisle, where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Having read and appreciated all of Richard North Patterson's previous books, I eagerly awaited this one. I found it dull, opinionated and preachy. It was too filled with legal technicalities for me to completely understand all the anti-gun testimony and deposition proceedings. All-in-all, had I read more about it instead of preordering it before release date, I would not have bought it. I did, however, finish it, but the ending was a foregone conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda","review":"This is blatant anti-gun rights propoganda. He intentionally distorts the issue and lies throughout the book about gun laws. The worst argument is the fact that some people think that Al-Qaeda is going to buy guns from gun shows and than use them on Americans. This argument falls apart when you consider the fact that you can buy a full auto AK-47 in Pakistan for $85, as opposed to a semi-automatic AK-47 in the US for $300. Al Qaeda's probably a little short on cash right now and I doubt that they would want to risk traveling to the Great Satan to buy an outrageously expensive gun when they could just head off down to the market and buy one there. The whole Al Qaeda buying guns from the US is basically crap put out by the Brady Center to capitalize off the fear of terrorists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balance of Power completely unbalanced","review":"I have never read such political tripe disguised as fiction in my life! Every conservative in this book is depicted at best as spineless and at worst as inherently evil and selfish. I don't read fiction to gain political knowledge and I resent RNP's attempt to preach to me and other unsuspecting readers.Of course if I had bought the book off the shelf instead of on Amazon, I would have caught the reviews by Clinton and Ted KEnnedy. That alone would have made me put it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Balance of Power\\" is not balanced","review":"According to Patterson, 20% of US citizens like guns, 20% dislike guns, and 60% are somewhere in the middle, providing the \\"balance of power\\". The 20% that like guns will dislike this book, and the 20% that dislike guns will like this book. The other 60% are likely to move a bit closer to disliking guns by reading this book. But the reader should be mindful of the fact that Patterson is controlling both sides of the gun debate inside the covers of his book. Clearly, he is anti-gun and believes that the Second Second protects only the rights of state militias, not individuals. If you're looking for a well written, emotionally compelling, fictional story to buttress your belief that guns are bad, this book is for you. On the other hand, if you'd like to explore a balanced debate, check out \\"Opposing Viewpoints Series - Gun Control (Opposing Viewpoints Series)\\" by Helen Cothran (Editor)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I never finished.","review":"I normally enjoy Mr. Patterson's books and am not a gun dealer, collector, or advocate. I may go buy one now. Other than the improvement Mr. Patterson has made in his overuse of the words SARDONIC, and PENNSIVE, he has written a book clearly with an idealogical agenda replacing good fiction. Once one of favorite authors, I will think twice before reading him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and detailed","review":"I tried to listen to the tapes but it was too long. Lara's family is killed early on and the whole rest of the tapes (10?) seems to be about changing existing law."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book!","review":"The book is very slow, and has numerous flawed legal findings and legal arguments. I was awaiting this book, however this has been the most disappointing book in a long time, I suggest that readers seriously pass on this particular Patterson book. Very predictable ending, and overall a poor read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time!","review":"I strongly recommend that you don't waste your time and money on Balance Of Power. I have been a fan of R.N. Patterson's previous books. However, the plot in his latest work is much too drawn out and weak and the character development is very shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"No balance in this book","review":"There may be an entertaining, suspenseful novel buried under the propaganda here, but I couldn't find it. No, I'm not a member of the NRA, nor do I aspire to be. But this book was so skewed to the left, I couldn't finish it. The characters were either so good or so evil as to be completely unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative?---Save your money!","review":"I usually don't like to write reviews on books I haven't finished but this one deserves all the bad press it can get. This book is so politically one-sided that I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. I got so bogged down in Patterson's political agenda (of which I don't agree with) that I lost total interest in the story.One only has to look at who wrote the blurbs on the cover to realize that the book has a left-leaning agenda. Gun control is one thing but Republican bashing is another and there is enough of that in the first half of the book that any self respecting conservative would have to stop reading as I did.I have been a big fan of Patterson's for many years and was sorely disappointed that he chose to politicize his novel. I probably won't bother reading any of his future novels after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Tale of Advocacy","review":"Be prepared for the slow start; hang on for the strong finish. In Balance of Power, Richard North Patterson weaves a political tale of intrigue, guns, money, tort reform, backroom deals and ethically-challenged lawyers.Painstaking research, personal experience as a trial lawyer and a detailed understanding of the contemporary Washington scene arm the author with enough ammunition to create a compelling, believable tale of special-interests politics in Washington, D. C.Do not pick this novel up unless you are willing to experience the reasons our elected representatives often fail to legislate the general public's bidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little book but videos?","review":"Used this book in medical as a supplement to larger phys book.

Got 5 replacement items, and of those, 3 worked out of the box.When plugged in, indicator light come on, and even with knobs turned to off, one or both of the burners gets hot!!! Frightening. Dangerous. And these are supposed to be \\"professional\\" quality.Broil King has been very supportive, and has replaced all defective units, but with no explaination as to the poor quality control.I'd recommend finding a different solution. If you have to purchase and use, be sure to test first and replace if defective, and keep unplugged at all times except when in use.

To be clear this is not a match for a stove burner. As with other comments, boiling can take a but longer. But so far it does a VERY good job.

It was able to clean his little hands, which was important since they touch everything. He loved the melon scent that lingered after washing. The pump dispenser top was large, so he was able to handle it himself. The soap has a light/medium scent, but it didn't last long. Considering how well it worked with my toddler, I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a replacement for Juicy Melon","review":"I searched far and wide for a soft soap scent that was mild enough for me to tolerate and I loved Juicy Melon, which is evidently now discontinued.

It leaves my hands feeling soft, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juicy Melon DISCONTINUED by Manufacturer---Waaaaannnnnnhhhhhh!","review":"Juicy melon was the ONLY scented soap I could use as I have terrible allergies to strong/floral fragrances. Now that it has been replaced with \\"Melon and Cucumber\\" I am out of luck because the scnet is no longer mild but is super strong floral scent--NOT melon or cuke. I emailed the company and they said there was a lack of interest in the Julicy Melon scent so it has been discontinued indefinately. Well, the new melon and cuke scent smells like a flower factory instead of fruit & vegetables so I cannot use it. Bugs my allergies too much and I prefere to be able to breathe. So, guess I'm back to using unscented bar soap. You lost out on a great customer, Soft Soap! p.s. I gave it a star only because you couldn't do no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This hand soap has a wonderful smell! The ...","review":"This hand soap has a wonderful smell! The bottle is really attractive and won't look out of place on your kitchen sink. The kids loved it, and anything that makes them want to wash their hands is just great by me. The only drawback was that it had a tendency to leave my hands feeling a little dry. However, this effect wasn't as bad as with some other soaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crisp cucumber melon-stinks!","review":"Years ago I discovered Softsoap Juicy Melon to use both as a hand and shower soap. Clean mild fragrance was a major selling point. No lingering scent when washed off. That's changed. When my Juicy Melon ran out I picked up a bottle of Crisp Cucumber Melon thinking it would be similar. Not even close. Though the name implies a scent of cucumber and melon it has neither. Instead it produces this wretched, overly-perfumed fragrance. The stink won't wash off and lingers for some time after use. Horrible! Softsoap's \\"new and improved\\" line of soaps may be designed as something only a Wal-Mart regular can love, but I don't. Time to move on from the Softsoap brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"juicy mellon!","review":"This little bottle of soap has been sitting by my bathroom sink for a month now trying to tell me that it was actually mammaries, but it's not!

Major characters from The Original Series and the movies (Saavik, for instance) are left out while even the most minor character from The Next Generation receives full coverage.

From one of the better hip-hop producers of all time, this album was wayyyyy below average.Maybe its my fault...Whenever a new Eric B & Rakim, Nas, Roots or Redman album came out, I always graded those albums with a different scale that I judged the Afro-Man album. Feel me?There is nothing on this album that you would remember ten minutes later. Nothing.I'll take into consideration the fact that I'm changing as a hip hop fan (Hell, no album could ever touch Illmatic). But this album isn't even close to average!Maybe I'm a little harsh, but that's my take on it. I'll never spend money on Erick Sermon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as great as the MUSIC Album.","review":"The only really good song on this album is React. I was unimpressed with the overall quality of this album because it really lacked to illustrate the talent that I believe Erick Sermon has. One thing I will mention about his album which I think is pretty low is the lyrics in the second song titled \\"Here I Iz.\\" Erick Sermon makes reference to \\"dropping bombs over Baghdad.\\" I am not certain if he is just trying to make some political point or he was just being careless with words he used. In any event, I thing it is in really poor taste, I think he should really take a good look at his political philosophies before expounding them on his albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac's news","review":"Kelton's Charlie is a strong man of very high principles who is confounded by others who may not share his idea of honor.

I had a Westinghouse mini food processor for a few years that I loved until I finally broke the lid. So, this is the replacement (my second one of these by the way). I didn't like it the first time, and I don't like it now. It emits an ear-piercing squeal every time I turn it on, and it doesn't chop very well. I ofen have to run it for a long time and/or mix up the contents several times to get it to chop everything -- and it didn't chop my parsley like it did another reviewers. I would recommend avoiding it, even despite the low cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little powerhouse","review":"I absolutely love this little chopper. I have an older one from maybe 10 years ago and it's still going strong. I don't use it often (maybe once a week), but it chops all my fresh herbs and veggies for stews and soups.

I have also used it to chop nuts up for cookies etc. For $10, well worth it, save a ton of chopping time. I have not had any issue with dullness of the blades all this time, so unless you are grinding rocks, shouldn't be a problem.

The outlook for reducing these tensions is not optimistic, but perhaps this book will promote more understanding than currently exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Real Jews\\" is a real eye-opener","review":"This is an excellent and very balanced book which demonstrates that much of the dislike and fear of the Haredim (\\"Ultra-Orthodox\\")is a result of ignorance and a certain degree of bigotry on the part of secular Israelis. Efron reports on both sides of many issues which divide the 2 communities and shows how misunderstandings arise on both sides, how differences stem from differing world views and how, in some cases such as the army draft, one can use the statistics to prove both sides of the argument, for and against the status quo. I found the book informative, readable, honest and (as far as I can judge) unbiased. We see both sides \\"warts and all\\" and I came away with sympathy for some views on either side and the profound hope that, in the not-too-distant future, talk of secular and religious \\"sides\\" in Israel will disappear in a new mutual understanding and respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent analysis and a very interesting read.","review":"The topic requires a keen understanding of religious, political, social, ethnic, and geographic nuance. The author has these qualities as well as the ability to explain the religious-secular divide thoroughly and evenhandedly.

It set the stage for future Kingsmen live albums, and changed forever how southern gospel live albums would be done in style.

Although I found A Fine Balance to be the most moving and brilliantly contructed novel I have ever read, I preferred this book as it didn't tear me apart emotionally as much as AFB. I adored the characters and was touched by the protagonist's kindness towards Tehmul when he (SPOILER) discovers the whereabouts of the doll. If I have any criticism at all, I felt that the so-called \\"plot\\" of the book (according to its cover), i.e. the conflict between father and son, was underplayed. I would assume this is more to do with the publisher's blurb than Mr. Mistry's storytelling. A compelling, touching read that I was sorry to finish..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my","review":"I love this author. I recently read SUCH A FINE BALANCE and was still reeling from that story when i began this. That was a mistake. I should have given myself time between the two because this story did not move me as much. It is very well written like all his books. the story is about a man who is struggling with being good and providing for his family and being tempted to being corrupt to provide even better. The descriptions of India and Bombay are so explicit, i felt it, i smelled it, i was there. This is a magnificent author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is but a journey","review":"This book left me to wonder what exactly does the author intends to achieve and convey with this book. When I reached the last page, the story falls into place. Gustad's aspirations for his sons, the emotional wall he build to shield himelf from being hurt are no different than what most of us feel. The story does not reveal anything elaborate or on a big scale, and yet it reveals that our life is a journey and there is seldom much excitement and seldom we have all our questions answered. I enjoyed the reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair - no comparison to A Fine Balance","review":"After reading A Fine Balance I couldn't wait to read another book by this author. I then read his third book called Family Matters which was good but I was disappointed as it by no means compared to A Fine Balance. I just finished Such A Long Journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots. It is my least favorite of the three books by this author. It's hard to believe that someone can right a book like A Fine Balance, which was magnificant and one of the best books I have ever read, and then turn our stuff that is, at best, average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, but not as incredible as A Fine Balance","review":"This book was touching and well-written, but it didn't have the powerful heartbreaking ability or emotional resonance of A Fine Balance. I would recommend it, but make sure you read this one before you read his others. His style definitely developed over time, as is evident in the artistry of A Fine Balance.

The only other emolient that I have ever found effective was Keri lotion with a good concentration of alphahydroxy, but Keri stopped making it. I use the C&M hand and body lotion on hands, feet, and legs. The shower gel leaves me gently almond-scented and soft; it keeps my skin from itching in our terribly dry winter weather.

First of all, the water flows into the grounds so quickly that the compartment overflows. Second of all, because of the way it's made, when that happens the water with coffee grounds in it backs up into the water reservoir, which becomes filthy with coffee grounds. Third, because of the way it's made, it's not possible to open up the reservoir sufficiently to clean it out. So pretty quickly you've got some old coffee grounds stuck in the water reservoir, and your coffee starts tasting bad as a result.

This is a coffeemaker which works inconsistently and often requires you to monitor it while it is running to avoid leakage. If the steam curls the filter to one side or if the coffeemaker is not perfectly level, the coffee tends to drain down the back of the cup, onto the base, and under the unit, getting the surrounding area wet. I have tried multiple types of filters, tried different configurations, different types of cups, etc but still inconsistent performance. A design engineer friend looked at it and told me that the area where the coffee drains should be out further, to hit the center of a typical cup, rather than nearer the back. I would suggest spending the extra money and purchasing a product which works more efficiently - who has the time to babysit a coffeemaker?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricky to fill","review":"I had a Cup-At-A-Time for many years when it finally started to fail. It wouldn't empty the tank completely leading to a partially filled cup. It worked well for such a long time that I didn't hesitate to purchase the new model. Well the new one performs just fine but the shape has been changed. The new shape is a bit futuristic and is difficult to fill without spilling some water on the countertop. The old shape had a square top which presented a large area to lean the cup against when filling. The new shape has a pointed and curved area at the top which requires greater accuracy when pouring the water into the tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent to wrong Address!","review":"This product was misdirected by USPS so didn't arrive at my home for three weeks after the promised date.

Maybe I just wound up with bad one, but BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for one!","review":"I love this one cup coffee maker. It's fast and easy to clean. Automatic shut off is a plus. I had tried the Toastess and there is no comparison. The B&D is better quality for the money. The Toastess took forever and is very cheaply made. Great product! Only down side is you can't use extra large coffee cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Desktop Accessory","review":"I love this product. It is perfect for the desktop and perfect for just one cup of coffee when you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For warm coffee drinkers...","review":"If you like cooled off coffee you'll like this coffee maker. Water flows thru so fast that the water does not get hot. It is also difficult to pour water into the top of the coffee maker without it spilling outside. Great idea - wish water was hot and you were able to use your coffee cup to pour the water into the base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker Single Serve Coffee Maker","review":"I was not happy with this coffee maker for several reasons. First of all, my coffee cups would not fit into the area under the drip spout. Secondly, it did not keep the coffee warm. Our previous single coffee maker had a warming plate where the coffee cup sat and kept the coffee hot. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ol' faithful...","review":"I love my coffee maker. Hubby is not a coffee drinker so just 1-2 cups I drink per day, this is PERFECT. My daughter had to have one when she left home for college. Maybe I'm lucky (or maybe it'll break tomorrow because I state this...) but I've had mine over 15 years. It gets a daily workout and makes perfect coffee each time. Although the 'fad' is getting a pre-made coffee 'pod' these days, my comparison in price is NOT a drive through coffee shop price so to me, the pods are expensive. I would HIGHLY recommend this coffee maker and it doesn't take up much counter space."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd One Wasn't Good","review":"Update:After a couple of years, my coffeemaker started leaking badly. At this price I threw it out and bought a new one because I loved it. The new one improved the size of the cup you can use, however, it leaked badly from day one. I had to stop using it. I can no longer recommend it.This simple coffeemaker makes a decent cup of coffee in no time flat! It takes up hardly any room on my counter and the coffee is hot. The only reason I rated it four stars and not five is that there is a an unpleasant residue in the bottom of my cup because you can't use a paper filter. So I don't drink the last sip and I am good to go! Also, you can't fit a large mug in it - the picture is deceiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time saver","review":"Love this one cup wonder. Just what I was looking for. Got a similar one for my husband to use at work that dispenses into a travel mug.

It makes great tasting coffee and the automatic shut off means I don't have to worry about a fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, with 3 flaws","review":"I am very happy with this coffeemaker, and am able to make my one cup of coffee a day. I use natural colored #1 filters, and that makes cleanup simple. I have 3 complaints, but am happy overall.1. The dripper continues to drip once the coffee is finished. It drips after you take the cup out (no matter how long the cup is left there) and then it even drips after I take out the used filter to throw away. So, trying to keep away the coffee stains is not really possible, and it makes this a bit messy.2. You have to fill you coffee cup with water and then pour into the tank. It is almost impossible to do this without spilling a little water down the side of the cup, which leaves you with a wet counter. Also, leaves a little remnant water in the cup.3. It does not fit any cup taller than the normal cup size. Sometimes I would prefer a slightly larger cup, but it will not fit the cup under the dripper, and it will not hold enough water to fill it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for a gift, may have to buy myself one.","review":"I bought the coffee maker for my 91 year old mother. It is hard to find one of these in the stores. I was surprised at how quicly I received the item. My Mom loves this coffee maker and has convinced me I need one too. I think she may be right. It does exactly what it states on the box, is a perfect size for a small kitchen and gets the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Decker one cup coffee maker","review":"My old way of making one cup used a cone on top of the cup and heating the water in a microwave. By comparison this product requires about one half of the coffee ( I think because the hot water remains in contact with the grounds longer). Good product in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"The cup-at-a-time is great! A fresh cup of coffee in about one minute. Who can beat that?? Not even Starbucks! Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life span","review":"After about two weeks of use the coffee maker failed. I now heat water and pour through a one cup maker. Guess it was my fault that I bought a cheapie rather than a goodie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we needed","review":"This arrived a day before it was scheduled so we were pleased to begin with. We had another B&D single cup coffee maker for years, slightly larger version, and gave it to my father in law because he had a below the knee amputation and can't get up the stairs to the kitchen. He needed something small that would fit in the space in which he now lives (until a prosthesis lets him negotiate stairs better). This smaller version doesn't take up much space, has it's own filter so we don't have to go buy them, is easy to clean up and makes good single cup coffee quickly. The only down side, same as with the one we had preciously, is that if you put too much coffee in the filter it will boil out of the filter into the boiler and sometimes onto the counter. Makes a mess! I still give it 5 stars because it's inexpensive, reliable, and does everything we intended. When I need stronger coffee I use another cheap, small machine that makes espresso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee maker","review":"Heats the water to 180 degrees F which is hot enought to brew green tea and make a good cup of coffee. It is well worth the amount of money I paid for it. I do recomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cup at a time by Black & Decker","review":"Makes great coffee, quickly. about 2 min. Just enough for you when you first get up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong second choice","review":"This great little coffee maker is just slightly second as my favorite behind the Brew 'N Go. When I don't want a full 15 oz cup of coffee, I'll use this little jewel. It's so fast! Can you tell I might drink a lot of coffee? Ha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I would recommend this microwave to anyone looking to put one in a kitchen island or under the counter. It's sleek design compliments my kitchen without being a focal point. Plus I love the fact that my grandson can't toddle over to it an simply open the door. It works great and is worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too informative","review":"This item is not at all what I had thought. I was seeking a guide more practical than Lawtons but still informative. It is merely a list of moss names and where they fit in bryophyte taxonomy. I soon sought book recommendations from professional botantists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre to say the most!!","review":"I guess I am one of those who just does not get this movie! I found it boring and difficult to sit through for 130 minutes. I guess there is supposed to be a point to all the madness, but I never saw it. There was no plot, and the acting was poor in most cases. In my opinion, there are far better movies out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly balanced report","review":"In the preface, the author reveals his former gung-ho attitude toward welfare handouts and his gradual introduction to the realities of red tape and political expediency which constantly interfere with giving any real help to the poor. Because he approaches the topic as a researcher, his observations are not as weighed down with bias as in some books on the topic. And so the book is interesting for two reasons: it offers some productive suggestions for reform, and gives insight into one activist's disenchantment with partisan platitudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite homemade...but darn close!","review":"these were the best stuffed grape leaves i have had since i left fla. they are also the canned choice of our local greek festival in atl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analysis","review":"Arna Bontemps delivers an overview that is often overlooked in American history books, the African American migration. Bontemps decribes the hardships and struggles of Africans searching for a better life. To really enjoy the drama and detail of this novel, you must realize the impact that African Americans had on the history of America. I believe that this book gives a great presentation of black americans depicting the theme of hope, with disappointment, and love of life, and the struggle to gain that, any place but here (in the South). Although it is not grand reading material, you will learn a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-math text","review":"I tried using this text for a Liberal Arts undergrad course, and I would never use this book again. The jokey writing style is patronizing, offensive and ultimately fails to provide a viable alternative to a more traditional approach. Some of the examples and proofs are erroneous (that of the Brouwer fixed point theorem, for example). The pious pronouncements about \\"effective thinking\\" are just cynical and disingenuous. I had to include a large amount of supplementary material just to explain how to do the exercises, which the authors never bothered to do. They were to busy dropping trou and pandering.You have heard of \\"truthiness\\"? Well, what this book has is \\"mathiness\\". It gives the appearance of presenting mathematical ideas in an effective way, when in fact it does no such thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The product was fine...but this may be the worst math book you could buy! Get something IB (International Baccalaureate) approved."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disagree with the implied goal of this book","review":"I disagree with the implied goal of this book to give people who are unable and/or unwilling to learn mathematics an easy way to fulfill a mathematics requirement. When are mathematicians going to face the fact that not everyone can enjoy and do mathematics? Do we ask students to read Dr. Seuss in fulfillment of a literature requirement?The world is already filled with too many people who think they understand mathematics and who are practicing mathematics. The real challenge is to educate those who are able and willing to learn mathematics and ensure that mathematics is applied competently.But if one wants to make a buck selling mathematics books, this is the way to do it.

I can't imagine ANYONE wanting to read a story about lunatics rioting, a family running from a burning apartment, cats lost in the fire, and a reference to a \\"dead body without arms\\"(turns out to be a mannequin) to a 4-8 year old. The the overwhelming tragedy of the story out-weighs any redeeming message that might be hidden within. Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark and scary","review":"I was horrified to read this book to my children. For the vast majority, this book is unnecessarily scary and negative. It may have a \\"redeeming message\\" and perhaps would be useful in a situation where a child might really face these horrors. BUt the average family would be better off avoiding this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid, this book creates negative stereotypes.","review":"Must aggree with other negative posts. Although the author has good intentions, this book is too complex for kindergarteners who may sadly create negative stereotypes of Blacks based on the depictions in the book.However, this book may be appropriate for childeren who have encountered urban riots and other street violence.Unfortunately I will have to solicite my child's kindergarten library to remove the book or at least place a warning indicating the book contains complex social issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new view of urban violence","review":"Bunting takes a bold step by bringing the LA riots to life through the eyes of a child. Though not the ideal bed time story, Smoky night is worth being read. It conveys the message of the effects of urban violence on a child but also tells a beautiful tale of coming together. Daniel and his cat stare out their apartment window at the streets below as people loot the stores. He can not understand why this is happening, how people can look angry and happy at the same time. As Daniel and his mother sleep, a fire breaks out in their building. In the confusion their cat is lost as well as the cat of Mrs. Kim, a Korean shop owner where Daniel's mother never goes. Perhaps a tad cornybut effective is Bunting's use of the two cats coming together to find comfort and security in a time of crisis. The illustrations of David Diaz fill the pages with bright neon colors. His use of multi media to create unique chaotic pictures, complimentary to the story being told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for this age group!","review":"While this book attempts to view the LA riots through the eyes of a child, it never actually gives any historical context, thus making the likelihood of the reader's understanding less and less with each passing year. The only tolerance shown in the book is by cats, and while young children identify with animals, this moral is a stretch even to adults. The artwork is lovely, but that only serves to highlight the poor and age-inappropriate story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent illustrations","review":"The collages in this book are very creative. It's interesting to see what the illustrator uses to create the backgrounds. The pictures and the story work very well together. The story has a moral at the ending that makes this book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"My daughter brought this book home from her school library and after reading the book to her I couldn't believe this would be available in a kindergarten library. It is very disturbing! I believe it has a good message but the details are too vivid for a 5 year old. Daniel sees people stealing from stores, sleeps in his clothes because he may have to get out in the middle of the night, has to escape a fire, and sees \\"a dead man with no arms\\" which turns out to be a manequin! I would look for other books about people of different races coming together in crisis that aren't so scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoky Night","review":"This sad story I reccomend to pet lovers everywhere.

That alone was enough to make me return the book--NO dog collar should poke or choke! There's also lots of info about cats, which is legitimate enough, but since most readers will be training one or the other, and not both, this amounts to wasted text (for which you pay). I'd recommend going online and digging up some info on getting your dog into film or TV, and buying a book like Dog Tricks for Dummies in the meantime. Cute cover, but I returned this one because of the choke-collar issue. FYI, I have an energetic German Shepherd who I pleasantly and successfully trained 100% through positive methods.

I guess whoever produced this dvd figured that by bleeping out the worst offending vulgarities it would qualify as family entertainment. I do not agree.

Visited over Thanksgiving and popped it in that evening. Was sad that the content was so often sexual/racy. He's such a funny and talented guy - I don't think he has to go down that road.

I haven't seen the bonus features yet, but the main feature almost put me to sleep in spots.

This one should never have been targeted for Christmas (not sure why they tried - it has little actual holiday humor). His previous disks have so much funny stuff about real people, and all kinds of people, so we could all relate. This one tends to really target, with mean/almost angry humor, specific groups of people. The only part of this disk I really enjoyed was when \\"Guitar Guy\\" was on stage and cracking up.

I didn't know there were so many names for a woman's breasts. And there were so many references to drugs and drug use that it got boring, especially when directed at \\"Guitar Man\\". Even Peanut, who is my favorite, came off as mean. Usually he is the cute one with a bit of edge. But this time he wasn't cute or funny. I think Dunham wanted to have a Christmas special but just didn't have the material and went ahead anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Jeff Dunham and think he is great!

But then, I was shocked at how poorly Christipher Golden wrote his character. Pike went from a street wise mechanic with an alcohol problem to a taxi driving beach bum who, despite his superior fighting skills, has given up the good fight to simply ignore it. HORRIBLE characterization of Pike. When I think of Pike, I choose to omit this novel. If I could, I would unread this book. I love Christopher Golden and Pike, but this book is an accurate representation of neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be a script for a NEW Buffy movie","review":"This book was very well written. It was good to see that Christopher Golden brought parts of the original movie into the book. A face from Buffy's past enters back into Buffy's life unexpectedly. Her old flame from Los Angles. Pike( who was played by Luke Perry in the movie). This puts Buffy's love life into a spin when she has to decide which man she loves most, Angel or Pike. Pike's coming to Sunnydale was not personal, he needed Buffy's help to destroy a Stone Demon that he got really mad. All this and the usual magick from Willow, quiet coolness from Oz, fighting between Xander and Cordy, and the usual British remarks from Giles makes for some really good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning Instrument","review":"This is a great way to start off learning to play.

Musically, hip-hop is still an influence, but so are blues, funk, soul and more. Butler drops his half-rhymes, half-songs like honey over the grooves, adding to the smoke-filled atmosphere. Lyrically Butler talks about everything from the state of the industry to his take on love relationships - its all done with a strong sense of irony.Fans of Digable Planets should not expect more of the same - Cherrywine is definitely a departure.

The beauty and the beast story and its variations can be extremely entertaining and there are countless examples in romantic and, particularly, regency fiction - too countless to name here. Any of the romantic review sites will give you long lists in this sub-genre. This one, however was just simply credulous. Angela Lacewood never aroused any sympathy in me and Lucius (and boy did the author make a mull of his title - it was given in several ways and usually wrongly) was too ill-drawn to make me at all attracted to him (a \\"must\\" with romantic fiction!).

After some research I found it would fit the rear springs on this vehicle (any MKIV VW, non-R32).I do occasional towing with my car. The car has plenty of power to tow what I need. I tow two different trailers, one is a two place snowmobile trailer and another is a popup camper with a total weight of about 1900 lbs. The airbags do a great job of leveling the rear end. In the past I would have the rear of the car sagging, which would also lift the front end, making traction hard to obtain on slick surfaces as well as point my headlights up. With the camper this became a problem because I had very little ground clearance on the back of the vehicle, and many times the hitch would scrape on dirt roads, etc.This kit does a great job of leveling the car, and giving me more clearance. Of course when I do not need the extra height, I deflate the airbags down to 5 psi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toaster","review":"I've had plenty of toasters over the last five years; mostly cheap (under $20) types.

The only thing that I can't say is how long it lasts. Most of my toasters fall apart after 6 months so I'll have to wait a little while to see how this one lasts, but absolutly no complaints at this time.(update) It's now been two years and the toaster still works as well as it did on day one!

I was looking to upgrade since my old toaster (a toastmaster) was cranked to the highest setting and needed to go through two toast cycles to lightly brown. I am seriously disappointed with this toaster. I put my english muffin in and only half the muffin toasts, and that half usually ends up burnt. The slots are slanted forward, and it seems that when the muffin is in the toaster, it is the upper portion that over toasts, and the lower portion comes out essentially raw. Though my toastmaster was only 6 years old or so, and had to go through two cycles....it still toasted better then this T-Fal. I bought it several weeks ago and have only used it a handful of times, I am going to try to clean it up good and return it for some other brand.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"My husband and I bought this toaster looking to upgrade. This toaster was the biggest waste of money. Sounds like many other reviewers had trouble with their toast being burned, but we couldn't even get that far. From the moment we took it out of the box, we had trouble even getting the toasting lever to stay down. After a couple of months it wouldn't stay down at all, and we'd have to stand there holding the lever down to get the toaster to work.

My second one - the wires work but it does not toast evenly at all! Half the time portions are burned, even at a lower setting of 3-4. I don't see it being a whole lot faster, either. I've gone through a half/loaf of bread testing it and I am not happy. I appreciate the reviews on Amazon and checked here to see the comments on this product. It looks like the two good reviews were from a year ago, so perhaps the manufacturing has gotten sloppy. But my old, cheap, unattractive toaster does a better job than this!

I have several other high end cookware, and none of their handle gets hot like this (and all of them have a branched origin of the handles).Other than that, , the pan is very good. I would have given it 5 stars, , but I think the hot handle should take it down by 2 stars. I am very surprised that none of the other reviewers has mentioned this.This part is a follow up on the review I have done a while back.

However, it is awkward to hold and move due to the long thin solid metal handle supporting the heavy pan.However, the real difficulty is that the handle gets almost to the pan temperature. It also stays hot for a longer time than the pan probably due to the different metal in the handle. This presents an additional surface for small children to touch.I got this for my wife, and she bought their everyday round griddle for me. The round griddle is better balanced, and the handle looks to be improved. On the other hand, the non-stick looks different. It also isn't as heavy so it may not conduct heat quite as well and, therefore, not cook quite as well.However, we'll trade some perfection for a better balance of virtues."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!","review":"I bought this a couple of weeks ago. This is my first piece of Calphalon, but after my experience with this, I hope to own more pieces in the future (and get rid of my almost new Revere Ware which I do not like). It heats very evenly, making for perfect pancakes and grilled cheese sandwiches. I like it so well, I keep trying to think of other foods I can cook on it. Compared to the similiarly priced griddles I looked at in local stores, this is an absolute steal. The quality is excellent.A few people have mentioned that the handle gets hot on this particular griddle. I have only had a problem after having it on medium-hot heat for more than 15-20 minutes. At this point, it is a bit uncomfortable, but I don't think it would actually burn my hand. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hot to Handle","review":"The quality of the griddle itself is great; however, the metal handle becomes extremely hot after just a small time, and regardless of heat setting. ALWAYS have a pot holder handy before working with this piece of cookware. Also, it takes a long time to cool unless you run it under cold water after use. I would not recommend this product to people with small children who might want to grab the nice shiny - and scalding - handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"McDonald's best work to date.","review":"Ian McDonald's Desolation Road is undeniably his best book, a rich and vibrant tale of village life on a terraformed Mars. Reminiscent (intentionally) of the magic realist novels of Marquez and Llosa it transcends the science fiction genre without denigrating it, revelling in both worlds to the credit of each. This is one of those books that critics should hold up as an example of great writing in sf, especially because it won't disappoint even the most hardened veteran reader--literally, a book for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mars at its best.","review":"Absolutely bloody brilliant.Each chapter is beautifully written and the vast cast of characters is utterly memorable and compelling.The book is set in a mars that is being terraformed for human survival. McDonald plays with the characters, challenges your assumptions about what a Science Fiction novel should be and despite being around 20 years old it hasn't dated a bit. The Science rests mostly in the background but the more you notice it the more you realize that McDonald's research is impeccable.It just takes you on a ride, surprises you and then just when you think you have it figured out surprises you again. Page after page is filled with prose of the highest quality possessing a poetry, a rhythm and cadence to it that renders most other authors obsolete.Its actually the most un Science Fiction like on Mars that I have ever read and as with most of McDonald's work I didn't think that it was possible to do what he did until I actually read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get interested","review":"I read a lot of books and I read a lot of sci/fi.

Well, the only book I could find at the time was 'Fletch Won', and I'm glad. This book starts us out at the beginning of Fletch's illustrious and wild journalism career. Assigned to a story, then taken off it once the subject is murdered, Fletch decides to abandon all and find out the truth, despite the protests of the police, his rival reporter, his fiance, and the ever-present Frank.

There's only 1 song out of the fifteen that I don't like, and it's not even that bad, just bad compared to the rest. There's also a few songs that sound to similar and kind of blend together.While nothing on the CD can possibly compare to classics the likes of Mother's Little Helper, Satisfaction, or Paint it Black (then again, nothing can compare with them), it's still a rock solid album. The Stones have still got it!Enjoy.-PFC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thru & Thru","review":"This 1994 release is in my opinion their best post-1985 release to date. They primarily go more back to a more RS rootsy, stripped down sound and less pretenious, commercialized gloss that some of the mid 80's and after albums fell into.

It is a wonder, therefore, that they can still put out anything at all; especially a record as great as Voodoo Lounge. The first four tracks are some of the best they've done, ever.

The only thing you can say about their \\"Steel Wheels\\" album is that it produced a decent hit single, \\"Mixed Emotions.\\" For all intents and purposes though, that was the last gasp for these ossified geriatric rockers.Since then, the Stones have made nothing but trite and tiresome albums and \\"Voodoo Lounge\\" fits those catagories easily. This album is a real dud: it's a boring, lifeless recording that will put you to sleep. This album deserves a zero; don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another boring cd from a boring band !","review":"I have tried to listen to the Rolling Stones many times but the result is always the same, I just don't like their music. I don't understand why they are so big with so limited talent. Mick Jagger is not a signer, this band should consider themself very lucky to have been in the fisrt band in the history of Rock'n'Roll because I am sure they would never have such success if their career started in the 70's when there were many more bands to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ROLLING STONES!

It rocks like the old days and it has quite a few songs, some of which are memorable. What's most striking is that there is a return to a theme explored, in particular, on \\"Let it Bleed,\\" \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" and \\"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll.\\" Read the printed lyrics to see what I'm talking about. \\"Sparks Will Fly\\" is particularly outrageous. I have a hard time believing that people don't know what this song is about -- if you've never heard it, check it out. The Stones maintain their reputation as one of the most dangerous and outre bands with this CD. There's a lot to love here, especially if you like the Stones doing that old time rock 'n' roll. Buy it and find your own favorites. \\"Sweethearts Together\\" perfectly sums up the giddy mood of this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lekker CD","review":"This was my first Stone's CD. Today I am a real Stone fan. This CD is simply excellent. It is a bit different that the rest but that's way it is so good. It's got hard rock \\"I go wild\\", and it's got smooth tunes \\"The worst\\" and \\"New Faces\\". Listen to \\"Thru and Thru\\" four times and I promise you, you'll be addicted. I argue that a real Stone fan that doesn't recommend this CD is not a real Stone fan. It's lekker, I'm telling you, lekker."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM BUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN LESS TRACKS","review":"THIS ALBUM IS VERY GOOD, BUT THIS ALBUM SHOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO MAYBE 11 OR 12 TRACKS"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad, sad, sad","review":"If this wasn't the Stones, Voodoo Lounge would be used to back up beer commercials. The candle is out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good album.. close to great, but not quite","review":"VOODOO LOUNGE was the Stone's first album in probably 20 years to really usher in a new era in their career. Some Girls was phenominal, but Tattoo You marked their slow decline (although I liked the album). It was a precedent for how bad their albums would get through the decade. (Undercover, Emotional Rescue, Dirty Work). Steel Wheels only alluded to a new era, but Voodoo Lounge finally takes it to the next level.From the beginnin of Love is Strong, there is a unique kind of energy that the Stones never quite had. No doubt, they had unbridled energy through the 60s and 70s, as well as creative peaks. But nothing quite like the calculated powers they undertook with VOODOO LOUNGE. This is just what the Stones needed, and whats more- what the fans needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK BUT NOT GREAT","review":"Surprisingly enough this album was actually a little bit better than most of the garbage that the Stones have been bombarding us with recently. Okay, so its not Exile but its actually more listenable than Steel Wheels or (shudder)Undercover and Emotional Rescue. I actually kind of like love is strong, the worst, and through and through. Odd though that two of the best are by Richards.Anyway, this album is okay but dont expect anything great or original. Theres still the standard rockers about sex,three of which sound the same,and one dumb song which compares a girl to a car(thats really a new idea!)and one awful ballad called Sweethearts Together.Whats annoying about most of the songs is that they are so OBVIOUSLY TRYING to be macho, and they are in a kind of cartoonish and unrealistic way. It seems that back when Mick was androgonous and bisexual the Stones had more of an edge. Now it all seems to just be pretend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hex on it","review":"For the life of me I can't see why people prefer this to Steel Wheels. The songwriting is weak, bordering on lazy; the production by Don Was is bright and shiny MOR, which sucks the life out of the hard rock numbers; and the band performances are good but not exactly hot, although both Mick and Ron Wood are in nice form. Probably my least played Stones album."},{"rating":"1","title":"casio alarm clock","review":"Alarm does not work.. I guess I got what I paid for.

I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special...somewhat interesting but no mystery and no intrigue","review":"I love true crime and this sounded interesting simply because the man was put on trial 4 times for the same murder. But so much of this book is a waste of details about characters who don't have a thing to do with the killing or whether the accused is guilty, and they don't even have any connection to each other or the outcome of the trials, etc. There's no mystery, no intrigue. I think the author was simply filling up enough pages to make it long enough to publish. I kept reading part one thinking it would build up to something exciting in part two and that these characters would all fit together. But in part two, the author writes about the trials, not in any great detail, and mixes in more filler that is simply a waste of time and has nothing to do with anything. It was somewhat enjoyable but for all of those who sing its praises so highly, I have to wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this book. I was really looking forward to reading it because of all the positive reviews I had read. The only reason I gave it two stars is for the authors descriptions of Savannah and its residents. The book was very slow moving and there were characters introduced that were extensively discussed in the beginning but never reappeared in the book near the end. I also purchased the City of Falling Angels for my husband and he said the same thing about it. Nice description of the city but definitely not worth recommending to someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a novel but lacks suspense.","review":"I too picked up this book because of the attention it was receiving nationwide. I was drawn by the vivid portrayal of the city and the people but a little disappointed in the actual covering of the crime. Part of this is my fault, I went in expecting a suspenseful, gripping murder mystery to go along with the hype, but what I got was a trial drama. That's a problem with preconceived notions, but not with the book itself. An enjoyable read, especially for non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book's overrated, but the title is a \\"10\\"","review":"I went into this book expecting a really good read. I am genuinely mystified as to how this book became a best-seller. The characters, though colorful and often humorous (even over-the-top), are feebly developed... a series of personality vignettes that wander in and out of the book, with very little to bind them cohesively into the story or to each other. Ultimately, I still didn't know any of them well by the end of the book, and frankly, didn't care. As to the murder-mystery itself, I felt Berendt did just enough homework to pass with a \\"C\\". Hugely overrated, quite unsatisfying and disappointing. A slam-bang sexy title, though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is barely readable and the cassette is WORSE!","review":"I have to say that I have not enjoyed this book. I listened to the audio tapes while commuting and I thought the narrator was awful. The narrator talks really slow and makes the book extremely boring. I guess he thinks that to sound southern one must talk in long, drawn out monotone. Moreover, it is startling to hear him use some of the degrading, offensive, and racist language that is in the book. Plainly put, this book is useless drivel. Don't waste your money buying this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeper of the Year!!! -- Insomniacs Assoc.","review":"I have just finished this incredibly boring book about people and there lives that I could not care less about. The characters are not well defined and the circumstances and events that surround them are loosely tied together with some exhausting decriptive narrative of useless flowers and colors and streets and surroundings.

John, you did such a wonderful job that I just know it will all look exactly like I picture it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"A wickedly funny book about a collection of eccentric and irrestible characters in Savannah. John Berent wraps the stories of these people around the tale of a real life murder and the trial of the Savanah socialite accused of the murder. Reading like a group of short stories, held together by the story of John Williams rise and fall in Savannah society, it is one book that makes you want to book a plane trip there tomorrow. Laugh out loud funny in many spots, incredible in others, a book you will think about long after finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding -- makes you drive slower!","review":"I listened to the 10-tape unabridged audiobook.

I found it impossible to put this book down, partly because I was laughing so hard and partly because I was learning so much. At first I felt cheated because it wasn't a true story, but then I just fell in love with the narrative and no longer cared. Read this book if you're going on vacation or taking a long plane ride.

A fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know these people...and I'm from Texas!","review":"I read \\"Midnight\\" when it first came out. I am happy for the author's success, but I can tell you that anyone from a small town in the South could write a story just like it.The South has long been famous for its eccentrics. I grew up in a small town goverend by much the same rules as the ones that rule Savannah's society. A lady NEVER wore velvet after Valentine's Day, nor did she dare wera white shoes after Labor Day. Card games were as important as anything that happened on Wall Street and one's ancestors were to be honored. Perhaps I wasn't taken to the cemetary with a picnic basket and a pitcher of martinis, but I know all these people...or characters just like them. They're Southerners and they're my friends.I have no intentions of seeing the movie. I understand Eastwood butchered the book's story...what a pity. Maybe that explains the movie's poor showing.

Woodman's accents are right on! Ordinarily, I choose audio books merely for the sake of convenience and entertainment on car trips, but I am so happy that I listened to his performance rather than reading the book myself.

As usual and not surprising, the book is much better than the movie. From the beginning of the story when the author spoke to his editor and said after spending some time in Savannah that NYC was boring I was hooked (as I was living in Manhattan for some time when I read this book).The characters were rich, vibrant, and one more eccentric than the next. The narrative of the city, weather, culture, and personalities was fun, funny, and created vivid images. It was a tragic story in so many ways with real and flawed characters.

How could the author possible have captured every word out of the mouths of the people he is writing about? Did he have a tape recorder with him at all times? (Unlikely, considering the occasions he describes supposedly being present at.) Does he have a superhuman memory? Hardly. Therefore, he made up about 90% of it. In addition, he ascribes thoughts, feelings, and reactions to people that he couldn't possibly know about - such as a \\"smile playing about\\" someone's lips when he clearly wasn't there to see it (and what a cliche THAT is). The book is also poorly structured, consisting as it does of the history of Savannah, long dull descriptions of so-called local 'characters' (which I skipped), and a murder and its trials. The result is a dog's dinner without any credibility. If it's a novel, say so at the front, don't pretend it's an accurate account.

The author attempts to introduce us to the town's most eccentric folks. As the introductions drag on, one starts to wonder where the story was going on. When part 2 opens with the murder of the hot-blooded lover of a dubiously gay socialite, I figure that it is a whodunit. But it isn't.

At one point, I thought the thing was going to pick up with some whodunnit, murder-mystery, courtroom drama. But no, just never-ending trials and re-trials. The book goes absolutely nowhere.And as for \\"did he murder Danny Hansford?\\" Who knows? Who cares? Dreadful.

That delightful novel, just released, about the quirky community of Selby...a town with many similarities to Aiken, SC...also is told from the perspective of a Northerner in the South and reminded me of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, one of my favorite books.

I found the author's descriptions to be completely dry and drab, considering the topic. The only reason we might consider Savannah a eccentric, unusual, and colorful place is because the author keeps telling us we should, not because he's written it that way.

That's because the book doesn't have much of an ending! I think the author just ran out of musings to jot down in his notebook.

I haven't seen the movie yet, but I understand it is pretty weak as well, so perhaps I'll save myself further torture and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book so popular?","review":"This book is not well written. One winces at the long, laughably unconvincing dialogue passages that are simply exposition...e.g at a cocktail party where each guest chimes in with another chunk of Savannah history...the only colorful character is the black transvestite Chablis... at least she doesn't talk second rate jounalism, but talks instead about herself. Most of the anecdotes about colorful types in Savannah are trite, overdrawn, unconvincing.Very slow for first hundred pages.I'm astonished the reading public has the patience to slog through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eccentric, but very enjoyable","review":"This was a really enjoyable true crime book. I loved the eccentricities of all the characters! I also very much enjoyed the description of Savannah. I felt like I was there. I was so impressed that a writer from NY could come into a city like Savannah & obtain the kind of detail that Berendt was able to obtain. What a wonderful job of storytelling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I simply enjoyed the book. I also saw the film! Excellent!","review":"John Berendt, along with actor-director, Clint Eastwood, did an excellent job describing a southern town full of secrets -- even deadly ones. This book deserves to be on the best-selling list and people living in small southern towns should get a kick of knowing that a person can come into ones' town and reveal many things that tourists are not aware of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Book","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. Lots of historical information. I also recommend my book with related information-ANOTHER SIXTH SENSE:The Fort Lauderdale Story by Brian Roesch."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the movie first","review":"This is the ONLY book I've ever read which has been brought to life better as a movie than on paper. You've got to see Lady Chablis for yourself!And the core of tbe plot is supposed to be an upperclass gentleman's trial for murder, but the trial's just not that interesting. And then there's a retrial...and another one...and another one...On the other hand, I appreciated a lot of the book's details that were left out of the movie. Like the author, I'm a native yankee who moved to the south...and that, in itself, is an inside joke. If you're a yankee who's never spent a good amount of time in the south, or if you're born-and-bred southern, you probably won't \\"get\\" the quirky yet true-to-life phrases, customs, and lifestyles which Mr. Berendt subtly but honestly portrays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This national bestseller from John Berendt is a fascinating text that is both comical and compelling. A book that is best read slow, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil gifts us by closely observing the all too human, if not eccentric citizens that inhabit the city of Savannah, Georgia. For those who find real life more exciting than any fiction, this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a wickedly funny book with a diverse and always interesting cast of characters. The story revolves around a suspect antiques dealer but eventually encompasses many more inhabitants that are true Savannahian. They gleefully air all of their dirty laundary, and oftentimes embrace it also. Berendt creates an unforgettable atmosphere and ultimately a book that will undoubtedly become a classic. However, this book should be accompanied with a warning label: Read only with an open mind and black sense of humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An observer's sharp-eyed tale of Savannah","review":"I'm sure this has been said 1,000 times in the other reviews: this is a non-fiction work that reads like a novel. Berendt was no doubt aided by a bit of seredipity in that the trials of Jim Williams provide him with a stong narrative line to the book. But all kudos to Berendt: he found Williams on his own before the critical incidents took place, and he also formed relationships with a whole series of interesting characters in the Savannah environs.Berendt brings a city to life as no other writer in recent times has done. I just finished 'The Masters,' in which the author tried to weave the same magic about Augusta and the words just seemed to lay flat on the page. Berendt's character and geographical studies are clinics in fresh, insightful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly intuitive look at the secrets of the south","review":"Midnight ... is a suspenseful and inviting look at the south undercover. Raised in the south I was \\"protected\\" from much of the intrigue that happens down there. Berendt takes us into the opulent wealth of high society and invites us into their secrets, and the murder trial was a timely event that illustrates the attitudes of the community towards scandal. Ultimately this book, a \\"scandalous success\\" in itself, speaks about the unspeakable, the chips beneath the veneer and high shine of priceless and \\"flawless\\" furniture, the imperfect and disturbing nature of a society consumed by image."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the truth is more engaging than fiction.","review":"John Berendt takes his place in the Garden as a quiet and careful watcher. With a place in his heart for those he observes, he reports his findings with charm and humor. Not one to let an opportunity for adventure pass, he finds himself involved with the lives of those he watches. We come to find him at a drag show, in a cemetary at midnight with a voodoo priestess and on the sidelines of the juciest scandal to rock Savannah in quite some time. His ability to watch and be involved without passing judgment is a skill most of us would probably find hard surrounded by such encentric folks. A true tale spun with heart and wit, this is recommened reading for anyone that knows life should be looked with a sense of humor and an open mind. One may not find what they expect but they will enjoy a tale well told"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful story","review":"Rich, full-bodied storytelling with a twisted sense of humor. After you read this book you feel as if you've been given the privilege of an inside tour of Savannah, Georgia and a thorough history of the town. That the book is based on a true story makes it all the more delicious. Loved every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the story","review":"I am planning a trip to Savannah and read this book as 'research'. The book was well written and I could \\"see\\" the city, buildings, and people in my mind. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"This book by John Berendt is an amazing one. Wasn't sure what it would be about when first started reading other than had heard it was a true story. The book is filled with unusual and interesting characters that I will remember for a long time. Rather than deal with the history of Savannah that many would write he tell of the characters, the people, the stories that they can tell and live. A wonderful experience after visiting there.J.

That is one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring.","review":"I read the whole book, but it took days to finish. I found it very easy to put down and walk away from. I was very disappointed. After all the publicity and great reviews, I expected to be captured and unable to stop reading...Wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated tabloid tripe.","review":"I eagerly looked forward to reading this book but was awfully disappointed.Throughout the book the author basks in the reflected lightof the eccentricities and foibles of some admittedly colorfulcharacters, but, aside from stroking his own ego, never really shows any good reason for his ownpresence in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A general rolling of the eyes","review":"To use a Southernism worthy of my grandmother: \\"Oh, please.\\" This airy, feather-weight book is nothing but the rehash of every Southern stereotype to come down the well-worn pike since long before Faulkner and Welty. We might even be talking pre-Glasgow here. I did not sigh, cry, and die as I read it. I thought, well, the sure way, once you are living in Manhattan, to get a book published is to make your way down South and see what the rubes are up to. Read Penn Warren or O'Connor if you want to soak in this murky nostalgia for the Southern eccentric. And then move on, for goodness sake"},{"rating":"1","title":"I said the hell with it after plodding through 200 pages.","review":"I kept plodding along, page after dull page, searching for whatever it was that so many other people had apparently found interesting in this book. After more than 200 pages, I gave up. I'm forced to conclude that this was one of those cultural phenomena where people buy something or go to see something because it somehow became fashionable. And, once having been duped, nobody wants to admit it, so they continue to recommend it to others. Because of the book experience, I have no interest in seeing the movie version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"All I knew of this book was that it was about a murder. Throughout the first half of the book, I kept hoping the next new charachter introduced was the murder victim. By the time Danny was killed, I was hoping some type of nuclear explosion went off and killed everyone in that pretentious, egomaniacal, worthless town. I still hope it happens. Every day was a struggle to get through this crap. When I was done, I couldn't say I learned anything, except never to go to Georgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"This is by far the worst book I've ever read, and I have read a lot of books. I lent the book to two friends who are avid readers and they two thought it was terrible. There is absolutely no plot, just character descriptions. There was no talent required to write this book as many people have their own unique experiences in life. It does teach a valuable lesson: just because a book is marketed well doesn't mean it's interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have missed something!","review":"I cannot for the life of me understand all the five-star and four-star ratings! I forced myself to finish it hoping that it would get better, but it didn't--at least not to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book.","review":"Read the book and/or watch the very underrated movie.

The book is awful.

You have been warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"Parts of this book were good and other parts were hard to follow. It was some what confusing and i dont understand the real point of this book, i am not finshed with this book, i am on page 300 somthen and it has yet to get better. This book has no point to it. It was given to me by a friend. I read it but i would not be interested in ever reading it again. i would not give this book to just anyone. Only people i thought were boring and had nothing better to do than waste their time for 3 hours or so reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overgrown with weeds","review":"Unless you have a real fetish for the city of Savannah, this book is just a generic tourist guide. It's nothing more than a novel of manners with themes we've all heard about before: old money against new money (Great Gatsby), the taboo of homosexuality, a high profile murder case (OJ Simpson, anyone?). There seems to be many unconnected events not connecting. The prose is flowery at best, confined by the inanities of nonfiction. Skip the book and watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Ever Believe the Hype","review":"I've read great reviews about this book so I finally bought it because I could not get it at my local library. Never ever finished the book - it was god-awful. Badly written, incoherent story - it jumped around - JUST PLAIN BAD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for everyone.","review":"This is a book that you can not put down until you have finished it. The characters are all real people that you either like or hate, but you can not stay neutral"},{"rating":"2","title":"Savannah, the city & high society come alive!!","review":"It's more than a story of a true crime; it about Savannah and her people;It's an intimate look at the mystique of southern high society & culture -Savannah comes alive as never before.Berendt has the ability to make you feel that you are livingthe experience. The city & character come alive in full color;after you finish the book you'll want to visit Savannah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This refers to the abridged audio CD....YUCK!","review":"I bought this CD for a few reasons: I LOVED the text version of \\"Midnight;\\" I adore Anthony Heald; I needed something to listen to on a Friday night driving a long distance with my baby daughter in tow. Two words: P and U. First off, whoever was in charge of abridging stunk: lots of repetition (we hear that Berendt lived in Savannah eight years over and over again). Also, a listener who has not read the book misses out on the Lady of 6,000 Songs and other characters (you're only introduced to Jim Williams, Joe Odom, the Lady Chablis, and Danny Hansford). At three discs, it ends way too soon. The main emphasis is on Jim's trial. Heald is fantastic at doing all the voices...he is the one redeeming factor in this mess. Very very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two very good books, one (almost) great book","review":"I loved Berendt's evocation of the ambience of Savannah and his cast of eccentric characters. I also loved the 'mystery' story. He has a gift for dialogue, place and character. It would have been better if he'd integrated the ambience theme more effectively with the mystery story so that the whole was greater than the parts. As it is when the two fall together it seems contrived rather than inevitable or natural. Still, it is a wonderful book and definitely rates as one of my top reads so far this year (a bit behind Wild Swans, Primary Colors and Snow Falling on Cedars)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptively attractive evil.","review":"This is a dangerous book.

Fast, efficient, with no unpleasant surprises!! I would recommend both to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read!","review":"I read this book after a trip to Savannah. It was referenced numerous times on the tours. Having been to Savannah helped the book to come alive. When a location was mentioned, you would know exactly where the book was referencing.The characters in the book were excentric and made for a fascinating read. I couldn't put the book down. I had to keep reading to see what was going to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding! I loved it!!!","review":"I had resisted reading this book because it was a \\"bestseller.\\" Usually bestsellers bore me. Although many people I know had read it and enjoyed it, I still resisted until an article in the NY TIMES recently sparked my interest. The article was about how Mercer House in Savannah is up for sale, reportedly for almost $9 million. I ordered the book from Amazon, and I haven't read a book which isn't a biography or history in a long time that I enjoyed as much as this one. Berendt is a masterful storyteller, the characters literally jump off the page and shake your hand! When you think you've just met the most outrageous character, along comes another one! I absolutely could not put it down, and now I want to go to Savannah. Recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST! WHAT A GREAT BOOK! I LOVED IT!","review":"I couldn't put this book down. The characters and story were some of the most intriguing I've read. Who would have thought non-fiction would be so completely engrossing and exciting! An easy read and a great vacation destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST non-fiction book ever !","review":"Most books bore me, but this book grabbed my attention and would not let go. Very captivating. I have been to Savannah and reading this book sent me right back to the historic district. John's portrail of the city is majical. I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a good book. If you intend to see the movie you may be dissapointed, the movie doesn't have half the humor or charm of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down","review":"I was shocked to find out that this was true story.

Then again I wouldn't want any midnight graveyard dirt ending up on my porch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eccentric and unpredictable amazing true story.","review":"I am a fan of non-fiction stories that \\"tell\\" a story...this is why I picked this book up...I had seen the movie and was baffled by this story..how could this be true ?? The array of people in this story makes it quite interesting, yet barely believeable. I admit the story drags a bit, as we wait the fate of Jim Williams, however, by the time we find out, we already know what will happen based on the happenings in Savannah...Minerva is really cool...I think some of us could benefit from her !!! Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"the south will continue","review":"I loved the description of Savannah and could see the dogwood trees and the sqare.

I already knew it was an intriguing murder story but I was caught off-guard by all the wonderful peripheral characters who are all-the-more fascinating for being real. The whole tale moves along quickly but never feels rushed. It's as fun, wicked, and filled with wit as one of Jim Williams's Christmas parties probably was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off intriguing, goes nowhere","review":"I too am mystified as to how this book became such a runaway best seller. The book starts out well, introducing us to a cast of crazies and describing Savannah in such a rich way that we are immediately drawn in. Unfortunately, the subsequent murder story with Jim Williams seems tacked on, and amounts to little more than a rehash of the verdicts in his four trials. In the end, the book seems to be more of a long magazine article than a cohesive work of non fiction. A major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Non-Fiction?!","review":"I bought the book because of the movie and could never get over the fact that it was, indeed, non-fiction. The characters of Savannah, GA come alive thanks to John Berendt's excellent writing and skill at putting the scene into your imagination. Anyone who has been to Savannah will appreciate the way in which Berendt crafts the story and love him and the book that much more.If you loved the movie, you HAVE to read the book. If you've done neither, skip the movie and soak in one of the best non-fiction stories you'll ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savannah - Doing it their way.","review":"This nonfiction novel certainly put Savannah on the map and on my list of places to visit.Between its parks,colonial architecture,graveyard and most of all its collection of \\"originals\\" it must be worth the trip.This tale of a true murder is,to say the least,ususual.It describes a society of old,new and no-money trying to survive in some kind of a time-capsule, the result is a surprising cocktail of voodoo adepts,nutcases,pseudo-scientists,odd ladies' clubs,sex in all its forms and other local originalities.Written with an enormous sense of humor it hits you as witty,scandalous and terribly entertaining. At some point you really start liking some of these oddballs.Is it possible not to adore the faithfull servant walking a Ghostdog??Without any doubt this is the best novel of its genre I have read.The movie was also extremely good."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a book this was!!!","review":"This was quite a book. I loved the characters- they gave the book a certain air of quirkyness (a word I am sure does not exist, but it will do to describe my feelings for the time being). You are introduced to one amazing character, and just as you are beginning to get over the effect they have played on you, the author then introduces you to yet another amazing person who will draw your attention. The author, John Berendt, had this unique way of grabbing my attention span and holding it up in midair. A favorite character I had was the Lady Chablis- a very interesting, attention grabbing, stunning character whom the author creatively wove into the book and it's plot, all the characters were actually woven into the plot to give a sense of Savannian society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just toured Savannah","review":"We heard about this book while touring Savannah.

After seeing a recent travel show on Savannah, featuring Chabilis, I had to read this book. I loved the conversational style of the book. Even though it is non-fiction, it reads just like a novel.

Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"A spellbinding tale of intrigue in the high society of Savannah, Georgia, John Berendt's \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" makes for an incredible recreational read. Berendt paints such a vivid picture of his characters and the world in which they live that, upon later recollection, one forgets that one gleaned this picture from text rather than from a beloved film. Few other books from the present day can claim such fine description. That is not to say, however, that this book is wordy; in fact, the opposite is true as the prose remains concise throughout the body of the work.Bottom line: Don't allow yourself to pass this one by!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long confusing title but still a great book","review":"Some books just have that \\"It\\" - charm, humor, style and all the quirks that help make a story memorable. Non-fiction has never been more fun - in fact I had to contiously had to remind myself that this is actually a true story! You wonder how this cast of characters could all exist in one city!The actual story revolves around a murder and if or if not it was committed. The accuses was prosecuted and convicted several times before he is finally freed. However, the true star of the story is the city of Savannah and all of the quirks that makes this city so unique.I highly recommend \\"Midnight in Garden of Good and Evil\\" to anyone who enjoys well written books. This is not your typical drug store paper back written for the masses - so if that is what you are looking for you may want to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonfiction? Historical?","review":"This book is broken into two parts, the murder mystery and the Characteristics of Savannah, which include people as well as places. The author chooses to put himself in as a character as he relates the information about the murder he has investigated. He introduces the murderer in the first chapter, then doesn't revisit him until chapter 11. In the meantime he tells the reader about Savannah, the culture of the people, the kinds of attitudes of the people, he describes the homes and the characters. I found the book cumbersome and boring. It was supposed to make me want to go see this magical place. It didn't. I would see the movie only to see how it would relate to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been titled The History of Savannah ....","review":"Most of the book is just the history of Savannah as seen through the eyes of the author. I read the book in order to try to figure out the movie but since they are almost nothing alike that was no help. I will say the selection of Kevin Spacey to play Jim Williams was a stroke of genius by Clint Eastwood. The latter part of the book is much better than the first half since it deals with the real story of Jim Williams and not all the unnecessary history of the bit players."},{"rating":"2","title":"book from Amazon","review":"Received the book very quickly and in good shape.

My practice of waiting until \\"bestsellers\\" hit the public library and then checking them out has paid off again! John Berendt must have cynically counted on the low expectations of the American reading public when he threw this book together. My greatest disappointment in the book was that the author didn't care enough about his project to tie any of the innumerable loose ends together. Characters appear at random. Some of them are connected with the \\"plot\\" and some apparently are just local color. I think I've put more thought into writing this review than Berendt did into writing the book.

It is a beautiful city with a ton of history. I love the old south as I grew up in Wilmington, NC. So I only naturally looked forward to reading a book which has received so many great reviews about this beloved city. Boy was I shocked. I hated the book. IT was full of vulgarities and filth. It made the people of Savannah seem so shallow and immoral. While no doubt that element of society exists in every city, I just cant believe people have been so quick to embrace this book. I found alot of it poorly written. I wish I had never read it as it paints Savannah so negatively. No doubt it has brought addtional fame and notoriety to Savannah, which Im sure has benefitted the tourism of the city - but at what cost?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it...","review":"This was for my mystery book club, and all I want to know is: Where's the mystery? It's basically a very long, drawn-out character study of some admittedly interesting people in Savannah, but it is slow, has very little plot, and is pretty boring.

This had no rattling parts, but the receptacle still would not hold a power cord reliably. I tested with ten different appliances and devices. In most cases, the power cord would immediately be popped back out of the line splitter. In the other cases, the cord would pop out a few minutes later, causing electrical arcing if the load was drawing current.It looks like Extech has made a bad batch of these where the receptacle is not compatible with standard power cords.

It should be noted that it is written by an AT Kearney dude and as an ex-EDSer I can see the resemblance of the consultants that made all consultants look bad.

Carol Page seems to have gone into this book with the desire to humiliate everyone she met and to attempt to make even well adjusted vampires come off as freaks and deviants. The best description I can give of this book is a textbook definition of biased slander. While some of those the writer speaks to live a life that is unusual to most people, they still invited her into that life with the assumption that she would treat them fairly and respectfully.

Then he made his first mistake. He titled it, and made a title character that is so unbelievable that the novel just dissolves into a poor effort.The story revolves around the murder trial of Elliot Ashford an ex-congressman with possible mob ties. All the lawyers in this case have hidden agendas and are well thought out. Barrett Dickson and Grace Harris are very well rounded and likeable. Then enters the alternate juror Amanda Keller. An ex-actress with delusions of grandeur. She starts by slowly breaking all the rules of being a juror and then things get messy.The Keller character is so unrealistic in this novel. Martel portrays the lawyers to be very competent, but even they get fooled by Keller which is hard to believe. Martel gets two stars for the surrounding characters, but no more due to Keller"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like legal thrillers, this is the one for you.","review":"In \\"The Alternate,\\" Martel brings you into the world of a high-profile trial and never lets you go. Unlike many practioners of the genre, he doesn't stint when it comes to sudden plot turns and unpredictability--you feel like you're in the hands of an expert, but an EXCITING expert.

Check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning--poor follow through","review":"The first half of this book is a better-than-average courtroom thriller, with well drawn characters and plot twists to keep one interested. Then it starts to fall apart. The plot twists become so implausible as to be ridiculous, the characteriztion becomes inconsistent and hackneyed, the court-room scenes degenerate and largely irrelevant strands are introduced.

You can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read but some silly mistakes","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down. I ended up staying up till 3am to finish it. The characters, especially Bear, are people we can relate to. Although, as another reviewer stated, things go along a predictable route, I enjoyed it anyway. Two points detracted from the book, however. There were way too many typos for a major publishing house. And there were several timing errors which did not make sense. In one paragraph it is 4:30 pm when Bear decides to go to a restaurant. In the next paragraph he gets to the restaurant at 4:00. Good trick. Somewhere else in the book it is Friday. The next day is also Friday. Things like this should not go unnoticed in the editorial process.

There is nothing protecting the device from your skin, so you have to be very careful not to burn yourself.The straightening feature works well enough, but leaves crimps in your hair if you are a novice.

Charles Day, Des Moines, IAWith One Voice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace in Our Times","review":"\\"With One Voice\\" is a film with an important message for our times. Mystics -- people who've come to realize the deepest truth of their spiritual/religious traditions (including Buddhist, Christian, Hebrew, Hindu, Moslem, Native American, Shamanistic and non-sectarian practices) -- speak from their direct experience about the peace that is available to each of us. This is a peace that is found within, not imposed or negotiated externally.

First of all the author seems like he is trying to be this big wig of a motorcycle club. The book was boring and all it did was go on and on about himself (the author).

But to someone who has at least a year or two of middle school or who isn't fascinated by old newspaper clippings of the 'biker wars' of the 80s and 90s it is absolute garbage. It really is almost unreadable.It's not the author's fault, really. Someone paid him to write a book ... a task that is clearly over his head. Hey ... I'd take the money, too. I blame the folks who should have told him the truth and saved him from embrarrassment. And speaking of those poor, misguided souls at the publisher, I must ask again ...Did he whack his editors?

He nothing but a little skinny wanna-be, a hey look at me dude, nothing better then a rat, a thief, a bike thief, he was/is so proud of that fact.

But then I discovered that you REALLY have to buff/polish the steel with the microfiber cloth to get it right. Granted, the surface you are cleaning has to already be pretty clean (so I have to 'preclean' my range). Also, the microfiber cloth has to be washed frequently. But it does work.

After calling Audiovox, they were not willing to do anything to help me out, nor even make sure that their product specifications on their own corporate web site's owner's manuals were accurate for their product.

He becomes clinically depressed, he can't eat, and he can't sleep. And ends up in a mental hospital. While in there he meets a variety of people whose lives are just as bad or even worse.

In complete honesty, this reminds me of the thirteen year old girl with the loving parents who cuts herself because she couldn't get the skirt she wanted because it made her look too slutty.Reading this book will not help you accomplish happiness.

Not every item may be applicable to your specific field ou activity, but the book contains much good practical infromation for the beginner and advanced chromatographer as well. It is also not dependent on specific configurations or system models and, therefore, more timeless and useful for anyone. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Kawaii!","review":"Wow! This has to be the best of Kawai's books thus far. I can't stop reading it! It's amusing how Hamtaro is so hopelessly in love with his owner throughout the book. It's not based on the Hamtaro we know from the TV show, but this book is so much better than any one episode from that series. I'm not sure you can say this book is just for kids either. And if you got either of the previous two hamtaro books, and found them to be somewhat of a bore, you'll find this book to be much more enthralling, especially if you're an older reader like me. ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I title this poor because it is what I am after getting ripped off by this crappy product.

So purchase them from a reputable source like museumofmoderndesign on Amazon. I gave many of these great Candela lamps to my friends and they all love it! The best invention since the wheel! These fantastic portable lamps are a safe alternative to regular candles. These lamps provide a warm, ambient glow that won't blow out in the wind, or set the house afire if left unattended. Equally useful on the dinner table or bedside and late-night jaunts, each Candela lamp stays lit for 5 hours, and takes 16 hours to recharge. Intelligent circuitry makes them turn on automatically when lifted from the charging platter, and start to recharge as soon as they're put back. Plus, the pattended SafeCharge system eliminates exposed electrical contacts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look cool- but functionall Crappy- Poor battery Life","review":"I wanted so bad to like this company. Seemingly cool looking products. I like design, and Vessels products have the aesthetic I'm after. I bought the 4-set of Candelas in the Moma store in NYC, after charging them for 24 hours, 2 of the 4 did not work for longer than 3 minutes. I returned them to the store. 3 weeks later, 2 of the new Candelas started diminishing 10x faster than the other 2. I then contacted Vessel, who was surprisingly unfriendly and not very helpful. After a vigorous letter, I received 2 replacement Candelas (i marked them on the bottom) which lasted- get this- 2 weeks before fading out after 10 minutes. I sent the whole thing back to Vessel - who told me without the original receipt, could not refund me. I promptly told them to keep them. Terrible business practices, and useless product.

Great idea, and very stylish. Unfortunately after a few months the charger in one base died. We bought a replacement, but after a few months both the replacement and the other original base died as well. That's three dead bases in a matter of months.

I considered them \\"expensive\\", but I figured that if they stood up to regular use in a hotel, they must be durable and safe.I still consider them beautiful - they offer a candle ambiance without the soot and fire risk.I was dismayed that their light soon started to last a shorter and shorter time. I considered replacing the batteries, but considering how much I paid, I wasn't interested in spending even more money on them when they seemed to \\"wear out\\" in a matter of a few months.I would rate them a \\"5\\" if:... they were far less expensive, or... the manufacturer would provide the first set of replacement batteries free, or... they used some sort of standard rechargeable battery (I'm a big fan of rechargeables - I used them in all my battery-powered devices.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh For Goodness Sake","review":"I got the Candella and was thrilled. It was the perfect reading light - soft glow and I would rest it on my chest while I laid in bed. A bedtime reader's essential tool. After about six months, all four \\"candles\\" instead of charging at the base, they would turn on and when I removed them, they would turn off. This was completely the reverse of what it should do.

It requires logic. This unit requires that you actively use the serrations provided on paper towel rolls. It won't easily cut paper towels in the middle of the sheet. Why? Because we require paper towels to be \\"strong\\"', to not fall apart while we are using them. This means the towels are made to be stronger than toilet paper. They do have serrations for separating sheets.This holder allows one to easily rip off individual sheets with one hand. Just respect the design of the towels and this holder is truly the best I have ever found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like this one!","review":"When I first received this, I wasn't too sure about it, but after 2 months, I really like it. I had a little trouble figuring out how the center core came off - it slides out then snaps back in. I also wasn't used to the wired center core - I thought the towels would be hard to pull. It works like a charm and I get just the number of towels I need. To save towels, I usually tear one in half, lengthwise (tear at perforation halfway, then tear down) and this holder lets me do that without having to hold the roll. I just re-roll the 1/2 towel up so it stays off the counter. Simple!It has a \\"slot\\" in the rim to run the towels through but I don't always use it. Either way, this holder should be around for a long, long time. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right amount","review":"The right amount of paper towels when you want them. That's what you get with this dispenser, no more pulling to get one towel and getting three or more and having too lay them on the counter for later.

One thing of note, if you do mount the unit under a cabinet make sure you leave enough room to raise the arm allowing refill. The anchors supplied with the unit are quite sturdy and hold it to the wall securely."},{"rating":"1","title":"overengineered junk","review":"Shame on OXO.

To my dismay even after obsessive cleaning of the pristine room dust would settle from moment to moment. (I have a cat, I sew, I shed skin cells.) From previous research I knew I wanted a true HEPA unit and was pleased to find one at this price. Brought it home, turned it on and had my first night of sleep in going on three years with no sore throat or stuffed nose. The \\"quiet\\" setting is an inoffensive white noise murmur.

For it to even begin to work it must be on high. Consumer reports really describes why any purifier that does not go above 100 CDR is really not working well enough to realize any benefits - in fact may actually harm you - because you have it in your mind that you have a purifier in the room and then you don't allow fresh air in.Don't buy the delonghi's - they are very poor air purifiers.

And I noticed after running it just one day that some odors and 'stuffy winter house' smell had vanished. My sniffling has lessened, too.

On this unit the water flow goes down to a mere trickle in about 3-4 weeks.We deal with slow flow for about as long as we can stand it and then we have to replace it before we loose our minds. I'm ready to give up on this brand, but somehow, due to convenience, I just end up buying more filters from Amazon.I guess if $15.00 for a 3-4 week filter is not that much to you then this filtration system is the one for you.I'm going to try another brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polypropylene filter a health hazard?","review":"I was researching water purifiers and was most interested in the Culligan, until I noticed that the filter is made of polypropylene, which is itself a suspected health hazard ( liver and respiratory).

And the only reason I took it apart was because I used this Culligan to filter water for my tea kettle and I noticed that tea kettle had become chalky white which I guess is the residual chlorine from the water which got me thinking does this thing even work?

They dribble coffee - have a cheap plastic hinge, and are the most fragile item we have to wash in our sink every day. As some reviews state, you just have to be careful - but then most of us are usually half asleep when we make our coffee.We recently upgraded to the KF600 and love it.

Its simple, inexpensive, long lasting, and makes good coffee. But the carafe is too weak. It should be made of strong pyrex glass, but instead it seems to cracks too easily. My first carafe cracked after about a year and I ordered this replacement. I was always very careful with the second one, but after about a year, it cracked also. Now I am ordering my third one. I am also like one of the other reviewers who said he refuses to buy another coffee maker out of principle. I don't like metal carafes because you cant see how much coffee you have left. I feel like I'm buying a new coffee maker each year. Its almost like the business models with ink-jet printers - sell the printers cheap and kill them with the recurring cost of ink.

One of the worst characters to become popular was Speedy Gonzales. Every episode plot was the same--think Casper or Baby Huey cartoons. Volume Four seems to be a dumping zone for every Speedy Gonzales episode ever made. There are a few rare jems such as...Rabbit Hood - 19498 Ball Bunny - 1950Mississippi Hare - 1949Southern Fried Rabbit - 1953Kiss Me Cat - 1953Plane Daffy - 1944The Grey Hounded Hare - 1949Hurdy-Gurdy Hare - 1950The question is, do the few jems make it worth buying the mine of abysmal undesireables?

Speaking of 'controversial' cartoons, I wish 'Hare Ribbin'(un-cut of course) would make it on the next volume, instead of seeing the edited version on TV where the dog just magically drops dead?

The packaging of the DVDs is an issue,since they are stacked one atop another. This increases the risk of damaging a disc considerably.As for the material,disc 3, is almost completely unwatchable. Speedy Gonzales on a whole Disc? Please. Disc one is the best one, all Bugs, not necessarily at his best but, it is the best disc of a mediocre lot. Conspicuous by his relative absence, Daffy Duck.

I think it's imperative that we fans continue supporting each release, in order to continue the Golden Collection series.Having said that, I would prefer that they stop giving each disc a single theme. I love these classic cartoons, but even I will have trouble sitting through 15 Speedy Gonzales cartoons in a row. Wouldn't it be more fun for viewers to mix it up a little? Or better yet, take a cue from the Columbia House Video Library, and give each famous cartoon director his own disc.OK, so I'm guilty of nit-picking, too.

And, if they could re-issue \\"Frigid Hare,\\" which was banned on some TV stations because it makes fun of Inuit peoples, or good ol' \\"let's make fun of Latinos\\" Speedy, why not bring out \\"Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarfs\\" again? According to just about every review, this is one of the best cartoons nobody's ever seen, and the voice work by Dorothy Dandridge should make it worth something.But (sigh!) these are relatively minor cavils.

I have spent more time trying to figure out how to get good reports and charts than I have spent doing input and research put together. Instead of allowing direct printing with lots of formatting options like FTM, Reunion tells you, if you don't like their clunky, hard-to-read reports, to send them to your word processor and reformat them yourself. Isn't formatting your data what the program is for?If you need Mac software, I would suggest checking out the less expensive programs or waiting for FTM for Mac, which I have read will be released any month now . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied with purchase","review":"Add me to those who are satisfied with this software. I find it easy to navigate and easy to enter data. With a little time investment you can learn a few shortcuts to enter data even faster.

It allows you to import and export GEDCOM files which is important when working with others on family history. The ability to include photographs is also a plus. If you are looking for a software program for genealogy and are using a Macintosh computer this the program to have in your hands. The best part is the company only produces it for the Macintosh and has kept their focus to one computer platform. If you like the ease of working with a computer that is user friendly like the Macintosh this program pushes all the right buttons.

A reading of the plays reveals an author who believed women should be educated. The general philosophy illuminated in the plays was anything but parochial and reveals a man who was very well-read and intimately knowledgeable about the things and people of which he speaks -- these are not qualities one would associated with someone of very limited education who apparently never traveled outside of England. We'll never know for sure who was the real author the plays, but the authors of this book make a fair case for Sir Neville."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth will out","review":"I wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare.

As I continued to clean it kept getting stronger and I wondered if a squirrel had gotten in and maybe died in the walls. I then itched my nose with my wrist and got a large whiff of the problem- the stupid wipes.Now, I don't know if this is a problem with some of them (like maybe they went bad on the shelf before I got them due to a lack of preservatives or chemicals) or if they just all smell rancid.

I enjoy few authors more than James. I'm a full-grown, mostly rational, non-squeamish, non-superstitious adult, and these stories make my skin crawl, even on repeat readings.One small caveat: It might be hard to resist devouring all the stories in a short period of time. Resist and ration them out. First, because these are (nearly?) all the ghost stories he wrote. Second, they're formulaic enough in structure that as you near the end of the book, they start to lose some impact if read all at once.I've read \\"The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance\\" four or five times. I still can't follow the plot. It still keeps me awake at night. (Maybe this is because Punch & Judy puppets creep me out). Does anyone else get it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh whistle and I'll come to you.....","review":"These quiet, strange, antique little stories from the age of the Edwardian gentleman have always seemed too good to be true. How can we be so lucky to share the same universe with M.R James. They are everything we desire in a ghost story : a curious, ancient setting,a cast of elite eccentric scholars from England's best schools in England's best time, and strange, plausible perfectly terrifying creatures representing the accummlation of sometimes centuries of nastiness. James knew something about what makes us so uneasy and it is a delight to accompany him there. Number 13 was the first story I read when I was thirteen myself and still a great favorite. Oh Whistle and I'll come to You My Lad has long been a favorite of many as well as An Episode In Cathedral History. They are all of them excellent, every one. Happy happy reading for this and many Halloweens and beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"People, please stop comparing his works to Owen Meany!","review":"\\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" is a masterpiece. Enough said. This book delivers just as it should; it is captivating from page one on, it is wildly funny (people on the \\"El\\" don't want to next to me, the crazy lady laughing out loud), rich in details and it comes full circle. It is a great book and an excellent introduction to the wonderful world of John Irving. I highly reccommend for the first-time reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irving continues his drek","review":"My suggestion to you if you are planning to read Water Method Man is to either sell it back, give it away, or burn it. This (along with his other two first books) are drek. The plotlines are hazy and nondescript and far from being entertaining. PLease, do yourself a favor start with Garp, skip THe Hotel NEw Hampshire and run to the bookstore to buy the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hints of the writer-to-be....far from his best work","review":"Since I first read Garp I've been a huge fan of John Irving. I've pretty much loved everything's he's written since Garp. I had left his first three books for last. I think Water Method Man may be his worst (which is not to say it's bad...it's not. It's just not up to Irving's very high standard). After reading this, I gave it to my wife ( a voracious reader, indeed, and also an Irving fan). We agree. The biggest problem here is that we just didn't care about Trumper or anyone else in the story, for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloshing through the Water-Method Man","review":"I am a fan of John Irving but was unimpressed by this book. Although the Fred Trumper character was developed fully in the usual Irving fashion, he was ultimately unendearing and dull. Coupled with an unmomentous plot, the lack of an interesting protagonist made for a dull read. While The Water-Method Man had moments of truth and insight, they were just that: moments. Overall, a semi-worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding John Irving","review":"John Irving, as a young man, starts off with a bang. His first chapter is an hilarious incursion into a very unpleasant situation. Officers and enlisted men in armed services around the world will knock themselves out laughing. But then, somewhat characteristically although certainly his Cider House Rules was well organized, he wanders here and there. However, as my favorite Irving character, Jillsy Sloper, explained, I just had to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen.The Water-Method man is much more organized and better written than Garp and miles above those dreary bear and Vienna stories. And we can understand Irving's expression of pique with editors and others who hold a writer's destiny in their envious hands, for that is how I understand much of Garp to have been.This is a must and most entertaining read for Irving's male fans. I don't know how the ladies will regard it--probably not charitably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this book not famous?","review":"My sister so loved the hero of this novel, Bogus Trumper, that she named her cat after him. And while I'm not a fan of the cat, I do love this novel. No other book has made me laugh so hard. One scene in particular had me gasping for breath (I won't ruin it by describing it-- suffice it to say that it involves a prophylactic and attempted infidelity and that you will know it when you come to it).The Water-Method Man is far from perfect; I don't suppose it will hold up as well as The World According to Garp. But some books you love despite all their flaws and limitations. God knows John Irving made me very happy for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing . . .","review":"If this had been the first Irving book I'd read, I would not likely read others. This was a somewhat dis-jointed read; I never connected with any of the characters or cared much for their fate. I can somewhat dismiss this as an early effort by Irving & stick to his more recent works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Water Method Man","review":"I loved this book. I like John Irving. I think this is about the fifth book I've read of his. This one was very funny and also a little sad. I like happy endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful for most, horrible for Irving","review":"This would be an awful book for most writers, but for a talented artist like Irving to print this garbage is just sad. The book jumps back and forth from the past to the present, he goes in and out of fantasy without noting which one you are in. The old lit piece is out of place all together.This is my fourth Irving book, and I was so disappointed I will have to will myself to read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, mabye I don't get it","review":"I read all of the wonderful reviews of this book- and after being thoroughly pleased by his much later work- Prayer for Owen Meany- I felt I surely couldn't go wrong. All I can say is \\"WTF?????\\"- and for those who don't know what that means- just look it up. This book was written in the 1960's so maybe it was the age of the psychedelic drugs that influenced the writing- but I have no idea what Irving was getting at in this book. In addition, though I'm no prude, I wouldn't dare let my wife or kids have a glance at this book- I can see it getting banned from many libraries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only book I ever wanted to trash.....","review":"I got a little more than half way through John Irving's book and I couldn't stand it anymore.If your into toilet humor and bad taste, this one is for you. If this is one of Irving's better books as some of the reviewers have stated, I wouldn't touch the others with a ten foot pole. I depend a lot on the comments of our fellow readers before making purchases, you guys let me down on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"What can I say - this book is magnificent! There is no substitute for the wealth of detail and the authenticity of technical and historical knowledge that can be brought to bear by a person who has actually been there and done the things of which he writes. Layne Heath combines his knowledge and experience with an obvious writing ability to produce a spellbinding story of the day-to-day experiences of a helicopter pilot in Vietnam. His storylines are plausible, supplemented by a rich attention to detail which allows the reader to virtually share his experiences. Although the ending is designed to accommodate a sequel, it was never written - most likely because the author put everything he had into one blockbuster of a novel that you will find very hard to put down until you are finished. Utterly superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The revival of American Spirit following September 11, 2001.","review":"Life magazine always produces great pictures and this is no exception in this book. The book is a compilation of the life of America following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The personal stories are always the best to read about. There is a personal background of five people who survived the attacks and this is very poignant. One detailed a young widow of a NYFD person killed in the attack. She described the payout which she recieved as a victim as our \\"sad money\\". These people will never be the same as a result of the attack.I find fault with this book because there is so little focus. It descibes personal stories, then goes off to talk about the ex mayor, then looks at Afghanistan. There is a series of writings in here about the American spirit, but there is no focus in even this. This is a hard book to follow, so I rated it low. The editor should have focused on one trend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit the bill","review":"I needed these pans to make a dinner entree of filet of sole stuffed with shrimp mousse.

I grabbed the volume knob and as I turned it all I got was noise. Amazon was great and sent a new headset in 3 days. I set it up and they were working great.

They're just no good. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great sound!","review":"I really love my headphones.... a lot. My gaming experiance has totally changed and I really have an advantage now with this precise sound. I can easily pick people up walking into the room and hear them sneaking through the bushes/around walls/etc. I don't have any of the microphone problems other people have (I doubled the mic input in windows). The only thing I need now is the Razer sound card that works with this headset. I could do a lot more sound configuration with that card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dissatisfied reviewer.","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers who have been dissatisfied with this headset. The first problem with mine is the mic wouldn't stay put. It's removable and just plugs into the left ear piece. It seemed like it would always move around in use and I was constantly having to readjust it. I also had problems with the sound balance. The right ear was LOUD while the left could barely be heard even with the left volume at 100 and right volume at 5. The center channel didn't seem to exist at all. Lastly, they were large, clunky, and uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. I finally exchanged them for the Razer Piranha headset which I really like. Not all the bells and whistles as the Barracuda, but they are light and comfortable enough to wear for hours, function well, and sound pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I purchased the HP-1 headphones and was very disappointed. I could never get the microphone to work correctly, even after returning it to Razer for a different headset. It took Razer one month to exchange my original headset. Entirely too long in my opinion. I'll look at products made by other companies than Razer from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"My son really likes the sound of these headphones, but the left earpiece snapped off after less than a year of use. It broke at a really thin connection point made out of what we used to call \\"pig-iron\\" or \\"pot-metal.\\" It's a weak, brittle metal amalgamation that's not suitable to withstand this kind of localized stress in a tiny little cross section.On the Razer website, the support FAQ for these headphones says:Q: Can I request or purchase replacement parts for my Razer product?A: Razer does not currently supply any replacement parts.This situation may not be improving soon. I noticed they're not hiring anyone in development or product support, but they do have an opening to replace their Marketing Director. (sigh)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Customer Service at all","review":"Got a defective unit(horrible noise when adjusting volume),after several e mails never got a response from their customer service.The sound is great as long as you can ignore the terrible interference when adjusting volume.I'll never buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturing needs help.","review":"I have so far had two pair of these. The second pair is sitting back in its box for a return. Same problem with both sets. The center/bass channel is completely non-existent, I get great sound out of the Front and Back channels, but absolutely nothing out of the center or bass no matter how much fiddling is done with the volume knobs. Since the center and bass come from the same sound card output, I tried plugging in the Front (green) plug from the headphones into the center output on the sound card and I could hear sound clearly. Since sound was being output from the sound card but I could hear nothing on the headphones, I can only assume that there is some wiring/connection defect preventing the center signal from reaching the speakers.Reading the other types of problems people are having, I think there is a major manufacturing issue with these headphones and it would be best to stay away from them until it is sorted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Good sound, although a slightly \\"tinny\\" sound on the rear channel. Compared to my last set of headphones (Turtle Beach HPA2) these just couldn't hold a candle to them. They feel cheaply made, and while they are quite a bit lighter, I just didn't like the feel of the in-line controls or headphones themselves.Also, there is no way to have both this headset and your normal speakers hooked up at the same time unless you can find line splitters. I wish I would have know that before purchase.I ended up returning these after the mic stopped working less than a day after they arrived. While not bad, I can't honestly recommend them considering what is available at the same (or even lower) pricepoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent gaming headphones","review":"These headphones are top quality gaming headphones. The surround sound feature has improved my online first person shooter skill drastically, given that its now easy to HEAR where an opponent is coming from directionally...left, right, front or rear in either direction. Its made a huge difference. They are extremely well made, adjustable for sound in a variety of ways. The only drawback (and its not to me) that could be said about the sound is the base isn't all that deep. For music, listening to songs I know from heart, I'm able to hear notes and sounds that even my quality sound system didn't highlight, so they are great for music too. I highly recommend these Razer HP-1 Barracuda headphones, especially for playing online games where knowing where someone is by the direction of the sound will give you a definite advantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This headset sucks!","review":"Usually Razer products are above average in performance. but the Razer Barracuda Gaming headset didn't do any good. and if you wear glasses the headset pushes your glasses into your temple, causing bad headaches. hope someone finds this review useful -Gube"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Power","review":"Just received item in the mail today.There is NO power when plugged in.Returning Headset for a replacement.I will post again on my progress..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Headset","review":"Its a great headset , i recommend 100% if you are a gamer.If you find great soud this is greate choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good gaming headphones bad build quality","review":"After 2 months of use with the headphones the screws fell out from the earmuff holding it with the headset. it gave me good positional audio in Counter strike but the build quality should be better, i expected more from razer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same as the Turtle Beach Earforce HPA2","review":"The same as the Turtle Beach Earforce HPA2 expt it has the fancy connector that plugs directly into the back of the Razer soundcard.

For a gaming headset (headphones w/ mic), the Razer Barracuda set leaves something to be desired... due to its fragile mic.I had my Razer Barracuda headset for less than five months... and then one day the mic simply quit working. I hadn't changed a thing on my OS/computer during that time, nor had I abused my headset. I come to find out... numerous consumers have had problems with Razer Barracuda mics. For the money I paid, I expected this headset to have lasted much longer than five months. To this end, I rated these headphones with just one star and would not recommend them to anyone (for any price over $20.00). Why $20.00 you ask? Because... I have a generic headset that I purchased for $19.99 three years ago... and it's still going strong. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset","review":"The Razer HP-1 Barracuda headset is very good headset, It sounds excellent with my Creative X-FI using the attached Dongle, but even better when paired with the Razer AC-1 Soundcard, It does however have a weakness in audio quality and \\"3d\\" sound when used with only stereo input \\"as on my laptops built in audio\\" so if you are to purchase this item make sure you have 5.1 capable sound card. As for comfort it is Good for long term use. The Microphone is kinda cheap feeling and plugs in on the bottom of the headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst headset I have ever owned.","review":"I'm a gamer, I go through a lot of different headsets. Its been a while since I have purchased anything other than the cheap 20$ headsets, so thought I would give these a try along with the AC1. Got the parts in a timely fashion, installed, to find out no one could hear me on ventrilo, as the mic volume was so low (this is with mic boost on and level cranked to max). The boom is so short, its a good 3-4\\" from the side of my mouth. The advertised LED logo's didn't work either. After some support with Razerzone, they suggested I send my set back to get another one as maybe the amplifier is broken. I get the new set, and they have a short right out of the box. Going to try and return these for some Zalman's or similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razer HP-1 Barracuda 8-Channel Gaming Headphones","review":"love this headphones. the sound is good and have good bass. will recommend to everyone.after 1 year bulb on the left side goes out but for me is nothing because sound is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like these...","review":"... but I'll be returning the third set in a month. First set headband broke two days in. Second, microphone didn't exist (as in, literally removed that tiny cap on the tip of the extension, and there was no little mic inside) and the main volume control knob started going crackly, where you have to pinch and squeeze and torque it to get all channels working. Third set, microphone existed, but the sound quality is wretched, just utterly wretched. And yep, the volume control is now giving out just like the first two. During the brief periods that it's actually functioned properly, the sound was quite positional and fun for gaming, of pleasantly acceptable (but not audiophile) sound quality. Not to be confused with product quality, which this puppy comes up short on after even the third try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks Too Easily","review":"I've owned two pair of the Barracuda Headphones and both have broken the exact same way. The piece that holds the earphone to the headset is made of some type of metal. After about a year to two years of use, the metal fatigues and breaks. Unfortunately, this is a key part, because the earpiece no longer connects to the headset now.When the first broke, I was disappointed but thought it might be a fluke and purchased another pair because I was happy with the sound. When the second set broke, I realized it wasn't a fluke.Oh, and the microphone stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage","review":"Do not buy this headset. It may sound good; But it is very poorly constructed. There are very thin, cheap metal plates that keep the speakers attached to the two metal rods that go over your head. After awhile those plates will wear out and break, causing the whole headset to fall apart. That's what happened to mine. Also: The paint is very cheap, and scrapes off very easily. And the microphone sounds horrible. If I could give it less than 1 star; I would.Do yourself a favor and stay away from Razer's headsets. Especially this one. I would highly recommend the Logitech G35 as an alternative. That's what I replaced my Barracuda with, and I haven't regretted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shotty Quality","review":"Let me start by saying that I love Razer products, and I like to try out all that I can get my hands on.

I learned Greek in seminary and in my opinion, every Christian should learn it. It's no harder than learning spanish in high school.

But I am on the hunt for a different model for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a handy gadget","review":"Emeril Lagasse calls these \\"boat motors.\\" Of course he probably uses the professional Waring version that costs over $100. I find this much less expensive model to be quite well built with a powerful motor (it actually pulls itself down into the sauce). Clean up is simple enough- simply run it in a bowl of hot soapy water. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the tool I've been waiting for","review":"I don't know why it took me so long to get this blender. My daughter-in-law has one and I saw how handy it was. Anyway, I really like it. It does a fine job on drinks, mashed potatoes and sauces and it's easy to clean. I had no problem whipping just a 1/4 cup of cream in the provided container. I will probably retire my Cuisinart food processor to the pantry now, and use the hand-held mixer just for egg whites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny Metal parts broke off into my blended drink!","review":"Great item. Loved it, until... Tiny metal washers broke in half and fell into my milkshake and cut my mouth. Contacted the company, who said \\"sorry, out of warrantee\\". Didn't realize there was a warranty period on caring about customer safety. Thank goodness it wasn't a broken blade on my Cuisinart food processor that slit my throat, guess that wouldn't matter much either if it was \\"out of warrantee\\". SHAME ON YOU CUISINART/CONAIR!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can she turn rugged West Texas men into sensitive guys?","review":"'Simply Sexy' is the third novel of the Sexy Series by Linda Francis Lee. In this novel Julia finds herself the playing nurse to the brother-in-law of her best friend aka Undercover cop Ben Prescott. Does she not only need to and fight desires for Ben she is dealing with her father's death, mounds of debt and producing a TV reality show. Check out the entire series: Suddenly Sexy, Sinfully Sexy and Simply Sexy. If you enjoy this genre, I would also suggest, Flirting with Danger by Suzanne Enoch, Crazy For You by Kate Angell and Underfoot by Leanne Banks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great end to the trilogy","review":"Although this is my least favorite in the trilogy, it was still a good read. I can't wait to read more from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Linda","review":"This isn't the book for but some love it. What else can I say? Too many cliches and you know exactly what is going to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the whole series","review":"Each book in the series got better and better. This series is about 3 best friends who run a tv station. One is the owner, one is producer, and one is a star of her own show. In this book Julia who is the owner sells the station and tries to find her identity. She was born rich but when her father past away she was in serious debt. The story is your typical girl and boy butting heads and fall for each other. Each main character is dealing with problem they have to work thru, and have help from the other one to find peace. You will want to read these books in order. I hate when a series comes to an end when it is enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Sexational","review":"The third book in the Sexy series doesn't disappoint. First it's incredibly hot and then it makes you snot. Couldn't ask for more in a contemporary romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very complete and clear version","review":"I choose this raiting because is a book that helps you understand in a clear form how to use the grammar. I recommend this book for classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"what are you talking about?","review":"I am already cancelled a book I ordered because you did not send me a book until estimate delivery day 2, Sep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super And Versatile Cooking Pan!","review":"This is the perfect pan for preparing or reheating small meals in your oven, providing excellent cooking/heating quality! The ribbed bottom prevents sticking and even gives that 'grilled' look to meats and poultry at higher heats. Plus the ribbed bottom provides an area for grease to drain in to if you are cooking oily foods like fish, cheese, etc.For extra non-stick quality one can always add a light spray of PAM or similar non-stick food preparation, but I find it seldom necessary as foods rarely stick to this great pan.These pans are durable, heat well and cool quickly, and are perfect for disposable cooking of that quick, low-cleanup meal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty in an odd setting","review":"This book is a poetic look at what the author sees.
