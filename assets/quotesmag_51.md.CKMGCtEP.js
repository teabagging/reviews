For too many kids, high school is a nightmare they live with their whole lives. This book lets them know they're not alone - a solution all by itself. But, as usual, Dr. Bluestein packs more goodies.

I've not had them long enough to know how long they will last but they seem to be of better construction compared to the others. They give you extra ear cushions and the sound quality is noticeable better. The cord length is appreciated. These retractable earbuds by nature are vulnerable to breaking easily but for me they are worth it. I love the retractable capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work from the start","review":"The very first time I used these earbuds, there was a short in the wire. So I returned them. Also, if your iPod is in your pocket, the spool ends up at the middle of your torso with no place to clip it, and it will pull the earbuds out of your ears if you let it hang freely. Poor quality overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"They would have been perfect","review":"The sound quality would be excellent if I can get the left ear bud to work properly. It doesn't work well and I haven't had it for 3 months yet. It seem like not too long after use it started going out.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken twice","review":"I purchased these earphones to use while at my desk and while running. The first pair I bought broke after about a month, I think the wiring was severed from the retractable action, and both ear buds quit playing. I tried to salvage my investment by holding the cord in just the right position to have them work, but even this was ineffective after a while. I emailed the company and got a replacement pair with no problem. However, after 4 months these did the exact same thing. The company is responsive to complaints, and the sound quality is good, but the workmanship is shoddy and the equipment breaks down.

For example, the claim the govt knew about Sept 11th before it happened. Why? Because for years people said \\"something was going to happen somewhere\\". Hence the gov't knew on Sept 11th there would be planes crashign into building.

Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I have been using two of these for about two years and they still work just fine. They are not very bright but provide enough light to get up and down my staircase. The motion sensor is somewhat inconsistent and will not always respond quickly to motion greater than 10 ft away. These make more sense than turning CFL's on and off for less than 30 seconds which significantly shortens a CFL's lifespan. I use them in my garage and the temperature and humidity variations do not seem to have been a problem. Worth the money in my situation but other users may have different requirements.

One for the garage and one for the dining room, surely these will work. NOPE, when the other two showed up, I put brand new batteries in them and nothing happened, not even a flash like the first one.

Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing, terrible, sad, beautiful tale.","review":"Not normally a vampire story fan, I found I couldn't put this book down (called \\"The Night Inside\\" in Canada). Like the two books after this (\\"Blood and Chrysanthemums\\", and \\"A Terrible Beauty\\"), Ms Baker has a way of creating sympathetic anti-heroes out of her vampire characters.I highly recommend this as an engrossing story you can lose yourself in. Fans of the genre, and people who normally steer clear of horror will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"I liked it -because- it wasn't like Anne Rice. The original title was better, because while the book involves vampires, it's more of an unlikely, and very moving, love story involving people who are very different from each other. It also raised some interesting questions -what does it mean to be human? How does one remain ethical in an unethical world? Is individual suffering enough of an excuse for inflicting pain on others?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good book but not really a great Vampire story","review":"While it starts off slow and doesn't really get much more exciting it does go into what it think's are what would happen when someone who doesn't belive in vampire's and the supernatural joins them on the \\"Other Side\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks because.....","review":"I'm a big vampire book fan but \\"Kiss of the Vampire\\" is a dull boring book.

The story itself -about Gerald, a giraffe who can't dance and gets teased by the other animals but finds his own rhythm with the help of a cricket and then wow's the other animals with his dancing - is very endearing and easy for children to follow, all the while teaching a subtle lesson. What I especially love are the beautiful illustrations and wonderful rhyme and rhythm. The book is an absolute joy to read and look at. We never get sick of reading it.

Honestly, I made it to page 45, and I am not a person to quit in the middle of a book. The purposefully elusive prose was not what turned me away, nor was it the confusing plot that when reading other reviews proved to never make any more sense; it was a implied pretentiousness that invaded its pages. After seeing the word 'leonine' (a word that might be able to be used once, maybe twice in an entire book) three times in these short pages, I refused to go on. I preceded on to Gabriel Marquez Garcia's One Hundred Years of Solitude, a first for me, that proved to be much more worth my time.My advice: skip the book and read the review in the Times. It will save you a great deal of yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did Not like this Book","review":"I understand that the author is making a debut here, but someone (his editor? his therapist?) made a grave error is launching this book for publication before its time. It could easily be two books. More likely, it could be one, shorter and (dare I say it) linear tale of his family shenanigans.

And I get the impression that in terms of his art,he isn't a slacker but an extremely talented painter. I think that Simon is a great charcter - supposedly based on Minot's brother - Sam, also an artist. It would be interesting to find out how much of Simon is actually based on Sam and how much is from Minot's imagination. One of Minot's sisters - I think that it was Susan said in the Times recently that she felt that the book needed editing. There are some difficult sentences that even when I read them over a number of times - I still couldn't make sense of them. I don't know if she was refering to that or something else.

I'm in the midst of currently reading this book and I think that it's definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for any trust manager or participant","review":"I found this an ideal resource for any trust manager or participant.

With very few exceptions (mentioned later) none of the articles have any depth or utility. At the most they let you know that a method exists so that you can find out more about it. I will have to say that the article by Shyamasundara Dasa called \\"Astamangala Deva Prasna\\" was atypical from the others and a fascinating read.

However it is MOST effective when taking it BEFORE doing yard work.

I work in a wood shop all day, have to keep boots on. I can change my socks once or twice a day and apply calimine, but I've been taking 12 drops every 2 hours for 2 weeks and it's only gotten worse.Who knows, maybe I'd be covered head to toe and this stuff kept it from spreading. Wish there was a way to tell for sure, so I feel bad giving it 2 stars, but I feel like 3 would be wimping out. I won't be buying this again and I won't recommend it to anyone.I was into homeopathic medicine years ago, I've even made my own tinctures in the past.

It really works! That's the best review anything can get. Basically this is poison ivy poison in an alcohol solution. You put a few drops in water, juice, vodka, whatever, and chug it. There is no reaction, no stomach upset, no rash on your tongue, no jitters (ok, that depends on how much vodka you put it in). But seriously, if you take 5 drops for 10 days or so before being exposed to the dreaded PI, you will have immunity. I am a major hiker and in Pennsylvania where I stomp the trails, PI is rife. If I get a direct hit, I might get an itchy feeling on that spot, but even that is rare. For the most part, I am immune. No red messy spots, no blisters, no agony. Buy it, try it. And one bottle can last 2 full PI seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"not work for me","review":"I had the poison ivy rash on my arm and leg, it is very itchy, so I started to look for something great to make me feel better.

Instead I got a lame low budget film, that started off a bit interesting but soon lost all appeal for me. The main reason for this is that before the main character, a woman, embarks on her trip to England she is captured at night by an assailant, who then ties her to a wall in an unknown place. What might at this point still sound good, is simply from the capture scenes onward boring and tedious to watch. After this the whole movie is set in a dungeon where the abductor preys on his new victim, which is really not in the least exciting to watch and one just wants to desperately press that stop botton on the DVD player.Hence, this DVD was neither a thriller nor a real horror movie, but instead something terribly boring.P.S.

I have not noticed any wobble or any other problem that might be associated with cheaper bits. They come sharp and hold their edge pretty well. If I use a particular bit enough to wear it out or break it I can then justify buying a Freud or some other better brand. I have found that buying sets from Grizzly and then replacing the individual bits with a better brand is much cheaper than buying the expensive ones outright.

The wedge-pointed tips help easy highlighting and easily cover a normal line height (up to ~10-12pt font size). The assortment of colors in this pack is okay. Most of them are good, but a few are little too dark or hard to distinguish. Most of my past highlighters had a really tight cap (to keep them from drying) and you need to use both hands to open it and make sure to keep the cap safely. These are retractable and it makes it very convenient - easier to use. Do make sure you retract the tip before putting in your pocket/purse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but bulky","review":"The photo makes it look slim and more portable. Actual product is a lot more bulky. But it is just a pen, so I'm not too picky about it.It says it has \\"smear guard\\" but depending on what kind of paper you're using this on, I would still wait a few seconds before touching it. It does smear on my semi-glossy textbook pages, if I try touching it immediately after I use it. So, use common sense. That said, the markings did dry VERY QUICKLY, and even though it was not 100% smear proof, a light \\"dab\\" of the finger would not have created disaster on your page.It glides very easily across the page, very smooth. I liked it a lot. However, again, the types of paper will effect it. Overall, it's a great product!So long as you don't press down too hard, it doesn't seem to bleed through the pages very much.Now, the picture shown on my computer shows much brighter colors. The actual product I received seemed to have much darker colors, almost marker-like. FYI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't blur my ink!","review":"I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about these highliters being able to effectively highlight printer items without messing up the ink. But I was happy to find out that it can indeed highlight without blurring the ink. I tried these on laser printed pages as well as on magazine pages and had no problems. The retractable design is nice too since you don't have to keep up with the caps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set","review":"These are really nice. They're bigger than I expected, much bigger than an average pen. The colors are red, pink, orange, yellow, green, teal (aqua?), blue, and kind of a cranberry color. They all work great and it's ideal for proof reading and school work to have all of the available color options. Definitely a nice product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends what you want to use these for","review":"I received this product at no cost through the Amazon Vine program. I chose it because sometimes I need different color markers, for which this set has the following features:. Good selection of colors. Retractable tip eliminates lost caps, dried out markers, and is easy to use. Shape of tip easily enables a thick or thin line depending how you hold itI use nothing but yellow for highlighting since that is the only color that will not show up on a photocopy, which is something important for me, though probably not for lots of other people.I gave this four stars because for markers the ink is not as dark as using regular Sharpie markers, though those don't come in this variety of colors (the regular markers are black, red, green and blue). And even if you don't restrict yourself to using yellow as a highlighter, the darker colors in this set make the text too difficult to read when highlighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do the job for me","review":"These highlighter pens work nicely, for me. I've been using them mostly to highlight the stitches on knitted lace charts to help me keep track of the different stitches. Before, some of the charts would give me a good deal of eye strain, now it's easier to see the different knit stitches. I think it would help on some of the black & white cross stitch charts too.The darker blue and the indigo are a bit dark like others have mentioned. So I don't think I'd use those colors to highlight something I need to read, like in a text book. It's nice that they are in a handy plastic sleeve to keep them all together, and I really like how they are rectractable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several improvements needed","review":"These are okay, but could use several improvements.1) Make them brighter.As mentioned in other reviews, the colors are on the darker side.2) Make them smaller.The tip and the mechanism that holds the tip are only in the bottom quarter of the highlighter. The button at the top and the extra space in the middle could be decreased in size. A highlighter 3/4 the size would fit in a lot more small pockets in backpacks.3) Decrease the sound of the click.I like to click them closed while I'm looking for the next part to highlight. It's a habit that I have to consciously stop myself from doing to avoid annoying other people around me. Not sure if it can be done, but if the click can be muted even a little bit, that would help."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice improvement overall","review":"First of all, the new retractable design seems to be a complete success. After almost a year there is no sign that they are drying out, and the change also makes it trivially easy to switch between colors. I also like the thinner profile and the pocket clip. I also haven't seen any smearing except for a slight amount with pen-written text that was *just* written.My only criticism is the colors themselves -- I think most of us want the colors to really pop. The classic yellow does this very well. Pink, green, and light blue are pretty good. Orange is OK, but the red, dark blue, and purple are just too dark,. They don't really stand out and they make it hard to read the text underneath. These three are also the ones not included in the 5-pack, so that would be my recommendation unless you really need a ton of different colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"smudge free they are not","review":"My wife owns just about every Sharpies product ever made so I jumped at the chance to try these accent markers. Unfortunately, one of the features that these markers are supposed to have is smudge free on any ink surface. I have a HP Photosmart inkjet printer and my wife got tons of streaking as well as absoprtion using these accent markers. She had printed some of her school lessons about 2 hours before using the Sharpie's on them but the ink still smudged across the paper and some of the ink absorbed into the Sharpie.. Other documents worked fine but beware if you use an inkjet printer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Offering","review":"Overall, these are fine highlighters. They don't smear and feel like a pen in your hand. Retractability means there are no caps to keep track of, which is a nice feature. I love the idea of an eight color highlighter set, but some of the darker colors are just too dark for most highlighting over text. Some may like the unique tip, but as I neither write nor underline with my highlighters, I'd prefer a more standard tip. I'm a lefty, so perhaps the way one has to hold the highlighter to highlight is more difficult for us southpaws.I was pleased to find a plastic case for the highlighters included in the packaging, as it wasn't mentioned in the product description. It eliminates the accidental clicking problem and helps me keep track of them, which is a bonus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great accent markers...","review":"Sharpie Accent Retractable Markers are so useful! The lighter colors work wonderfully as accent markers, and the darker colors in the pack are able to be used as both a marker and an accent marker. The colors are vivid, and stand out very well on the page. The retractable feature is very convenient - no more looking for where you put the lid!With true Sharpie style and quality, these retractable accent markers will soon become your favorite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First time Sharpie!","review":"I'd never used Sharpie highlighters before. (STAEDTLER highlighters are usually my choice.) I bought the product solely because they are retractable highlighters. It is a feature I wished highlighters would have. So, I tried. The product serves its purpose. Very convenient and fun to use. But I am not impressed with its performance. The line is too thin and the ink dried out quickly after continuously used for about an hour. Some colors are too dark so I have to use them to underline texts instead. They are not terrible products but they are not my cup of tea. I definitely prefer STEADTLER highlighters than this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great markers","review":"These markers are a great quality, they are small highlighters so good for tight spaces and very pigmented. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"A great product for the price.

I do wish the darker colors came out a little bit lighter, but it's not really enough of a con to make me drop a star. I could also do without the pocket clip because I always tend to play with those and break them--but again, not enough of a con to drop a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Threw my old ones out... these are great!","review":"Much to like about these. The big thing of course is they don't have caps, but retractable tips, like a ballpoint, so there is no drying out, or getting ink on yourself trying to cap them. They don't stink like those old ones, or bleed through thin paper. They don't pick up ink from the print and leave it on the tip so they stay clean. They don't smear, really!What's not to like? The dark blue one could be a bit lighter perhaps if you are highlighting, but it is perfect for underlining or artwork. There are many colors to choose from. I also like the slanted writing tip, so you can make a line thick or thin, just by the slant of the pen. I like to circle things, and underline things, as well as create some art. These work fine for many things, and come in a handy plastic storing pouch that allows you to pick and easily choose which you want. I love them, and highly recommend them for teachers, or anyone who has a need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run out quickly","review":"I don't think the convenience of the retractable feature is worth the price nor the limited time it actually stayed wet."},{"rating":"2","title":"So fun!","review":"I LOVE these highlighters!

I have a blast using all the colors; and with 8 you definitely get a variety!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't last long","review":"I bought these highlighters thinking that because they are made by Sharpie they would be of good quality. I was disappointed in the fact that they didn't last very long at all. I used these to highlight in a text book. I was unable to stretch the yellow to do 1 chapter, it dried out very quickly. All told, these highlighters lasted less than a week. Next time I'm going to be purchasing the liquid highlighters by Sharpie - they last much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need more juice","review":"Other reviews are right when they say these don't smear and work well but these highlighters also run out incredibly quickly compared to other brands. If you're someone who uses a highlighter every day, expect about 10 days out of each one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"We didn't like these sharpies. The colors were ok, it needs a true purple instead of a pink and a magenta. The tips were uncomfortable to color or write with. We did, however, like that they are retractable. We tried them for a bit then gave them to the receptionist at school who was very happy to get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but not really anything new.","review":"I like the ability to click and write with these Sharpie accent markers. While Sharpie has already worked on this concept with their original black markers, it is nice to have these for quick and easy access while grading papers and coloring signs for my classroom. Not out-of-this-world special, but a good addition to the Sharpie family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese society in a nutshell","review":"Nakane's description of hierarchy where workers in the same company from the vice-president down to assembly men have more in common than with their counterparts in other companies was extremely useful to me in writing my own book on Japan. Her descriptions of how seniority in groups is formed is extremely useful in understanding Japanese society as well.This short book is a must-read for the plane.

For example on page 148 the author discusses module ports and has an example of a port redeclaration, but he neglects to discuss why you would wish to redeclare a port as a wire. If you are learning Verilog because you are going to use it in an actual design look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise & complete","review":"That's the way to describe it. The matter is not very verbose. It is comp[avt & the book moves fast.

Scott ulls together a body of writings that are insightful and serve to fill in many of the holes in the UP.

Each aspect of the novel, whether preceding or following this episode, points to, anticipates, or reflects upon it, directly or indirectly. The volume's title, In the shadow of young girls in flower, is itself a commentary on time's passage, perhaps even more so than the grand title itself, In search of lost time."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower","review":"The book, In The Shadow of Young in Flower was in excellent condition.

Classical, almost operatic at times, with a touch of synthisizer here and there, this score is to Goldsmith what Star Wars was to Williams. Worth every penny of the price to lovers of fantasy, soundtracks, and/or Goldsmith. A must have!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Contraband!!!!!!! Golden Earring!!!!!!!","review":"I have always been a big Golden Earring fan... & they are without a doubt one of the most underated bands of the 70's... They deserve way more recognition & respect over the years then what they have gotten... Contraband is a hit or miss album with alot of fans, I have to admit when I first heard this album it didn't grab me straight away, but it is definitely an album that grows on you with each listen. I have grown to like this album alot & I appreciate the fact that Golden Earring was not afraid to try something different... I believe that Contraband is one of those albums that any fan will appreciate the more they listen to it... My 4 star rating may be a bit much to some but check it out & give it a few spins & you'll see what I mean... I feel it is one of their better releases..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Golden Earring","review":"Contraband / Mad Love was the second GE album I heard. It is one of my three favorites along with Moontan and the 1977 Live album. The songs Bombay, Mad Love's Comin', Sueleen, Con Man, and Fightin' Windmills are 70s rock gems. The guitar work on this album sound great - especially the opening riffs to Bombay and Mad Love's Comin'. Fightin' Windmills get bonus points for referencing Don Quixote.Other favorites: Moontan (U.S. version), Live, The Naked Truth, Seven Tears, Grab It for a Second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet informative.","review":"I purchased this to assist with a spanish class.

It is this quality that makes him so much money, but his line of work has him constantly moving from town to town. He vows to stop this by setting up stakes in a new town which he plans to take by storm. His intentions seem good when he starts his own saloon to get away from the corruption of the sherriff. He takes the town drunk, also the judge (Frank Morgan), under his wing and makes eyes at the judge's daughter (Lana Turner). His plot is completely successful, but at the expense of the people around him.Turner and Gable work well together, but this is Gable's film all the way. He uses his trademark personality masterfully in this role. All of his charm is believable and it is no wonder people do what he wants. His appeal with women is undeniable here, which is the main reason this movie is worth watching. The story is somewhat thin; it is mainly a showcase for its stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie review","review":"Great movie and the response time was, as usual, prompt from Amazon.

Almost nothing is worth seeing here except for the teaming of Gable and Turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"I don't know what the deal with this band is, they're totally generic alt-rock emo, but they're on a basically metalcore label. There's a little bit of post-hardcore cred in their sound maybe, and the production makes them sound slightly heavier and darker than drive-thru bands, but the tunes are totally mediocre, and this stuff really does belong on Drive-Thru. The main strength of these songs is poppiness, and they totally fail at that, and if they're attempting to be experiemental, they fail at that even worse. I just don't get this band at all. How hard is it to write a semi-decent pop-rock song?. This is definitely worse than their last album, which suffered basically the exact same faults, except slightly less so."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Perfect book for new and experianced Mac user\`s. i have switched to a Mac 3 years ago and found alot of information that i never knew about.

Yes, it's campy, but I think that's the point. It's \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\"-esque, so if you didn't like ND, chances are AoP is not for you. But it's been a long time since I have seen a totally original movie that had complex story lines for multiple characters. The movie is designed to relate to \\"everyman\\" - there are issues that we all can relate to regardless of socioeconomic status. If you are a musician - especially a percussionist - you will definitely relate to this movie. And make sure you take a look at the Bonus Features, as they include an interview with Rush drummer Neil Peart and a \\"drum-off\\" between Ari Gold (Power) and Peart!I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good, old fashioned comedy draped in a bit of drama and a lot of camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"This movie is amazing!

There is next to nothing about the battle for the Central Highlands (10 pages tops). The writing style is annoying; the author writes as if he is floating through (and slightly above) the events he relates. There is zero humanity. For instance, about halfway through the book, the author \\"gets his family settled\\" at a new duty station. The book started with him at 15 years of age. When and where he acquired a family is, and will remain, a mystery.The book is also in serious need of an editor. There are numerous examples of the same sentence groups appearing from 1 to 3 times as a given topic is explored again. It's like copy and paste was overused on the word processor.Finally, the oft repeated praise of Ed Sprauge goes far beyond admiration or even hero worship. It's absolutely cloying. Enough already.Save your money for a better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle for Central Highlands","review":"Poorly done book, very disappointing.

It also gives one an incite to the political stance taken on the Special Forces. It may be a very good book historically, but really tells little of the actual battle for the Central Highlands. This book does nothing to deminish my admiration and respect for all of those brave souls who fought and who died in a very thankless conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good packaging for a rip off product","review":"I have complaints about everything in this package.

The new oven was a direct drive motor (the belt in the old design would break eventually) so I thought \\"no belt, less failure\\". Well, the electronics in this oven are very poorly designed and the heat from the oven 'cooks' the control board and it fails. Mine failed within 3 months of light usage, I sent it back to Nesco and they repaired it. Three months more of light use, failed again.

From a wretched childhood, she is forced by her scheming mother Queen Isabeau to marry the conquerer of France. However, she grows to love her adopted country of England. When King Henry V dies, her son, Henry VI, is taken from her. But she finds true happiness with Owen Tudor, her Welsh servant, and they marry and raise a family in secret. They live in fear of discovery by those who think her children by Tudor might seek the throne.

I was not disappointed. Unlike most 'official' episode guides for a series, Keith & co's guides always contain HUGE amounts of plot detail, cast info, trivia and general comments from the actors and author/s alike. This guide is definitely the best and most informative for this series, however, i find that it lacks some of the sparkle that made 'X-Treme Possibilities' and 'Slayer' such a joy to read, perhaps because there doesn't seem to be quite the same level of detail.Despite this I believe that 'Beyond the Gate' is up there among the best for any genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst guide ever!","review":"This is a horribly written guide! just in general, poorly written. not very well organized though it tries like hell to be.

But every now and then you've got to read something just for the pure pleasure of hysterical laughter. If Stephanie's botched attempts at bounty hunting or Grandma Mazur's obsession with funeral homes doesn't make you crack up, seek professional help immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the Money, Two for the Dough, Three to Get Deadly","review":"I read this because someone recommended Janet Evonovich's books as being good reads - pretty hilarious- etc. I had also seen a couple of her books on the best seller list. I could not get into them at all. They are very simple with character development that doesn't really occur. When I read I am usually able to picture a character in my mind - not so with these books.To me, the recommend was highly over rated. If you want to read something simple, fast and easy on an airplane to kill time - maybe - otherwise skip Evonovich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get started in the Plum series and you'll never put themdown","review":"Great way to get started in the Stephanie Plum series. Its full of fun, action and romance. A great buy if you love comic mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked","review":"This is the first book in a series of books about bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. Stephanie is clumsy, love-challenged, and broke. I could definitely identify with her. I laughed out loud so many times while reading this book...and had tears streaming down my face from laughing so hard. Once I read the first chapter, I was hooked. I'm a Stephanie Plum fan and have read all of the books in the series so far without disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and fun","review":"Although a bit on the edge when it deals with sex, these 3 books are fun as well as a great quick-read. Good way to spend a few days; you'll feel like she's your friend. She mostly says what she thinks...but when she doesn't, we still know what is on her mind and it'll bring a smile to your face (or an explosion of laughter.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You are going to LAUGH OUT LOUD!!!","review":"This was a wonderful 3-in-1 book!! It was cheaper then buying each of the three books. I heard that these books are in the works of possibly becoming movies!!! I sure hope so!! The grandmother is quite a riot! While you can usually figure out the plot the book is still worth every bit! Almost every page you turn has something for you to laugh about. There is even moments of suspense!!! I highly recommend this book. Wish I could be a bounty hunter!! Hee heeee"},{"rating":"2","title":"zany fun","review":"I'd previously read two of the holiday Stephanie Plums but I'm new to the regular series. I really liked the first three books.

I read more than one book, so that I can give her a fair chance. I struggled through the first book, and gave up through the middle of the second. It simply was not worth it, despite the many recommendations she got on the romance talk board , which only shows that one should buy one book and test an author.

She didn't count on falling for Tripp Jordan, the town sheriff. Tripp is divorced, and he wonders if his faith in God can be restored. Both struggle to raise their teen-aged children as single parents. This book started off kind of slow, however, the pace did pick up around the middle.

The characters are nice \\"people\\" (okay, echidnas, koalas, tortoises, etc.!), but not perfect. They learn important lessons in each episode.The claymation in this series is adorable. The animal characters are interesting and endearing. This is a series with good values, yet it doesn't take a preachy approach. Instead, it just illustrates some dilemmas which kids can face, and shows the characters learning from experience how to handle these situations. It also is really based around the idea that in life we should \\"always try to help!\\"-- what a great message to reinforce.Best of all (?!), unlike many programs for kids the Koala Brothers series is NOT torture for adults to watch this series with kids-- you'll find it entertaining, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"used it for a month then dumped it","review":"It was first of all poorly constructed. The first one I got had a crack in the bottom and there was no way to wind up the cord and it leaked water. Amazon happily exchanged it. I used it for a month then calcium deposits started forming fast and started to clog the holes. I tried to clean it but it just got worse. It does put out a lot of steam but that's about all it can do. Controls are hard to use. It comes with extras though like a demineralizer and plastic gaurd for the hot plate. I ended up buying a model w/ retractable cord and have been happily ironing ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with errors","review":"We have used Access guides for almost twenty years for many locations. They have always provided a strong alternative to the traditional guides, with a particular emphasis on architecture and design. We have returned our copy of this book. The maps for Florence are completely inaccurate with no co-relation between text and map numbers. Essentially the guide is of little use without a separate map. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T rely on the map numbers!","review":"I agree totally with the reviewer who complains about the lack of relationship between map numbers and street addresses. This edition is completely messed up, and unaware tourists are going to be standing in Florence, book in hand, wondering where the #$@&! the museum/gelateria/hotel is that was on the map for that location. What a shame - Access guides are usually just the best street-by-street guides around. And this isn't a matter of just being one number off, consistently, or of the location being just around the corner. Numbers on the map send you all the way across town sometimes, compared to where the location really is. Extremely weird and unexplainable. Why isn't HarperCollins pulling this off the shelves and/or offering buyers a corrected edition? Someone really dropped the ball here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong number","review":"Sadly, I have to agree with the previous three reviewers...I have just emailed HarperCollins in Australia to see whether they have correct maps (the text looks ok) and will post the gist of their reply if it seems useful.I HOPE the problem is only with Florence... I am going to Venice as well as Florence and the text looks useful.It looks to me as though the text is correct and the maps are wrong - but I stand to be corrected :) by more knowledgeable readers.UPDATE: The maps are indeed wrong, but HC Australia supplied correct ones. I suggest if you bought this flawed edition you contact HC and see how they can help.HC's service in helping to find a reasonable solution (I go to Italy shortly) was excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Errata","review":"On several of the maps in this book the numbers do not match their descriptions.

I was very happy to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, fascinating illustrations and good punchlines","review":"These three stories - which I remembered vividly from my own childhood - became a treasure for my own 3 y.o. In the first, Mitzi wakes early and decides to dress her baby brother and take him to visit their grandparents. Feeding, dressing, elevator, etc. She gets as far as the back seat of a cab, but she doesn't know the address, and the whole story unfolds in reverse. This story is so immediate for kids, because they think they know how to do so much and yet there are certain obstacles they still can't overcome. The other two stories are more of these iterative exercises. The pictures summon a Lower Manhattan where kids sat on stoops and stores sold gum, but the people are dressed for Nixon's re-election.

She stuggles with being quiet in the begining and really had no voice because she would never speak up, for herself or anyone else. Towards the end she begans to find her voice through journaling and writting down her thoughts. She learns that she has to speak up people to know and understand her and to let people know that she doesnt want to live with her mother. She also found her voice throughout the story by doing carvings and paintings. The carvings and paintings were part of her culture and family traditions. Naomi grows up and learns lots of things through the story and really finds herself though all the differnt experiences. I alo liked how the story had happy and sad moments but it was kind of a depressing story to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naomi Leon","review":"Becoming Naomi Leon is a story of two young children who were abandoned by their alcoholic mother at a young age and left to be raised by their positive thinking but equally tough great grandmother. Naomi, who narrates the story, shares the family's struggles when their mother comes to their trailer named Baby Beluga in Lemon Tree, California to break up this non-traditional but happy family. She not only shares the family's struggle to stay together but also shows the troubling time of adolensence struggling to grow from a child to a young woman. Throughout the novel we see Naomi transform from an awkwardly shy child to a young woman who speaks up and finds her own voice. Through this Naomi is able to relate to many other young readers going through the same tough time. Personally I can relate because I also grew up in an extended family and can also relate to the struggles of adolescence. Though this novel is simple and short it is a moving story to be enjoyed by many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naomi the Lion","review":"I think this book can relate to many young girls. Some girls have difficulties coming out of their comfort zone, and in this book it follows a young girl named Naomi through some hard times she is having. You also see how Naomi changes with the problems her and her family are facing. Many emotions come to play when her mother returns out of nowhere to see her and her brother, Owen after many years of being away. As you read this book, you really see how Naomi matures and finds herself at a young age. I thought this story was very good and it kept my attention. I think girls would enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great-grandmother","review":"The two children, 11 and 8, are being raised by their great-grandmother because their grandparents died in a car wreck and their parents abandoned them.

Through the journey to search for her father, Naomi is finally able to find her voice. She discovers who she really is and more about her Mexican-American culture.

I tried several time to do pick it up and continue, but finally just gave up and put it down. How convoluted, Salvador Dali thinking processed can you get? The real time part of this book is good and you become attached to the characters, but the minute you go to his otherworld it is so convuluted, out of touch it just can't come together. I think this writer could be really talented and has a lot to offer he just needs to stay in the real world. I had to stop reading it and I dont' recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing mess!","review":"This started as a promising story. I couldn't put it down in the beginning. It was a real story about a real boy in an exciting, intriguing situation. Then, somewhere in the middle, it just got weirder and odder and more confusing. And the stranger it got, the less interested I felt. It was difficult to visualize a world where every single thing (everything!) is unfamiliar. People don't look like people. Buildings don't look like buildings. It was hard to care about the side characters, because they were so bizarre. I love fantasy and science fiction, but this storyteller forgot something very important. The reader needs something familiar to help them relate to the story and characters. I definitely won't read the rest of this series. Blah! Way too strange and confusing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nix does it again","review":"this book is an unimaginable blend of magic,fantasy,realistic fiction,and suspense.

He doesn't know why he was given this key, but it is the only thing keeping him alive. The person who gave it to him is named Monday and wants the key back.

This book is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth Nix scores again","review":"Mister Monday tells the story of young Arthur Penhaligon's attempt to save the world, or at least his community and family, from a deadly virus. It certainly sounds simple enough, but this novel is anything but simple. Once again Nix takes the reader to unimaginable places where danger is always at hand and the rules aren't what they seem.THis series isn't as good as the Abhorson series, but then it is aimed at a younger audience. Even so, this series is well worth reading. The characters are likeable, the plot is complicated yet compelling and the writing superb. This fantasy will certainly hit the mark for anyone who enjoys the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This book started off very good, but as it progressed it was incredibly boring i was basically falling asleep to it. The story has no story line, it isn't planned out well, the characters aren't described well and its mostly a narator telling the story. I would not suggest this book to anyone it was terrible!

It is not long after before things start going amuk, and strange forces threaten his world.The boy, Arthur Penhaligon, drawn into complete despair, ventures into a house only he can see, and into a world he where he should not be.This book is sort of a cross between Harry Potter and the Matrix, but with clear invention and an all together fun story. Hold on tight, and don't be left behind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and fun for kids","review":"For this new series of book, Garth Nix obviously had a younger public in mind than for his best selling Abhorsen trilogy. The plot is simpler, the protagonist is younger and the language is easier. Difficult words are being explained. Having said that, this must be an absolute thrill to read when you're nine or ten. It puts an ordinary boy in charge of the Center of the Universe, if just for the Monday, and which ordinary boy wouldn't think that a very attractive idea?It's a story about adventure, but also about responsibility, and courage, and overall I could recommend it to any boy or girl, and their parents, to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book","review":"If you are a parent and want your kid to get into reading, this book is perfect.

It is even a great read for adults, as I found out while reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Subtle Knife vs Screwtape","review":"Other reviewers have mentioned the Potter series, but this book reminded me more of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. As in HDM, the world is bleak, the heroes are young and most adults seem oblivious to anyone else, except as they may be used in some grandiose scheme.Unlike with HDM, I couldn't develop any integrated picture of the KTTK world. Things were described, but the descriptions seemed like prop lists. The author seemed capable of throwing in anything or anyone that we might have read about elsewhere. For example, Prometheus shows up - with a different name.At times, I felt like I was reading a screenplay, \\"Hey, this'll look great in the film, (coming soon to a theater near you) and they probably have some on the backlot!\\" Maybe I should have called this 'Will and Dr. Who vs. Screwtape.' I did want to find out how it turned out, so despite all criticisms, I think it probably works for the early teenager that hasn't already read everything in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book by a Good Author","review":"In an effort to do whatever he can to save his family, his friends, and his world, Arthur Penhaligon enters the strange House that only he can see.

It is easy to interpret mania in the pages of the works on this CD - particularly in the Symphony No 1, which is almost comical in many of its melodic and structural elements. Unfortunately, it makes for some uncomfortable listening. The Symphony No 2 is more uniform, but also not very distinuished. The performances here are top-notch and well recorded - but can't make up for the subject matter. Careful when purchasing, unless you know what you are getting into.In an almost disturbingly parallel way, the liner notes (in translation) also appear to be written by someone not quite certain where their thoughts were going. Don't count on getting any reliable information about Klemperer or the pieces on the recording from these liner notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I haven't even seen ST: TMP, but I still enjoyed this book.

Yes, that's how bad this mixed up load of old nonsense really is. The only bonus is the second dvd with its' lengthy excerpt from a real Manson interview.Avoid this like the plague if you want to know what really happened. If you just like grizzly horror, make sure you skip to the murder chapters. The rest is just a film makers ego trip!...and not a very good one either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"If I could rate this movie minus 10 I would. There is nothing new here and as a matter of fact, the dialog is taken mostly from other movies (Hendrickson's \\"Manson\\")and repeated here in clips. \\"Manson\\", by the way, is a much better film if you want to learn about the Family from the actual participants. Charles Manson Superstar is another good one if you are after a learning experience. Both films above are disturbing and creepy in the sense that it is real.If you are just interested in sex, violence and blood then you will probably like Van Bebber's film because that's what it consists of.

I then tried it on a Word document and it happened the same. Everyone who's willing to improve his English pronunciation MUST try it, for it's really worth. I'll advise all foreign languages university students to buy it. The interactive exercises are also worth, as we hear whole sentences, and I like the idea to look for words both by typing in the text and the phonetic symbols.

I can't believe how poor their support service is that their first diagnostic to my question was assuming that the controller must be replaced.In the other hand, and the weirdest thing of all, this controller works with no problem on the pc.I was really excited with this controller, but now, I realized that buying an original 360 controller for just a few more dollars would be the best choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not have an invert switch","review":"I don't know why they continue to advertise this feature, as it hasn't been on these controllers for a couple of years.

After barely a month I noticed the right stick would turn to the left on it's own. I actually had to hit it with my hand to get it to stop. Yeah, stupid idea but that fact that the problem presented itself without any damage before I hit it makes this a terrible choice for a controller.

The biggest problem I have with it is that it doesn't like to stitch a regular, straight stitch--it really likes a zig-zag stitch. Putting it on the straight stitch setting doesn't work, but if I put the dial in between two zig zag stitches, it will stitch straight. So, a pretty easy fix for a stupid problem that I shouldn't be having, but oh, well. It's an OK cheap machine.**UPDATE:I've had this machine for about 6 months now, and I can no longer get it to make a decent stitch.

The birdnesting issues resurface everytime I rethread the machine, and while the machine works well for me in spurts, there is no consistency. I play with different needle sizes and with the upper thread tension, but with little luck. Even when the tension seems balanced, the machine will skip stitches randomly and occasionally reject a brand new needle (meaning that the needle will ram into some part of the bobbin case even if it doesn't look bent). I have been stranded in the middle of a project for months. In short, my experience learning to sew has been even more frustrating than I expected because of the difficulties with this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone's been listening to the Blue Album!","review":"I just heard this song recently on MTV and was greatly impressed.

The concert was great, and Nixon is amazing... and the rest of the guys are as well. This is definatley an up and coming band.

Very few Americans are familiar with the history of the turmoil in the Middle East. Fawal's book provides even the most learned historian with a glimpse into the conflict he might not ordinarily get. Fawal gives a balanced, relatively non-partisan depiction of the birth of the Arab-Jew conflict through the eyes of an embattled teenager by using symbolism and imagery reminiscent of J.D. Salinger.

For me and many others, claims of any literal truth to the Christian narrative have nothing to do with it. The power of the music, and its appeal to our sense of what is possible in our own lives is more than enough to inspire every feeling described by the previous reviewer.That said, this is an excellent performance, though many people consider Sargent's 1946 performance to be better. The Huddersfleld Choral Society was at its peak at that time, and the Dutton transfer is at least arguably better than the present one. Of course, you could obtain both versions, and others, including the masterful 1959 Beecham account (available on RCA), and enjoy this glorious music in your own way for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value for the $$$","review":"Hikari is known for quality products at reasonable prices.

I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered.I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of \\"children's books\\".That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Necklace","review":"Didn't realize how large the pendant was - I thought it was going to be a cute little choker.

I was right, but this was the WRONG book. It put me to sleep, didn't cover anything that well, and in the 2nd chapter, it showed a 12 page Java code! it said \\"you won't be doing this, but this is REAL java code\\" i just really thought the stupid book wasn't worth the money i invested"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"Absolutely empty book. I even have nothing to say about it. I would rate it 0 stars if it were in option. Links point primarily on JavaSoft.com and Netscape.com.

Since I has already been programming with Java, but not with Applets, I was told to for a new project. I got the book cheap in an auction, but finally it wasn't the schnappchen I had hoped. This book is somehow about the web, somehow about Java, somehow about browsers, somehow about search engines. It is not about applet programming. 40 pages out of 370 cover only the very very basics and did not even reach the deepness of SUN's tutorial.

Good job! Can't wait to read more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and balanced at the same time.","review":"I enjoyed the detail the author put into this book. He did his research well, interviewing many sources from both sides of the issue. His writing style was humorous but direct. Both campaigns were stripped away from the facade they gave the public to the raw win-at-all-costs approach to gain the ultimate political prize. While I was glad to see the outcome, this book reveals all the work that went on behind the scenes, both positively and negatively.Of the several books on the market covering this topic, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined for the Bargain Bin","review":"Shoddily researched, pregnant with speculation, this book is destined for the shameful dust heap of advocacy journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"The book is easy to read. But it really is just an long winded argument that has already been beaten to death. It assumes that the people of the United States are stupid, ill informed and can form no opinions on their own.

In view of recent events, it is rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring with an Uneven Hand","review":"This story has been told in a number of books so there is nothing new here that millions have not seen on TV or read in newspapers. What I find so utterly tasteless is the title of the book. A)It is not true and B) given recent events isn't it time to rally behind our president instead of shedding doubt on him? This book is more an accident than our president, because it hits and runs with criticism toward Bush, but has hardly a hash word for Gore. This book does get my vote!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth About The \\"Accidental\\" President","review":"This book is nothing but typical mean spirited, unamerican, liberal spin. The truth is that all but two of the Supreme Court justices found serious Constitutional problems with the selective Florida recounts.

Gone are many of the cartoons and genuinely humorous pictures, gone are the victorian prints and original art collections, which made the older version a pleasure to use, and offered really unusual material.It's still a decent program. It is easy to use and gives you access to many images on the DVD or CDs as well as online.

Even if the movie is bad I still try to find something I like, like this scene was great because..... or I like when they id this because....but this movie had nothing. I'm sorry i feel bad leaving bad reviews because they tried to make something good, but I cant say anything nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, but I think I got it.&ss","review":"I watched this film with my beau and we spent the first hour yelling, \\"What an idiotic idea! Don't do it!\\". Watching this couple entertain the idea that sleeping with other people would somehow enhance their marriage was depressing, nauseating and downright cringeworthy. However, if the viewer pays close attention, I believe that the cheating scenes as well as the aftermath are meant to repesent what MAY have happened if they'd gone ahead with this ridiculous plan. The last scene shows the couple in bed, still toying with the idea. I certainly didn't think this was a great movie,but I think the film maker's message was that thls is a bad idea! I was surprised that none of the other reviewers realized that the actual carrying out of the idea was hypothetical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"Very quick delivery and even though the book I bought was used, it was in great condition. Thanks for the great service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Another History of Chicago","review":"I was totally frustrated trying to read this book. The author constantly embellished meaningful thoughts with 'pretty' words that distracted me from the meaning of the sentence. For example: \\"Stripped of the rhetoric that made it seem a mechanical deity, the railroad...\\". He also pegged his story on words like 'booster', 'hinterland' and 'metropolis' and then used them over and over again to the point of total annoyance. Hey if you are an English major go for this book and enjoy the 'beautiful' writing but if you just want a history of Chicago find another author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for planners, economists, and future-thinkers of all types.","review":"City Planners, Urban Economists, Futurists, and others whoponder the evolution of cities must read this engaging study ofChicago's development. William Cronon's exceptionally well-researched and presented story is an arresting account of Chicago's evolution from a rough frontier trading post to a world-class metropolis. As the connecting point between the industrial/financial East and the agricultural/resource-based West, Chicago capitalized on its physical location as a transportation nexus, and prospered. Cronon's portrayal of the large and small influences that led to Chicago's success is intriguing to those of us who search for similar clues in contemporary situtions, and who wonder which of our current outposts will be the Chicago of the 21st century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a blend of geographic, business and urban history","review":"I bought this book during a business trip to Chicago. Late on a clear summers day I started reading as we flew west high above Cronon's America. I was still reading at L.A. and I finished it somewhere over the South Pacific as we were close to home. Its really economic geography/history with maps. Some of the analysis is dated and suggests an historian playing in an unfamiliar field e.g. Cronon spends some time developing the von Thunen rings theory of urban growth. This was considered to be a deterministic and flawed theory by my grad. geography teachers 20yrs ago . But, a book I enjoyed and reopened for me an interest in landscape transformation and urban history. You should also try Fernand Braudel's books the \\"commerce and civilisation\\" series of 3 - wonderful readable stuff on a bigger geographic scale but in a similar vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"A gorgeously designed, oversized hardcover with fantastic essays that illuminate Tichy's history and work.

Please check with Jones and Bartlett Publishers for more information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they let other people write in Dr Seuss' name!!??","review":"The only similarity \\"Oh, the Places You'll Go\\" has to Geisel's work is the repetition and the drawing (which isn't up to his standards.) This book isn't worth reading to my 3 year old, my 6 year old, nor myself. It seems to have nothing but a philosophical agenda to push. It goes off on too many tangents - \\"You'll go frightening places\\", but doesn't resolve them for the little kid. They have used big words to make a rhyme, where Geisel himself would make up a creative word instead. This stuff is nothing like Geisel and just confuses the buying public. Certainly Geisel was an artist of the first magnitude, but one would think a professional writer could have put a week's worth of thought into the writing and come up with a book that flows better and uses children's level words."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Doctor Seuss!","review":"Overall, the text in the book is cheerful, although somewhat pragmatic...it has highs and lows included, and stresses the ability to get out of the lows and back to the highs. It is the familiar Seuss writing style, with lots of illustrations. Our 3 month old enjoys looking at most of the illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, the Places You'll Go!","review":"Bought this as a graduation gift for my friend's granddaughter who graduated from high school.

I think that it would be a lot more useful to get a positive feeling for what one can find out there, than to be told that finding the same old cheese in a different cheese box is the way to face the future.When I am reached retirement age, I looked on Dr Seuss's book as a positive picture of what might still be in store for me. My cry was, \\"Bring on the future!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Strained - not classic, but alright","review":"Like his posthumous 'Daisy', 'Places' lacks the zing, the excitement, the otherworldliness of his classics.The strength in 'Places' is the message, which is OK - fairly new and simple, but eventually boring - not ennobling, like 'Lorax'.The drawings are weak, comparatively empty and labored. Compare to 'Sleep Book', which is a completely engrossing new world at every turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad if you don't look at it as a children's book...","review":"Like dog owners that buy food for dogs that is more appealing from a human perspective, many of these reviewers liked this because it touches them from an adult perspective. Not only is this not that great for children, it's not even the good Dr.'s best work. If you don't believe me, buy it for you kid and see how they like it compared to other books. Not very engaging for kids...Try one fish, two fish instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"over done","review":"Don't get me wrong- Dr. Suess is king of children's books.

Don't do this to someone you care about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money for graduation gift","review":"Having received 3 copies of this book on high school graduation and 2 more following college, I implore others to refrain from purchasing this book. A student headed to college or their first job would get so much more from either (1) useful items for their dorm room or apartment or (2) books geared towards personal finance, leadership or other professional/executive training - years later, topics I wish I knew more about when I was young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love, Family Absent from Book","review":"I cringe every time my son (4yrs old) has me read him this book. I hate it. The basic premise -- if you don't like where you are, get up and leave it all behind for great adventure, and when that doesn't work out, you'll have to figure it all out for yourself and then you'll be back at it, unless that doesn't work out... etc. The premise is not only flawed, it runs counter to everything I'd like him to learn: that he is surrounded by love and the support of his family and friends, and that when the going gets tough he shouldn't just leave town; he should learn to value trusted relationships to help him overcome challenges. The book has no sense of family, love, or other type of support, and while it does say \\"kid, you'll move mountains\\" it forgets to say \\"kid, you're well-grounded and loved\\" and that is a fatal error by Seuss. Also, the language (complex - \\"dexterous and deft\\") is not suitable for young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"card\\" for any graduate!","review":"My daughter just graduated college and a friend suggested this book to me. Her main gift was a stunning Italian leather brief case but when she opened it up I had this book inside and had inscribed it. She loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always relevant no matter where you are in life","review":"Typically this book makes a great graduation gift, be it high school, college or some other similar milestone. It easily speaks to those who are setting sail out into the world. I read this book for the first time many years after I last graduated from anything so it's a testament to this timeless story that I was surprised how much 'Oh, The Places You'll Go' was relevant to my life at present.As I write this review I am currently unemployed during the Great Recession. I'm optimistic for the future but, to borrow from the book, I've come down from the Lurch and now I'm in a Slump. This is not a fun place to be though I'm sure it will define me for the rest of my life, good or bad.If you're thinking about giving this book as a gift, and you should, don't forget to read it again yourself.

Dr. Seuss's whimsical book takes an optimistic look at life and its ups and downs or as he puts it, \\"Bang-ups and hang-ups can happen to you.\\" In this book, his lovable and memorable rhymes are encouraging as well as entertaining and tongue twisting.

It was not quite a life changing experience, but it came close.

My niece hasn't gotten them yet (she will on her first birthday), but I know she'll have fun with these, too.What I liked (pros):-Small, portable, can be carried in a diaper bag-ENTERTAINING for small children-Authentic noises!-Educational: the names of each animal are embroidered on it-Good for ages 6 mos-2 yrs (probably longer)-A perfect gift: a great toy, but you can't find them at your local toy store"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mixer!","review":"I love it.

It is a substantial mixer, heavy, you will have to leave it on the counter...too heavy to be put away constantly. I have read reviews that the metal flat beater tends to flake with time. We'll see. I'm ordering the juicer (we live in Florida-lots of oranges in the front yard).By the way, last night on the television program, Baking with Julia Childs, I saw a KitchenAid in use.

I have yet to find a job that this thing could not handle: egg whites come out perfectly, dough is kneaded without a bead of sweat forming on my (or the machine's) brow.For most of us though, this is a mixer that allows us to consider everything we could make if we had the time, energy, or inclination (or for some, the skill). Mostly, it takes its place on the counter next to the Cuisinart and looks spiffy. But what the hell, for those who wander through Williams-Sonoma and salivate over the 'dream' toaster and the 'can't live without it' blender, this is the must have mixer.After all \\"dude, it's the best.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooooooo great!!!","review":"In my first review I hadn't had a chance to use it yet. since then I have used it & it is everything I hoped it would be.

The brand had such an excellent reputation for quality and durability. After replacing the mixer 3 times for reasons from motor burnout to a badly wobbling head I finally gave up and asked for my money back which I then invested in a really fine piece of kitchen equipment, the Electrolux Kitchen Assistent (spelling is Swedish as that's where it's made). It is far more powerful, durable, sturdy and versatile.

It's beautiful and powerful. This Thanksgiving, I attempted to make mashed potatoes and the lever/motor is not working properly. The machine turns on (at a medium speed only) and quits after 10 seconds. It will turn back on, but only at medium speed (no matter where the lever is) and will turn itself off after 10 seconds. It's just disappointing. No wonder they discontinued this model. I'm going to try to fix this-my dad is handy. I still love the looks & when it's working properly I love how powerful it is. I'm disappointed with this product as I only used it maybe 45 times, I guess I didn't get my money's worth on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough, but not invincible","review":"The Epicurean has been one of the best additions to our kitchen (aside from the Pyrex digital oven thermometer). Used it to mix up batter for 20 fruitcakes (batter can get *very* stiff) one Christmas and it handled the job quite nicely. It also does very well with putting together dough for sugar spritzer cookies. We even use it sometimes to mix meatloaf. It groaned a little bit at times, but backing off on the speed seemed to make it a little happier.The 6 quart bowl gives you plenty of room to make large batches of whatever you want and the shield/pouring spot helps contain the mess.The only thing my wife complains about is the whininess of the motor. It often makes people think that there's something wrong with the mixer, but the Kitchenaid people said that's the way it's supposed to sound.If you need a large capacity mixer, this is definitely one to consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a lickin","review":"We have had a 5 qt mixer for several years now.

Joe's family is saved with the help of Nate Romanowski, Joe's wild friend who may -- or may not have -- gotten wild with Joe's wife.CJ Box' Joe Pickett has gone from refreshing, self-doubting (and self-aware) lawman to self-parody.

It has become increasingly worse over the last month and since it's losing .2 to .5 miles on previously ridden 10 to 30 mile courses, is essentially useless as anything other than an HRM.I confirmed the magnet and sensor are set to specs. The sensor to computer distance is also within specs, and worked fine for 2 years. I emailed Polar service about the problem, no reply. I've bought a new speed sensor, still glitches.

I have to have my magnet and the sensor both angled inward so they're about 1/8\\" apart. That's ridiculous. Not only is it not aerodynamic, it looks stupid.

His ability to make the characters leap off the page and into the reader's mind is remarkable. He is one of the few contemporary authors that have an uncanny ability to make you feel that the book's plot is actually happening somewhere in the world. Not only is this an enjoyable book to read (enjoyable in that you care so much about the characters that you have to keep reading, no matter how much your eyes hurt), but it's a topic that is largely untouched in contemporary writing. Buy the book, read the book, then share this one with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trans-Sister Radio","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is the first book I've read on transsexuals or transgendered. Chris Bohjalian did his research and the book gave me incredible insight and sympathy to the difficulties that a transgendered or transsexual individual goes through. Though the book is fiction, you really develop feelings for the characters and it seems as if it were a real story. It has a beautiful and ironic ending.

But it thinks it is. Furthermore, I couldn't really tell any difference between the narrators. He has the same voice as she and they have the same voice as her. You get the idea. I hate to say it, but I've read instructions on the backs of seed packets that had more passion. Now, with a topic like this, one would expect one's fingers to be glued to the page, turning and turning, madly. Sadly, this was not the case with Mink's fingers. Mink's fingers tapped.

The premise of the novel was very different and had great potential, but could have been handled in a more intelligently matter. I finished the book just to finish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"Chris chose a hard to tackle topic. It most definitely had a twist, but the twist was so big it was hard to concentrate on the other things that were happening in the story. The switching of viewpoints with the radio transcripts in the middle was confusing. I kept asking myself why they were there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who finds this ending completely false?","review":"I mean really. First of all, the idea is very original, and I looked forward to reading the book. I was very disappointed. Dana was extremely selfish and I felt no sympathy. She/he was an empty shell - I really knew nothing about her, aside from her gender difficulties. The use of four different points of view was unique, but they were too similar. It would've been better to stick to one. And the ending! Don't even get me started. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"A lot of corny emoting and boring conversations. The transsexual subject matter was the most interesting/intriguing part of the book. The characters and plot were borderline anemic. I was frustrated when some of the conversations seemed to go on and on. The town conflict was what kept me reading. I wish it were better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't ring true.","review":"Bohjalian is too talented a writer to rely on something as inherently sensational as transgender relationships and sex change operations. He did approach the topic with something new to offer -- how the operation affects the people around the transexual. But he quickly devolves into the expected -- and butchers any chance he has of making a statement about the nature of sex and gender and relationships, and how gender can transcend the physical.The idea that a man could be handsome as a man and equally gorgeous as a woman is ludicrous -- as is the idea that a woman would \\"accept\\" that her ex-husband becomes involved with the man/woman she used to date. Add to that the fact that the voices of his characters all sound the same (even the college-aged girl sounds exactly the same as her mother).Bohjalian wrote this with a heavy hand, and in doing so lost any chance of creating a meaningful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writers get to describe their fantasies....","review":"Chris B. has a thing with girl-on-girl (...). I've read other books by him and it seems to be something he gets off on (not always girl-on-girl, --that only happens in this book.) In fact, it's like he wanted to write about it so then built the plot and characters around it. Which is fine, I mean hey, that's a writer's perrogative. I just didn't buy WHY Allie loved Dana so much, --I didn't feel any sparks from the first moment they met-- would a woman really lust after such a slight, effeminate man to the point where she wouldn't care if he became a woman? I just didn't buy the strength of that relationship. And when narrating from the four characters' POV, the writing was all very similar: meaning I didn't really get four distinct \\"feels\\" from them. The writing was pretty much the same across the board. I just thought this was an unrealistic, gratoutious and unbelievable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trans-Sister way short","review":"Boo - I don't know what else to say. I tried, it didn't work, I tried again, I tried harder; in the end, this book simply sucks. No where near what Bohjalian has done with Midwives. Bohjalian is a talented author who's descriptive qualities are superb, but he really needs to find some interesting material that strikes a chord with the masses..."},{"rating":"1","title":"As if there isn't enough sex in our world already...","review":"I found this book to be little more than a Jerry Springer situation in novel form. Maybe some people like stories like that, but personally, I found Trans-Sister Radio to be centered completely around the subject of lust, NOT love, as well as a disgusting reflection on the morals of men and the objectivity of women. I shared it with my mother, and when she finished it, she threw it in the trash. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who enjoys real literature. Mr. Bohjalian writes a lot from a woman's point of view about sex. It makes me wonder if he has a gender identity problem himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another triumph for Bohjalian","review":"It's seldom you encounter a storyteller of Chris Bohjalian's skill and sensitivity. He demonstrated his talents with Midwives and The Law of Similars, and now he's done it again. This is a risky novel that takes mainstream characters (and readers) to the outer limits of human emotional and sexual experience, and the author makes it all entirely believable. These are people in difficult straits who retain (or regain) their sense of humanity. The book is by turns surprising, heart-rending, outrageous, and triumphant, but always utterly engaging. As in all of Bohjalian's novels, his charaters are people you can really feel for... quirky and unique and unforgettable. Chris Bohjalian is at the top of his form. (The cover is terrific, too!) I'm already looking forward to his next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting; jarring","review":"I'm not quite sure how to react to this novel, although I liked it. Mr. Bohjalian has yet again written a daring and gripping novel about people who are at once easy to relate to and difficult to fathom. Some parts of the book were painful to read (the surgery section is not for the squeamish). However, Mr. Bohjalian brings great insight to the intersection of the personal and political, and writes about a usually forbidden topic with understanding and kindness. This is not a topic I would have been interested in if Mr. Bohjalian didn't write it, but since he was the author, I enjoyed it almost as much as \\"Midwives\\" and \\"The Law of Similars.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Well-Handled","review":"This book on transgendered relationships was very interesting. I really enjoyed it. The plot, however, was a bit predictable, but the characterizations struck me as realistic. And I thought that the rather delicate subject matter was handled well. The detail on the surgery was a little - well, more than a little - graphic, but it was an important part of the story, even if it was not for the squeamish. I think Bohjalian is a very talented writer and I really enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although a timely and interesting subject - I found the writing to be poor and the characters one dimensional. This is not a book I would recommend. There were several interesting passages which accounts for the 2 stars but mainly Bohjalian harps on the same points over and over without adding anything new or thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"notes from Mom","review":"I just wanted to pass on my mother's reactions -- she's in her 70s, and not always very much at home in \\"today's world.\\" She seems to have started the book without any idea of what it was about -- I guess she doesn't read reviews . . . The first surprise was figuring that out -- the second was discovering that she wanted to finish the book in spite fo her discomfort; she cares too much about the characters to just let go of them.The whole thing has her thinking about her world, \\"today's world,\\" and the world we're raising her granddaughter to inhabit. All in all, a pretty good return on a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master Surgeon Is In","review":"Someone you love is changing. Maybe he's changing politics, or taking up Buddhism, or just going through a rough patch. Of course you continue to love him. But what happends when the person you love is changing genders? You continue to love . . . who? Once again, Chris Bohjalian takes his razor sharp imagination deep into the heart of a new dramatic conflict. Bohjalian's universe is full of real people facing incredibly complicated situations with humor and humanity -- decent people we might hope to emulate if we found ourselves in a similar predicament. As with many of Bohjalian's dramatic concoctions, I'd much rather read about these folks than have to endure their stories. No wonder you can't walk through an airport these days without seeing one of this guy's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark, lurid read","review":"Chris A. Bohjalian has written a compelling, disturbing and heartwarming novel from an otherwise tricky subject matter.Trans-Sister Radio is a novel written in five parts - using four points of view with excerpts from a NPR radio interview. Set in Vermont, Dana Stevens, a college professor, meets and falls in love with Allie, a divorced mother and college student. The romance goes well - that is until Dana tells Allie that he's planning on having a sex change operation...Trans-Sister Radio is a beautiful, unique, lurid and dark read. Chris A. Bohjalian took quite a chance with the subject matter - sex change operations, the dealings after the aforementioned change - and did a wonderful job with it. This novel enthralled me from beginning to end, and I look forward to reading more work from this talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I thought Midwives was great. I even enjoyed The Law of Similars. But this was the most ineptly written book I've read in years. The characters are so incredibly one-dimensional that you can't remember a single point of their lives.The plot, though, is the bigger problem. What could have been a fascinating story about a subject most people have never encountered is instead turned into a series of awkward speeches. It reads more like an educational treatise on tolerance than a novel. A huge waste of time -- not even enjoyable as mindless reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gender lines blurred","review":"Only a writer such as Chris Bohjalian could pull this off, and then barely. Not only is the character a transgender M2F, but a lesbian as well. Not only is she in love, she is in love with heterosexual whom she met and courted as a man. Going from one to another as narrators makes the tale more readable and believable. Chris is an expert at getting inside his characters. I felt I understood more about the subject of transgenders after reading this book. However, I still don't feel the characters would have interacted in this way. I really didn't buy the ending either. But this book is worth a read, especially if you want to know about a subject BEFORE making judgments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I found this book well written, interesting, with well thought out characters. It brought up a lot of issues dealing with who and how we love, what gender means, and the changes that people are capable of. I thought it was thoroughly enjoyable, but I really was disappointed with the ending,also. While Chris Bohjalian tried to show the complexities of love and gender and sexual identity, why did he have to have everyone remaining straight in the end?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one","review":"Such an unusual topic- Chris Bohjalian has wonderful stories- it's always a surprise to read any of his novels- they're terrific, and more people should discover him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent figure","review":"I bought this figure and was very suprised how well it was made and how nice it looks, i strongly recommend this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing!","review":"Some great pictures, I won't deny, but particularly, my expectations were way beyond that what I could get from this book. Most of the pictures are in plain old B&W, instead of being in living colors. The great majority don't even have a subtitle, therefore, we get a little lost sometimes. Besides, as this book was supposed to be something like a filming diary, it could depict much more behind-the-scenes stills, making of candids and so on, and even could show some text in it. I think if you only like to see pictures then the book will be ok, but if you're a die hard fan, searching for news about the filming of the picture, then this book will be the wrong choice. I think maybe to those photo admirers the book will be a disappointing, so, I wouldn't recommed it at all. I am quite disappointed myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond on Set - Filming Die Another Day","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. When you get a book that involves the making of a movie, you look for details in set location, make-up, special effects, etc. This book is 95% pictures. I wanted information not pictures. Therefore, this book was a waste of time and money for me. There was a similar book for \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", but that book described the movie making procewss in detail. That was the way that this one should hav ebnn written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality for a Used Item","review":"This book arrived much quicker than I thought and in much better condition than expected.

A big thank-you to Henry Winkler and Lin Oliver for not overlooking young boys as an important literary audience.The characters are relateable, the subject matter real and humorous. I would reccommend this to anyone with kids in thier lives ages 9-12. These books will win over even your most reluctant reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"I have 3 kids who are dyslexic in one form or another. My husband and I are also dyslexic, but I wasn't discovered until we started diagnosing my oldest. I bought the books after seeing Henry Winkler's interview on TV. I have been reading them to my kids at night. After three chapters, my oldest asked me if this kid is dyslexic. The book is well written and enjoyable to read. I have enjoyed this peek into one type of a dyslexic mind so much that I am buying several copies to give to some of the teachers at my childrens' school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful reading","review":"To be quite honest, I wanted to read this book because when I was growing up, Henry Winkler was one of my favorites. Now that I have read the book, he is still on my list. This book would be an excellent classroom read aloud. The fast paced dialogue and eye for detail kept my interest. Hank Zipper, the narrator, is such a well thought out character. Anyone who has been around ADD, AHDH, or other children with learning disabilities will recognize him immediately. Winkler is right on with this book. I just hope that as a teacher, I am more like Mr. Rock than Ms. Adolph!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pimsleur Chinese Mandarin Quick and Simple","review":"This method would be perfect if it had a text book attached to it.

As a screwdriver for light jobs it works fine. What I don't like is the ratcheting mechanism. For example, when you try to screw with it, if the screw is loose or medium loose you can't take advantage of the ratcheting. Because every time you try to use it the screw will move backwards. It's not until your screw is tight that you can really enjoy the ratcheting mechanism. I decided to purchase a Stanley 68-010 10 and it's much better. It goes for about 3 dollars more than this one here at Amazon and it's well worth the price.

The watch itself did not have neither plastic protector wraps on the bracelet nor the original tags or warranty cards from Cartier. At a heartbeat, looking at it, anyone could tell that the watch was either a high mileage display model or a worn item. At a closer look, without even a magnifier, I noticed some visible scratches and dirt glued into the bracelet and the case. The back of the watch also had the signs of wear.I own quite a few of upscale timepieces, starting from Rolexes Daytona SS, 18K... and up to Vacheron, Audemars and Patek.

Each musical selection is shown in its full score so that the reader/listener can get a better image of what their reading about or hearing (the only way one can understand some of these examples is to go out and listen to these examples otherwise their just notes on a page). Quite possibly my favorite section is the one where Berlioz describes his \\"perfect\\" orchestra. It is one so massive that it sends chills down my spine! A must have for any music library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treatise!","review":"This book on orchestration is top notch. Not only does it cover the basics, but it goes further by accepting that some \\"rules\\" can be broken to get the desired effect the orchestrator is looking for. I would recommend it to beginners as well as advanced students who want to learn to go beyond the borders."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"The revision by R. Strauss added a lot of technical in-depth, that today remains current."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good design","review":"I bought this one to try and I like it. Seems well made and can be moved from tree to tree easily. I have bought only one and used it for 4 trees by rotating it. I have a big yard and wanted something to allow slow watering of newly planted trees without having to leave hoses all over the place. You do have to drag the hose to where it is once for filling but you could use 5 gallon buckets to fill if a hose will not reach. If your tree is planted on a slope, be careful to place it well as it is very heavy when filled and once mine toppled over because I did not distribute the weight well while filling it."},{"rating":"2","title":"tree gator bags","review":"I recently planted 3 new trees and was searching for an easy way to keep the trees watered. I saw the Tree Gator bags being used by our city and that was my introduction to them. They were easy to set-up, easy to fill with water and seemed to release the water slowly enough so the ground could absorb the water and stay close to the tree roots.Overall I am very pleased with the Tree Gators. The one improvement I would recommend is to make the water intake hole larger so it would allow the use of spray nozzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tree Gator","review":"I planted about 18 trees in an area I had no access to water without bringing it in via waterwagon. This was perfect. I first attempted to let the water slowly run from the hose to the trees. What I found was I either over watered or had a lot of run off. I had seen this product and was hesitant bc of the large investment to purchase so many of these items.However, I did as I also have a much greater investment in my trees and I stared using these last week. I am now watering once a week. I use approximately 400 gallons of water to cover all the trees and previously I was using over 1000 gallons and did not get near the results I am getting now. Well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the city uses","review":"This is the bag I've been looking for in my local home improvement stores... it was worth returning the dreadful ooze tube (that was missing a part) and paying a few more bucks for the Treegator. This is the heavy duty Gator bag that the city and other landscapers use on newly planted trees. Did I mention HD used it on their trees for sale, but they don't sell the bags? The quality is great- it zippers to keep the bag from blowing away when it's empty...I was a bit concerned it would be too heavy around my little tree- but it worked fine!I'm just hoping my tree makes it through the summer this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad we purchased, saved our trees","review":"Easy to use, attach to tree before filling with water. Had to use all our water hoses to reach trees. So that could be a drawback for people with larger pieces of property. Quality material-similar to a tarp instead of a trash bag like some. Blends in with surroundings better than buckets and takes less space to store. Building new home with lots of landscaping to do yet, glad we didn't buy knock offs to save a buck, durable material for many uses to come. We will probably get the smaller brown ones too when we plant shrubs. Saves time, only have to fill twice a week instead of watering every other day. We haven't had rain in a month (TN) but new trees are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"releases water too fast","review":"not a bad product. it releases the water way too fast. if was over a two day or three day period at a slow drip, it would be a great product. however, this releases all of its water within a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treegator work great","review":"After pricing these locally and discovering how much markup there was, I found them at Amazon at a much more reasonable price. I bought 5 but should have bought a 2-3 and then rotated them as needed - duh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you need it first","review":"I'm sure the tree gator works well - if you need it. Many people (including me until recently) erroneously assume that if it's hot and dry out their plants need to be watered. I recommend getting an inexpensive hydrometer that you stick in the ground to test how wet the soil actually is. I was surprised to find out my fruit trees had moderately wet soil (perfect for them) about 4\\" below the surface (where the roots start), while the surface was bone dry. I would also highly recommend a reasonable layer of organic mulch - it goes a long way to keeping the soil moist and adding tilth and is way cheaper than buying & managing tree gators. Never underestimate mother nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as advertised!","review":"Nothing fancy about this product but it does a great job of supplying only the needed amount of water to my newly planted oak tree. In the past I would water the tree using a hose and on a number of occasions I forgot to turn off the hose resulting in the tree being overwatered and wasting water which in the current drought situation here in Texas is a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"watering trees","review":"watering occurs over 4-9 hours and can be done weekly.

I would recommend it for long term watering needs. The price was reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This product was easy to use, convenient, and really cut down on the amount of time spent watering our new trees. We have a large lot so dragging the hose to each tree every 20 mins was getting old. Now we fill once and done for a couple of days. It's also the best way for the tree to get watered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Transaction & Great Product","review":"The item ordered was received promptly, well packaged, and in the condition stated on Amazon.com. This transaction went smoothly and business-like. These are awesome and work very well. I have purchased three in the past year. On one, the water drain holes got plugged up somehow and wouldn't drain the water completely. This is the only reason I down-graded the rating I've given. I merely took a hole punch and made the drain holes larger; this worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY wanted to like this, but....","review":"I simply could not get the product to work as promised. I tried it with three different trees, built up the level of mulch around the trees, etc. In all cases: no matter what I did, the water wound up running out beneath the bottom edge. The bag simply did not fill.I ordered two of these, and will hold on to one in the hope that the product works better with newly planted saplings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Tree Gator is an excellent investment to protect new transplants. Zipper is heavy quality, easy to fill and maintain."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for short trees!","review":"Product works great, however, I didn't take into consideration that my newly planted Japanese Maple tree didn't have enough trunk! I did manage to \\"crunch\\" it up a bit, it just took longer to drain than the other one that was able to stand straight on my Serviceberry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The summer of 2012 has been a drought in the midwest. I bought two new large trees in the spring and was very worried about watering them. The Treegators have kept them watered all summer and thriving.I would recommend buying one for every new plant you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly NOT heavy !","review":"Really bad decision on my part.

In my bookLeadership Matters...The CEO Survival Manual: WHAT IT TAKES TO REACH THE C-SUITE AND STAY THEREI spend a great deal of time addressing leadership as it relates to change, innovation and performance. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in deepening their understanding of leading change."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Entry to the Field","review":"I'll make this short & sweet. My introduction to Gioconda was the Cerquetti/Del Monaco studio performance on Decca way back in 1960. I loved the opera. Then I heard the Callas/Barbieri/Poggi/Silveri/Neri recording a few months later which turned me into Maria's most devoted fan on my campus. The present Urmana/Domingo issue does not disappoint, but overall I would recommend the Cerquetti as the \\"best\\" all around performance ... although I would not be without both Callas performances, the Milanov and Tebaldi studio recordings, and the Caballe for sheer b eauty of the pianissimos. Also, if yu want a blood-and-thunder Gioconda, the Arangi-Lombardi vintage issue is quite thrilling. But, heck, the Urmana is worth a hearing. This is an opera which has not received a bad studio recording to date, so if your finances are limited, this new EMI release is not a poor choice ... it's just surpassed by earlier recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of heart!","review":"Man , Carlos Vives has an incredible way of taking classic cumbia songs, and adapting them to his unique style.

It is inaccurate, prejudiced and a very distorted book. Scott wants to portray the French Revolution as the most evil event in history, so he twists the facts and randomly invents new ones. His bibliography alone shows his total lack of famliarity with the major historical books on the period. If you want a true picture of Robespierre, there are numeros first rate studies by legitimate scholars, such as J.M. Thompson, Norman Hanson, and the brilliant REVOLUTIONARY CAREER OF MAXIMILIEN ROBESPIERRE by David Jordan (one of American's leading experts on the period), Otto Scott, on the other hand, provides an amateurish effort best forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Useless Muddle","review":"I recently wrote a term paper on Robespierre using a dozen sources, some pro-Robespierre like Gallo and Rude, some balanced pro and con like Norman Hamspon and Thompson and some anti-Robespierre like Belloc. Then there are the off the wall zealots, who throw history to the wind and launch diatribes that ignore and totally distort history. This book by Otto Scott falls into this category. I found it usful only to point out in my paper how some people crudely try merely to manipulate facts and events to promote some half baked notions. It is really a total muddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogance and paranoia","review":"Otto Scott's approach to Robespierre is a rather unusual one. He falls into the trap of using error-filled and discredited sources, but that is not unusual. Many writers on the French Revolution do that. What is strange is his attitude toward the goals of the Revolution. Most writers concede that the revolutionaires were sincerely hoping for the betterment of all French citizens. But Scott seems to have a thread of paranoia running throughout the entire book. His fear seems to be that the ordinary, working class Frenchman will now have the same rights as his \\"betters\\". His terror of mob rule is so intense that he cannot be in any way objective. The book has a great many mistakes and is at times unintentionally hilarious. Avoid it by all means unless you really know your history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor scholarship","review":"Mr. Scott betrays his lack of familiarity with the era, and instead rants for most of this book, which should be avoided by any serious readers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance, a bit old-fashioned, yet still fresh, though","review":"Not much action there, true enough, but this tale of the Old West makes for healthy entertainment with quite an unexpectedly moral ending to it, too.

It certainly has something to do with the fact that the band is loaded with virtuoso talent on banjo, mandolin, guitar, etc. The presentation of the songs is very well done, with exquisitely beautiful tunes interleaved with songs that are good old, toe-tapping fun. The Dirt Band style makes classics like \\"Rocky Top\\" and \\"The Battle of New Orleans\\" sound better than old versions that you thought could not be improved upon.

If you want to get an album by Grapes of Wrath, pick up \\"Now and Again\\" not \\"Treehouse.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Square soundtrack ever","review":"When Squaresoft released Final Fantasy VII in 1997 for the Playstation.. its was more than a game. It was an event. Here we had a very well known franchise making its debut on the then new system breaking the barriers of the RPG world and even past Final Fantasy games. The story and plot were fresh and the atmosphere sucked you in.But there was one thing that made it even more memorable: the music. The music isn't just good.. its spectacular. If you want to make a comparison, its like the Edward Scissorhands soundtrack by Danny Elfman (his best). The cues and mood are dead on and its nothing short of memorable.Not only that, but this spans 4 CDs! You basically get every music bit from the game in its orginal form. Enough of me talking.. if you liked the game and want to see the pinnacle of video game music, get this soundtrack! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"The Dvd would not play in my Samsung 3D blueray player, but did play in 2 other dvd players, which are not 3D players with no trouble.

To me, it seemed to be just a pastiche of plots that were done better by other authors. I could just see the author going through her inventory of idea index cards and choosing them at random: big-city woman returning to her roots to start a small b&b, injured big-city cop/hunk/town-bad-boy returning to his roots to heal after his partner was killed, the failing old homestead, cattle rustling, the too-soon pregnant young married couple, the fighting old-marrieds (with the maternal character totally lifted from an old Maureen O'Hara-John Wayne movie), etc, etc, etc. Bah!

Oh well, her husband isn't her husband - let me adopt a baby and get over it. I actually started to dislike Maggie because of her oh well attitude towards this tragedy happening to her best friend. I think I would slap any man who told me my best friends life was just turned upside down and in the same sentence asked me to marry him. And then she didn't see Daphne for awhile? I know I would need my best friend at that time.

There are a few facts in there but it's so slow going it gets to the point where you figure out where they're headed five chapters before they get there.

Don't waste any effort on this sewage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and enticing","review":"This is a story without heroes. That said...the characters are exquisitely drawn. The romance between Alec and Richard is surprisingly sweet, especially since Alec is entertained by shows of blood and Richard is basically amoral. The wit is tart, sharp and stinging.

How it got so many good ratings is beyond me. What an incredible waste of money and time. Just blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"So many people had recommended this to me, but I just couldn't finish this book.

I enjoy regency romances and old-fashioned swashbucklers, so this was right up my alley. I often get bored by conspiracies and intricate politics, but there was just enough complexity to keep me interested and not so many factions that I forgot who was on which side. A quick, entertaining read. Somehow the tone is light, despite the high body count, secrets, and intrigue - I think that's what reminded me of the Three Musketeers, as much as the swordplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"oups","review":"Well written (at least I practice my english), but a plot so thin that the author had to explain it because nothing, or perhaps I failed to understand it, could lead to the end, but fortunately the hero was able to keep his life and honour... However the title is well found, this book is really a melodrama, the characters are aggravating especially St Vier's lover, his manners and death wish made me hope for a quick death, unfortunately it was not the case. There was a reason it was not translated in french, and the gay characters are not this reason, it just because it is uninteresting.no suspence, no emotion and boring at best,avoid it to all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third time is the charm","review":"Well, I have written two reviews on this book and none were posted. So for this one I will just point out quickly that this is an awful book. Not a fantasy book at all, more like a Harliquin romance book with boring action and bland characters.Oh and all the men in the story bat for both teams, graphically to I might add. If that's not your type of book, don't get this one. I returned my copy for the first time ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing . . . Bad Love Life","review":"Lable me naive, but when I picked up this book I did not know that it featured a gay couple. Lable me politically incorrect as well, but I have to admit that this was uncomfortable for me as I was half way through the book before I relized the two main charactors (Richard and Alec) were a couple and I had already come to care about what happened to their charactors. Kushner has a great warm style, and I'd love to read any book of her's. About a HETEROSEXUAL person, thank you very much (you know guy+girl instead of, well, guy+guy). The plot was good and the story was interesting, but I just couldn't get past their sexual orientation:( Maybe this won't be a problem for some people, but I personaly couldn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Everyone lives at Swordspoint.\\"","review":"In Riverside a famous Swordsman named Richard St Vier lives and dies by the sword.

And remember: \\"Everyone lives at Swordspoint.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wickedly Fresh Drama","review":"Someone described Richard St. Vier's Alec as \\"the boyfriend from hell\\" and he is, but it certainly makes an entertaining read. From the intricate plots of the nobles on the hill to the thieves in Riverside, Swordspoint is a wonderful book and should be back in stores. Ellen Kushner's stories in the Borderland series have some of the same style, in humor and the breaking of stereotypes. And this time it's the heroes who have green or violet eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Clever, witty, wonderfully detailed. Five stars are not enough, and I'm a picky reader. Kushner is a truly elegant writer with a gift for characterization. I can't believe I'm only now discovering her! SWORDSPOINT is a succinct, self contained story, but it makes one long for sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, elegant, understated, riveting--an absolute joy","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, in any genre. The characters are unusual and unforgettable, the plot interesting and intricate, and the writing elegant and beautiful. Kushner makes her two main characters appealing and sympathetic, without compromising their fundamental ruthlessness and violence. She portrays deep, unconditional love without sentimentality or mawkishness. This is in many ways a dark, disturbing book, and it did raise unsettling questions in my mind about the nature of reality, the morality of violence, and people's ability to change, among other topics to ponder. Yet it is a joy to read; the sex and violence are not explicit; and I throoughly enjoy thinking about the book, rereading bits as I try to make sense of the novel's themes. This is a book I will read over and over, and never forget. Writers, this is how it should be done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A creative book of merlin's youth!","review":"This is a wonderful book for people of all ages.

I like the look of the canisters in the bathrooms, and they are convenient to access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic story of treatment of an Eskimo woman","review":"Someone gave me this book as a gift. I am a Native Alaskan, born and raised. The whole story was a tragedy - of young naive men taken advantage of by a con-artist, who is still touted as a 'great explorer' by the likes of Harvard University. Even more tragic is the idea of the time the events took place - that Eskimos were 'lower than whites', their lives were not important - especially an Eskimo woman. No wonder my family was ashamed for decades to admit to being 'Native'. Now that there are advantages to being 'Native', everyone wants to be one. Read this book - and if you don't see the tragedy in it - you don't have a heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ada BlackJack: A True Story of Survival in the Arctic","review":"If you like reading stories about arctic and south pole exploration, (ie: Shackleton) this a good one. Its nice to read about a worman's experience about her survival and the aftermath of her rescue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating tale","review":"This was one of my best books of the year for 2003. I bought it the first week it came out and finished it in 24 hours. It is wonderful. I see so much written in these reviews about Ada Blackjack and not as much about Jennifer Niven, so I just want to take the opportunity to commend Ms. Niven on her writing. Not only is Ada Blackjack a well researched and documented story of nonfiction, but it reads like a novel. I was able to get inside the characters in a way that I'm not always able to when reading nonfiction. It is obvious that Jennifer Niven cares about her characters, and because of that the reader does too. Her writing is compelling and rich and she captures the voice of each character vividly. In the end, I felt they had told me their story and not the other way around. I wish more books were able to do this successfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larger than life","review":"Ada Blackjack was a pint-sized woman with enormous courage. After reading her story, I place her with other women who inspire me: Anne Frank, Helen Keller, Zora Neale Hurston, Eleanor Roosevelt. It may seem ridiculous at first to compare this unschooled, unskilled Inuit woman with the brilliant women I have named, but to understand fully you need to read the book. Ada Blackjack is an every woman coming from unremarkable circumstances and being thrust into situations she did not want or expect. But she not only endured, she triumphed, and her faith, her grace, her courage, and her fire all serve to inspire me. Thank you to Jennifer Niven for bringing this lady to life and doing it so superbly."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh.","review":"After reading the Ice Master I was hooked and wanted more so I purchased Ada BlackJack: A True Story of Survival in the Arctic. I bought the book looking for an arctic adventure complete with a female lead, what I got was life histories on a group of people that lacked common sense, courage, and decency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt like this book.","review":"It did not hold my attention and it wont hold yours either.

I deducted 1 star due to some of the errors in translation to Kindle (where multiple words ran together with no spaces), and the book was long for the content. It definitely could have been told in a shorter version without losing any of its impact. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a worthwhile read","review":"If you like inspirational stories, this is a great one. Ada Blackjack is an amazing woman, every inch a hero, even though she is also a flawed, fallible person. That makes her even more likable and easy to identify with. I highly recommend this book to anyone craving a good story, a good adventure, or inspiration. I will think twice about complaining about the mundane daily details of my life now, after reading what Ada and her colleagues endured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ada Blackjack","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It took you to a different time with different mores and values, and you can see Ada as a victim of prejudice, in being a woman, and in being a native Alaskan from the young men she went to Wrangell Island with. The arrogance, spins, misinformation, responsibility avoidance, and power plays that were done after the expedition was over must be compared with politics today. History repeats itself, indeed. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Niven is an amazing writer!","review":"I first read \\"The Ice Master\\" by Jennifer Niven and got so thoroughly absorbed in her reconstruction of that adventure, that I couldn't wait to read \\"Ada Blackjack,\\" which is in some ways a continuation of the first tale. Niven does such a great job of telling compelling stories based entirely on documents and interviews. She drew me into the world of these people she was writing about and I felt like I knew them when the story was over. The funny thing is, when I first started reading \\"The Ice Master,\\" I was kind of afraid I wouldn't like it because I'm not big on the North or \\"adventure/survival\\"-type stories. But I was hooked after the first few pages. I can't wait to read with Niven writes next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost As Good as Ice Master","review":"I read & loved Ice Master, the adventure of the Karluk, because I love Arctic adventure.

I hope she will write many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Niven...ROCKS!","review":"Jennifer Niven did a SUPERB job with research on this book! The way she covered all the details of the parents of the explorers added greatly to this wonderful book!Jennifer Niven takes the reader into the thoughts and feelings of each character by showing the letters that were written through the years by all concerned.This is one book that I have read 4 times and enjoy it as much on the last as I did on the first! Jennifer Niven has my vote for superb, well-researched material....brought together in a manner to hold your interest from the first word to the last period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! Much improved sound on this remaster","review":"Just got the new Esoteric Edition of \\"Oblivion\\", and I'm really pleased at how much more alive it sounds than other CD versions. Much improved stereo separation, less compressed sounding, improved dynamics. I bought this album when it came out in 1984, and to be honest I always thought it sounded thin, even on vinyl.

I have to echo all the praise previous reviewers have written. I have tried to grasp ActionScript by diligently studying several tedious Flash books and never quite \\"got it\\" until I bought this one. This book is very well written and it intelligently guides you through Flash. I agree that it is written so that you can jump from topic to topic, but if you work though the chapters in a linear way, the book helps you build skills & knowledge of Flash from start to finish. Good for beginners or more experienced Flash users. The hands-on lessons after each chapter help you apply what you have learned and the inspiration design modules make it FUN! I LOVE this book and recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I reading the same book?","review":"That's what I had to ask myself after reading all the great reviews here and then reading the book. The book seems to be a series of short examples of all the features of the program without getting into the real nuts and bolts. If you want a printout of the help menu, then this book is for you. If you are looking for some help with actually pulling an application or site together, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trashed at the time but really surprising & underrated","review":"At the time of release this one was killed by bad critics. Over time, it is still a hit & miss record, but the hits are right on the mark. Indeed a weird, but interesting combination of a jazzrock outfit around Thijs van Leer plus PJ Proby.Although not always sounding sober his voice is impressing & in place in the Focus classic \\"Brother\\".The song \\"Maximum\\" is a true Focus gem, though completely unnoticed it seems. This is how jazzrock should sound like!Also Orion, Wingless, Eddy and Sneezing Bull add in their own jazzy flavor, making for a varied album full of surprises.And the story about Tokyo Rose? Well, also PJ Proby deserved a drink after all the \\"hard\\" work, didn't he?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time","review":"Our family has enjoyed the Swallows & Amazon series more than I initially expected. Each book has taken a few chapters to pull us in and we take it slowly; these are worth your time. The children in the stories are what my kids want to be like: independent and capable, fun loving and creative. The plots and themes are simple and interesting. I recommend the whole series for reading aloud and encourage readers to not drop them if they are not as fast paced as other stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swallows and Amazons on ice","review":"This was always one of my favourites of the Swallows and Amazons series when I was a boy, perhaps because I could identify myself with Dick, the character who first appears in this book. Also, it was a bright idea of Ransome's to change the usual summer setting of his books to winter for this one, and show the characters and scenes in a new light.What is so enjoyable about the whole series is the perfect balance between imagination and reality. Real people, real places, but also imaginary explorations ranging from gold mines to the North Pole. And it is so easy for the reader to picture him- or herself joining in.My sons enjoyed the books just as much as I did, and I don't see why another generation or two shouldn't do so as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"james last remembers the sixties","review":"I am a big fan of James Last and consider him my favorite but James Last Remembers The Sixties was a big disapointment as none of the songs matched the titles.The music is good but I would not of bought this album for what I got.I bought it to hear what was advertised. i"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER GOT IT","review":"I NEVER GOT IT.

There may be some bags out there where the orificeis too large, but it is nothing a little duct tape won't cure..That said, this is a very powerfull well appointed vac .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Vac but bags are no longer available locally","review":"We love the vacuum cleaner, but as the previous poster stated the bags are now hard to find. We used to be able to get them at Sears. However they are available through the shop-vac website. But you actually have to enter the bag number 919-64-00 in the search box that comes up after you enter the accessory link. This is not very intuitive.You can also just use a cartridge or foam filter, which works as well, but then you have to empty the vac and shake out the filter, which is messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on carpet?","review":"This is the strongest suction I have ever encountered in a vacuum! Gobbled up dust, dirt and spilled water on the garage floor. But when I tried to get water out of a carpet, the intense suction would not allow the vacuum to move. Not forward, not backward! The info never said it was for bare floors only. I had never had a shopvac before, perhaps this is common knowledge. If you need to clear any uncarpeted floors, this is for you !!! Unfortunatelyi, I had to return it because I need it for carpet too. Perhaps some sort of re-design would let it work on carpet. The brush on the one tool didn't hold it off the carpet high enough, and that suction just attached itself to the carpet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Very dissapointed. I was looking for one that that would be powerful, but I didn't need a huge tank. This isn't much different than a cheap vacuum. It doesn't pick up much.

Won't buy anything of much value from them again"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this little shop vac","review":"I never write reviews but this little guy earned it, this is by far the best 45.00 Ive ever spent. It is my favorite cleaning tool and I use it daily if not multiple times a day. I have a lot of tile and hardwood floor in my house and I rarely get out my broom, this little shop vac follows me around so nicely and does a fantastic job of keeping my floors clean and while Im at it I find myself vacuuming the window sills, room corners and ceilings. I store it in my laundry room and my laundry room is always clean because its so handy. I had the electrolux cordless stick vacuum and I would run out of battery before I even finished my kitchen, since this is plugged in I never have that problem and the cord is very long so I can easily get whereever I need to. Love Love Love this and wont find myself w/o one ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping rip off","review":"I have to agree withe the comments regarding the bags, and how much they cost to ship. Shipping is almost as much as the cost of the bags. Shop-Vac doesn't seem to realize how great this vacuum is. All the others they make tip over. This one actually stays upright, and it's powerful as well. If you use this vacuum a lot you'll be spending more than the price of the vacuum every two months on the cost of the bags and shipping! How expensive can it be to manufacture a bag, and why does it cost so much to ship?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shop Vac","review":"My original shop vac broke while I was out of town, and had people staying at the house so I looked on Amazon and found a fantastic deal for a similar shopvac with free shipping.

Excellent for cleaning crevices, baseboards, auto interiors, and places where you'd rather pick up dust and hair with the brush accessory than wipe up using a towel. Relatively quiet and light-weight. Not top-heavy due to design. My wife can handle easily. Accessory holder adequate. I have had a problem with motors either burning out or becoming extremely noisy on Shop-Vacs of a similar size. I'm crossing my fingers on this one because replacement motors are rediculously expensive. Would I buy it again? Absolutely."},{"rating":"2","title":"bags are not a problem","review":"easy to get bags at shop-vac # 916-64-00 $12.19. I own a small vac shop & bags are readily available at a wholesaler's warehouse so you can have a local vac shop order it. PLEASE use the RIGHT BAGS!! Duct taping a wrong bag makes me a bunch of money from blown motors :) Bags are made to exacting tolerances and, at best, you will blow dust all over the place & at worst-$$$. This has a stronger than normal motor & you take the chance of blowing up a bag made for a cheaper, domestic vac. 30 yrs vac repair experience says duct tape should be hidden from some people!

I needed something that was more like a tool, and less like junk. Bought several vacuums from the 4 major \\"Big Box\\" stores near me, and every vacuum I bought was returned as soon as I saw what sort of junk was in the box. This Shop Vac has decent power, can upgrade to a larger hose, has decent cord and tool storage, can be a blower, and above all else has better build quality than most other Shop Vac products. I am so not a fan of Shop Vac, but they got it right this time with this product. Bags are hard to find, it runs hot with blower vent closed, had issues with inlet baffle [ Shop Vac Customer Service was helpful and sent out the right part for no charge], and the filter can and should be upgraded for some jobs. All things considered, this was the only small portable Shop Vac I could find that was a respectable enough tool and not junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Bother!","review":"The only problem I have with these little Shop Vacuums is if you need a bag, good luck finding the right one that fits.

The Shop Vac I have is so worthless now, I went and bought a rigid to replace it, because I could get bags for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned out, only used for vacuuming car.","review":"Disclosure: I did not buy from Amazon. I bought from a local big box store in Oregon.With one or two exceptions, I only used this vacuum to clean our cars out.

The suction was ok, when it worked. Lots of attachments.Cons: Motor burned out. Unacceptable. Even worse, now this vacuum will sit forever in a landfill, horrible.I don't recommend.

Over the years a few of the songs have appeared elsewhere with liner notes giving the dates. I remember that my first impression of this album was that it was rather somber, with none of the songs really standing out. Of course, through the years of repeated listening I've come to respect and enjoy it more. I was extremely surprised when Karen's solo album came out in 1996 that she had recorded \\"Make Believe It's Your First Time\\" because I hadn't read anything about it. I wonder if this is the same vocal track taken from Karen's album (without credit at the time) or was it rerecorded specifically for a new Carpenters album (I need to listen more closely to both). Overall it's a very enjoyable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"voice of the heart","review":"That albumn really grabbed my heart from beging to end. The single \\"Two Lives\\" was magnifed by her untimely death. I always cry when I hear that song though I know it has a different meaning to it,I can't help but remember how she's touched all our lives. To try to decribe Karen's gift to this world would not do her justice.

Her's was truly a gift from GOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Posthumous Tribute","review":"Just after Karen's death, Richard went back to the studio to record another album, featuring tunes that didn't make previous albums. While a touching album, it really is just a compilation of \\"outtakes.\\" The first song \\"Now\\" is clearly the best, but there are other good parts to the album also. \\"Make Believe it's Your First Time\\" became a Top Ten Adult Contemporary hit in 1983, but the version on Karen's solo album seems to be better. \\"Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore\\" is another highlight, reminiscent of \\"Hurting Each Other\\", but it never broke the Hot 100. \\"Look to Your Dreams\\" is a fitting closing, but overall, this album is a combo of some of the group's less than stellar material."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"Ignore those negative reviews.

Listening to the early recordings and then to this one is a sure indication of the beauty that maturity and time were building into this incredible voice. Yes, this album was played over much after her death. But after all these years it still contains a wonderful depth and richness that living gives us all. Karen allowed that to show in her music. Get this one . . . you'll never regret it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So, so sad","review":"I agree with a reviewer below, that this is just a compilation of previously unreleased tracks. Richard Carpenter and A&M Records never should have hailed \\"Voice of the Heart\\" as the final Carpenters album, considering this fact. I also agree with so many others as this being regarded as the \\"funeral\\" album. I was a fan of The Carpenters and this posthumous release only served as a reminder of the great loss everyone was feeling at the time. However, there are many lovely recordings such as \\"Ordinary Fool,\\" \\"At the End of a Song\\" and \\"Now.\\" \\"You're Enough\\" is the only song I bag on, in which the intro always reminds me of a bunch of circus clowns and elephants for some reason. I love \\"Sailing On the Tide\\" which is the only upbeat song on the whole album. I could have done without the \\"fogie\\" chorus singers on some of the album's best tracks. This is The Carpenters and if you were a fan, you should add this to your collection.

The second section includes readings in Mexican history, which are also graded in length and difficulty. Unfortunately this section lacks the crucigramas, but it does have comprehension questions. The third is a VERY abridged and simplified version of \\"Lazarillo de Tormes,\\" with comprehension questions. My disappointment with this section is that it is SO abridged that it eliminates the humorous language and the first-person perspective.

As others have pointed out there is a strange lack of instructions that leaves you feeling initially clueless (there is a \\"Help\\" feature accessible through the software) but the overall usage is intuitive enough that it wasn't really missed. Also, some of the webpages that I've seen indicate that you need 4 AA batteries but this is not true. (Maybe the earlier model needed it?)

We both still use them - even though she has advanced to an MP3 player. She still likes this because she can carry it around with her in the house and use it when her MP3 player is recharging. It may not be high tech, but it works just fine. Thank you very much. I have always trusted Panasonic and still do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but some practical negatives to consider....","review":"I read some of the reviews for this product and I agree that it is a very good value for the price. It also has great sound, equalization and the ability to play MP3s. However, it does have some drawbacks to consider:-- Very small buttons that are close together.-- A battery compartment inside the player where the disc goes. This increase the probability of scratching or altering the position of the lens.-- No radio, which isn't a problem for many people, but may be for some.Overall, I think this product is very good and it is light weight. There are some claims that the batteries last significantly longer than other older models, but I haven't noticed this.This set sounds particularly good with SR60 headphones. I have tested many combinations and this is a real winner. These headphones aren't necessarily pretty, but the sound/price ration is terrific. They are not good headphones for athletic activities, just for very PURE enjoyment:SR60"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Portable CD Player on The Market","review":"You can't go wrong with this portable CD player.

Not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"EARTHQUAKE!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you are a fan of GCS and have the first three albums I suggest you get your hands on this. The first 5 tracks on the album are excellent and easily good enough to merit the purchase. Happy 2 CU a gin' is similar to We've been waiting, Do U Want to Dance is funk nasty, Love city keeps the flow moving leading to arguably the highlights of the album Love and Happiness(Al green cover) in full GCS trademark style, and the monster track; Earthquake. Earthquake has one of the most memorable riffs I've ever heard (be it on guitar or bass)and was so far ahead of its time you can clearly hear how this track must have influenced artists like the Chilli Peppers. Whilst the last tracks do not have the same impact as the opening 5 they are listenable and do not put you off owning the album (although the back of the CD might as it has some of the cheesiest photos possible!) GO AND GET IT AT ANY COST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally UNDERrated album!","review":"I love this record - avoided it for years because of the DISCO cover art! But it actually has some of GCS' best funk, filtered bass, jams and songs. The song Earthquake is jaw-dropping. Literally as heavy as Black Sabbath in places. It's amazing they could go this far on one album. Get it - it sounds great....I forgot \\"Have Faith in Me\\" - it's like gospel, soul, gothic and classical and rock and Russian music - whatever! Amazing tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van the Man","review":"With Van Morrison you never knew what you'd get. He became pretty hit or miss as he progressed later in his career. And...I saw him once in concert and his complete lack of interest in what he was doing really disappointed me. But, I gather that he is a guy who likes things on his own terms; take him or leave him. He writes and records what he wants and not what others expect of him. Some times that approach works out well and other times not. The early 70's was kind to him and some of his best work comes from this period; most notably \\"Moondance\\". The title track could be considered his most recognizable song but 'Caravan', 'Crazy Love' and 'Into the Mystic' all rate as highly. A very consistent excellent record and one that never wears out it's welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the wrong record label??!!","review":"I ordered the Rhino Records reissue (vinyl) as mentioned on the listing but instead Amazon sent me an old Warner Bros LP. What gives??"},{"rating":"2","title":"moondance","review":"This is a truly great cd. I had the album years ago and it is great to listen to it again. Every song is awesome, and the lyrics and instrumentals are great as are the vocals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer in a CD","review":"The romance and wistfulness that accompanies this Van Morrison album are sure to bring you memories of summer days. Songs such as \\"Caravan\\" and \\"Brand New Day\\" have quicker beats. \\"Into the Mystic\\" is retrospective of a warm breeze and you just have to smile at some of Morrison's lyrics that could easily bring back childhood memories (such as in \\"And It Stoned Me\\"). And of course, there is the fabulous love song \\"Crazy Love\\". \\"Moondance\\" is perfect for those who feel like dancing.As you can see, I have nothing but praise for every song on this album.Listen to it. Trust me, you will feel the summer sun on your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect cruising music!","review":"Before I heard \\"Moondance\\", I had vaguely heard of Van Morrison, but didn't know any of his songs beside \\"Brown-eyed girl\\". During a long, grueling road trip, I decided to buy this tape on a whim at a truck stop because it was cheap, and looked interesting. As soon as the music started, I knew I was hearing something special. This album is just pure magic. The songs are a perfect mix of rock, jazz, and even gospel elements, somehow blended into a soulful whole. The whole vibe of the album is just experiencing a perfect warm summer's day. I just cruised with it the whole eight-hour trip, and the miles flew by. And \\"Moondance\\" hasn't left my tapedeck since. Really, if you love music, you'll love this album. I'm so grateful to have been introduced to Van Morrison's artistry, and this album will always rank on my top ten list of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down to earth","review":"Van Morrison's Moondance. A mecca of 12-bar blues, rootsy Memphis soul, 50's Sinatra swing,and Nashville country-rock. This album rates on almost anyone's list of Top 30 rock & roll albums since Elvis Presley sang about another moon in Kentucky, and Chuck Berry revved up his '54 Epiphone. Morrison, and his imitation of the rough-edged blues of Son House, Leadbelly, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Ray Charles, is sprinkled throughout. It's as if the man isn't making any qualms about his music, but directly pushing his lungs and feelings through a microphone. This is probably the greatest white blues album ever created. [All apologies to Paul Butterfield]. You couldn't go wrong purchasing two, because in all likelihood, you'll wear the first one out after a year of repeated listening. Yes, it's really that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I would describe as timeless!","review":"I would consider myself to have a very eclectic taste in music, leaning more towards newer stuff. My collection consists of everytthing from Limp Biskit to Fiona Apple. After buying Moondance I am amazed at its honesty and sound. Most times by listening to a cd you can guess what era it is from. Moondance I cannot, the musicality of the cd is amazing as are the lyrics. Moondance was one of Van Morrison's earlier recordings and you already get the idea that this man is a virtuoso. It is simply amazing and moving. His voice drips with emotion no bottled feelings here like you hear on todays stuff. I highly recommend this you won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Restores the tambourine mix on \\"Into The Mystic\\"!","review":"This remaster sounds much livlier than the stock Warner Bros CD (which I always disliked. I feel it is more than \\"marginally\\" better (as the another reviewer mentioned. On headphones, it sounds better than the overlapping material on the \\"Still On Top\\" 3 cd set (better high end). And the tambourine that was on my old vinyl pressing on the track \\"Into The Mystic\\" has been restored! The tambourine somehow disappeared from later pressings and the original CD, so that track always sounded sparse to me. I'll get the other two based on how pleased I am with this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is his best album, even with everything else he made","review":"I would make this an essential purchase for all music fans! especially \\"caravan,\\" which is one of the best songs he's ever made and one of the only songs that never seems to get old when I listen to it a lot! People may talk a lot about Astral Weeks as being better, but it is not as consistent as this album. For some reason people also say that Tupelo Honey is better, but I found almost everything on that album to be monumentally cheesy, and far below The Man's high standards. If you are just getting into Van Morrison, make this your first purchase, you will like all of the songs on this disc! Then get Best Of vol 1 for the rest of his essential songs, and maybe Astral Weeks, though I suggest you listen to that one first before you buy it. Then the magic of Van Morrison will be yours to savor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Side 1 of an album I have ever heard","review":"Awesome album and side 1 is the best side 1 of an album I have ever heard. 5 classic songs. I sometimes forget their is a side 2 to this album. The melodies, Singing, and piano arrangements on this album our great. The songs grab you emotionally and won't let you go. This is a classic and a must listen to album. Thanks Van."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag! Cough!","review":"The little guy has no voice! Who told him he could sing????

This is something you'll never get tired of listening to, once I take it out of my CD player, I want it back in there! The Bluesy, Jazzy, bopping music and lyrics make you want to dance, sing, sit back and relax and get mellow with your eyes closed all at once as Van the Man spins his tales in your head. It's just great, something I can't imagine NOT having in my collection. So put it in your CD player, put on the headphones, turn it up and sing along with Van, you'll enjoy yourself for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I am excited just thinking about this album. This is one of the top 100 albums of all time, period! Okay some people might disagree with me on that, but what most agree with is that Moondance itself is a work of art. Blends of Jazz, Folk and Easy listening with enough tinges of Americana to rival anything by Springsteen or Mellencamp. Oh, did I forget to mention there are some blues to this as well? Again, a work of art and I think Moondance and Into the mystic are a couple of my favorites, but it is hard to choose when again, the entire album is simply amazing. Despite being released over three decades ago, it still chimes with a radiance that words cannot describe.The Moondance album is somewhat prolific to me when looking at all of Van Morrison's studio releases, perhaps because I do not think he put out an album after this one that could even come close to matching it. A one of a kind find that I will always treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Masterpiece","review":"Van Morrison / Moondance: This is a masterpiece. It is an album of Irish soul, great depth of feeling, controlled joy, and exuberant passion. For the rest of the Twentieth Century, for as long as there was a real living breathing Disk Jockey playing music that mattered on the radio, we could always count on one of these songs being played during the day. This album deserves a Sixth Star."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Van CD","review":"Even though there is a \\"best of\\" CD for Van, this one is my favorite. Crazy Love...

Once I played it I understood why it has ranked among the classic albums for so many years.

I do wish they held more cards, as you have to strategically place them as the hand gets fuller, but they serve their purpose and the kids haven't complained...only gotten more excited about playing their card games.

However, this book is lacking in everything one needs to determine the meanings of the cards or the images particular to this deck. I can't figure out why on earth this book is so expensive. If it's not lined in gold, there's just no reason to spend this kind of money on this overly simplistic paperback. I gave mine away to a thrift store because it was useless to me. Unless the seller of this book can give a good reason for charging $650, don't spend that kind of money for this book.

The ambitious 3-CD set delivered ELP to a new audience, while carving a path in electronica that has a unique style.Not meant to replace the original music that made ELP one of the leaders in the progressive rock movement, it actually enhances the iconic standing of the band....in the new millennium."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS","review":"This CD shows how low an artist can go to squeeze a few dollars from the remains of a past career.

I figured, \\"Both from the same company. This should be no problem.\\" This adapter is terrible. Dropped connection, poor signal, freezes the USB port. I read several forums and followed the suggestions. I called Linksys tech support. That call turned out to be the longest 2 hours of my life. I downloaded the most recent drivers for the adapter and for my USB. Nothing seemed to help. The last straw was when the adapter lost my control panel. Don't ask me how, but it did.

The N router is horrible. Before, I was able to access WiFi with the Ipod Touch and now I can not access the Net at all, even with my computer(s). I have either dropped signals or no signal. Ironically, my old USB G adapter is able to pickup my neighbors internet signal no problems, but I can not pickup my own signal from the WRT160N router in my own house! When I first called, the helpdesk gentleman put me on hold for 15 minutes while I could hear laughing in the background and then he hung on me with no call back. The next person (woman) was nice, but stated that I now needed N adapters and that my poor /lost signal was unavoidable. I purchased two N adapters and I am still waiting for an overdue shipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me!","review":"This may have been a problem with my PC or Compatability with Vista, but the device never stayed connected to internet.

I finally called Linksys support who told me that they have not released the drivers for this adapter for Windows Vista 64 bit machines. When I asked him when and if they would plan on releasing these drivers, he told me that they possibly would release them in late 2008. He was not helpful either. The thing that really stinks is that Linksys advertises that this adapter works with Windows Vista. But it apparently doesn't. I think I'm gonna try D-Link or Netgear in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I have five computers in the house. I recently got a Linksys N router to increase range and bandwidth. In general, I love the range and bandwidth benefits, however, with this particular adapter, I have to re-boot the computer daily.

I also purchased a new Linksys wireless N router. After several hours on the phone with Linksys I got it working, but discovered that it was actually slower than the wireless G router I currently have. Tech support couldn't figure out any way to get it performing better so I returned it and I'm sticking with the G for now.Regarding customer service, I have had numerous Linksys products and I'm not sure why I keep putting myself through the headache. I'm 99% sure that their tech support is based out of India which isn't unique but makes it difficult to communicate. As a general rule, I have found their tech support to be the worst I've ever dealt with."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I am competely happy with this purchase.

Great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"This works with the software provided, or you can let Windows control it. I have set it up both ways and ended up with Windows in charge of the connection as it allows my other USB wireless to work the same way with fewer applications added to my system. All in all I would suggest this as an excellent USB type Network adapter. I only stopped using the original software to simplify things, however, it does come with a nice program & works well by using that if you want to just start-up your first wirelss & don't plan on using any other type.USB cable is extra long, the mount far exceeds all of the other types I've used that just stick into the USB port and you bend the stiff wiring to position the adapter. You'll have a mount that can actually be mounted to a shelf, a flat magnet for mounting on top of the RV or car when parked trying to get a better signal from a nearby router, or a variety of mounting situations.ENJOY!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Linksys WUSB300NN Wireless Network Adapter","review":"I had a lot of problems getting my wireless network to work.

I find myself unplugging the device and replugging it in to have it re-detect the wireless signal quite often....even just regular web browsing. This happens on xp,vista and win 7 and connecting to a linksys router. I do keep my pc on 24/7 so that may have something to do with it.Id think maybe I just got a bad device but to be honest.. every linksys product Ive owned seems to have problems,, be it a laptop card or whatever..

I was assigned to teach a Bible College course on the 5 Fold Ministry and there is simply not a good textbook anywhere. Then I read this book and each of the Five Fold Ministries have a chapter of their own.Its a type of book that while you are reading it you just simply know and sense that it is right and should be applied. It actually will leave you excited about doing church and then you wake up to the reality that may lead you to frustration because your churrch is not anything like this and how difficult, if not impossible, it would be to make these changes. Even though yu know this is a much more Biblical way.This book at the same time does cover areas that can be utilized immediately in your church without any great stress. He covers in detail the offices and responsibilities of the Elder and the Deacons. Elders to rule; Deacons to serve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, thoughtful, and interesting","review":"This little book is really a long essay on what is involved in understanding a religion. It has an almost conversational tone, as he talks about the various topics that arise in teaching students. Well, they are the same topics that arise for their professors or, for that matter, for any of us: religious experience, religious institutions and authorities, religion and culture, and so forth. These topics are discussed with a point of view that balances a sympathy for religion (and perhaps even a religious commitment) with scholarly distance. The reader learns the lay of the land in contemporary religious studies from a thoughtful, engaging tour guide.

Dry the container and then rub with white vinegar to renew shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My reason for purchase was to see if this would get red of mild stains caused by pot roasts, cassoulets and other preparations involving red wine. I have always washed the dutch ovens by hand, with hot water and mild soap -- never in the dishwasher. The enamel, especially at the bottom, had became a tad browner every time I put it in the oven. I wondered if I could have the pale-cream surface back, and bought this.Sadly, I have had no success at all with this solution. I don't think that using this cleaner from the get-go would have been brilliant, because it made absolutely no difference to the stains.

Still, it was better than what I was able to accomplish without it, and it left the pan looking cleaner as well. I think it is worth purchasing although I haven't tried the other alternatives other reviewers on this site and others have mentioned (like kosher salt, boiling water in an empty pan, barkeep helper, etc.).

Not enough light to read, much less provide lighting for a room of any size. Not even enough light to provide mood lighting.And I find the on/off switch (A floor switch) to be extremely inconvenient.

It came so highly recommended that, perhaps, I looked forward to it too much. The characters are so central to the stories that if you don't find them real, there is little else of interest. I felt detatched from most of them and so, was just reading about people I didn't care about. There is also some sort of cold feminism running through them- smart women are misfits and men are minamally drawn. I hope my next Munroe book strikes a better chord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This book is so well written and the stories are superb.

Being a huge fan of the Nowhere release, it was disappointing that KROQ in Southern California completely abandoned all further Ride projects. So I found myself, 18 years later, listening to Ride albums I had not been exposed to on Pandora. Sight of You is the song that convinced me that I had to have this CD, just giving me reason to spend 2 weeks overplaying the CD and reveling in the layers of guitar. Yes, Crown of Creation and Since Then pale in comparison to the energy and lavish guitar work in Like a Daydream or Perfect Time (it's odd to even type that since Ride jammed so much music into a 2 year span), however I found the good on this compilation of sessions completely irresistible. It is an interesting walk through Ride's progression of sound through 2 years work. Bonus is the bandmember's comments in the jacket, reflections of time and a peek behind the curtain."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans","review":"This cd is pretty much a must-have if you're a Ride fan (and have the other albums).

There's news. He talks about that for a chapter that's 30 pages long!There are some interesting historical bits to the book, but they are relayed in the most uninteresting way.

The box arrived extremely fast and was packed very nicely. A smaller box was inside the larger box with air packages on each side to keep the package from shifting. It kept the crisps fresh and from being smashed! My only problem now is I have 18 large bags of chips to eat. Make that 17. I highly recommend them!

I was sorely disappointed. While the title says it is a practical guide, I felt it was practical only for diagnosis but not treatment. For a new intern who needed to know what drug to give when, how to treat this fell way short of the mark.It wasn't particularily helpful in the clinics or on rounds or in the ER. It was too vague for that.I ended up never using it. Instead in my third year I sold it brand new. I think it's probably a great book for someone who doesn't have basic mental health experience, such as a medical student, or a medicine resident etc. It's a complete waste of time for the psychiatry resident!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Have Been a 5-Star, But . . .","review":"The piece itself was beautiful, nicely weighted, and durable, except for the glass water-catcher, which had shattered during delivery.

The strings have a very clean sound, and the winds are a joy for the listener. Fournillier choiced the right tempi, and controls well his musicians.

I bought several so make sure you have a bag or cubby for your puppets otherwise you'll find them all over the floor (the child sized duffel bag I had was too small for five, only two or three fit).

I'm surprised he let his name get put on the cover. The details concerning the characters and some of the events destroy the whole fabric of the story. For example, most of the enlisted personnel in the story are cited as being \\"Privates\\". In real life, guys with those kinds of knowledge and skills would be senior NCO's. This applies to both the North and South Korean forces and the the US military. Also the team leader would not be a 25-year old Lt. Col. Maybe a 35-year old, but not 25. The author also shows his general lack of knowledge of things military by indiscriminately labeling all military forces the Army. The Army does not operate C-9A Nightengale or C-141 aircraft.

Rodgers decides to stand resolute, then as soon as someone's threatened, he folds, then goes back to the brave american during torture.

About 15 pages into the book, I start to get a bit suspicious about the book, and look up the reviews online. It is then I come to learn that Clancy did not write this book, and that the Op-center series generally had poor reviews. I decided to give the book a chance, and to finish reading it. This task became impossible for me. At about half-way through the book, I decided that I had had enough. I couldn't deal with the dozens of one-dimensional characters and I couldn't deal with the ridiculous plot that kept dragging and on with no end.I plan to start reading Clancy books soon, but will not give this Op-center series another try. This book was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Entry to the Clancy canon","review":"This book is very disappointing, as it never seemed the least bit believable nor compelling. The threat didn't seem threatening, the operations not convincing, and in a first for a Clancy-verse novel, was internally inconsistent. For example, on page 413 of the paperback \\"..the woman put three bullets into the back of the wheelchair. The dead body fell forward.\\" Yet on page 426 referring to the same wheelchair (after a knife thrust to it's back,) \\"..she murmured 'How did he miss?' 'I never go anywhere without my Kevlar-lining,' he said. 'Multilayered bullet-proofing in the back and seat...\\" How does a body get pitched out of a chair when the bullets can't directly transfer their momentum to the body in question?

While reading it ,I could pick out the parts that Clancy MIGHT have hadd a hand in writing. Those are mainly the parts dealing with technology. The book reads like a poor James Bond script. Are we to believe that a video game is going to cause world turmoil? You could say that I've read this book (or any in the Op-center series) twice. The first time and the last time."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as enjoyable as a bad TV Movie-of-the Week.","review":"As a die-hard fan of Clancy since before Red October was popular, I couldn't get over my disappointment at what was clearly a sell-out by Clancy. The plot was weak, the characters one-dimensional, and the '90's politically correct overtones were too much to take. Where is John Clark when you need him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy's A-team tackles terrorism in Korea, without a clue.","review":"Total Disneyland. For all Clancy's vaunted skill with technical derringdo, this doggo title can't even get right even such relatively simple details as Korean surnames or common greetings in that language. The breathless computer chicanery is very funny, although apparently not by design. The characters are far more cardboard than usual; the plot has twists and turns, almost none believeable; and the book has a high mawkishness quotient. Perhaps Clancy has an infinite number of monkeys under contract to produce this series of clinkers, but it's about as real-world as Robert Ludlum (and only slightly better written than those eminent pieces of hackwork)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale imitation of Clancy's earlier work","review":"If you were looking for anything like _Hunt for Red October_or _Patriot Games_, you'll be sorely disappointed. Thoughthis has Clancy's name on the cover, it's clear that it'sjust a cheap sell-out of his name. Inside, it's justa poorly thought-out, sub-average spy story, with noneof the strong characters of his \\"real\\" work. Give it amiss, and avoid all of the derivative \\"Op Center\\" books.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Future","review":"This was the first Op-Center book and it looks like the Op-Center seris will be very good. It has great suspense, lots of action, and so forth. Some of the characters are very likeable. For instance Hood's son in the book has asthma just like I do. Whenever the book would get slightly boring they would go back to the asthma part which got me right back in it"},{"rating":"1","title":"From bad to worse...","review":"The Jack Ryan novels are usually good (if sometimes a bit one-dimensional...), but the \\"OP center\\" books are simply bad.

Stick to that formular Tom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Games of State","review":"The first quarter or so was interesting and plausilbe, and I had high hopes for the rest of the book. But alas, action-based military/intelligence thrillers have become little more than \\"A-Team\\" television re-runs, and sadly Games of State fits this scenario to a tee. Summing up: Games of State was predictable, grossly unrealistic, predictable, comic-bookish, predic..., strangely sappy, pred..., lacking in creativity or originality. Oh, did I say it was predictable and unrealistic?Yes, I finished it. Then I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Clancy Novel","review":"Not every author can grab your attention from the first sentence and some take several pages to do it. Although I was only partially interested in the book from the beginning (this being my first of this genre), I gave it a chance and soon found the book to be quite intriguing. Clancy's style seems to be to create several plots and switch between them throughout the novel. I gave the book four stars because it had a great plot and okay description but some of the occurences were not plausible. For example, the Striker team included Privates and sergeants but it would be more likely that this type of team would contain professionals. Moreover, 25 is too young for a Lieutenant Colonel in my opinion. However, the book wasn't too taxing upon a reader's belief. All in all, I think this is a good book and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm... Probably the worst Clancy book yet.","review":"Clancy's new Op-Centre novel \\"Acts of War\\" is notanywhere near his preceeding works.The misinformed rhetorical questions and prejudicial dialogs hecreated are outright awful. The book lacks the most basic knowledge of geography, language, culture and economics of the region that the plot takes place. Believe me, I know... because I live there. It was like reading a fantasy novel. Maybe his co-author was responsible for the research? In any case, a big disappointment for Clancy fans. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy does it again (what else is new?)!!","review":"Hmm, not as good as Op Center or Mirror Image but none the less, an excellent read.

Totally remarkable"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was tolerable.","review":"First off, the only reason I picked up Op-Center was because it was created by Tom Clancy and \\"the other guy\\", and as a (at least I think I am) deicated Clancy fan, I feel a sense of duty to read anything written or created by him. And no it wasn't actually written by Tom, instead it was written by some guy named Jeff Rovin. That explains a LOT of the, er, unusual things in the text. Errors that Tom would NEVER have let by in one of his \\"real\\" books like at one point an F-117A Nighthawk takes off from an AIRCRAFT CARRIER (it really was in the text) and then uses all sorts of exotic weapons which I'm pretty sure an F-117 was never designed to carry. Well, now that that's off my chest, Op-Center is tolerable (barely) as far as techno/spy thrillers go, but it wasn't 1/000 as good as the \\"real\\", \\"pure\\" Clancy novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Key events unreal!","review":"The smartest anti espionage minds in America fall for the old banana in the tailpipe trick?

But this thing shows a rare lack of knowledge, which I find annoying.I am german, a citizen of Hanover, where Clancy set much of his plot - and the connection between real events and the story plot would make SOME research neccessary, I guess. But all the research found in this novel is reading a roadmap of Germany, and even that is done badly.

I reccomend this book, and give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prolific Doesn't Equal Good","review":"So my mind started wandering midway through Sum of All Fears and it hasn't come back to Tom Clancy since. I started Op-Center mainly because it was a short book and I figured I could ease my way back into Clancy's little world. My mistake. The book is nearly unreadable and appears to be an attempt to just get another book out there. I was genuinely stunned at the quality of the first four books (Red Storm, Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present), but enough already. We all know you wish you were Jack Ryan, but you're not. Every time I see a Tom Clancy book I see puffy Tom with his shaded prescription glasses, the wannabe flight jacket and his dead serious accountant's face. I guess it doesn't help that when I met him at a book signing he could barely be bothered to lift his eyes to the customers. He's laughing all the way to the bank, and it's my fault - I bought the books. No more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepubescent pap","review":"Tom Clancy is a supremely gifted writer, but he clearly sold out to an unconscionable marketing scheme in allowing his name to be used to sell this Op Center drivel.

Among those Acts of war is really the worst. Either Clancy is getting old or he didn't write this. The book describes how a bunch of pros fall for little tricks, how incredible hi-tech almost blows it, and a few Rambos save the world. Appaling torture scenes and a rocket flying through a cave supply the icing on this stale cake. Did I mention the DIY-psychology at the end of the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"God, is this horrible!","review":"Hey, I'm as much of a Clancy fan as anyone else (if not more so), having read all of the Ryan books at least twice. But this OpCenter series, which Clancy is only putting his name on for the bucks, is complete garbage. Believe me, this is NOT Clancy, nor anything remotely close. The writing is the pits, the plotting less plausible even than Clancy's usual stuff and the characters two dimensional. As a matter of fact, this book (and the series) are so awful that I can't imagine any reason for anyone ever even attempting to read 'em [sigh]. Save your money for the next real Clancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! GET IT AND LET IT GET YOU","review":"I read this book not knowing what to expect. I have never read Clancy. I heard he was good so I got the book based on the subject matter. I was blown away by the story. It was tight, kept you on the edge of your seat, and would not let you go. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good modern spy story. You writing style will make you turn the next page to find out what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Op-Center","review":"Op-Center proved itself in almost every way possible, showing the great literary skill Tom Clancy possesses. In this action packed novel Clancy manages to show multiple story lines and keep the reader interested in them all. There were a few holes in the plot but nothing that could hurt a Clancy book. A bombing in North/South Korea has Op-Center proving it's self to the president as they attempt to prevent World War III. Terrorism may be played out in the Clancy collection but I enjoyed the storyline and found the book entertaining to the end. I found the ending to be surprising and sufficient to the story itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Op-Center series goes from bad to worse.","review":"I have been a long time Tom Clancy fan but these Op-Center one week novels are not only goofy, they are bad.

I can't recommend this item, even if you were to buy a larger size than you think you need, because I don't know if that would prevent the rolling problem.

With the ever-increasing standards of playing by instrumentalists, Busch gives as fine a performance as Brain, who was outstanding in his day.

I have through the years gained alot of weight, experienced injuries and simply can not just jump into the program. So for me, this is a great way to slowly begin to exercise again.

I've been shoving my hand into the paper slot. It hurts your hand and the paper can rip if you're not careful. Of the 7 or more printers I've had, I've never had one that was so awful for clearing jams. Even if you clear the jam, you may still get errors and be unable to print.3) The margins aren't great.

The price is great (you can find it for $6 at most stores). We've been using this for the past 4 months, since my daughter was born, and I love it! We put it in our kitchen sink and in our tub, and it works great either way. You don't have to use a ton of water with it, so I didn't have to worry about her slipping in the bath, and the sponge seems comfy for her to rest on. Of course, you always need to stay with your baby during a bath, but this made bathing a less nerve-wracking experience for a new mom like me. It wrings out super well, and we just use one of the holes to hang it up to dry. The temperature gauge dot is also nice, since I like my water REALLY hot and need reminders that babies do not. :)Awesome product that doesn't take up the space or the pocket change that an infant tub does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great and fast service","review":"i was thrilled when I saw that you carry this product.

I've been listening to Green Day for about 3 or four 4 years and I have to say that this is Green Day's second best album (under American Idiot). All the songs are fast-paced, angry, and just plain good. This ain't for the posers. This is for the people that actually like Green Day for the music, not the image. I just hope their next album (due late 2006/early 2007) is a combination of Insomniac and American Idiot (minus the politics). Oh yes, to the reviewer 3 or so below: Green Day will not be inducted into the rock 'n' roll hall of fame this year. They aren't elligible until 2014 (25 years after their first release). And don't get your hopes high for that year either. It might take a couple o' years. This album is AWESOME! BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have CD","review":"This is green day's best album. Unlike most other cd's, there is not a song on the album worth skipping. All 14 songs are a shot of adreniline. The best songs are Armatage Shanks, Geek Stink Breathe, No Pride, Panic Song, Stuart and the Ave., Brian Stew/Jaded, and the best song on the cd is Walking Contradiction. And the rest of the songs would be the best on any other green day album, just not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day's best","review":"This album may not have had much commercial sucess, but it is by far in my opinion their best CD.

Hah! I've heard garage band recordings that sounded better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretend this one wasn't made","review":"I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either). The sound is very forced. Green Day admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts. It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the \\"I'm still punk\\" notion which fortunately Green Day gave up years later.I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew's refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible.Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple.In general, unless you are a major Green Day fan, there really isn't much you're missing in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"This is a great album. Brain Stew is the best song but they all rock. Don't listen to the one stars, you don't normally start loving an album after playing it only once. BUY IT. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insomiac shows Green Day's darker side","review":"Don't get me wrong by the title, this is one of my favorite Green Day albums. If you're a true Green Day fan, you'll notice that this album contains heavier, punkier, and somewhat emo music. It stands out from the rest of Green Day's albums. The reason this album is so heavy is because Billie Joe's first son had recently beeen born. His son cried throughout the night, so Bilie Joe would often write songs since he couldn't sleep. The song \\"Brain Stew\\" is supposed to describe how he felt."},{"rating":"2","title":"insomniac won't put you to sleep!!!","review":"Insomniac is a very good cd.

If you don't have this cd, then you should buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green day's coolest album so far","review":"Hey I was a Green Day fan since they broke into the mainstream. I've loved them for a while and insomniac is still definatly my favorite green day cd. This cd is very good fast punk rock. My favorite songs from it are 86 and westbound sign. The rest of the tracks rock too. So if you like green day and don't have this then get it. My second favorite green day cd is probably their very first one 39/smooth because that's also pure punk so if you don't have that get it and listen to some other punk bands like mxpx cause they sound a lot like green day and they're friends with the guys. Also make sure you get the new album from green day called warning that comes out this fall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What Dookie Was Missing","review":"Following Dookie returned in 1995 with the harder hitting Insomniac. In many ways this album has what Dookie was missing on a lot of it's songs, better playing and better lyrics from Billie Joe Armstrong. Also almost all of the songs could have been hit singles, well except Panic Song, as the A.D.D. generation would lose track around the midway part of the incredible instrumental opening. A great record that is worth buying but is just short of the perfect mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dour chords","review":"While some of the energy may be intact, songwriting abilities were becoming all-too-predictably limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"IM IRISH AND I SAY THIS ALBUM IS DA BOMB.GET IT!","review":"WATZ UP PEOPLE?IF YOU ARE A TRUE DEDICATED GREEN DAY FAN, BUY INSOMNIAC.

'STUCK WITH ME'(YOU GOTTA HEAR THIS TUNE FOR YOURSELF), WESTBOUND SIGN AND STUART AND THE AVE.I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT A LETTER LIKE THIS WOULD COME FROM THE IRISH BUT WE ARE STILL MAD ABOUT GREEN DAY EVEN THOUGH WE HAV'NT HEARD MUCH FROM THEM.THIS ALBUM IS NOT A FAILURE.IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT.THE GUITARS ARE HEAVY,THE DRUMS (ESPECIALLY FILL INS) ROCK AND THE LYRICS ARE SOPHISTICATED IN THE SONG 'JADED' AND FIENDISH IN THE SONG BRAT.IF YOU HAVE ANY BRAIN AT ALL.....THEN BUY THIS ALBUM. IT ROX"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day's best!!!","review":"This CD is without a doubt Green Day's best album to date! It's loud, hard, melodic and fast - the tempo picks up and never lets down. Songs like \\"Jaded,\\" \\"Brain Stew,\\" \\"Walking Contradiction,\\" and \\"86\\" highlight this excellent album, and all the songs are awesome. Billie Joe's songwriting seems to have improved from Dookie.The only problem is that it's TOO DARN SHORT! Only about 35 minutes in length. Other than that, it's a great album - buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Rock at its best!","review":"I have been a loyal fan of green day for some years now, and I must say this is their BEST album. This is one which never leaves my CD player, I never get tired of listening to it. The combination of Tre Cool's powerful drums, with Mike Dirnt's great bass playing and Billie Joe's distorted power chords make this record a MUST HAVE. In fact it is the record I am listening to while I'm writing this review. All of Green Day albums are great, yet all of the songs in Insomniac are my favorite Green Day songs. If you have been listening to Warning(a dissapointing record in my opinion, taking in account the fact that Green Day is a punk band), or other Green Day albums, buy Insomniac because you haven't lived until you heard it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very satisfying chunk of punk-rock","review":"This is, like all of Green Day's albums, an excellent CD. The formula on this album works great - fast, hard and to the point. The album moves quite smoothly from one song to the next, staying loud and in-your-face for all 14 tracks. \\"Armatage Shanks\\" is a great start to the album, followed by the snotty \\"Brat.\\" Other highlights from the album include \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" and \\"Stuck With Me,\\" two great songs. \\"86,\\" \\"Stuart and the Ave.,\\" and \\"Walking Contradiction\\" are also very good, but the best track on this album is the breakneck speed metal song \\"Brain Stew,\\" one of Green Day's best. The guitar work, the lyrics, everything is perfect. All the other songs are good too, making this one hell of an album, even though it didn't sell as much as its precedor, Dookie. If you are a Green Day fan, you have to have this CD, and for those of you who like Godsmack, Creed, and stuff like that, I think you'll enjoy this CD too."},{"rating":"2","title":"tdowell","review":"The only contradiction with this album is the fact that it hasn't been their top seller. They come out guns blazing and finish with the best song on the album: \\"Walking Contradiction.\\" At a time when supposed hard core bands think it's time to reflect, Green Day knocks off your socks with this one. This is their best yet. Check out Warning and Nimrod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Effort","review":"If you're a fan, you'll enjoy this disk. They are going back to their roots with this recording. You'll hear influences from the late 70's/early 80's punk scene but not as much as on Nimrod. Great Christmas choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although different than Dookie, this CD still rules","review":"When I first bought this CD I didn't really like it much. It's very different than Dookie. When I started to listen to it more though, I started to love the CD. Now I think there's not one bad track on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day does it again","review":"After their last CD it was hard to imagine them making something else that would equal it. But Green Day did it again with Insomniac. I still like listening to this CD even though it is the year 2000. This CD is one of Green Days' heavier CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, THEY REALLY ARE PUNK!!!","review":"Ah yes, this is the album that contains the classic single (and anarchist anthem) \\"Geek Stink Breath\\". I believe it was The Clash who originally penned that one. Or maybe it was the Dead Kennedys. No wait wasn't it the title of a book by that Nietzsche guy. Wow! \\"Geek Stink Breath\\" THEY REALLY PUNK ME OUT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This CD is horrible.

Green Day are too weak, rinky-dink,pro-life, clean cut, and inoffensive to even remotely be Punk Rock. Real Punk Rockers are U.K. bands like The Exploited, Chaotic Dischord, The Insane and The Anti-Nowhere League all of which could smash Green Day into oblivion!!! Punk Rock is supposed to be nihilistic, dark, destructive, nasty, offensive and, most of all, radio UNfriendly!!! If Green Day really want to keep recording nursery-rhyme elevator music like this, that's all good and well, but they have no right to call themselves Punk. They make a Capitalist mockery of the very word!! A waste of plastic, a waste of money and a waste of a perfectly good star! Somebody send these sniveling sissies home to mama!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD...","review":"This is my second Green Day album (American Idiot being the first) and i really do enjoy it.

He put the kids in charge of the upcoming concert. The concert was going to be a holiday concert. They had an election to see who would be in charge of the concert. The students could pick anybody in the room. Hart Evans was chosen. It was a rough start. There was a big variety of performance ideas to choose from. They had to vote again for what they were going to do for the concert. They finally picked. They did some pretty interesting performances!My thoughts on the book: It is interesting and funny.

Hart Evans is a very popular sixth grade student at Palmer Intermediate. One afternoon he found himself landed in the principal's office after deciding to launch rubber bands at Mr. Meinert, the chorus director. After some convincing, the principal decided on a light punishment for Hart. This angered Mr. Meinert and therefore led to his decision to turn the Holiday concert planning over to his students. After all, Mr. Meinert had nothing to lose; his position would be terminated after the holiday break due to budget cuts.Hart was chosen as the student leader and would spend the next several weeks attempting to direct the holiday concert.

It doesn't sting like some alpha hydroxy products. One thing is I cannot use this product in the winter or my skin will be scaly and dry.

I don't really understand some of the negative remarks about the vocals, though.One breath of fresh air; No insane speed drumming like with so many 'progressive metal' groups!I don't feel inspired to write reviews often, but this group definitely deserves to be 'found' by others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical ecstasy","review":"Brilliant guitar sound and technics, perfect bass and drum basic, jazz and fusion related jamming and solos. Totally, the album reminds me of best moments of Kansas but with lots os new elements. (Some perfect elements) Offered to prog rock fans who like thought-provoking instrumental sessions and the sound of Kansas.Why only 4 stars? Singer is not too shiny when singing in a deep voice but other way is pretty good. The other reason is jamming sessions could be a bit longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically good, doesn't flow","review":"I'm sorry, I have to be one of the few to downplay this album. Technically, the musicianship is good but the songwriting sucks. The lyrical subject matter is indeciferable at times and just not very interesting. Ted Leonard (vocals) sounds better than he has in a long time but, as one reviewer states, there's just too many notes on this album. For Dream Theater that may work but not here. Needs more style and substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts?","review":"With Ted Leonard of Enchant on a seemingly long hiatus from his band (so it appears) here he comes with a new album after teaming up with some fellow musicians. This is a great progressive album and each song delivers. While some downplay the lyrics and the album having too many notes it is all just a matter of personal taste. When I found out that Leonard was the vocalist with this group I jumped on it and found the album refreshing. While somewhat of a departure from Enchant it does still retain the Enchant sound because of Leonard's voice. But it does have a heavier sound to it which might appeal to more legions of Dream Theater fans. So, if you love Enchant then you should yourself a favor and check this out while Enchant tries to figure out what they're going to do next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I purchased a Singer Inspiration 4206 in June 2009. This Singer product has been nothing but a disappointment. I am an experienced seamstress and was very disappointed with the performance from this machine. Very light weight, this is my first plastic sewing machine, it literally hops around as you sew. I have had to replace the bobbin case 3 times and it still does not sew correctly. All previous machines I've owned were metal. I am going looking for a metal machine.

It's great to hear so many old favorites again--especially \\"Reach Out\\" (A very pleasant surprise. This song was never included in the shows I saw during the 80's, and this is probably my overall favorite track on this CD), \\"More Than a Man,\\" \\"Makes Me Wanna Sing\\" and \\"The Way.\\" It may be about 14 or 15 years later than I originally hoped for, but a live release from Stryper is still very welcome.

I brush and I floss everyday, but it seemed like every three month I am back to my dentist's office for another filling or crown! I have tried every kind of toothbrushes -- manual and electric -- to no avail, until I tried this Sonicare. It took a few days not so much to get used to the sonic vibrations in my mouth, but rather to learn to angle the toothbrush so only the bristles touch my teeth and gum. And what a difference this toothbrush makes! I could feel how much cleaner my teeth after the first time I used it. It literally felt like I just had a dental cleaning at the dentist's office. Moreover, my last visit to my dentist was the first time in years that a regular checkup did not end up in another filling or worse. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely wonderful","review":"i would never go back to the normal toothbrush. sonicare is amazing. cleans my teeth better. the only issue i have with it is that it shuts down after 2 mins. there should be a button to turn this \\"feature\\" off. using the brush was a bit annoying for the first few days but once i got used to it, i was hooked on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Teeth!","review":"This is the first time I've used an electric toothbrush and I was somewhat reluctant, but after trying the Sonicare I am amazed at how clean my teeth feel!

You will also have cleaner-feeling teeth (yes, you can tell the difference!) and you will brush your teeth longer... The massaging action is actually quite pleasant...My only problem is having to switch the heads because my wife and I share the same unit...It's probably better to get two units, because the power unit can get kind of gross with splattered toothpaste... As an added bonus, you need to use far less toothpaste than normal, because the Sonicare brush doesn't need gobs of it to work it's magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durability not good","review":"I have had the brush for less than a year. It has developed cracks around the on'off button and is no longer usable.It does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth but the brush should last longer than one year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is the most amazing toothbrush I've ever used. It cleans the teeth perfectly. There is one slight drawback though. It sometimes has a tendency to bore a hole through the back of your head. This, plus the obligatory heachache you'll get using it, which is, of course, unfortunate because your now beautiful smile will be replaced by a frown. Apart from that it's great all around.Oh yes, there is one other negative:It's cost could probably buy you a very small third world country with an entire population of \\"teeth brushers\\" to serve you for the rest of your life. But...it's your choice. Anyway, enjoy it, especially if you have a neckbrace or public heath facility near by!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon was irresponsible and I never received my sonicare","review":"I waited two weeks to receive my Sonicare ordered through Amazon and I never received it. I'm sure it's a wonderful product but now I will never know (actually I'll order it through drugstore.com so I will know soon enough). Amazon was incredibly unhelpful and I had to chase a package around until finally it got cancelled.

I'm not sure if I can name the other brands but I've used the popular names. I like this one for a few reasons. (1) It was recommended by my dentist who said it was safe for dental work. (2) It works very well. Cleans you teeth as well as an office visit. (3) You can use any tooth paste. One of my previous electric toothbrushes I had to use their paste. I did not and damaged the gears in the hand unit. (4) It cleans your teeth very well (had to say it again). I am amazed at how well this product works. Remember when you are considering purchasing this product that Sonicare recommends changing the brush heads every 6 months so there is an addition cost involved. I suggest the PL-4 since you get 3 brush heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives you super-clean teeth, but is difficult to clean","review":"I was surprised how well the Sonicare cleans my teeth. I don't think I can ever go back to a regular toothbrush!Things I like:- 30 sec timed cycles give me the discipline to stay brushing for the recommended two minutes- holds a charge long enough to take on vacation without the charging base- travel case is a good design- gets my teeth very cleanThings I don't like... the inside of the brush head, the threaded top of the handle and the base get dirty within a few weeks and are not easy to clean.Overall, a very good product and one I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of toothpaste matters!","review":"I have had a sonicare toothbrush for two years. I like how it cleans and enjoy using it. I am presently on my third handle. Cracks keep appearing in the handles or part where the brush is screwed on.

It's quite nice - the pages are all the same size as the paperback, but the cover is hard. Similar to the standard Dr. Seuss books. (No jacket, but those get messed up, torn and lost on children's books anyway.) It might not be worth the extra cost for most home libraries, but if it is your child's favorite book, then it's definitely worth it.On a side note, yes the farmer has a gun.

I officiate high school and college ball, and I wear this mask with no fear. I have taken several foul balls right in the grill and the mask has performed masterfully. I have owned probably 5 masks in 15 years and this has been my favorite, hands down. All of the former models were top of the line products as well. The Wilson Dyna-Lite, The Wilson Zero Gravity, The +Pos composite, all masks in the $100.00 range. No better than this trusty little Diamond mask at almost half the price. Buy the mask, save the money, and you will be yet another satisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great wearing mask","review":"Let me see if I can keep this fairly short and concise. This mask is almost enjoyable to wear. First off it is quite light compared to many other comparable masks. In fact several of the people at our fields have commented on how light this mask is compared to the steel mask that our league has for umpires to wear. While being light, it also have good visibility and fits quite nicely. The pads are comfortable on my face and having work it in some rather hot weather have been good at not sucking up moisture.Lastly, I cannot speak to the safety aspect much. I have not taken any hard hits to the face, only a couple of glancing blows. With respect to those hits; however, it has done well in protecting me.Overall this has been a really comfortable and easy to wear mask and I would definitely recommend it. I rated it only a 4 since until I have taken a good hard hit and had it protect me, I would not give it a 5. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No tiene voz para la salsa.","review":"Sherly Bruce no tiene voz para interpretar el ritmo tropical de la salsa.

Therefore, when I purchased this iron while low on funds, I felt that it would probably be just a temporary one until I could afford another Rowenta. However, I found it to be an exceptional iron, giving me the steam and power that I needed.

There is a huge design flaw, however. Someone didn't realize that small animals like to go the bathroom in corners and along the edges of their cage, so when they go, urine runs through to the floor because the drip pan doesn't extend to the edges. I have to keep puppy housetraining pads under the cage so the carpet doesn't get soiled. I would not spend almost $100 on this cage again.

It didn't.If you are \\"medically inclined\\", I can see it being more engaging, as you will actually understand more of it. Half the time, I was skipping ahead to get past the \\"medical language\\".The characters were likeable and the writing was good. But the plot just bored me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy it if it's really really cheap","review":"I got this for a few dollars. It comes with a short book that is only somewhat helpful for beginners, and not at all for anyone else. It comes with chakra cards by Amy Zerner that look almost identical to the tarot deck these two have done and redone. Then there are cheap candles. (and if you run out you can buy more of these cheap tealights for 10 bucks!) Then the CD-it is wretched. Something akin to porn music is in the back ground, and Monte Farber sounds like a voice over from a B science fiction movie from the 50's.

Both are still in love with the other but keep it a secret to themselves. Hero tries to be nice to the heroine. Heroine is just plain mean to the hero.

I wish that Balogh had explained earlier in the book why they hated each other, this wouldn't have helped the book make more sense than it did. I thought the first sex scene was ridiculous and left me feeling a little uncomfortable.

One moment she seems to be slipping into self pity and the next she is 'proudly' declaring her independence. These sporatic reversals make her character hard to believe or sympathize with. Ultimately, her character is rather weak and unappealing.

I admit I have a problem with Mary Balogh's longer fiction. I find she crams an awful lot of plot twists & turns into her \\"Super\\" regencies, and in some of her longer novels...in place of character development, there's alot of dialog & plot weakness. There was just too much going on here, the romantic element & sexual tension (which Balogh can write so well in her shorter fiction) got overwhelmed. There was nothing particularly memorable about this hero or heroine; frankly, they seemed pretty blah. The reason they initially got separated seemed weak, and the reason they finally got together seemed weaker. So what if the hero cried when the heroine miscarried? I didn't feel anything for him, I just didn't care. This was kind of a \\"by the numbers\\" Balogh, with all her signature bits, but no heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great book","review":"This is one of the best crime books I have read in awhile.

It is extremely slow, seeming more like a day in the life of Fletch on vacation. No real mystery or adventure here, nothing Fletch couldn't pack up and leave behind, unlike most of the other Fletch books. Not too much of the classic Fletch dialogue, but there is plenty of portugese without translation and names that are tough to pronounce. Clearly, Gregory MacDonald did his homework for this book, but it I could use a little less description and a little more story. I will, of course, still read the two Fletch books that I have yet to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"This is my first Fletch book, and it might be my last. I'm only half way through it, but I'm not even sure I'll finish it. Essentially, the problem boils down to there not being any Fletch in the book. Though he's physically present, he doesn't seem to do, say, or think anything. Most of the book consists of McDonald going on and on and on about Brazil and the Brazilians. Fletch just sits in the middle of it and observses their zany, wackiness (as if anyone cares). Theoretically, there's a murder mystery here, but no one, especially not Fletch, does anything to investigate. Looking at the other reviews here, it appears it's not just me who thinks this. So, I'd say don't bother reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it, but I guess I'm the only one","review":"It is definitly more about Brazil than the story line, but Brazil is the story here. If I'm not mistaken, McDonald was a journalist at some point, and he's gotten at a travel story from a different angle here.

There's a lot of Brazilian \\"flavor\\" that ultimately felt like filler. There's also a lengthy subplot involving some party boys known as The Tap Dancers that I will generously call a red herring, as (minor spoiler) it has nothing to do with the over-all story, even though so much time is devoted to it that it feels like it should. (end minor spoiler).If you want to be completionist about the Fletch series, keep your expectations in check and get it from the library. Otherwise, you can safely skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"It's almost as if someone else wrote the book. It doesn't have the feel of any of the other Fletch books and I was thoroughly disappointed. Obviously, the author wrote it after a trip to Rio, probably during Carnivale, and he was affected by it so much that he wrote the lead character so much differently from the other Fletch books. He doesn't speak the way he normally speaks, and frankly I almost bailed halfway through the book. Oh, and thanks for all of the Portugese which I don't speak. It just doesn't fit in the series. As a story, it certainly works and attempted to keep my interest, but as a Fletch book, sorry, I didn't care for it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly Me Down to Rio","review":"Every prize winning author is entitled to a stinker.

There is no real mystery or suspense here. Mcdonald delves into too much Brazilian mythology to create a plot. the mystery if you could call it one is who killed Janio Bareta 47 years ago? who cares. there is no real investigation into the murder, and fletch solves in about 2 seconds. the book could have been much shorter. i didn't find the characters very intersting. and i can't imagine that Brazilians are really this superstitious. most of the story is really about Brazil, and Carnival. the mystery if you could call it one, is really secondary to the setting. who cares. i can read losts of books about Brazil during Carnival without reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Solution for Gauge Relocation","review":"I had searched through various vendors and distributors for aftermarket solutions for placing my gauge in line of sight.I previously had a custom fabricated gauge panel in the sunglass holder area (tray removed) but the gauges were essentially useless under boost.Its actually a safety issue looking anywhere other than forward when driving, and this product allows useful live monitoring of gauges.Through my searches I found this seller to have the best price, online, period.Product ordered and received ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Piece","review":"If you're looking for a barometer with a BIG dial, look no further.

The result of their communication, including answers to some of the deepest human mysteries of experience and explorations into the nature of the Will, the Self, and God, are all recorded in this compelling testimonial. Most of Abraham: The Initiator On Spirit, Will And Ego is presented in a question-and-answer format, with Abraham's wisdom in sharp relief.

The Latin one is of course in latin arrangements since it was at the time the big Bossa Nova craze. The best ones of the Sounds of the great bands that Glen did is 1 through 6 and a lot of them are also on the old time life series The swing Era with Billy May doing the rest on the series which is good.

In 1961, when I was learning the radio business at a college station, KTCU in Fort Worth, this album arrived as part of a package we received every month from Capitol records. I attended a band concert in the South Tyrol area of Northern Italy this summer and one of the selections played by the Brunico City Band was \\"The Poet and Peasant Overture\\" by Franz von Suppe'. I was immediately reminded of this album with arrangements of classical themes by Billy May. The Poet and Peasant is stunning. Just when you think it's over, there's another bit of whimsy on the end. I searched Amazon and found a used CD in the UK and ordered it. I have yet to listen to all the other tracks on the \\"Shall We Swing\\" half of the disc and almost certainly won't listen to the Big Band classics in Latin, but I have played the Poet and Peasant until my car CD player refuses to repeat it one more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, HORRIBLE","review":"Who in their right mind would add a latin beat to great swing music?

This movie is beautifully filmed, the cast is first rate. Real life enters her world, as she meets again her first love. WWI and its aftermath also play a part. It is a movie about life's decisions and did we make the right choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful adaptation of the novel","review":"Vanessa Redgrave gives a fine performance as Clarissa Dalloway in Marleen Gorris' adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel. It tells the story of one day inthe life of Clarissa Dalloway as she readies her house for a dinner party later in the evening. Throughout the day, she remembers people and events from her past that had a lasting effect on her. But, during her party, the news of a suicide causes Mrs. Dalloway to step aside and to wonder if she's given up anything with her own life's path.Ms. Redgrave's performance is subtle and really shines during the party sequence. Her facial expressions alone show what a fine actress she is. Other great performances in the film are Rupert Graves as Septimus, a soldier suffering from a late onset of shell shock, and Alan Cox, as the young Peter who was desparately in love with the young Clarissa.Not many extras on the DVD. But the film is self is definitely one to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the negative reviews!!","review":"I was all set to love this movie, but as it turned out I couldn't wait for it to be over. I love to watch movies where they go back and look at their past, but this one was so disjointed. It kept going from past to present so often that you really couldn't enjoy watching either one. What I thought would be a love story from her past and them reunited and still in love in the present turned out to be completely different. I don't think she really loved either one of the men in her life all that much, what she was looking for was security, which made her an unsympathic to me. Also, I could have done without the crazy solider popping in and out of the movie. It just made it even more confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Some reviewers enjoyed this film a great deal. I didn't. I hated the movie The Hours and I feel just about the same about this one. Vanessa Redgrave is an excellent actress and did a wonderful job as usual, but I thought the storyline was boring and slow. Expecting a lot more, I ended up disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation","review":"Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway can seem difficult to the modern reader with its stream of consciousness-styled narrative and minute attention to detail. This film adaptation will prove very useful to the student attempting to make sense of the meandering scenes flashing between past and present, sanity and insanity. Wonderfully cast with Vanessa Redgrave as Clarissa Dalloway, Rupert Graves as Septimus Warren-Smith, and Michael Kitchen as Peter Walsh, the vagaries of the multi-layered story become colorful and clear. True to Woolf's inimitable text, this adaptation is not only lucid but enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment & Unsatisfactory on many levels","review":"I like so many British period piece movies but not even Vanessa Redgrave could make this likeable. Her character is boring and vapid,interested in only her own continued comfort in life...such a shallow person is no heroine.I'm not sure how the viewer is supposed to know if she loves anyone but herself at all. There is no happy ending really for any of the characters. I found the soldier who commits suicide to be sad & depressing. The same gender kiss and the nudity unnecessary. The whole movie falls flat is an existential waste of time. There are many other movies worth the material they are on, this is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mrs. Dalloway","review":"I normally love Vanessa Redgrave as an actress but this movie came up short.

Do not waste your money buying this movie or your time trying to figure out the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and Disappointing","review":"I usually love anything to do with England. About the only redeeming quality I found in the movie was the scenery in London and the countryside. Otherwise, the story was disjointed and disappointing with no real depth. Mrs. Dalloway spends a day remembering her youth, while being quite the air-head later in life. She speaks of no love, feels no regrets, appears shallow in character, and cares more about her parties than anything. Her loves and friends of the past haven't matured much either. The story was bland and slow, and I usually don't give two stars to anything. Except this one failed to move me, including the off-shoot of the poor man with shell-shock craziness after World War I - another disjointed part of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"This is the 3rd or fourth book I've read by Pressfield. Last of the Amazons is yet another novel that manages to pull the reader in with its combination of the historically accurate, the historically possible, and the mythological. If you enjoy novels wherein the lines of the three become blurred to the point that one can hardly be discerned from the other all while taking the reader on a great ride you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good battle scenes, missing character connection & development","review":"Pressfield does an excellent job of describing battle scenes and a decent job of creating the culture of the Amazons and the Greeks.However, what breaks the story is that it is told from several points of view - none of which have voice changes. The \\"voice\\" of each \\"narrator\\" is basically the same. The voice of a middle aged Greek warrior and the voice of his niece (either as an old woman or as a young girl) would be different, just as the voice of Selene would be. If the author hadn't noted who was telling what part of the story, you would never have guessed that it was a different person. I don't think this leads to strong character development and I couldn't quite get myself to care, on any level, about the characters. The over all impression was a flat one - a finely tuned world with characters that can't quite connect with the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clan of the Cave Bear 50,000 years later","review":"A warrior race who is peace loving? Give me a break!Are they really living \\"free\\"? They seem to have so many rules governing their lives - and virtually certain death if they contravene them - except if you are in charge. All in all, it leads to a not very believable social structure.The language the author employs leaves me wondering why he is using a 50 cent word (perhaps read the Illiad too much, too often) when a more modest word or phrase would have done.The book was a gift. I suppose I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. However, I cannot recommend this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous read...","review":"Shut out the kids, the husband, the cat, and read this marvelous, engrossing book from start to finish.

I happened to pick this one up by accident as I was waiting to pick up my friend. And from that moment, I could not put it down. You become attached to the characters ... and invested in the Amazon way of life, cheering for their successes, and feeling loss in their defeats. This is one of those books that you do not want to end - but maybe that's also because with the end of the novel comes the end of the Amazons. I am in withdraw now, desperately searching for another work to fill the void."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"bought this book after i read Gates of Fire, another Steven Press book.

He has done his research on Greek history. Some people in his book are comic book-like and are not believable as real people. Others are better. The thing I dislike is his author's voice. Like with Gates of Fire, you can hear the author's view over the narrative of the story. You can tell the author's opinion on Greek society. In a great novel, you you just are shown a picture. In lesser novel, you get what the author thinks of the picture.With Pressfield, you get very loudly his disdain for Sparta and his love for that other city.For me, always knowing the author's world view takes me out of the picture.Wyatt Kaldenberg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"a different world, believably, excitingly captured.

To say I was disappointed is an understatement! This novel covers the love triangle of Amazon Warrioresses, the Greeks that tempted them (and eventually brought about their downfall), and their Amazon lovers.The narrative is painfully slow and dry with pieces of over-the-top dialogue that could only have been written by a man. An example, \\"You reek of mare-stink from between your thighs...\\" Puh-leez!What could have been a great book exploring the Amazon culture turned into a boring treatise on horsemanship in ancient times. If you like historical novels, treat yourself to the Roma Sub Rosa series by Steven Saylor or even Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series.

The main character is totally unbelievable, and worse, unlikable. He's basically got world view of a 20-something bar fly. His language is so foul so often, that it becomes boring. But worse to me, was the slang is so contempary, that any feeling of being in West Hollywood or Castro instead of Shakespeare's England. Great Marlow is a fat, unwashed pervert, and Will is vague and undefined. Of course, some gay men really think like this that this stuff is very gay chic and cutting edge, and might find the book amusing, so I'll give 2 stars.

This book would make a great classroom read aloud for grades 2-5. I think that even the most reluctant of readers would be caught up in Hank's adventures and might even see some familiar traits.

I'm not sure how you could put it up with one person as some reviews state, it took two adults and two kids \\"helping\\" to go up easily even after a practice session. We had no inclement weather to test the water resistance. My only negative comment is about the zipper size: The pulls are small as are the zipper teeth, smaller than my old tent. And it does take two hands to operate the door zipper to keep the fabric from getting caught in the zipper. Not good when you have a bunch of stuff in your hands to go inside.It for sure can only hold 4 people with gear. The room divider does get in the way for family camping. The hanging gear loft also gets in the way of standing. It cuts the headroom down to about 5'.

The poles are steel w/ bungee connections, which made them much heavier than the aluminum poles on my previous Eureka tent.

Fantasy fiction, while speculative, is also its own genre and has its own archetypes and standards that stand alone, without the crutch of science fiction. The problem with LeFanu's book is that she leans on some archetypes while dismissing others. Any attempt of this sort leads to a narrowing of the genre. Being revolutionary and liberated from all past stereotypes is no more valid a stance than writing something fresh within old and standard archetypes. I was unimpressed with her one-sided viewpoint and sweeping judgements. The moment you say, \\"You shouldn't do it this way or that way,\\" someone will come along and knock you off your high horse, and I daresay that authors come along every year to prove Sarah LeFanu wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as others with more features for less money","review":"This is an OK stroller, but it's not all that great. There are others that are better for less money. There is no basket underneath to put your diaper bag or purse. The sun canopy is very small and not at all effective. There is no snack tray for either child or parent. For less money, get the Safety First Avila lightweight stroller. It has a roomy basket, useful sun shade, and 2 snack trays...and it is just as lightweight as the Caddy, all for $10 less!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacation Lifesaver","review":"This stroller is the best for trips! We have taken it all over the US, and to Greece as well. It is compact, and the carry-case is great for the plane. It is easy to maneuver on all kinds of streets, including old cobblestones. The 5 point harness is great for a wriggly 22 month old, and the rain-wind cover keeps them warm and snuggly during all kinds of weather. The sunshade is adjustable, and I sewed ribbon to the sides of a baby blanket to tie to the stroller to make a side canopy for really sunny times when the shade wasn't enough. The older my daughter gets, the less confined she wants to be, but we still brought the stroller out with us every day, because we could put our purchases in it. I did buy cup holders to attach to the frame, so we could have drinks handy, but found we really didn't need all the other gadgets that are on a lot of other higher priced travel strollers. I love this stroller and plan to give it as a shower gift to all new moms-to-be I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best stroller ever!!","review":"I love this stroller!! My husband was about to kill me for spending so much on a stroller. When he had to use his mom's $10 umbrella stroller he finally admitted ours was worth the money. We're both about 5 &#145; 10&#148; so the height is great! My daughter is 19 months and very tall and she fits in it great. She actually likes this stroller where as we would have to fight her to put her in the regular stroller. I love that it sort of reclines so she can lie back a little and nap. The only problem we had was getting used to not having cup holders and a storage compartment like we did with the Eddie Bauer travel system we had. I bought a mesh bag separately and a couple cup holders from Toys R &#145;Us and it's not a problem now. I did remove the sunshade though it just seemed to always be in the way. I have recommended this stroller to a lot of people; they all think it&#146;s great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stroller","review":"At first we bought the cheap umberalla stroller and the handles were too short. Then we bought a little more expensive model, same brand the \\"jeep\\" model. The look was nice, but our son, who was one year just fit into it, and would have probably grown out of it in a month or two, so we took it back and got this one, it is a little more money, but we think it's worth it. It allows for more room to grow. It is very light weight and folds nicely, and it is the only stroller we use now. The only thing, we wish it had one more adjustment for sitting more upright, but otherwise the best available. Four and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent lightweight stroller","review":"This stroller is great if you want to go from a bigger stroller to something lightweight.

I will not be using this anymore. There are two locking bars on this stroller, but it is so flimsy that it pops up on it's own. My baby is a year old, and weighs approximately 24 lbs. so I can't say it is because she is too heavy for this. Maybe it is a defect in my stroller, but I just thought people should know before a bad accident happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stroller!","review":"I would recommend this stroller to anyone.

Shakespeares best story turned into a costume romance with music. It doesn't hurt that both stars are easy to look at, and that the scenery is beautiful. That they cut out some very beautiful parts (as well as some boring ones, ie dance music for 20 minutes) is a shame. That they get it done in just over an hour, keeping the bones of the story and the opera intact makes it a useful tool to expose people to opera as a concept.

Even if my parents were divorced (they're not) I'd be interested in the person who gave birth to me, not his current wife. Hopefully I'll be able to track down an earlier copy of the book. The concept of this book is wonderful, but the execution of this version isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor!","review":"I agree with most of what the other reviewer has to say, but I have one major difference of opinion. The casting of this production is awful. There are some good voices, Gens in particular, but no one seems quite right. The Zerlina and Masetto are both swallowed up and leave a lot to be desired in terms of acting. The Ottavio is awful, and the commendatore took his time finding the beat. The only performers worth seeing are the Donna Elvira and Don Giovanni, both are fine, but not special and the people I haven't mentioned are utterly forgetable.I don't have a problem with Modern productions, in fact, at times I perfer them, but this doesn't work and isn't worth the disc it's burned onto. If you want a modern Don, get the Salzburg with Hampson and D'arcangelo, or the new release with Keenlyside. There are some awesome traditional Don dvd's like the Met's with Terfel.

As a result, songs like even the normally bouncy \\"Let's Fall in Love\\" slow down to a state of quiet reverie. \\"Love Tide\\" has a slightly jazzier feel to it, with more of Riddle's trademark gentle swing infusing the music. (The use of a small rhythem section behind the strings helps here.) Riddle dabbles around in instrumental exotica (\\"Bali Ha'i\\" and \\"Santana,\\" among others) as well as jazz staples like \\"Caravan\\" and \\"Solitude.\\" Both albums are among the most sheerly gorgeous of all Riddle's orchestral arrangements, and deserve to be played over and over again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Great birthday gift for my wife, but now I have to get my own...Another great product from Nintendo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nintendo DS review","review":"the Nintendo DS I purchased came in a timely manner and in great condition and just before christmas which was very helpful too, it was just what my daughter was looking for,and she just loves it :)Thankyou"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent delivery","review":"I ordered this gift for my daughter on 25th DEC and was suppose to arrive on 29th , however, it was delievered on 28th early morning.

With all these Xbox360 and Playstation over-rated games, it's nice to sit back and relax with a Nintendo. The thing I'm not feeling too much is the touch screen with the stylus. You have to hit it just right at the right angle to get certain games won. The touch screen idea is great, but maybe it needs something heavier than a stylus. I hear you can use the strap that comes seperate as a stylus , but I haven't tried that.

It's too late to take it back to Wally world, and I'm stuck with sending it back to Nintendo for repairs. I've opted to do my own with Crazy Glue, which for the time being (I hope ) holds it together until I can repurchase the old model again.

My die-hard Sony PSP son, assisted my husband with the initial workings of this product and gave his dad the pros and cons. Once the Brain Age cartridge was in....it was easy for my DH to navigate the games. He has a Brain Age of 48 now, and is still working on it. I highly recommend this system for those baby boomer and silent generation folks. I am going to get the pink system for myself and I am thinking of purchasing another for my 80 yr old mother.

A few days exercising my \\"cortex\\" (anyone who has ever played the game knows what I'm talkin about) and it was like my writing block disappeared! I knocked out 40 pages in less than 3 days and completed my first 3 chapters on time!I have to give credit to the game player...I look forward to playing with it every day, if even for just a few minutes. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DS has the games","review":"This may be an inferior system to PSP in terms of hardware specs, but the DS does distinguish itself with the dual screens and touch screen.I bought this system purely for the games, like New Super Mario Bros, Contra 4 and Zelda.

Everywhere you go it's on backorder, and you cannot get on a waiting list for on-line orders. I called the company and they said they can't make them fast enough to stock in the stores. When they do ship to the stores, you have to be at the check-out counter waiting for arrival! Each store only gets a couple of them! It's out of control! My son only wanted this for Christmas so it made for a very disappointing day as we could not locate one. The only ones I could locate were on Amazon months later.

Finally they have color, and now with this double screen, more things can be done to interact with the games. The graphics are decent, but I still really like the title selection, and the kid friendlyness. This does not have a bunch of the blood and guts games, much to the dismay of some adult gamers, but I feel comfortable giving this to a 6-9 year old and feel they may actually see something valuable in it other than violence. That is the other reason nintendo has been kept alive, is because of the family. Worth the a look, the price is a lot less than PSP, and features are basic, but still a fun gaming system."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Hooked","review":"I purchased a DS for my nephew, by brother and my mother.

I was a doubter. When I first saw the Nintendo DS I thought that it was going to be a flop. It was just so different. But then as tons of great games started to come out for it, as new ways of interacting with a video game were created, I came to a huge realization. Those guys over at Nintendo know what they're doing. The Nintendo DS is a complete success on every level. While it can't compete with the PSP graphically, it wins in every other category. In the end it's the gameplay that brings the gamers, and the DS has that in spades. The newly redesigned DS Lite simply improves on an already great product. It's now smaller, lighter, brighter, and feels better in your hand. If Nintendo is just for kids, then I don't want to grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Pretty","review":"This product is easier weight wise on my carpel tunnel. I love the pink color.

Nintendo did something above and beyond the button mashing tired-and-true we've been used to and it's not just revolutionary, it's an evolutionary step to Nintendo's new approach to \\"hands on\\" gaming.My Mom, who used to scream at me for playing nintendo games at 8 years old for too long, is now playing with her DS. Particularly the Brain Age games and the Ace Attorney series. She can't go anywhere without it.

I'm not sure how long these should last, but I admit I played the heck out of it (and I'm wasn't exactly gentle with it - but I have a feeling these should be made for kids rough handling).

I already have a Wii so I was a bit familiar with what I was going for with another Nintendo product. Intially, I was torn between the PSP and the DS. But the game \\"Professor Layton and the Curious Village\\" plus my limited budget cleared this up for me. I bought the game along with the DS. And I have been happy with my decision. The DS's touch screen is quite responsive and does not suffer from the usual touch screen glitches. The wi-fi setup and operation is actually much simpler than I thought it would be. I travel a lot and this has become a nice traveling companion while I wait for flights in transit. The battery life is also reasonable and goes for upto 8-9 hours after a single charge.

I own a PSP, and Nintendo, where did you come up with the idea that the graphics are better then the PSP? I think there stuck in the 20th century! Its just a remake of the Game Boy Advance. I liked the GBA, but the DS is the same old stupid thing. Come on, 3D graphics, A, the games are mostly 2D, the 3D games are horrible, like Madden 2007, and Mario is over 20 years old. Make a new game!!! Same with the Wii, the graphics aren't even comparable to the 360 and PS3 and its gimmicy. I say, jump on the Sony and Microsoft bandwagon. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nintendo DS","review":"This is the first product I've recieved from amazon that I wasn't completely satisfied with.

I will not recommend 3rd party 3D games. Only good games are by Nintendo.3rd party game look terrible the characters look like big blocks. The Sony PSP is light years ahead of this DS. Nintendo has a history of selling outdated hardware and making a profit on the consoles. Sony has a history of selling cutting edge hardware and making a loss on a console with the hope of making a profit from the games.The graphics in the DS sucks badly. As a grown man I cannot see myself playing this. This is great for kids who don't care for graphics but not for grown people. I hope the 3DS will be much better than this DS that I wasted money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"nintendo ds lite colbalt/black","review":"they sold me broking item.my son play just once with this nintendo and it is not working anymore. payed some thing ever $80 for just a month is not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"A great gift for my mother in law.

It was cheap, and it shipped fast. That's probably the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars. I had written a review because there was a problem with the system, and the seller had offered to take the one that was broken, and sent out a new one (Considering that it was received broken). I was then content that my son would get a new DS, and it would all be done with. It later carried out until December because they had a lack of communication with me, and then I wrote a response on the 29th of December. Today is 2/6/13 and I have still not received a new DS.

I'm very happy about buying this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Say I'm Disappointed","review":"I've been wanting a DS Lite for a while now and since the New Year came around, I figured, 'why not blow the money on this'. It came in on time, and I was expecting a Crimson/Black DS Lite as ordered, but it turned out to be ALL red. Nothing like I've seen before, but apparently it's found in the UK and/or Hong Kong. I didn't give much thought about its authenticity and whatnot, but now I am. My dad was more excited than me to open it up, and the box went straight to the trash can, so I can't tell for sure whether or not my order was a sham. Although on the system itself, I'm more than satisfied, so I suppose it's just my conscience getting the better of me. Probably would've saved me the trouble if I received what I originally ordered though."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"my daughter is 5 years old and she was really unquiet untill this product got in her hands, she love it, no more stress to me and my wife"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars","review":"5 stars.

A few of my friends have it and we played Mario Kart together while waiting for a movie to start. The only issue is that I've dropped it a few times (there's no grip and it's so smooth) and now I hear a loose material sound when I shake the DS. Doesn't appear to have damaged it as it still works but it would be nice if they made it more sturdier. I'm sure tons of kids will be dropping it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nintendo DS Lite","review":"I ordered the Nintendo DS Lite for my 6 year old daughter for Christmas It was her favorite Christmas gift.

Buyer Beware!Actually, after further inspection, the item isn't refurbished but a cheap knock-off. The charger is generic. The instruction manual goes from page 2 to page 7 and is a poor copy. The DS is pink and has a pink DS pictured on the box yet the box is labeled: \\"Color:Red/Black\\". It is cheap and the flip up lid will be broken within weeks.

If you take care of your equipment and protect it, I don't think you will have any problems.

This is my second DS Lite (the other has been banged and bruised while on the deployment I am on), and as long as Nintendo is making DS and GBA games I will use this and other Gameboy systems. Definitely a good buy over the more expensive PSP. It is not like comparing apples to apples but Apples to Cousins' of Apples.

Put us in the big batch of users that suffered from this quality issue; had I written this review the first week of ownership, it would be 5 stars! Three weeks in, all I've got is a broken machine and a sad, sad little girl. Nintendo refuses to acknowledge what is clearly a pandemic design flaw, blaming the consumer instead. Shipping and repair fees are $80 for a machine that is $130 new; Nintendo told me how lucky I was that they charge so little to repair. Funny, I don't feel so lucky...

It had a few spots on the screen that got bigger and bigger like a windshield crack. Called Nintendo they explained that the screen was shattered but, wanted $75.00 to repair it, Amazon offered to replace it but, will not deliver the item until end of August. Buyer beware, I've bought 6 or 7 gameboys for my kids since the original and they've been dropped, thrown and stepped on and never have they shattered a screen.

That's right, buy our flawed product, use it for a short period, then due to a design flaw...spend as much as you paid for it to get it fixed. What has happened to their quality control. They used to be the best. I am Really considering selling all Nintendo products I own (which is alot since I have four kids) and switching to another company for entertainment. Sad, since i have blown thousands over the years and the one time I have a problem, the refuse to fix it.

The DS Lite is simply outstanding. It has a large library of DS and GBA games to choose from. The DS games usually have clever ways of implementing the stylus. As far as display quality, construction, comfort and battery life, I give the DS an A. Everything about it is great!Update: 10/2/2009Still rocking the same unit. Absolutely no problems what-so-ever!

The touch screen is sensitive but the mic wasn't able to pick up certain words when I tried playing Brain Age 2, which posed a problem in determining my brain age.

Less than 30 days later it had the same problem again, this time with a gel case and NOT being dropped. The screens seem to be less than able to handle repeated motions with the stylus.

When I saw that a special red and black version was coming out I just HAD to sell my white one and get this one!The best part about the crimson & black DS is that it doesn't have that shiny plastic over the whole thing (just on the red backing) so if you're like me and get twitchy when there's finger prints all over your DS you don't have to worry with this one!Also, because the other DS' have that plastic coating around the edges, I'm sure you've noticed (especially on the white one) that dirt and 'gunk' gets into those tiny little crevices, making it almost impossible for you to keep it clean. Because the crimson & black one doesn't have that: you don't have to worry about the dirt! :DOverall this is a fanTASTIC version of an already mind boggling game system.

Was impressed by the staying power of the batteries.

Only problem I have with it is the slot for GBA games, it sticks out so far!

I love the pictochat feature for talking to my neighbor without going to her house (Are you busy right now, can I borrow some sugar?). The cute pink color is just awesome for us girls and the bright lcds are just fantastic for playing in the dark or low lit areas. Get a Nintendo DS Lite, you will NOT be disappointed.

After seeing what's now available on the PSP I just cannot fathom how people can still stomach Super Mario XCVIII when games like Super Ghost N Goblins, the Sega museum, Grand Theft Auto, etc. are available for the PSP. Now with the option of being able to access your PS3 with a PSP, expect more PSP sales. If you like simple games and cannot afford something better, go for a DS. If you're a hardcore gamer, you cannot go wrong with a PSP, especially since it's finally getting AAA games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful - don't travel outside of North America and hope to use it!","review":"What a dismal surprise! How can Nintendo be so myopic and build devices that can be charged only at 110V?

I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but it seems they come out with a new gameboy every year, I can't even count how much remakes there were of the original Gameboy, and now with the DS?It seems Nintendo can never get their designs right the first time, this is a waste of money.Buy a Sony PSP if you want to have a game system from a company that knows how to create real entertainment. Great games, movies, music, videos, internet, how can you go wrong? And now it's only 200$, it's well worth it.If you buy a DS, expect to be buying another remake of the system next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You","review":"I love it. the plug was a bit sticky, but beyond that, i absolutly love the new (old) ds.

Honestly, I know it stops dusts from getting in, but there are wires in there. There has to be a purpose!-This DS is so hard to clean!

She is a lucky kid because she's one of the few who has doctor-recommended playtime.I find the Nintendo DS to be a reliable, kid-tough product. It's bonus is that it's portable and can be taken on vacation or on any long car trip. The variety of colors available would satisfy any child with a preference for a favorite color.

Will simply jump on the band wagon and embrace this band. Next thing they will be touring with Backstreet Boys. This kind of metal is just like the NU-Metal. Most bands will break up and go out.

The singers voice is equal to that of a baby seal being clubbed, the guitarists throw every cliche at you possible, while the drummer is weak and pathetic, making the drums sound worse than Lars Ulrich's on St. Anger.

You know what Avenged Sevenfold means? It is long for EMO. Avenged Sevenfold has some ok old stuff, but not the new stuff. The only good thing about AX7 is that the lead whiner suppports Bush. That's cool. I hope that keeps alot of you idiots that are anti-war from listening to them.Anyways, you can buy this album if you want, just keep it to yourself. So that the only mind it corrodes is your's.

Yes I know that \\"MTV 2's HEADBANGERS BALL had them appear on there but this was only for entertaiment purposes only in other words to make fun of the silly mix matched boy band.

They had a great new sound, released two smash hits and were musicaly talented. Now all that is gone. This album sounds like complete trash. There is NO mixing of heavy metal and punk sounds like their other albums and the guitar riffs are all the same and M. Shadows voice sounds like he got kicked in the nuts to hard. It is two bad that the saying \\"Third time's a charm\\" isn't true anymore. The only reason why it gets two stars is because the art work is kind of cool.

Thankfully enough the new album has brought me to my senses, or actually the terrible vocals have. I know the whole story about how M. Shadows apparently hurt his vocal chords and had to change his style of singing, but he should have left the band long before singing so badly off key. He is easily one of the worst singers I have ever heard. I cannot even defend him and say well he is singing metal and hard yells are necessary, for there are none here, just crummy vocals.The music is good but not great, I do enjoy the few breakdowns throughout the album though. Don't look for great guitar work, they are decent but nothing that metal bands haven't been doing for the last 20 years, and most of them much better.I cannot recommend this album at all.

Assrock, buttrock, hair rock with double bass and a little of G'N'R is all this CD is. It's nothing new, we've all heard it before.This isn't metal. This is new age assrock. This is metal for the wannbees watching MTV that think eyeliner and black clothes are cool. Go listen to real metal bands like, Converge, Ion dissonance, The Red Chord, Glass Casket, Myrkskog, Yattering, Into the Moat, etc, etc.A7x gives metal a band name.

Some of todays newer bands are good and they can play the guitar, but can they really play the guitar?? Either they can't or they don't want to. Whatever the reason, they should sit back and listen to these guys and sit in awe! These guys deliver the goods, kick butt and take names. \\"Bat Country\\" is one of my favorites while \\"Trashed and Scattered\\" just rips up the alleys. \\"Sieze the Day\\" is a nice slower track before cranking into \\"Sidewinder\\".

This band is a fraud. if you still like them, go download there music from one of those free sites(although I am not recommending illegal activity, it's just a figure of speech) but this band does not deserve support from anyone who is tricked into believing that this garbage is metal.

For this Album A7X throw the heavy sound, the unique guitar riffs, and the screaming in the trash. All of the guitar riffs (while still pretty crazy) are quite popppy, and extremely predictable. Most guitar solos sound like a new found glory melody on steroids. The drum is par...and the vocals are WEAK. This is no hardcore, this is no metal, this is mainstream rock. And I've come to believe that records like this are population control, because I feel like killing myself when i listen to it.This is not the first band to shame itsself with a crap release, produced by the idiots at warner bros who make them play this kind of garbage...nor, unfortunately, will it be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"METAL SLAYERS","review":"THIS CD AINT DA BEST CD FROM THEM I THINK IF MATT WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE HE DOES AT LIVE SHOWS THAT CD WOULD GO BEYOND 5 STARS BUT I THINK THAT THE GUITARS HAVE GOT TTEN BETTER AND THEIR IS MORE DOUBLE FOOT FROOM THE REV.

I didn't know what to expect but was very eager to hear this new album. I have been a listener to Avenged since their second album and own sounding the 7th. My appeal to the band has always been their talent as musicians and M Shadows ability to belt out a wicked scream. When I found out A) they were signing with WB and B) the vocals were changing I was expecting to be dissapointed. On the contrary I was quite pleased with the album. Despite the lack of screaming the band really pulls it together. If you can appreciate good guitar and an amazing drummer then you should give this album a shot. A mix with the old AV7 and a G and R sound this album is a must for anyone with appreciation for a hardcore sound.

I like the fact that they can rub off as (but not completely are) metal. You can hear their punk influences in their first 2 songs. From then on, it is leaning more to the metal side. I think that they have a unique sound, and the screaming is truly unnecessary. What people need to do is stop categorizing them as metal, so some of these \\"music, or metal fans\\" can get off their case.It's a good CD. Give it a chance, and don't expect METAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gman","review":"I feel like a tough critic. But after looking at everyone's review, I guess that I'm not alone on how bad this CD is. Wow, how disappointing. I was waiting for this CD for months...very excited since \\"Fallen\\" is so amazing. When I heard that they were going to Warner, I was worried. After listening closely to this record, I don't think it's Warner's fault. The songs are just bad. They flow into each other. There's no character to each song. Shadows voice appears very dead. Man, I just don't what else to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible change","review":"This album was a huge disappointment to say the least. I realize that M. Shadows hurt his throat somehow, but try letting one of the other guys do vocals along with him to give it a dual vocalist approach so there will be something other than singing the whole time. Dying Fetus uses two vocalists, and they are one of the most talented bands out there. Anyway, Beast and the Harlot is one of my favorite songs by them. It's a good opener, but then the goodness stops and never gets started again. With the exception of Bat Country (maybe), all the songs suck and sound like punk music. What happened to the metal-ish sound these guys used to have? If you like this style, then go for it. But if you're like me and you like vintage A7X, you'll stay away from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change for the worse (make me more money??)","review":"Either the label or A7X themselves decided to move in a totally different direction. Some of the songs have some ok material but its not much. This album sounds like a wanna-be metal rock band from 15-20 years ago. They had their own sound with Waking The Fallen. That album was very good. They have tried to reinvent themselves -why? i dont know. What I do know is that I will not be seing them live nor be wasting any further time with this album. Incredible let down. Thats just my opinion and i am sure some of you will like it. I hated it. HATED IT. \\\\m/ long live the metal underground"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst dissapointment in a while","review":"Aveneged Sevenfold Waken the falling CD was prolly one of the best Cd's i owned, and their love for the music seemed to show very well. But everything changed once i heard Their single bat country. This song is by far the sadest thing ive heard in a long time, what happened to this band? This is prolly one of the WOrst and Most dissapointing Rock CD's ever. Their last cd had Amazing songs that were hard and put together amazingly with great strings in songs to make then great, not lame ass pop songs with no heart like this cd is full of. What blew me over the edge is when i read a interveiw with the lead singer, M SHaDOWs, Saying he doesnt care if the music is good as long as he make enough money to by his liquor and have fun. SO PLEASE PLEASE!!!!! do not by this CD it is without a doubt the biggest dissapoint ever, Expecially for ever Hard Avenged sevenfold fan from their last CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"This album simply does not compare to Waking The Fallen. The dynamics of the song are nonexistant. What's the point in making just about every song 100% volume? What happened to the amazing volume changes like in Remenissions on Waking The Fallen?Shadows voice just isn't what it used to be, bruised vocal chords or major label pressures.This album is just a huge dissapointment. I'll keep listening to Waking The Fallen, but I definitely won't be seeing A7X on tour this year if they are playing this crud."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Bummed","review":"I must have listened to waking the fallen 500 times fully through before retiring it to my CD case and onto my list of top 10 favorite albums.

The lead singer being unable to scream severely limits this band and it now tetters on the brink of Skid Row/ Twisted Sister 80's junk. The screaming is gone and replaced by vocal harmonizing. The opening track \\"The and the Harlot\\" is junk and the album really doesn't have much going on until the 2nd half in which AX7 redeem themselves a little, but overalll this album lacks the thrash metal 80's feel of the last album and feels very commercial and watered down. This must be their \\"mainstream/cash in\\" album.GRADE: C-"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment","review":"the first time i had ever herd A7X was chapter four from the madden 04 soundtrack, ever sice then they have ben my favorite band, except when city of evil came out. i thought it was gonna be a great album especialy when i herd bat county, i'm sorry to say but in my eyes that was the only good song on the cd, i miss the old sevenfold, they try to hard to sound like metalica these days when they need to sound more like avenged sevenfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M APULLED","review":"THIS ALBUM DISAPPOINTS ME.

I have never been more excited for an album release and now I have never been more disappointed in an album release. No band today is, or should I say was, as good at creating a song that is a complete masterpiece as A7X. Not one single song on this album has the emotional outbursts, deep lyrics, mood shifts, vocal intensity, or melodic phrases that all previous A7X songs have. This is where you would normally crtique specific songs on the album or point out exactly what is wrong with the album, but this disc goes in one ear and out the other. There is nothing that remains in my head for 10 seconds so that I can comment on it. Please do not buy this cd. Warner Brothers can shove this you know where."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would Hunter have said?","review":"I would have rated this a zero, but apparently I can't so I must give it a one, begrudgingly mind you. I do this because the video they shot for \\"Bat Country\\" is loosley based off the film \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" (dir. Terry Gilliam, starring Johnny Depp, Benicio del Toro). If you know about the film, IT is based on the true exploits of Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. If this band that it would be a good idea to use one of the most memorable lines of this film as a song title AND THEN have the nerve to make a video for it mimicing this film, then I think Hunter's ghost should hunt them down with a Chesire cat grin on his face, toting a bag full of elicit narcotics and highly explosive materials. That's really all I have to say. If you want some real entertainment, don't buy this CD and use the money you saved to go rent \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\".

I will never see why people like this band. All these idiots walk around with tight girl jeans and black shirts and terrible haircuts and star tattoos and think they're hardcore. Guess what guys, YOU'RE NOT! You look like fools to everyone who listens to legitimate metal and not this Guns N' Roses wannabee bs. Speaking of which, I really wish Axl and Slash would get together and sue these people for ripping off their style.The vocals sound so strained and pitiful. The music is straight up 80s cheese and pure wankery.If you want some real metal go buy the new Meshuggah or hell go buy the new Motley Crue if you want cheese done right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screaming like a boy's choir","review":"I got cd for the song the Beast and the Harlot.

As the saying gose NO FALSE METAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"Really isn't all that fantastic of an album. It's just more pop-metal nastiness mostly. Vocals are nasily, yes I know he got surgery, but that doesn't mean the whole band has to change. The guitar work wasn't all the impressive either, let alone the drumming. You want metal?

This is just some crappy metalcore mixed with some guitar solos. Despite having guitar solos, they suck and the guitarist is no match for Kerry King, Adrian Smith, or K.K. Downing. The drums are a bunch of noise but that's what you expect in metalcore, A LOT OF NOISE!!! If you want an awesome old-school album in 2005, pick up \\"Angel of Retribution\\" by Judas Priest.

I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THE GUITARISTS PLAY THEIR INSTRUMENTS. BUT THE BEST PART WAS GUITAR SOLOS, THAT'S RIGHT YOU REMEMBER THOSE DON'T YOU? OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THESE GUYS, GET RID OF THE VOCALS AND YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD BAND HERE!................

They really got annoying on this album. Defaintly not another Waking The Fallen. Now I say this listening to Coheed and Cambria who have even more high pitched vocals then on this album. But the difference with Coheed is that Coheed's vocals work with the musicianship on their albums. This album however it just doesn't work for me. I give it a two because there's still a load of talent within the musicianship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!","review":"This album displays a7x evolving into a band that goes beyond genre labeling.

I never got into it, why? Because I am a METALHEAD. Now before all you mallcore and hardcore fans start boasting about how your slop-metal is really \\"metal\\", heed my words. Well actually take note from these guys... taking music to a power metal level is no easy task... esspecially for a band that has already secured its foundation in a certain genre.I'm pretty sure fans of A7X will be dissapointed... but these guys needed to mature and extend the boundaries of musicianship. Which is what i wish alot of bands with this kind of potential would do. Avenged Sevenfold have succeeded with City of Evil. A melodic, talented, and power metal album that will please anybody who appreciates good metal, musical compositions and talent.

But, all that aside I love this cd. It's very different, and it shows the real singing talent of M.Shadows, and not to mention the relentless melody assault brought every time by A7X. Not as diverse as \\"Waking The Fallen\\" but this disc shines on more of A7X's influences, such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Queen. They are easily our generation's new Maiden. fav. songs on this disc: Beast and The Harlot, Trashed and Scattered, Bat Country, Seize The Dayif you don't have this cd yet, and you are a fan of A7X and are not afraid to open up to a more old school feel, pick this thing up ASAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ALUBUM BY A GREAT BAND.","review":"This was a great C.D.

Honestly, it's the worst of their three albums. I mean they simply sold out with this album. I'll admit to liking it a little. There are some good song, but there is no edge to them anymore. To quote a friend \\"They went from being Iron Maiden clones to Guns and Roses clones.\\" That pretty much sums up A7X for me. They have never been super innovative with their music, but at least with SOTST and Waking the Fallen they had mostly interesting tracks. City of Evil is simply another nauseating nu-metal album. The only great tracks on this album would have to be M.I.A. and Betrayed(which is a tribute to Dimebag Darrel). The rest of them just blend in with all the other stuff that pollutes the airwaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Simply put this album is truly brilliant. the musicianship is flawless, melodies are great, vocals are brutal.

Compare it to their independent label(Hopeless Records) effort. \\"Waking the Fallen\\" was one of the most influential and original records of 2003.A perfect mix of harmony and brutality combined with precise songwriting and guitar riffs.Excellent. Now we have this.Okay I know this guy messed up his voice or what not but half of this album doesn't even sound like Avenged Sevenfold.They remind you of a really gay emo band for about half of the record. When they really do try they manage to rock you out. I personally liked \\"Blinded in Chains\\" a whole lot. Also \\"The Wicked End\\" has a cool like Movie type symphonic interlude in the middle. I like maybe three more songs on this album but the rest of it blows.I do respect them for not kicking their singer out just because he couldn't scream. This is loyalty and not many bands would do that.I was just dissapointed I didn't get an excellent metal record like I expected. Oh well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bah","review":"I think avenged listened to a little too much maiden lately since album sounds like a really really crappy version of maiden cds. The first few seconds of Beast and the Harlot are really good, sounds like they got heavier and the drummer became way better but then it all goes down hill when the chorus comes in.

It sounds like a Limp Bizkit cover band decided they were into Jon Bon Jovi and Guns 'N' Roses, changed styles but didn't have the chops. The \\"heavy\\" parts of this CD sound contrived, if you've heard any metal album in the last 20 years, you've heard all there is to be offered here. The \\"melodic\\" parts and solos sound like they were copied note-for-note by an ice cream truck. Overall, this is a bad hybrid of Bon Jovi and King Diamond; basically a re-hash of the past 20 years of hard rock/heavy metal, but without any fire, passion, or good execution to make it essential, or even worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative","review":"these guys suck.

As a hardcore fan of both of those bands, I gave Avenged Sevenfold a try. And I'm here to tell you-- it's absolute crap. I couldn't stand to listen to it, although I tried. Comparing it to Slayer or Metallica is an absolute insult. It sounds like David Bowie lyrics being obnoxiously screamed by a bunch of spastic teenagers who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. Like most music fans, I have a lot of CDs in my collection that I'm lukewarm on... but THIS was a CD I knew I would NEVER listen to again. I sent it back to Amazon, and they were nice enough to give me a partial refund even though I had taken it out of the plastic.Obviously there are quite a few people who like this band, and to each his own... but as a classic heavy metal fan, I have to say that Avenged Sevenfold gets two thumbs down from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell out?","review":"This CD is completely horrible. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the actual music part of the album is strong. The vocals are weak, and the band is only a shadow of their former selves. This is a terrible follow up to Waking the Fallen, which was an extremely well written album. So if you like A7X's previous albums, this will be a total waste.

The storyline didn't have much depth and you never really know why they are supposed to care so deeply with each other. The characters are unrealistic and did not resonate with me at all.

The empirical mindset is so ingrained in us that it's hard to imagine that it was once otherwise, especially in a classical civilization so influential to our history. Cultural knowledge and values were retained and passed down through practices that resemble ritual more than anything else. Knowledge and myth were indistinguishable.Havelock's book is an valuable contribution, but I do have some reservations about it. Havelock feels that Plato's mysticism is regrettable and this to me is a mistake. However valuable reason is to our lives, we still are not emotionally integrated beings. The ritualistic practices of classical Greeks may be obsolete from an empirical point of view, but not at all from an emotional one. For Plato to put spirituality on a rational basis was as important a contribution as putting science on a rational basis. Plato is not Aristotle, and that's a good thing.But read it and decide for yourself.

A stronger, more intelligent czar might well could have enacted reforms preventing the revolution and bringing Russia into the modern world without bloodshed.

I can understand any record label wanting to put out what they have the rights to, but the Elvis reissues have just gotten out of hand.

But who in their right mind would buy any of these new reissues? How moronic does Hip-O think Elvis's fans are? I don't even buy the line that they are suitable for new EC fans. All fans, new and old, should own the Rhino reissues. This set doesn't even cover the Warners albums.

It is very rare to find a novel which indirectly presents one who would normally be teh villain as the hero in a sense. By the end, I wanted Faber to escape Britain and successfully expose the allied deceit, despite the horrid consequences such an even would have entailed for the world. Follet was exceedingly successful in garnering support and sympathy for an otherwise nefarious character; an apathetic Nazi agent with only a shade of conscience. I musn't give any important plot developments away, but I must say I was very sad with the end. In essence though, this was a very engaging story with a dynamic and exciting plot and well developed characters, and perhaps one of the quickest reads I've yet encountered (it took only a few hours to read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"10/10 a few decades ago","review":"I first read this book when I was 15, many, many years ago. It was great then but it hasn't aged with grace. Though Follett is a pretty good writer, the best of later writers have surpassed him in suspense, action and drama.I would still recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. It's a solid book, but not as good as today's best thrillers. It's kinda old fashioned. It's not old enough to be a classic, yet it's too old to be still chic, it's like disco was in 1985."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye of the Needle","review":"Eye of the Needle is interesting throughout.

It's a scary tale. If dead bodies are too much for you to stomach, don't read this book. However,I found myself admiring the main characters, both the \\"spy\\" and the woman trapped on the island, but at the same time feeling horror at the deeds of the man and wondering if there couldn't have been some way for the young woman to escape her plight earlier.That's what makes a good story - conflicts - these kept me on my toes, trying to help out and tell the characters what to do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aptly Titled","review":"I do not want to reveal any plot points, but I can only say that the TITLE of this book is more chilling than you know. An excellent read. I am a voracious reader who enjoys Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal, Leon Uris, Colleen McCullough, Stephen King, Maeve Binchy, Olivia Goldsmith, Anne Tyler and many more, but Ken Follett is by far my favorite. He turns a phrase with a perfection that can be seen not only here but in The Man from St. Petersburg, Night over Water, and Pillars of the Earth. I highly recommend them all. The suspense in The Eye of the Needle does not stop until you put the book down, which you will not do until you have finished it. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking book, well written, hard to put down","review":"I've just finished reading this book and so it's all still very fresh in my mind. I know that I was supposed to root for the English, but the author made the German spy, Die Nadel, so appealing that I found myself rooting for him and hoping that he'd at least make it out alive, even if his mission ultimately fails (which I knew would happen, of course, from knowing the history of the WWII).The German spy is a loner, he is mistrustful and relies on logic, not emotion. He is an attractive man, an intelligent and educated German aristocrat, and he calculates his moves with military precision.On the other hand, the English forces trying to capture him are portrayed as mostly bumbling idiots, always a day late and a dollar short. I couldn't muster an ounce of sympathy for Percy or Bloggs.The subplot (Lucy and David on the island) was suspenseful and added a dimension to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye of the Needle","review":"I love English writers.

It's so excellently researched I would forget that it was a novel and be reading it, thinking it was a historical report. It kept me up late, kept me away from work I had to do. Those are the kinds of evidence that tell me I'm reading a great book. It was made into a movie, starring Donald Sutherland, so you can also enjoy the pleasure of viewing the flick after reading the book. Oops.

Based on the customer reviews i picked this one, but what a crappy book, it starts really slow, and gets interesting until you reach 20% of it. I agree with the reviewer who said there was a huge hole in the plot, but i think the worst part was the ending, how come suddenly Follet makes this lame woman the hero of the book, unbelievable. Honestly, every time I had to read events related to this woman and her family I skimmed through the whole thing. The ending sucks so much, that it ruined the whole book for me, I don't think that I'll be reading Follet for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Sidney Sheldonish for my taste","review":"This book sucked. That is the best way to put it. The only reason I did not gave 2 stars is because there is another book that sucks even more (Fireflies in december) but I digress. The characters are quite plain and cliché. They also seem to suffer from multiple personality disorder because they change considerably and almost magically from who they were in the beginning and who they were in the end.When I was a teenager I loved reading Sidney Sheldon's book. Everybody was gorgeous and brave and fabulous and had great sex and the stories could be made in to a soap opera thanks to the absurd twists and turns of destiny. Those kind of books were enjoyable for me then but not anymore. My point is that if I read the eye of the needle when I was 16 I would have probably like it quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triumph for a First Book","review":"I had read Ken Follets Eye of the Needle some years ago, and loved it then.

I was recently looking for something to read on a long flight and came across the Kindle version of this book. Good choice. Follett's prose is economical and easy to read yet full of detail. I knew the story but still enjoyed the development of the plot line.The characters are well developed and Die Nadel is not simply portrayed as a one dimensional baddie but Follett gives him some humanity. His brief fling with the heroine, Lucy, nearly proves his undoing. When Lucy uncovers the truth about her lover, she too faces a difficult choice. In the end, both Lucy and Die Nadel do what they have to do.A satisfying read and a story that can be easily re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of disappointing","review":"I have been a Ken Follett fan, and so I bought this book hoping for intrigue like the Key to Rebecca, and sweeping detail like Pillars of the Earth. I was disappointed on both counts. A contributing factor is that I'm still kind of new to reading e-books on my Kindle Fire, although I doubt that had much impact on my impressions of the content. The neglected wife's way-too-detailed-and-lengthy sex with the spy and the lack of impactful suspense negated what could have been a great read.

Check out the video \\"The Neocons\\" (Also called \\"The Power of Nightmares\\")The Power of Nightmares by Adam Curtiswhich can be found on you tube and see how the jihadists and the NeoCons share the same intellectual origins and how this book played a role in that vision, particularly Casey's decision to fund Islamic \\"Freedoms Fighters\\" in Afghanistan establishing the militant foundation for the 9-11 attacks on the New York World Trade Center. Also learn why these same NeoCons decided to attack Iraq. You will not find the answers in this book, only the Incestuous Amplification. This is a book full of CIA initiated lies that the CIA has discredited as it own (false) propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Scheibe is one of those composers who have been relegated to the backwaters of musical history. This is unfortuate, because his music is tuneful, well-crafted, and beautifully orchestrated. The music on this CD may not be the most memorable in the world, but it certainly deserves a hearing and carries its weight with elegance. There is even one Sinfonia that is highly reminiscent of J.S. Bach's Orchestral Suites. As for the peformances, they are cultivated and arresting, with particularly beautiful wind and brass playing. There is none of the astringency one encounters on so many period instrument performances; the sound Manze and his players make is very agreeable. The sound engineering is especially beautiful. I'm sure I'll be returning to this CD often for a decent look into a pleasant and bygone musical era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product.","review":"I had to go through and individually sew each strap back onto the cover.

I thought it was just one string, but as we connected the rest of them we had at least 4 more break! The material that attached the string to the seat cover was cheap and flimsy and poorly designed!

I wish they would have used better material to attach the seat covers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than expected","review":"I am a GKC fan but I avoided this book because basically is sounded boring and dated.

I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long, the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads, because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth, and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for yourself","review":"I bought this with a gift certificate my company gave me. I had been wanting an electric toothbrush for over a year. I just couldn't get myself to pay that much for it. My dentist recomended this one. I really wanted one that spinned. I got it out when it arrived and have loved it. (a plus with the free shipping) I have checked around and the 2 pack replacement heads are cheaper online than at a store. The first try doesn't hurt like the other reviews would have you think it just tickles. I want to use it all the time. I have a teenager and a two year old. I do not have a lot of time for myself. I will make the time because my teeth feel so clean when I am finished. I did have them cleaned the day this arrived. Also I chose the cheapest shipping method (free with housewares purchase) and it arrived in about 2 days all my items together. If you have been thinking about one look at all the reviews this is the only brush that consistantly gets a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works, but replacement costs...","review":"The effectiveness of the Sonicare PS-1 is most easily explained by just using it. First impression is that it's quite a strong device. But after getting used to it, it's a cinch.Because it's so powerful, after brushing you feel like you left the dentist's office. I don't doubt the claims of other ppl that this is a great toothbrush. But, I realized after the fact that replacing the brush heads are an expensive proposition, as compared to the competition. Even though the brush heads are recommended to be replaced every 6 months, the replacement costs are still rather high."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no substitute.","review":"We have 3 of these, and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to, and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory, but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best, as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things, so while I preach 'pack light', they tote their Sonics everywhere we go.

Why is it called \\"Saving the World from Mass Production\\" when many of the projects require materials purchased at mass retailers?

Whereas the SNB books feature designs that are innovative, beautiful, and sophisticated, Super Crafty is filled with projects that lack any real purpose and look just cheap and silly.This book seems to be aimed at adults, however I don't think anyone over twelve would be caught dead having most of these items lying around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surveyors Tape","review":"This item fell apart after a couple of uses-handle came off and I tried to put it back together but it ended up being junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Lacquer Job","review":"I purchased a Cecilio Blue Lacquer Alto Saxophone Kit a few months ago.The overall appearance of the instrument is pretty good for the price.The tone and playability is also very good for the price.I have had problems with the Blue Lacquer coming off on the neck of the instrument and on the back side of the bell.I went to a local hobby shop and purchased some model airplane paint thesame color and have touched it up so it does not look so bad.I feel that the lacquer peeling off in this manner is a definite rip offso I cannot recommend this instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love new sax","review":"This saxophone is amazing it has a nice clear tone and is very stylish.

Johnson alternates the action forward and backward from the birth of the child, showing Bobby's struggles caring for an infant, and also giving brief glimpses of how things went when Nia was pregnant.By itself, it's a touching but realistic story of two students with promising futures that suddenly give way to parenthood because of one mistake. But for me, the story really came down to the question of why Bobby was raising the baby. This question is answered toward the end of the book, and to reveal that really would give the whole thing away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I simply loved this book because of its wonderful writing and tender handling of a delicate subject. The story tells a tale of a young man raising a child and tells the story in a loving way. I really enjoyed reading the story and the way it was told. Johnson really seems to empathize with \\"children having children\\" and gives the reader a positive role model as a young boy learns what it is to be a father.

After water polo fun (sex) in the swimming pool Bradford's life becomes a living eternal hell when Christensen sends him pictures, makes his life a living hell and almost kills his girlfriend. The real truth is, is she picks athletes and stalks them till they cant be stalked no more. If you call this movie a 5 star movie, there's something seriously wrong with you, truly.

After all, it's rated PG-13 and I wouldn't call it a creepy thriller either as it has been called. It was just ok for me. Maybe a tiny bit of suspense but not a edge of your seat kind of movie. I would say it's a Fatal Attraction wanna be with the plot involving a girl who becomes obsessed with a man..... well in this case both of them are students. After a one night stand, the girl becomes obsessed with this guy and before long, she will do whatever it takes to make him hers even though he has a girlfriend.

The plot goes like this. Boy meets girl,boy and girl have a one night stand, but boy has girlfriend, and girl goes psycho. Thats it in a nutshell, but the movie is a mere 85 minutes long, so things move along quickly and there are no unnescassay scenes. Jesse Bradford gives a convincing performance as Ben Cronin, the swimmer being stalked. While all the performances are good, including Shiri Appleby as Bens loving girlfriend, I would have liked to see the 2 actresses switch places. Shiri has such a sweet face and vulnerablity about her, and I think she could have potrayed the girl next door turned psycho role better. Overall, its a mindless fun. Sit back, laugh at some unintentionally funny dialogue, and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It","review":"I was thoroughly board with this movie.

Yes? Well, next time, get a videocamera and film it. Apparently there are people who will pay $10 to look at it.I saw this on cable and still asked for my money back. If you were one of the 17 people to pay to see it in the theatre, call the ASPCA and make your neutering appointment. You can't be trusted with something as dangerous as free will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Water.","review":"This is a horrible movie. I can't possibly think of any reason anyone would want to watch this garbage. It's terribly written, predictable, and badly acted. I was almost falling asleep through most of it, near the end when she's beating at him and his girlfriend in the pool with that mop thing, or pool net or whatever it was, is just laughably ridiculous. I'd rather drown myself in a mudhole than watch Swimfan again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD","review":"...I'm usually not compelled to write reviews on here, but this movie was so hard to swallow, that I had to regurgitate somewhere...so it may as well be here.This movie felt like it was edited with a chainsaw. The phrase \\"how covenient!\\" pops into mind about every 5 mins. I just wanted to slap every character for being so dumb. It's so bad that you never actually see the villian committing her acts. Only the before and after...like I said....chainsaw.And what happened to the mother after she was cracked on the head with the trophy? Does she die? Does she live? Who knows? Again, chainsaw.The actors aren't bad...just bad writing...they do the best that they can with this drivel.And isn't it funny that in both Fatal Attraction and this film...the temptresses both drown???Now where is the boiling bunny?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Thriller","review":"I like Swimfan not only was the plot great almost like Fatal Attraction. But the clear star of the movie Madison Bell you can't help but either love or hate. The actress that played her was awesome. Jesse Bradford was a distance second. The supporting actors blend in well. Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Erika can't save this film....","review":"I bought this film despite the bad reviews over the past couple of years, hoping to find just a glim of hope in it. Erika Christensen, being one of my favorite actresses..can't even save the film. It has good music, and some moments that get semi-thrilling or intense, then go right back down.And even though you respect Jesse's Bradfords character, he annoys you at the same time. Somehow, he ALWAYS knows what to do in every situation, and it makes the movie even more unrealistic and immature.It had potential, but just couldn't quite make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Teen Thriller","review":"This \\"Fatal Attraction\\" for the Clearasil set is almost a complete waste of celluloid with one glaring exception: A terrifically maniacal turn by Erika Christensen(so good in \\"Traffic\\") as the obsessed teen. Too bad the object of her affection, a vapid jock named Ben(Jesse Bradford.Who?!) isn't worthy of her murderous designs. Aside from a lunkhead as our protagonist the film has uninspired direction and a by-the-numbers script. I like trash as much as the next guy but this magnum opus isn't even worthy of a casual cable viewing. If I remember correctly this tripe was released during the post Labor Day season when studios traditionally dump their bad-to mediocre product on an unsuspecting public."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Teen Movie","review":"This is an awasome movie and really liked it.One thing when ur doing the wild thing dont ever say u love a person unless u mean it cause this is a perfect example of what might happen if u find a girl like this and do the wild thing with her.But before we get the dirty part of this movie this is good movie and is not a chick flick.My doggs out there watch who u do things with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This movie is good! I liked it a lot. If you like movies where there are creepy stalker girls, then this great for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does for pools what FATAL ATTRACTION did for elevators","review":"Swimfan (2002) Erika Christensen, Jesse Bradford, Shiri Appleby, Kate Burton, Clayne Crawford, Dan Hedaya, D: John Polson. Slick high school hunk Bradford living on the east coast has a close to ideal life with a girlfriend and a swimming scholarship toward Stanford-but ironically when the new-girl-in-school (Christensen) keeps running into him, she leads him into a forbidding (and routine) trap beginning with seducing him in the pool. Christensen is no Glenn Close and the film is no FATAL ATTRACTION. Only the swimming pool setting and some thrilling scenes can set this standard teen-stalker apart from the others. Fact: Logically, a teenager cannot serve medicine to hospital patients without being a registered nurse, and that goes for Mr. Bradford! Running Time: 85 minutes and rated PG-13 for some language, sinister elements, and sexual content."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie really fell short of my expectations.","review":"I like a good thriller. Unfortunately, this was not a good thriller. The idea behind the movie is a good one. Obsession, sex, stalking, etc. But the dialogue was so cheesy and the premise so far-fetched that this movie lost all of its potential. The ending is a let-down and the acting is mediocre, at best.If you're into thrillers and have no other choices, you might want to rent this one. Otherwise, go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Attraction High","review":"This is the most blatant attempt at re-creating Fatal Attraction I've ever seen. Granted it's cheap entertainment at best, but as for originality one should look elsewhere. The sad thing is it will hit HUGE with the bubble gum crowd seeing as they have no clue as to what good cinema is and probably never got to see Fatal Attraction either, which might I add is also far more disturbing than Swimfan could ever dream of being. Madisyn Bell even has the characteristics of Glenn Close: fairly attractive but certainly not drop dead gorgeous. Overall, if you are 14 and listen to Britney Spears then this movie is for you, if not, go rent Fatal Attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic, Throw Away Fatal Attraction Lite","review":"Where's the boiling bunny? Welp, here we have non-descript youths experiencing the joy and ultimate pain of being a Fatal Attraction knock off. New, sensitive girl in school falls for swimmer who already has a girlfriend, in a moment of weakness, boy is seduced as girl says \`Tell me you love me'. Boy comes to senses afterwards, girl does not; proceeds to get boy fired, barred from swim team, kills opponent, tries to kill girlfriend, tries to kill mother and tries to kill the boy. Arrested by cops, escapes, and sets up eventual showdown in, yes, the same place they had sex , the pool. Hurrah! Pretty formulaic stuff. The brother from that cheerleading movie is in it, and he's at least passable. The villainess is the moon pie faced girl last seen paying for her drugs in Traffic; maybe someone attractive could have pulled off the character a bit more. Seemed more like a bad after-school special that something to waste time with on cable. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Crush, Part 2","review":"Well, as many of the reviews have stated, this film comes from the Fatal-Attraction-Teen-Crush \\"If I Can't Have You, Then You Better Watch Your Back\\" school of filmaking. Some of the scenes are pretty rediculous because we know that this girl, who is obsessed with this guy, is going to do all she can to send a message and ruin this guy's life. So, once he tells her to leave him alone, you pretty much know what is going to happen. She starts stalking him, leaving a ton of messages on his computer, getting him in trouble with his girlfriend, hurting people close to him, etc.It's not a terrible movie per se, but I feel as though I've seen it a hundred times. I think it would have been better if they had taken this movie a different direction. I would write a longer review, but in a few years this movie will be long forgotten about, so what's the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Best Guitar Improvisation..","review":"I was really surprised about there is no reviews of this album..I am a Guitar player and Abercrombie is one of master that I wannabe...I own a lot of abercrombie cd and personally this album is best of all of them. this one also easy to listen.cd like open land is nice but somehow very experimental. the other albums of john also pretty much trying to new things..but this album You can relax while you listen. and Don thompson' bass line is just fantastic..in interview he was tried like Jim hall and Bill Evans duo.but I like this album much..

To top it off the color is on the orange side. Not happy at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this lip stain","review":"I love this lip stain because the color lasts longer than other lip stains that I have used, the stain is light rather than heavy and dry and it is very subtle. So, it can be used alone or underneath various lipsticks or glosses to provide a nice base. I've given several to friends as gifts and they love it as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE lipstain to have!","review":"This is my favorite lipstain of all time. It is super versatile. You can put it on lightly, for a blushed, no-makeup look, or layer it a bit more and create a sensuous pout for an evening on the town. It also works well on your cheeks, just use it lightly, as a little goes a long way. It lasts pretty well through eating and drinking, but you may need a touch up here and there to keep a darker color. It is a bit drying on your lips, but that doesn't bother me because I always use a gloss over it anyway. The stain is not shiny, it adds color to my pale lips, so the gloss is for shine and a finished look. Beauty Queen is my favorite color because it goes with my red-head, pale skin really well and looks very natural. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Great color and feels wonderful - but good luck trying to make it last on your lips for more than 20 minutes.

I like this lip stain, but I wouldn't say it's a homerun. It does help my lipstick to last longer. I apply this before applying other make up and about 30 min later I put my lipstick on. If I put my lipstick on too soon it tends to make my lips sticky. It does last a long time and stains my lips without being overpowering. I just wish it was a little more moisturizing and perhaps had a little more color to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best out there","review":"I have very oily skin, so any blush, looks glossy on me after a couple hours. But with the Stainiac, I can touch my face, blot, even grab my face with both hands, and the color does not come off. I work from 9-5 and the color stays the same...it even lasts through a nice 2 mile run! The price is high, but totally worth it! I recommend it to everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy for lips, for cheeks-work quickly...","review":"Apply to clean dry lips, and wait about 30-60 seconds before using another product on top. Decent staying power and forgiving shade (Beauty Queen). For the cheeks, apply to one cheek and start working it in immediately, then start on the other cheek. If you dab it on both cheeks, replace the wand applicator into the tube, and then work in the stain one cheek at a time, by the time you get to the 2nd cheek, there could be a 'stain' where you dabbed the product on, even after rubbing...happens to me. Probably works best for moisturized or oilier skin. The product may be a challenge to apply to dry skin types. Nice product, not for everyone. Very natural looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Large-Print version.","review":"Web Accessibility for People With DisabilitiesWe can't find a Large-Print version of this book.

But if you have a Mac, you may know how it feels to be shunned by Samsung and Verizon. So this feels like a little victory!As another reviewer noted, there are no instructions with this cable.

A very easy read, this book puts a fun spin on the typically boring side of business management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, But Not Really Helpful","review":"Barbara's advice is just not doable for the average person in business today. Her examples about her mother's advice are just not relevant. I have not been able to finish this book because it is so boring and she pats herself on the back all through the book. Good for her for making a killing in real estate back when you could do that. We see what happened to many of these real estate sharks in recent years. Not impressed with the money, money, money! She pulled off her sales using deceptive practices, in my opinion. Sorry I helped increase her coffers by purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I bought it thinking it was a memoir and it was, somewhat, but it was also much more. I'm not a salesperson but I don't know anyone who could read this book and not become completely inspired by Barbara Corcoran's story. Alternating between charming stories of growing up in a huge Irish family with her lessons on what she learned growing her business, the book tells how she used lessons from her mother to become a success in real estate. As a tale of persistence and determination, the story has a lot of wisdom and is an enjoyable, fast-paced read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be a Sap and Buy this Book","review":"I can't believe this book has gotten such good reviews. It is extremely repetitive. It's rare that I don't finish a book, but about half way through I felt embarrassed that I had even bought it and was contributing to her financial gain. Also, Ms. Corcoran is proud of the fact that she lied about apartments, about her credentials, and about statistics she fabricated that were published in the New York Times. She views that as being creative and entrepreneurial. She's a typical example of the Business Ethic (i.e. no ethics) and why we are in the financial trouble we are in today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, almost contrived","review":"I was disappointed. I had anticipated something more realistic and isntructional. It appeared that the author had objectives and then created a history that fit that outcome. The title made no sense and was intended to market the book. Then the topics discussed in the book were too unrealistic to be credible. The author's liberal values and agenda were patently obvious and should have had no place in this book. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment!","review":"I saw the author on TV and thought i would give this book a try. What a mistake!! It was totally, unequivocably self-promotion. The author had an opportunity to make a contibution to the human resource community. Instead she dwelled upon her perceived accomplishments and self aggrandizement. This was an insufferable read. Do yourself a favor and do something you don't like to do as this will be more rewarding than subjecting yourself to this meaningless drivel and diatribe upon men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"A friend gave me this book as it made a difference when she was promoted to a high level position within her company.

I liked the author's style of character developement and explaination of past events that led to the present situation. However, I was very disappointed in the movie adaptation of the novel. True to Hollywood form, it did not even come close to the original storyline!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Calm","review":"I saw the movie first, with Nicole Kidman, Sam Neill and Billy Zane, and realized I had the book, so read it. Really good book, brought this landlubber reader right down to water level in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Memorable, well-drawn characters. Action cuts from one yacht, with a madman and the new bride, to the other yacht, which is slowly sinking, with the husband and two other people aboard. The husband and wife are frantically trying to reunite in the vast, empty sea. Tension abounds on both boats. The boats go further apart, then come closer, trying to find each other as the hours pass, the water rises in the sinking boat, and darkness falls. Climax? Wow!I wasn't surprised to find the book was out of print, but it shouldn't be, it's that good. A classic. Written in 1963. Williams born when Joseph Conrad was alive. I bought it and many other Perennial Library paperback mysteries 15 years ago for $.99 each, and was amazed to find it made into a current movie with big stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Read It!","review":"Dead Calm was written by Charles Williams in 1963.

You use it when moving a pot, or takingit off the stove etc. How hard it that? Come on folks, this is a great item, it helps youto protect yourself, it works great. This holder has already saved my hands from constantlybeing burned. It's size is wonderful, and I, for one, am very thankful Lodge made them at areally reasonable price.

(8\\" and 12\\") The length fits the handle perfectly, but they have both caught on fire. I've read other reviewers' posts that this has happened to them too. I think the instruction says to leave them off the pan handle except when you need to move the pan. But DUH, all cooking shows tell you to put some towel or mitt on a hot pan handle all the time as a reminder and caution that the handle is hot, so it's an unreasonable instruction to tell people to put the mitt handle on only when one needs to move the pan.It's a shame that this happens, as the price is decent for the pair. I've since replaced these with silicon handles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep my hands safe","review":"These work great. I cook on gas so it's not a good idea to have them too close to the flame.

I'm not sure if it's the flame creeping up the sides of the pots, or simply the temps that I cook with, but the mitts will start to brown at the edges closest to the pot if you leave them on when cooking. It's a mild annoyance to remove them, but the option is they will brown and no longer look as nice when in use.I have a few pans that are copies, not actual Lodge designed and these fit on those just fine too.

There were also two chips on the pan, which would have caused some issues once I washed the pan. I sent it back and ordered the large rectangular pan instead, which should supply the cooking area that I require. I am sure this product is useful for small turkeys and roasts but I wish the measurements would have been a bit more accurate or at least stipulated in the description that the length included the handles.

I was ecstatic that my local music store actually carried this (Zulu Records in Vancouver). Anyways, 10 of the 12 tracks are previously unreleased. Fans of the loud and squealing guitar of Dinosaur Jr might be a bit put off by this album. When they say acoustic show, they mean it. There doesn't appear to be anything else to the tracks other than acoustic guitar, vocals, and maybe a touch of reverb. This is just raw J Mascis. Anyways, the sound quality is excellent and tracks are mosty good. For me, the stand out track is definately Repulsion. This works so well as a purely acoustic number. That song alone is worth the price of the CD.All in all this a solid live album. It's definately not as easily accessible as say Nirvana Unplugged, so this album might be better suited for more hardcore Dinosaur Jr/J. Mascis fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreleased: Sort of...","review":"First off, it's J. Mascis and it's a fine solo show so it gets 4 stars. That said, if you already own \\"Martin + Me\\", you're essentially paying for 3 songs by buying this (Not the Same, Quest, and Throw Down; the later coming in at about 45 seconds). Even the arrangements and the vocal delivery are almost identical to \\"Martin + Me\\". Wouldn't shock me to hear they were recorded within a week of one another.

There was a time when music defined who we where and Dave Von Ronk along with others helped us to define who we where. Cocaine his definitive statement is without doubt his greatness. For those of you from this era, turn up the volume and revel in a unique and sophisticated voice of the era of Dylan, Odetta, Peter, Paul and Mary, Barry McGuire and so many other who's voices and lyrics made a difference in who we are.

Great!The design of the plate is very smart. The dark shade of blue in the center is nicely complemented by the warm, earthy tones with different color stripes all around the circumference of this fourteen inch wide plate. The overall effect certainly does give it that vibrant southwest feel; the design can also go with many contemporary and even modern dining room sets.This platter is hand painted; that impresses me. There is a five year warranty but with the great design of these plates I doubt you'll ever need it!

You still have to use multiple applications to really soften the leather, and while it isn't particularly greasy, it isn't grease-less, it still leaves some residue. If it wasn't $15, I'd give it 3 stars, but at $15 for a little tub, I'd say this is a rip-off. Just buy some cheaper leather lotion from your local leather shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"good place to start for discovery of your inner self","review":"I found this book to be very helpful in refining ways to bring out my true self.

The saddest thing, however, is that the servile submissiveness of the American people, and their unquenchable desire to worship bland celebrities as though they were Gods, perhaps teaches us that the hopes of our forefathers were premature --- that, like the Jews in the bible, the American people, having won themselves freedom, are clamoring for a king."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two extraordinary Everywomen","review":"Mulvaney has taken two of the most famous women of the last century and compared and contrasted them in the roles all woman are cast in (Maidens, Mothers, Myths). It's a fabulous idea and makes for very entertaining reading. While there is little new in this book about the lives of either of these well-documented ladies, the parallells Mulvaney draws between them gives the familiar information a fresh spin. (In particular, I'd never considered how similar their relationships to their formidable mothers-in-law were!) The cultural comments are interesting, too. Jackie maintained her (stereotypically English) \\"stiff upper lip\\" to the very end, while Diana took the more typically American, open approach to her life and her problems. And that's why I believe these women continue to fascinate. As much as we read about Jackie, we'll never feel we knew her -- she's an enigma we keep trying to solve.

For 95% of the workout portion of the video you only see Sandy from the waist up and the people standing behind her appear to be \\"people off the street\\" because you can tell by watching them (which is the only way you know what movement to do) that they have no knowledge of what's going to happen next or how to do a particular move.

I was a bit surprised by it, not to say confused.It is different from his previous work. I've recently purchased it on the CD because I remembered that there was something about it that I liked. I now understand why; it's very good. Green used the wha-wha pedal very sparingly when with the Fleetwood Mac. The End of the Game is a terrific display of his mastery of the effect. Although he himself classifies this album as nothing more than a jam, it is a must listen for anybody who enjoys his music, or the \\"cry baby\\" pedal in action. It's all instrumental and contains some of the most aggressive guitar playing from Peter. I love it.

They could also do the same for other high-priced collections like \\"Ernest Ansermet: Decca Recordings 1953/1967\\".It's also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cuts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Should Care","review":"Knowing this lovely collection was recorded on Boz's own Gray Cat label & that it debuted #1 on Billboard Jazz charts (on an independent label, no less), pretty much serves up some idea of what the trade thinks of this release.

Strangely empty of emotion, uninvolving.","review":"I picked this up because a) it's Boz Scaggs, a guy whose records I wore out when they first hit, and b) it's full of great old songs. BUT: Boz sounds like he's doing something else, maybe surfing the internet or looking out the window, when he sings. Hard to imagine that the man who punched out \\"Lido\\" can sound so half-asleep performing great material. A washed-out, almost depressing performance. There are many much better renditions of these classic songs. I imagine it's hard to come up with new material, but please, if you're going to do these songs at least sing as if you're awake. No emotion, no involvement. And to add annoyance to injury, Boz somehow found the world's worst drummer for this session. If you can tap your fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as him, incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job on the standards","review":"Boz does a great job singing these standards.

Have been a fan for many years and have always felt Boz to be one of the pioneers of Smooth Jazz.The intimacy and subtlety of Boz's voice is overshadowed by the terrible saxaphone playing (shrill tone and obnoxious solos)The C.D is superb otherwise, but unfortunately l consider it unlistenable as is. It would have worked better as a trio or perhaps with some orchestral support.Boz's own \\"Harbour Lights\\" and \\"Night of Van Gogh\\" is indicative of the true potential this project could have had.Five stars for effort - Zero for result!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong voice, right attitude","review":"I love Boz, but I don't think he has the right voice (tone/timbre) to pull off these classics. I just saw him in Aspen, CO, and that only confirmed my feelings. He's got the band, the phrasing and the attitude, but he just can't pull it off with his voice.

Where Nelson Riddle's big band arrangement perfectly suited Linda Ronstadt, who belted out the song \\"What's New?\\" for all she's worth, the small jazz combo backing Boz Scaggs perfectly suits his laid back vocals on that song. He sings the classic \\"Sophisticated Lady\\" as though Duke Ellington had written it for him to perform. Boz sings \\"For All We Know\\" with a world weariness that perfectly matches the mood of the lyrics. \\"So love me tonight; tomorrow was made for some. Tomorrow may never come, for all we know.\\" No singer's voice is better suited to singing standards than Boz Scaggs. The musicians backing him are superb and the production is perfect. The subtitle of this album is Standards, Volume One. Personally, I can't wait to hear Volume Two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"I am a Boz Scggs fan from 1971. I am also a jazz fan with deep appreciation for the old standars. It seems that more and more, everyone, from the new jazz crooners and divas, to the vintage rockers are covering the standards. I have found many of their interpetations interesting and intertaining. I am not a big Phil Collins fan, but his cover of \\"Do Nothin' till you hear from me\\" on Q's ook Joint (Quincy Jones) is a prime example. I anticipated that Boz Scaggs, with his voice and past productions would be the ultimate to cover the old standards. Disappointingly, I found his interpetations uninspired and totally lacking soul. It was an unexpected disappointment of a fan who has almost all his releases back to the days od vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant, but not flawless","review":"I really do like this disc, and find myself listening frequently. The song selection is good, and the vocals are easy to listen to if not \\"great jazz.\\" However, like one or two of the other reviewers, I found the drums at time detached from the song and mixed way too prominently. The sax player at times sounds inappropriate for these songs and trying too hard to make them something else. But these are occasional lapses in an otherwise fine production. Try the preview for the song \\"But Beautiful.\\" If the drums don't bother you, buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LIFELESS AND UNINSPIRING","review":"Countless pop stars have tackled \\"Standards\\" in the past twenty years: Linda Ronstadt; Rod Stewart; Leon Russell; Crystal Gayle; the list goes on. Unfortunately, Boz does so with such little enthusiasm that this set is ultimately lifeless and tedious. Boz has a great voice and I had hoped he would have been more emotional in his delivery of these great songs. But his \\"lounge\\" accompaniment is too redundant, and all the songs sort of sound the same. Nice try, but Boz is better with his own material.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and even irritating at times","review":"Boz Scaggs has a great voice but I don't think his talents are best showcased in this genre. I find this recording tedious and even irritating at times. The arrangements at times accentuate the worst in his sidemen---shrill saxaphone, no space in the drumming, languid piano---and Mr. Scaggs does not sound like he is really enjoying himself.It's not to compare this session with the high energy of an outfit like the Riff Burglars fronted by the outstanding Roger Chapman. I'll take the Riff Burglars any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill the Drums!","review":"I agree with the other reviewer - the drums are used as a metronome - to the extent that it DOES interfere with Scaggs' soulful, well balanced vocals.

It's frustrating because it's obvious that Sundazed used the session tapes. If not for the added distortion, this would be a great sounding CD from start to finish. If this had happened to one of the Beatles CDs, the problem would have been corrected by now. But since it's \\"only\\" a Raiders album, I guess we just have to put up with this sloppiness.

As I grew older I gradually realized that his attempts to construct arguments out of chains of half quotes, logical fallacies, and historical mytholigizing was only a symptom of the mans near total denial of reality. Readers get the thrill of feeling that their being let in on some incredible secret, thats been suppresed by mainstream culture. Sadly, their is no secret. Marxism and all its children are but the intellectual vituperation of an old man with chronic ulcers and capitalism is just a way of effeciently distributing resources in an economy. Every once in a while I check in on Chomsky's books to see if he's grown up yet, but he's still rambling on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Argentinian Success","review":"I listened to this album back when released. I think this album is definitive in exploring new and different influence with in the \\"Rock en Español\\" genera. This album serves as a palette of the eclectic reality of Latin America. Being a Mexican I can really appreciate the balanced and melancholic undertone to this album and the violently expressive tracks. The song \\"Hermosa from heaven\\" is the maximum expression of American influences in Latin America; elevating interlingual and intercultural mishap to an art. I truly appreciate this album like a Van Gogh; full of insight and beauty encased in violent texture and melancholic freedom. My appreciation goes out to the realization of this album; you truly captured something unique, of which I think can not be repeated by the Valderramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the best in Argentine rap...","review":"I was living in Buenos Aires from 1995-1997 and some people told me about these guys. I bought Chaco and soon realized this is one of the greatest, and most diverse bands in the world. I quickly hunted down their other 4 CDs. (Fabrico Cuero and Horno para Calentar los Mares aren't available in the U.S.)This is by far their best album to date. You can't sit still when listening to Abarajarme, and Hermoza from Heaven is great for impressing the ladies with your bilingualness.If you speak spanish and like all types of music, BUY THIS CD! Or better yet, buy two cause it makes a great gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the craziest mixes of music you'll ever hear on 1 CD","review":"Chaco is not horrible. It's just one of those CD's that I only listen to a few tracks, once in a while. I find them funny, not because I understand their lyrics (I speak very little Spanish and the whole CD is in Spanish), but because of the emotions they put into their music. It's definitely one of those crazy music mixes, using sounds from the decades of the 70's to the 90's, to the soft sounds of R&B, and to the ruffer sounds of hard rock and disc jock. If you've got a few bucks to blow, and you like to amuse friends with sorta stupid music, then it's worth the doe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Techno With Soul!","review":"After scoring with \\"Tainted Love\\", ex-Soft Cell guy David Ball went on to form Grid. This album is their finest moment, its eletronic soul tempered with unforgettable melodies, superb improvisation and the stuff that makes electronic music so mind-tripping. Sure, you can dance to it. But you can also hear it over and over and hear nuance and shade, degrees and shifts. And, on \\"Swamp Thing\\", a cool banjo riff gets merged with unstoppable synth-beats to create something fresh. Grid are far better than 9/10ths of other so-called \\"techno\\" acts out there. Evolver follows in the grand tradition of Tangerine Dream, Jean-Michel Jarre, Klaus Schulze. Check out \\"Rise\\" and \\"Shapes Of Sleep\\" to see what I mean. Oh, yeah, one more thing: King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp turns up here and there. A great release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pure techno - better than most","review":"This album sometimes gets a bad rap because the the most popular singles (Texas Cowboys, Swamp Thing) while well executed dancefloor stompers, suffer from all the \\"rave\\" trappings of its day including electronic \\"hand claps\\" and \\"siren\\" sounds. Yet, as a whole, the album is so technologically slick and melodically precise that you can't help but be drawn to repeated listenings. Those with patience will be rewarded by Robert Fripp's soaring guitars (Higher Peaks, Throb), and the operatic vocal stylings from Martyn Sharp (Golden Dawn). This album is a sure bet for any electronic dance fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aún peor","review":"Como completista de todo aquello en lo que participa Robert Fripp, compré hace algunos meses el disco \\"4 5 6\\" de The Grid.

There is some great footage of the lads walking around Granville street with a platter of haggis, making people try it before letting them know what the ingredients are - even a beat-cop gets to sample some.One minor complaint I have is that there is no real insert booklet to read through. They should have included some extra info/credits and maybe even pictures but instead left it minimalistic, leaving curious fans wanting more.Overall, if you like The Real McKenzies, and their brand of music, you will surely get a kick out of seeing this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Debut","review":"Beth Thornley's first release is a smart, sharp hook-laden collection of fantastic indie-pop songs. She has been a songwriting award finalist multiple times, and desperately deserves a much wider audience. She recalls Liz Phair's musical edginess and Aimee Mann's unsparing lyrical eye. But those are merely resonances in what is a fresh and original voice.

It is a great introduction for beginners; however, it is also an excellent refresher for those familiar with the Labyrinth. As one of the latter, I recently reread it and got many new ideas for walking and for thinking about the Labyrinth differently.This book focuses on how the Labyrinth can be seen as a metaphor for our lives. It explores lessons we can learn and then apply from the Labyrinth. These lessons have to do with living your life and applying spiritual wisdom. Most of the ideas or lessons are questions that you ask yourself and then explore and find the answers to, either on the Labyrinth or off.It is a rich little book, one to be read again and again.*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful,lyrical and sweet","review":"Mr. name is asher lev tells the story of a young Chasidic Jew in Brooklyn who is beginning his lifelong oodyssey of artitic longing and adventure. His parents being good pious people are at times mystified and eventually mortified at the result of his art. Mr. Potok is perhaps my favorite novvelist because he writes ,so well, about things that matter:God,life, children and parents,art fun and love.In this book{which though it stands by itself, should be read with its sequal, THE GIFT OF ASHER LEV},Mr. Potok gets will ionto the creative mind. Asher Lev is faced with the torturous decision of art or conscience{well, family}. His decision and the conclusion remind one of Marc Chagalls white crucifixion. Superb writing,excellent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER SINCE I READ IT","review":"\\"MY NAME IS ASHER LEV\\" WAS A WONDERFUL BOOK! I COULD BARELY PUT IT DOWN. CHAIM POTOK WRITES GREAT BOOKS, YOU CAN ALSO READ \\"THE CHOSEN\\". \\"MY NAME IS ASHER LEV\\" WAS BETTER THOUGH. YOU REALLY BECOME PART OF THE STORY. EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"judaism should have more then one view!","review":"i had to read Asher Lev as my english text book for these exams coming up. i am jewish and believe that this book expressed exaclty what i believe in life. if a person has a talent use it! Asher had that talent and in my opinion he was right to express the way he felt. as he was an artist he could also show the real stress and pain of life. life has defaults which asher always managed to see! his father, even though i dont believe was totally wrong due to his beliefs, i still think he could have supported asher in his work like parents should always do! im not saying that asher is an angel, byt he had to do things that he felt strongly for. even though im a jew i agree 100% with Asher Lev,..............a boy with such talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, yet Irritating","review":"I am a non-observant Jew, so I found this book, which delves into the world of the Ladover Hasidim very interesting. As an artist, it was amazing to me the lengths some would go to silence another and the strength of will Asher Lew has to perservere and make of himself what he wants. My only criticism would be the use of all the phrases such as: \\"I'm very tired now. I think I'll go to sleep now. Yes. Goodnight.\\" There were so many variations of that line, which didn't serve the plot or the characters at all. It just made them all seem like blindfolded clinically depressed people (which of course they were). Overall, highly recommended, although I preferred The Chosen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Style of Writing","review":"This story took me into a world that I knew very little about. While I don't necessarily understand all of the rules/customs the Hasdics live by, it did take me inside and help to see their side of it better. I would have given the book 5 stars except that I felt like there was too much description of some of the painting and painting methods Asher used. However it was quite entertaining and explored an area that is rarely explored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden, cold, stilted","review":"This story is about a little Jewish boy, Asher Lev, who is from a severely conservative Hasidic family and neighborhood in New York.At a very early age, he becomes obsessed with drawing and he is exceptionally good. Long story short - he's an artistic prodigy, which disturbs his parents to no end because they believe art to be anti-Jewish and a sin.Asher said the world was not pretty and he wouldn't paint it pretty and, boy, he didn't. I think the moral of the story is that sometimes, when you choose your own path, it hurts people.My biggest complaint about this book is that the boy was so wooden and unlikable. He talked in monosyllables, if he talked at all. His personality was cold and stilted and his mother's personality was just as unrealistic and empty.I do not understand why people loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, unrealistic waste of time","review":"I don't understand why there are so many people who liked this book. It's depressing, and gives a warped look into the life of Hasidic Jews, as seen through the eyes of a selfish, spoiled, willful child.There are plenty of reviews here with a synopsis of the story. I simply want to add mine because I wasted my time reading the book. I just kept thinking the story was going to turn around and end happily. Instead at the end of it all, this child has hurt everyone who has loved and supported him--except for his \\"mentor\\" and the gallery owner who became richer off of him. And he departs with the \\"knowledge\\" that he will continue to hurt people, and why? Because he just HAS to paint ugly, tormented feelings. Sick.If I knew nothing of Jews or artists I would walk away from this book thinking they were both twisted, sadistic, selfish and crazy.Don't buy this book, get it at a library if you still want to read it. My copy just went into the trash can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself","review":"Here is my recommendation. DON'T read this book. No, it's not horrible and I didn't cringe when I read it. But neither did I walk away a changed man. The character of Asher is so cold, static, and most importantly immature. The choice Asher makes in the end is in my own opinion the right one of course (especially since religion was the alternative and i hate religion, another factor that added to the insipidity of this book). Yet after being exposed to Asher's thoughts throughout the book, I'm not convinced his ultimate decision was righteous.I'm tempted to just say, \\"read the book so you can see what I mean!!!1\\" but alas, no. You will make the right decision and you will not read this book. Potok's writing is fluid and borderline enjoyable but this does not save the novel from a 1-star rating. Again, the concept behind the book was alright but the deliver, in terms of plot structure and character development, was very unsatisfying for me.My Name Is Asher Lev: A big 1 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Boring Put-you-to-sleep-by-reading-it","review":"I read maybe...3 Chapters of this book in my Act class at school and I found particularily useless.

So after the first 3 chapters I decided to protest by not reading the book. of course I still had to hear people drone on about it twice every six days but still I found it VERY boring. So If you are a parents shopping for your teenage son or daughter this book would not be a good choice.

Asher is an extremely gifted artist growing up in an hasidic community that does not understand nor value his gift. Written in first person, the reader gets a small glimpse of what it might be like to have such a gift and the curses associated with it. Potok brings to the surface so many questions about God, Orthodox Judiasm and Christianity. THe book forces the reader to look at the way you have defined God from a very different perspective. I love a book that makes you think, helps you understand someone else and yourself just a little better. My Name is Asher Lev definately accomplishes that. My book club recently read this book and it is great for discussion. Via the internet, I learned that Asher Lev is the character that Chaim Potok most identifies with and even were able to see a painting that Potok did representing the 2nd crucifixion. I highy recommend this powerful book. Its even better than The Chosen."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Name is Asher Lev","review":"This story was incredible. It really illustrates its purpose and leaves the reader breathless with a feeling of accomplishment. Whoever reads this is connected to Asher and feels his every emotion. You're disturbed by what he's disturbed by, his brief moments of happiness are you respites from unhappiness, you dread what he dreads. Made of the highest quality of writing, My Name is Asher Lev is truly what many have already dubbed it; a 'modern classic'."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book changed my life","review":"it is hard for an american gentile to understand the workings of the Hasidic Jewish community that exist in this country. in this book Potok opened up the wonders of these Jewish communities and translated the mystery behind them for the world to see by the everyday life through the eyes of a child and tracks the effects of this religious life as the child grows into a man. what appealed to me was that this gifted child was filled with all the fears and wonders that everyone feels, and he feels all the love and devotion to the pivital figures in his life the same as everyone else. this is Potok's best and most wonderful example of growing up with an artistic gift, and the passions that possess the spirit as we cultivate that gift. all of this is written in a brutally honest narrative that enthralled me. this is by far and away my favorite of Potok's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meeting an Old Friend","review":"I started enjoying the works of Chaim Potok back in high school, when THE CHOSEN was first made required reading.

So will those who had a problematic relationship with their father."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Name is Asher Lev is powerful and spellbinding.","review":"Chaim Potok truly captures the thoughts of a young boy struggling through adolescents in an extremely religious world. It is written so well, that one can hardly put the book down. Although it is not a quick read, it almost seems like it is since it is so easy to read it quickly. This story is so powerful and dark that one feels as though they are pulled into Asher Lev's world of darkness and fear. While living a Hasidic lifestyle, Asher is thought to be painting for the \\"other side.\\" This other side is so spellbinding that you are there as you read the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is prepared for a serious read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving unsatisfying reading","review":"This book plodded along like it was trying to escape from literary quicksand.

I could smell her breath. \\"I don't like the world, Mama. It's not pretty.

This book gave me a realistic and vivid view of the Ladover Hasidus and the Jewish people in general, as before I knew very little.

While the rack may not look as sturdy as some of the wood racks, this clever and well made wire rack is an excellent alternative as long as you secure the rack to either another rack in a \\"back-to-back\\" fashion or to a wall. In my case, I had enough wall space to attach three of the racks and attach them to the wall studs using two wooden rails for all three racks. The rack holds almost any 750 ml wine bottle. Some odd shaped champagne bottles may either need to be on the top shelf or stored elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Wine Rack. Bad Shipping packaging. Weak wall mount","review":"Sturdy.

Feminists and other man haters will and do despise this book because it makes them look like, well, man haters (rhymes with po-taters). I often go hunting with guys from my church and this book does not look down on that manly habit at all. We even use copies of a book that starts with the letter after J as our sighting in target for 200 yard shots. Works great! You should see the pages fly when we get hits! Perfect use for it!

It tells you to do specific activities that coincide with the paperback book \\"Preparing for Adolescence\\", but it also suggests use with the CD. Then the workbook breaks down each activity to a coinciding page section of the paperback book. In other words if you have the CD you won't know which lessons apply to what. Also, it didn't seem to match up really with what the CD's were discussing.

Charles Laughton is again Captain Bly, but he is outdone by his eldest daughter who successfully stages a mutiny against Laughton's no marriage edict. When she marries Laughton's Casper Milktoast bootmaker and gives him the courage to open his own shop, Laughton faces ruin from the competition and is forced to endure and succumb to his mutinous daughter and her husband. The film is absolutely hilarious, and unlike most British comedies which are either excruciatingly dry, or founded upon lascivious humor. All of the characters are extremely believable and overwhelminly endearing. The movie boasts an absolutely superb script, great acting and great entertainment.Whatever can be done to get this movie restored and released on DVD should be done. Who do we write to AFI? Criterion? Where do we get the addresses?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and useless","review":"I could not have been more exited when this technological marvel arrived.

Since I sent the system back, I will never know. Upon hitting the track,(a 3 mile loop), the GPS system never functioned despite all outward indications of working properly. The heart monitor would lose signals for moments at at time. Before my next run, I sat down and went through the instructions again to make sure I was not doing anything wrong. I took the system out for a second and third run and had the same results.

There is no information available to contact KB, so it's off the FTC and BBB I go. If there were a 1/2 star rating, I'd give it to the JamIt (rhymes with what I said when I saw the bounced check charge on my bank statement) for their poor customer service alone, not to mention the shoddy piece of equipment that was barely worth the $.32 to mail the rebate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay far away from this, you don't get what you pay for","review":"Well, I guess it's for kids.

You must rely on your wits and imagination if you want to get back home. Along the way, you'll meet familiar faces wrapped in a shadow of evil. Humpty Dumpty rules with an iron (..err... eggshelly?) fist, Cinderella has gained a taste for the sadism once pushed on her, and the Big Bad Wolf isn't the only one with fangs anymore.Designed to be played as a mini-campaign (the character levels are capped at 6), Grimm would be a perfect introduction for adult heroes in a d20 Modern campaign.

I love how she talks about the perfect being, selected just for you, will come when the time is right, without sounding preachy or saying \\"just relax and it will happen!\\" like everyone in life seems to like to tell you.

The first night we set it up we had an awesome rain and wind storm at the beach and I felt very safe in the tent.It was easy to set up .It fit back in its included bag.My only negative was the zipper on the door was tight. But I am sure it will streach out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This is a great tent. Because my husband is over 6ft tall we wanted to get a tent that was comfortable to stand up in. It has pockets inside and additional attachments for the corners and a gear loft. Set up is easy, best with at least two people. If you get the Eureka floor saver that's made for this tent (Large Square) you'll have to cut it or fold it under so it doesn't stick out from underneath the sides of the tent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tent I can stand up in!","review":"This is a great tent.

The tent is in excellent!!! shape (Always had tarps on the ground and inside on the floor). Recently, the waterproofing started to break down and the fabric has become sticky. I contacted Eureka and they will not replace or recoat the fabrics as they said it is part of the natural breakdown of the fabric's waterproofing and not covered under their warranty. Their warranty makes reference to not covering wear and tear and exposure type defects but my tent has been \\"stored indoors in the original bag\\". Ahh, says Eureka, the tent has been stored in it's original bag and that accelerates the breakdown hence they are not responsible. To bad the bag does not say somethng like \\"do not store tent in bag\\"Bottom line, great tent but don't expect much from their warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"The actual interior dimensions of this tent are 9 feet by 9 feet, not 11 by 11 as we were led to believe.

With duffel bags and winter coats for fall camping we have no room to maneuver. As we are now going to be a family of 6 we'll need to upgrade.However, we've had this tent for 10 years and it has served us well, rarely leaked. Once when we had a lantern hanging it pooled water and leaked. The zipper never snagged. This year, however, a pole broke. We don't like the way the poles don't stay engaged while we are assembling the tent."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you hear ain't what you get!","review":"Be careful when you sample this CD! It is not the blues CD that is sampled. It is an okay comedy CD. I might have liked it if it was what I expected in my order, but I thought I was ordering a great sounding blues CD not a couple of clowns singing about Elvis' smell and polka dot undies. I enjoy a good laugh as much as anyone, but not when I expect the blues. I would still like to find out what the sampled CD is and purchase it! The picture of the CD cover is correct but the songs listed for the sample section are not!---Since this review I have found this disc. It is Lightnin' Hopkins Rising Sun Collection.

This served that purpose but was more trouble than it was worth. The player itself was fine, good sound quality and light weight, but the software was horrible. I had to reinstall it at least once every time I went to load new songs. It rarely recognized my MMC and when it did, it didn't see all the available memory. After I purchased it the first time, I thought I had just gotten a lemon. So, I took it back and got another one. Soon it was doing the same thing again.

The company says you can get an hour of music but only if you record at a... 32kps. speaking of sound, the headphones are... earbuds that hurt after listening for about 5 min. Even when you replace those with good headphones, The sound quality is very poor. It is definatly not loud enough. At the loudest level you can barely hear it.

We are now into the 3rd series and the characters are well established. I still miss the father of the cop character from the first season , but other than that you have a fine ensemble cast. In this one 'audrey' must stop a troubled person from killing off people by drowning them. Is that person evil or is it not their fault that their trouble is killing people off? You never know with this show , as the mystery has played out over the seasons we learn more but there is still more to learn. Which is a good thing. I miss the chemistry between the two leads; parker and the cop. And the mysterious new big city detectives storyline is intriguing. But you don't have to have watched all the previous episodes to enjoy this one. the hd looked good on this one.

The installation disk tried to intall a virus on my computer. Thank goodness I had virus protection software running. The tablet works. That's about the best thing I can say about it. You can use it to draw clumsily. I could do just as well with the mouse though. It's hard to get used to how the tablet keeps it's center as the screens center. Much different and more difficult than using a mouse.

However, there are no drivers for OSX (Mac) and I think the same goes for Windows XP. Unfortunately my computer runs all my art programs in OSX. So I'm outta luck. If you use an older system and you want a cheap pen and tablet this is the one to buy...I have to give it only one star for it's lack of drivers for current systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall: functional.","review":"This tablet serves its purpose very well, thats it. Once you start to use it, it loses sensiblity pretty quickly. The plastic sheet that I thought would serve as tracking must be for something else because you just cant see what you are drawing. The cable for the pen is not too bothersome, but I would prefer a wireless one. The tablet looks like a cheap plastic toy. Setup is a little bit of a mess because of wires (a tangle of them) and drivers. In fact, now that I have sold this tablet, Ill settle for a Wacom tablet as I originally intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have done more research...","review":"I bought this tablet because of the cheap price. From what i could tell from the specs it wasn't a bad tablet considering it was [inexpensive]. Well, I now know the reason. The company went bankrupt, I had to do a lot of searching to find the windows 2000 drivers. Some kind person was nice enough to place them on their own website after hearing that the company was no longer supporting the product. I cannot recall the URL unfortunately or else i would have posted it. Works terribly with photoshop. The drawing method is clumsy and not well thought out and the drivers allow for almost no customization. If the shipping didn't cost just about as much as the product itself i would send it back. I suggest anyone looking to get a tablet go with waycom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuitable for any purpose.","review":"The only good thing that can be said about this product is that it easy to install and uninstall. The sensitivity is very inconsistent and tends to either get stuck on clicking on the screen all the time or you need to pound the pen into the board in order to get it to click. It is virtually impossible to draw straight lines, it looks like someone with a severe neurological disorder created the pointer movements on the screen.

The biggest difference is that Darren, the guitarist had taken a much more prominent role in singing and lyrics on this album. Serj is an awesome, original singer in his own right, but this evolves the band into a newer realm - something that most bands can't pull off, but is necessary to survive more than a few albums. I have all the SOAD albums and have been listening to them since before their first radio single. The only problem is that a few songs are so repetetive you are glad they're only a couple minutes long. The interludes and instramentals in most songs are great, and the switch between political statements and songs about loving your \\"****\\" are a crazy, entertaining combo. However, I'd like to see less repetition that reminds me of bad rap sometimes.

Toxicity is one of my favorite Cds. When I heard BYOB on the radio..they were on the \\"everybody goin to the party\\"..part and I freaked when my son told me it was SOAD. Now I think it's one of the best songs ever made. However, being a mom, I'm sensitive to vulgar language and was disappointed with the lyrics of the other songs.

Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mezmerizing way to sellout","review":"This has to be the worst album of their career. It is no way near the quality of Toxicity which I consider one of best albums. I don't understand people can call it the 'best' of S.o.a.D, because it is simply not! Apart from 'Cigaro' and 'Violent Pornography', all the songs have LOST the moshing effect of powerful riffs, destructive drumming and vocal consistency and originality.Speaking of vocals, they are lame, annoying and weak. B.Y.O.B has to be one of the most irritating commercialised song lately that trendies have started listening to. I'm absolutely disappointed because S.o.a.d is my favourite band. I hope their next album has something better to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Supposed To Be A Joke?","review":"Holy s**t, this album must be a joke. The guitar playing totally sucks, and the vocals are just so f**king stupid.

Sorry, but this CD sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus","review":"I could go on for days about how I dislike this album. If you are looking for anything remotely creative, interesting or perhaps different, then this isn't your CD. I think SOAD needs to spend less time whining about politics and more time focusing on making quality music.What is the real joke here? SOAD talks about unfairness, crooked politicans and people just out for money and power. That is pretty funny considering they released an album clocking in at 38 minutes and they are going to release part 2 sometime in November. They could have just made one solid album filled with songs, instead they decided to split the album in 2 essentially doubling their profits. What a bunch of hypocrits."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as toxicity but still great","review":"now, granted this is a really short album, it has good songs and it shows a lil more maturity with some punk influence in it, evident in some songs, maybe i'm the only one that picked up on the punk influence, i dunno but i like the cd...it has its down moments in radio/video and old school hollywood bu.... upsides far outweight the downs. like Question! is a better song, simple yet elegant. B.Y.O.B is a great anti-war song that is one of the harder ones on the cd. Cigaro, which many people don't realize and i didn't until i read the lyrics, is talking about the armenian genocide which is a part of their heritage...just read the lyrics, ya'all will know what i'm talking about. and sad statue is one of the better songs also with a catchy chorus and catchy riffs leaving this cd not as good as toxicity or their selftitled, but still great in it's respects...just hope hypnotize will be longer...."},{"rating":"2","title":"VICIOUS!!!","review":"This is an awesome piece of work! They have really tightened up their sound and its Solid. Every song on here is good. I like bands that sound like no one else and this is one of those bands. Very unique. It surpasses Toxicity and flows from beginning to end. Buy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album So Far","review":"This album has absolutely no lyrical content to it. Most of their songs have very good lyrics but this cd lacks any at all.Also missing is one of the things I like most about SOAD. Besides the hardcore metal they also make some amazing slower songs. eg. Spiders, Atwa, Roulette. Mesmerize does not have a song close to any of those on this album.Hopefully Hypnotize is actually worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST YET","review":"This is the best S-O-A-D CD, It will match or even top Toxicity's sucess. This CD brings out S-O-A-D's true Metal Rootswith lots of speed rifs and great singing by both Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian. Daron Has alot more air time in this CD than in the other ones. A MUST HAVE S-O-A-D CD~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"You know, from reading these reviews, it's quite obvious to me people just don't get these guys.

Oh those were the good old days. This cd is horrific, i feel like i want to cry. Their debut was spectacular, toxicity was subpar(why every one prefers it over their self titled is beyond me)and steal this album was brilliant in some places. What has happened!!! The lyrics are totaly trite. The same line repeated over and over again. I saw byob on the tele and got all worked up, well ive never been so let down in my life. Daron sounds like a whiny prepubecent teenager. I cant stand hes voice. Hes also to blame for the decline in lyrics. Normaly serj's department.

I really like these guys, this band is a great rock band, but their messages just fall short with me.The lead singer's voice is still intense but does not seem to carry the same punch that we saw on Toxicity. The anti-war and anti-corporate messages are felt by many, however, without the wars of past or the corporations of the present, these guys would not even have a job. Toxicity covered a lot of ground and I personally wish they would get back to that format. Still a fan so I'll stick around and see what's coming out from them down the pipe. With the exception of this album I like all of their other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO","review":"Well this cd sucked. I didn't even feel like buying it i just borrowed and then puked into a toliet shortly after. If you like toxicity, then you probable won't like this one because it is nothing like the SOAD that i'm used to. The songs all have good intros then they go all weird and getting really \\"crunchy\\". So if your into smoking a lot of weed then buy this album.

Daron sings on his own more often... and he really shouldn't be, because his voice is nowhere close to Serj. In addition, the lyrics still have the same political/societal message as usual, but they seem much more straightforward than in the past, which is somewhat disappointing. Again, this is probably Daron's fault-- the lyrics to each song were either written entirely by him, or mainly by him, with Serj given secondary credit. For me, it's always been Serj's amazing voice and lyrical skill that defined SOAD, and his diminished presence here really shows. I'm just hoping this is a temporary thing, with Mesmerize being more of a Daron album, and Hypnotize going back to being more Serj.Anyhow, I'd still recommend this CD, if you're a System fan, or anyone else... it's good stuff, but be warned it's not on the same level as the previous albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right case, Wrong CD","review":"Be careful when you order, I ordered this and got the right case, but Hypnotize was inside,not Mezmerize.

It is too political and fans of music don't care what our favorite bands think. America has hurt the pockets of Holywood by not going to see their movies for having such negative political view points about the greatest country in the world. I don't want to see that happen in the music industry. JUST SHUT UP AND SING! Music... it is all we have left... Nothing against SOAD. I loved their first self-titled debut.

These sort of people are worse than those pretentious morons that listen to pretentious indie rocks and think they're being unique by not following popular trends. Well, you're better of listening to Linkin Park because there's the same amount of angst here although these guys seem to have stolen the sound of actual good bands like Estradasphere or In The Flesh and just added tons and tons of angst to the mix for fun because people like angst and they buy a lot of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying!!!!!!!","review":"Very short, whiney, gay-rock at its worst!

Their first album, self titled, was actually really, really awesome.

With a band that started out with high quality lyrics..to be spouting \\"everybody, everybody, everybody sucks\\" and \\"my cock is much bigger than yours\\"...that's just a insult to my appreciation for the band. This album is actually what I consider to be the worst album ever made. It's horrid and for such a talented band..it's a shame to see their talent be wasted on junk like this.

I've seen many new bands that just suck get wide recognition for talentless crap.Though, very rare is it that a band that had a few good albums turn into something that is just awful and get praised for it! SOAD used to be able to write songs that were composed fairly well, but their new album isn't even composed! It sounds like they had a bunch of parts of songs and then smashed them together at random. That's not composision, that's lazyness.This is coming from someone who used to love SOAD. I have every album, I have an unauthorized DVD of their bio, I saw them at Ozzfest. I LOVED this band.But, now they have lost whatever they had going for them.

There are maybe two or three decent songs on this strangely short album, and allowing their guitarist to scream and wail throughout half the album was one of the worst decisions in the history of music. Not only is Serj sidelined, but the lyrics are no longer surreal and political in an interesting-if-stupid way like they were in Toxicity and Steal This Album. Now the lyrics have crossed the line to being just plain stupid. They alternate between banal, uncreative political whining and complete nonsense.Skip this album and hope like hell that Hypnotize turns out better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not Great","review":"This is a simply good album. Although it doesnt compare to Toxicity or the S/T, it brings a more progressive style in the band. Malakian is the main focus on this cd rather than Serj compared to their past material, possibly since he co-produced the cd with Rick Rubin. Expect him on every song because he does get greedy as the backup vocalist. The entire cd is very energetic but don't expect too many stand out songs like from \\"Toxicity.\\" \\"BYOB\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" appear to be the only songs going to get good radio airtime. I am looking forward to \\"Hypnotize\\" where i heard bootlegged live versions of \\"Kill Rock Stars\\" and \\"Holy Mountain\\" which both sound very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Oh man..... Before this album System was one of my favorite bands... This new album angers me... first of all Daron sings WAY too much. His voice sounds like a drowning weasel when compared to Serj.

And short.... 11 songs... 38 min.... why do you need 2 CD's for that many songs? why not put them on one CD? if they have more on the second song... why not release them at once as a dual CD album?CAUSE THEY SOLD OUT....

This disc is MUCH different from System's first two albums. It's much more melodic and clean vocal harmonies are ALL OVER this disc. If you love all of System's releases so far, definitely get this. Basically I consider \\"System of a Down\\" and \\"Toxicity\\" as their old sound. \\"Steal this Album!\\", although b-sides, was a bridge moving towards the sound you hear on \\"Mesmerize.\\"Each song is unique and stands out for its own reasons and the lyrics are top notch SOAD quality as always. The band's points of view can be seen by some as highly offensive, but then seen by others as undoubtedly correct. As always, many of the lyrics are not straightforward about their meanings. You'll have to somewhat \\"read between the lines\\" to understand the meanings of the some of the song. E.g., \\"Cigaro\\" is not really about penis envy.Buy this record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All You Maggots Smoking Fags......","review":"Finally, System puts out a quality cd. I have been a fan since their first material came out, and they seem to be getting better and better. This cd is maybe a little more melodic than their previous efforts, but they still get crazy on a few tracks. All the stanzas blend together well and the short length of the cd makes you put it on repeat. I don't find the guitarist's extra singing all that appealing, but the irony of that is the best track on the cd, \\"Lost in Hollywood\\", features his vocals. The melodies and vocal harmonies are smooth and its always interesting to disect the lyrics to figure out what they're trying to say. Hopefully this band will stick around for a long time to come, because they are getting better with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm now a SOADimite!","review":"I am more of a classic rock fan if anything, so I usually dispise metal, and I put it into the catagory of screaming into a microphone, but System of a Down is different. They mix loud melodic screaming with soft and beautiful sounding breaks in between. Each song is different in it's own way, which sets it apart from most metal. I admit must rock fans won't like, but if you are willing to give different genres a try, I say this is worth listening to if anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Mezmerized","review":"The Lyrical intensity of this CD is awesome, but I wouldn't buy it if I was a die-hard republican, as most of the songs on this cd relate to Bush-Bashing. For you righties, go back to your roots and buy a Garth Brooks CD because Mezmerize is not fo the faint-of heart. Yea, it could be harder. But I don't think that's the point of this CD, it's more of a lyrical intensive cd than a headbanger, although byob is pretty f-in awesome. Not that the musical part isn't good, in fact, it rocks, but don't expect \\"Jet Pilot\\"-like pounding rhythms through all of the songs. Must have in my book"},{"rating":"2","title":"FOur sTars for NewNess","review":"I gave this disc four stars cause I've only had it for Three days, but if my first instinct is correct then this is the best new album I've heard in a while. I love it, it reminds me of the Self Titled album which in my book is their best...not much of a Toxicity fan! I don't agree with it's polotics for the most part but it's about the music and it's some good music. I've read people don't like that Serj doesn't sing as much, well he's a great singer but having Malakain sing only adds depth and slightly different perspective to the music...change is usually good. Grab ya a copy if you like the band or if you just want some good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it LOUDER!!!!!","review":"If you don't like this album, you're not playing it loud enough. There, i've said it.It's music with energy people. It keeps you on your toes and changes tempo a million times!!! No one song really stands out, and, sure, some of the tracks aren't \\"radio friendly\\" but they will grow on you if you aren't close minded to progressive music.THIS COCAINE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IM ON THIS SONGTo clarify, it's not progressive music, it's fun music. you won't know what to think the first time through, but once you listen to it a few times, even the songs you thought you didn't like: you will find yourself head bobbing (thrashing, really)/air drumming/singing along to. You just have to get used to the switches and crazy tempos. Any way about it, the more you listen, the faster your heart goes. Beats the hell out of coffee in the morning. Plus if you play it loud enough and you look like you're \\"enjoying\\" it in your car, people WILL get out of your way. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much Daron!!!!","review":"This CD is awesome but almost every time Daron takes over, I cringe. Serj of course is back to his excellence.

This is the most un-inspred garbage from a band I greatly respected. SOAD's self titled album was GREAT!! Toxicity was pretty damn good, and this is just B.S.!!! What happened to the band with an edge. The band with inspiring deep lyrical content. Why are they singing about partying in the desert? Why do I feel like MTV hypnotized SOAD and convinced them they were the Backstreet Boys? I downloaded this CD to see if it was worth buying, and suprisingly it wasnt even worth the download! Well I still have the older works of a once great band to fill the void that this horrid album has left me with. WTF Happened!!!!!

With all the hard shouting they do the melodic content makes me like the songs even more better than previous albums & that to the chorus in most songs are damn good.As long there will be original music,people will always support u guys & one of them is me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late to the party, having a really good time","review":"To keep it short, I'll break with most of the SOAD fans and say this album, as well as its companion, Hypnotize, contains my favorite music by this band. I was introduced to the entire discography at once and slowly came to realize that the haunting folk harmonies are what really gets me. Most reviews I read malign the prominance of Daron's vocals, but I feel exactly the opposite, which also make me hesitant to grab Serj's solo album. To each his/her own, I guess - but I'm really hoping when they get back from hiatus that they continue in this direction, despite the backlash the band will no doubt incur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I got this CD as an early Christmas present a week ago and can't stop listening to it. What an amazing CD.The music is pounding, frenetic, searing, melodic and jarring all at the same time. The lyrics are satirical, political, sad and nonsensical. Somehow SOAD combine all these elements and make songs that have you banging your head, thinking deeper than maybe you want to and then laughing at some point of silliness.A lot of people are complaining that the guitar player is singing too much on this CD but I liked what he did here. He doesn't have a good voice in the traditional sense but uses it to good effect and it has an odd symbiosis with the lead singer's voice.My favorite songs are B.Y.O.B., Cigaro, Lost Hollywood and maybe the best song on the CD, Sad Statue."},{"rating":"1","title":"System of Who? Daron?","review":"Yes, Daron is a brilliant song writer and i think a musical genius, but why does he feel the need to not let any other member shine? i wonder how that convo went through with the band:Serj: Hey Daron, when we gonna get in the studio? it's been a little while since we've gotten stuff out there...Daron: Oh, uh, yeah. About that. Well, we're releasing an album. In about a week.Serj: Wha? What about the rest of-Daron: Oh, no. dont worry about it. I've got everything covered. I wrote all the tunes and made sure my guitar and whiny vocals overpower everything else on the two records that i've decided to release at separate times to insure maximum profit. Because you know how bad gas prices are these days, and sine I drive a Hummer...Serj: WTF?!?! YOU DID WHAT?!Daron: woah, easy. like i said, dont worry about it. As a matter of fact, i need your help. I need you to come into the studio tomorrow and do some backup vocals for me...I wanna hear SYSTEM OF A DOWN, NOT SYSTEM OF A DARON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of Dorks","review":"These guys are total posers. I DETEST their annoying music that seems to have mulitple personalities. PICK a GENRE!!! What is up with the mix of Heavy metal, Reggae and R&B;?I saw these looooosers on SNL and was amazed at how dorky they were. The lead singer looks like wierd Al Yankovich-seriously, check it out online. You can tell they were probably band geeks in high school. Awful. Just AWFUL>>>>> Really, why'd you make me give them a star. They don't deserve it AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I Have Hate This CD WHY!1. You get a mellowed out version of SOAD.2. This album only features crappy singing.3. You have rated there worst CD is good as the first album which is a classic.4. Mezmerize is not anywhere near as good as any of there other albums.5. Its good to know that SOAD can sell out there fans and get great reviews for it.6. The Lead Singer in this album is the guitarist not the lead singer. You cant understand anything that he sings.7. When the real lead singer sings he is to mellow and sounds like has crack stuck in his nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT compare this crappy band to Faith No More","review":"Faith No More is one of the greatest bands to ever grace this worthless planet. And to compare them to System of a Down is downright preposterous and asinine. It's like comparing William Shakespeare to Dan Brown, I mean, you just can't. So do yourself a favor and buy a Faith No More CD instead, Angel Dust to be exact, and forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yo-Lady-Who?","review":"What are these guys thinking? Are they trying to make a transition like Metallica? After listening to this album after I bought it; I realized that it dosent seem like they will be able to top their last album. Some music you shouldn't have to pay for; this is that album. My advise: DOWNLOAD it instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been protesters instead of musicians!","review":"I'm so sick of bands using their musical status and talents to push political agendas. I used to really like these guys and put up with some of the messages because the music was sick but this album reaches a new low. The music is decent but I can only listen to someone trash my country while they make millions here for so long. I'm sure it will sell millions of copies to the sheeple in our evil capitalist nation and I'm so glad that our troops can have such an inspirational album front and center while they fight the real evil. Good morale for America, but wait where is the song that condemns the terrorists and suicide bombers, I guess that was a hidden track... maybe check a country album for that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You people have your head stuck in your......","review":"Anyway what happened to real music, this is just a bunch of slapped together riffs, much like all of SOAD's albums with a bunch of lyrics that 50% of the time are gibberish and metphors that dont mean anything. Go buy some real music. Nightrage, inflames, Dream Evil, Killswitch enage, Testament, King Diamond, something anything but this waste of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ... freakin ... terrible!","review":"Please do metal fans a favor a do not call this a metal album. It's alternative, no more no less. This band is in the same category as NIN, only not as good, and I hate NIN. I made a big mistake and bought their first two albums. Well ... buying one could be considered a mistake, but buying two ... that's just bad judgement (or stupidity). \\"BYOB\\" has got to be the dumbest song I have heard in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for disappointing us System!","review":"Yah. It's been a few years sense the release of Toxicity and a lot has gone down sense then. 9/11, The invasion of Iraq, the collective re-election of G.Bush. I was expecting more from System of a Down. After hearing their new album I was thuroughly disappointed. I feel so let down, so betrayed. They threw a few songs in there that has some vaguely political lyrics. But for the most part the music sounds like Norwegian Death Metal, and the lyrics are trite! I don't know, maybe I'm too old or too stupid to \\"get it\\", but I like the first album, and after Toxicity and Steel This Album I couldn't weight for next installment of System. But what a disappointment! You really dropped the ball on this one Serj! I hope you like being out-shined by Green-Day. Maybe next time you'll stop being so introspective and technical and get back to what made you infamous in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"-1 star","review":"Is this a joke.

I can sing in the shower (and have) better than the \\"singer\\" of this group. \\"Fingernails on chalkboard\\" would have been a more appropriate name for these guys. BYOB is the song getting the most radio play, AND IT'S TERRIBLE!! Beer, Bombs, whatever the B stands for, really stands for ZERO!

I don't currently live in the states right now so I hadn't heard it on the radio. So 14 dollars later and throwing the cd away brings me here. Don't know a thing they are talking about. How do they talk about rich people in Hollywood when that it what they are. I also recently read an article in entertainment magazine with SOAD and the Mars Volta talking about Prog Rock. This is the worst Prog Rock cd ever. All the songs sound just alike except for the disco sounding song. If you want a new, good Prog Rock cd buy THE MARS VOLTA, FRANCES THE MUTE!!

Wow, imagine that, an album that does more than preach to stupid minded simpletons, ie, the american public in general. This album misses the 5th star, and this is where I agree with some of the other reviews, except, Daron is decent at accenting and backing up Serge, but please don't use him this much again.

The first time I ever heard B.Y.O.B. I honestly thought they'd taken a turn for the worst. But I've always been a big SOAD fan so I decided to go out and buy it before I jumped to any more conclusions. It turns out that this is a pretty solid CD from beginning to end. There was one song that really caught my attention though; \\"Question!\\". This is my favorite song on Mezmerize because it's very well written as far as lyrics go and I love the acoustic guitar on this track. I'm pretty sure the last song they used an acoustic guitar on was \\"Mr. Jack\\" from \\"Steal This Album\\". Anyways, Mezmerize is definitely worth buying, but I definitely suggest that you buy either \\"Toxicity\\" or \\"Steal This Album\\" in addition to this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNclassic","review":"This is what happens when a band goes mainstream.

The song, The Prayer didn't quite work this time around. The Charlette Church and Josh Groban version was better. It seemed that Patti and her husband did not blend too well as a duo.

With use it may stretch out a bit and get easier.The legs do not lock in the open position, and it can get very tipsy very quickly if they are not spread all the way.

The content is vast, the entries are detailed and well-written, and the range of information is amazing -- strongly concentrating on Greek and Roman lore/culture/history but not limited to only that. One could curl up by the fireside and have a great read anytime with this weighty tome. I should note that the binding quality is superior--- a _sewn_ binding, not one merely pasted together with glue--- so you don't have to worry about splitting the spine by opening the book too wide! This publication is a great value, especially in today's economy, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably Cool, but is this stuff Legal?","review":"I got my copy of this two days ago, and have read the whole thing once, and the iPod and Playstation hacks about a dozen times.

If you have a drwer full of gadgets, and aren't afraid of breaking stuff, this is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: This book will consume your free time!","review":"When I ordered this book, I planned to give it to my little brother in the hopes of interesting him in the delightful world of hardware hacking. I didn't expect it to contain anything I hadn't picked up doing E&M research for MIT, or engineering research for the Air Force. However, the things in the book were surprisingly advanced, even for people with experience. There are many excellent ways to kill time in here, and they can even turn out to be useful. They are explained clearly and presented without being intimidating, which makes it perfect for the motivated beginner as well. If you have the basic equipment and the drive, this book is great for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and Overwhelming, But Achievable","review":"Blogging for Dummies innundates your mind with numerous options to select a blogging platform and launch your own space on the net. It's organized into manageable chunks that let you decide how to proceed with confidence.Had I read this book before I launched my blogs, I believe my frustration levels would have been much lower and success much quicker, with fewer problems. The book also reveals beneficial ideas and tools for bloggers, whether new or at the veteran stage.Chapter 8, The Ins and Outs of DIY Blogging, is the only chapter I found more confusing than necessary. While blogging is already a daunting process for some, it needn't be complicated by the technical instructions explained here.The topics of Real Simple Syndication (RSS) and money-making options provide a well-rounded look at this subject.Stay with the book's basic strategies for fast and easy setup, and you'll be blogging in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to get started, well worth buying!","review":"Blogging for Dummies by Brad Hill is a terrific resource for new to moderate bloggers. I've been blogging for almost six months, but I learned an enormous amount of information from Hill's book. His writing is irreverent and witty and full of what you need to know to really make your blog stand out from the crowd. I still have to figure out how to shrink a picture to 50k, but once I get that down, there'll be no stopping me! The book covers Blogger.com, TypePad, Yahoo360, MSN, and several other sites in detail so a new user can jump write in and get a great site going. His instructions are basic and easy to follow, and he addresses the pros and cons of each site well with pictured examples. It had great info for me to get moving, but I think I'll end up purchasing this book, because he has a great deal of info inside for more experienced bloggers who want more control over their sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you are JUST starting out","review":"I decided to start a blog and I know NOTHING about blogging, so I picked up this book. If you are having a difficult time selecting which website to blog with, typepad, wordpress, etc. this book is great to help determine which will best suit your needs!

Otherwise, it's just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"As a beginning blogger, I was disappointed with this book. I generally like the Dummies series and have found them useful and entertaining. This one is not. The author is sarcastic -p. 3 \\"What You're Not to Read - I forbid you to read trashy novels from the supermarket.\\" Really! The information on Blogger doesn't add anything that can't be found on Blogger help screens. Several blogging services, for example Edublog, are not mentioned at all. Last, The Part of Tens was not as neat as in most of the Dummies books. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good or deep enough","review":"I have already put my comments into Blad's blog. The book, though well written, is too shallow. This is a pity as blogging could be very effective. Instead of telling us how to do the simplest of thing, which we could pick up in a few minutes in front of a PC, a deeper exploration of how to effecitvely use blogs would have really helped.Brad makes a big deal out of using photos in Wordpress. I found it straightforward: all I did was upload the photo and drag it into the post box, thus having it in both open boxes. Although I did not expect a lot out of this book, I did expect a little more. Loks like I will have to put this book on the shelf and spend time trawling Wordpress information sites. This defeats the purpose of buying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not this dumb","review":"This book provides a very basic overview of blogging for someone who has very little knowledge. It does not really tell you how to do it and provides very little information about how to use the any of the available software. On the other hand, it gives a lot of information about relatively esoteric functions such as RSS syndication, trackback links, audioblogging, etc. It does not offer a consistent approach to the subject but seems to go where the author's interests take him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Maintenance Practices Make For Dangerous Travel: A True Story","review":"This movie is well done and captures the beauty of aviation as well as getting the technical details right.

More people in development and IT need to read books like this. I like how it focuses on ASP.NET - the language that a large portion of Web applications are developed in today. The book covers the important areas of securing applications and shows some good examples. Appendix A also has some good ASP.NET code samples for real-world concerns.I especially like the coverage on authentication mechanisms which is something that's often taken for granted by developers but where I tend to find a lot of the weaknesses in the work I do. Plus it doesn't just focus on the technical side of things with the coverage of users awareness and policies. Overall, very good at covering the root of many of our security problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bargain","review":"I first saw this book at a friends who had gone to a seminar and purchased it.

It's that simple.The only issue is getting it out of the truck cause it weighs about 250 pounds when full. I bought an ATV ramp and just wheel it down that. It works like a charm.

Having grown up in Bakersfield, and now in law enforcement in another state, I found the book hard to put down. If some of the key facts in the book are true, Dunn should not have been convicted of murdering his wife. However, it is highly possible that the author skewed the facts to fit his own preconceived conclussion. Who really knows the truth? I am not foolish enough to believe the author was unbiased nor am I foolish enough to believe that Justice is always fair. I have found that the truth usually lies somewhere in the middle. Seldom are things black or white, mostly shades of gray. I would like to have been on that jury. I hope that an innocent man is not sitting in prison for a crime he did not commit. The book is very well written. Factual? Who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Superb Book","review":"Edward Humes is a member of a vanishing breed -- crime journalists who deal in facts, who don't make it up, who refuse to invent quotes, who don't substitute their own flights of fancy for the hard dogged job of research. MEAN JUSTICE is a classic of a fading genre. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in crime, justice, journalism and plain old-fashioned good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too true to leave my name!","review":"I would love to leave my name, but since I live near Kern County, I think it would be unwise. The author shares with us a dreadful story of how poor detective work, coupled with an over-zealous D.A., compromised our justice system and put a likely innocent man in jail. This book is a must read for every American: Let's just hope that Bakersfield has the courage to get the D.A. out of office and start with someone who believes in law and order; not just order."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided view of Kern County","review":"Humes hopes that we will accept this book as the final word on justice in Kern County, but it is not. A rebuttal has been posted on the District Attorney's Web page. The rebuttal, Humes writes, \\"failed to respond directly to most key issues raised in the book.\\" (paperback, page 510)This is untrue, because the rebuttal actually addresses all of Humes' important points, and rebuts many errors. It is a shame that Humes avoids any further discussion. On the book's own Web page, with more than eighty links, there is no reference, and no link, to the rebuttal.I read this book hoping for scholarship, but it turned out to be issue advocacy, and pretty sloppy advocacy at that. Prosecutorial misconduct is a major issue, an issue that deserves a better book than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminals Unite!!!","review":"Finally, a book where all of Kern County's criminals can gather around and bemoan \\"unique\\" tales of \\"injustice.\\" Everyone knows that the State prisons are full of \\"innocent\\" men and women. I cannot tell you how many times I have heard how convicted felons were \\"wrongfully\\" accused and/or prosecuted. However, just because people do not want to accept the consequences of their criminal conduct does not mean this book is either true or accurate. Just because one of the leading characters, Patrick Dunn, a convicted murderer, would rather get out of prison, does not make this book true or accurate. I, for one, like it when convicted criminals are behind bars; it makes me feel safe. This book does an injustice to the community of Bakersfield by creating a false sense of hysteria where none exists. It just seems ironic, though not at all surprising, that this book would find support from Kern County's convicted and admitted criminals; dare I say only the \\"innocent\\" convicted crimiunals?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, but not a good book","review":"This could have been a good book if the private investigator (Laura Lawhon?) had written it. I found it to be very repetitive. I also did not care to read about all the other cases. I wish it would have had pictures (most true crime books do)--it makes it more interesting to see who I'm reading about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Research = Sensationalistic Reading","review":"Whereas this book reads quite well it is perhaps better labeled as fiction. Having first hand knowledge of many of the described events, it sadly seems that selling books has become more important than factual accuracy.

That should make for an interesting counter-point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Phone on paper... only","review":"This phone looks reasonably good in appearance and on paper except that not much really works... hands-free feature never worked and after a week even with the new batteries, the LCD only works when you pick up the receiver, which makes all the other cool features like calculator pretty useless.

It worked great for about 8 months and now I can hardly dial out. The numbers in the middle section (2, 5, 8, and 0) are completely dysfunctional, so the calculator won't work either. Dialing out is a real nightmare; the keys get either stuck, dial doubles, or simply don't work. It takes at least 10 tries to just dial a number.

The only good thing about it really, is the tiny poster and the fact that they do give a lot of history about Reznor, its just that the British woman's voice gets really, really boring and difficult to listen to for the entire 57 minutes especially when someone such as myself has ADD.

The author focuses more on the evolving British blues scenes and Mayall's proteges (Clapton, Green) then he does on Mayall. I suspected that the author never talked to Mayall and this was confirmed when I asked Mayall after one of his recent shows to sign the book.

The idea behind the movie is nothing new but with Sissy, I thought it would be special. Markham is terrible, so unconvincing, the dialogue is bland and the introduction of Markham's friend is nothing more than a diversion from what should have been more development of the relationship between Sissy and Markham, I guess the writers didn't know how to handle that. Sissy is, as always, a delight to watch and with better support from a co-star and better dialogue, her performance would have been much better. She had to have known she was trying to carry a lame story all by herself. The ending was pure Hollywood sappiness. Why in the world would anyone think the 2 of them would make it as a couple?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ginger in the Morning equals sleep at night!","review":"A dull movie with little meaning and point. I am sort of disappointed in Sissy for this role. She is usually seen with her acting top-notch and performances at their peak.

A hitchhiker (Spacek) is picked up by a buisinessman (Monte Markham) and they fall for each other. In fact, Spacek falls for his drunken friend at one point.This movie lacks energy, pace, and an interesting plot. I would recommend this film only to those who are absolutely obsessed with Sissy Spacek (or any other of the characters) or those who just want to kill time, or money.On the brief pro side, the music is fairly listenable...for the most part..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland At Best...","review":"This movie is like spending time with four people you're not really crazy about, but you're stuck with them for the time being, & can't wait to get away.

By the time I got through this book, I was skipping lots of repetition from prior chapters.I agree that there was too much focus on the worst case. Conversely, the writer may feel that he received solace from his religious beliefs, but I felt like he tried too hard to push that while being soft on useful facts.I did think this was an improvement over the first book, as it didn't focus so much on Barr's own case, but I'm still looking for something more useful out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the informal chatty style of wrting and the recipes are pretty good too","review":"Chatty, warm and friendly this cookbook tells about how to cook and save money while never giving up on flavor.

She was apparently better known for her lives-of-saints books, but this mystery is right up there with many from more well known authors. The main characters are well drawn and the suspense is palpable. The silly young woman who will not tell of her very rational fear for her life is the cause of much plot twisting (including a few murders and attempted murders), but the best characters are the Mother Superior and the sheriff, both fleshed out with real personalities, worries, qualities and both very sympathetic characters.

How about the parent gets some therapy if they can't control their emotions? She's not a bad therapist but I would NOT take her advice regarding children! Additionally this therapist had no moral issues with omitting specific records about my son to his therapist because she disagreed with two other therapists regarding my son's condition.

The Road Taken is a great history lesson for poeple how would like to take it another level."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special...","review":"My unhappiness with this novel comes from its rather too obvious historical/sociological research (inserted in great dollops throughout) and the shallowness of the characters. The story such as it is moves along at a steady pace but in the end does not say a great deal. It's a bit like a popular 20th century history (event after event) seen through the eyes of not very significant people. Compared with the witty, observant family-centered novels of authors like Nancy Clark, Jonathan Franzen or George Hagen, this is minor stuff, the sort of novel you buy in a remainder book shop (which is where I bought my copy) and maybe read on a plane.

Overall, the book isn't so bad. There were some great moments such as Batman and Nightwing teaming together, Robin's dreams, and... I guess that's it. There were so many letdowns mainly because each writer seems to want to steer the story to his own direction rather than work as a whole. Major letdowns are the supposed major roles played by the Penguin and Poison Ivy, the quest for the plague cure, the annoying involvement of Catwoman and the resolution of the story. I had expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly mish-mash","review":"This is essentially what you get if you take an essentially decent idea for a Batman story and then spread it over about seven different comics belonging to four different characters, and several writers and artists.

I'm only thirteen, and I can't even remember such a time. It's wonderful, so simple and whisical and true to life, so real.

Vince and EG Ratcliffe did the programming and you can hear the Vince Clarke influence on the sound, but this is very much Marlows record.My favourite songs on here are Calling All Destroyers, The Face Of Dorian Gray (the video is also included here) and Claudette - a World War II ballad set in France.I have no idea why this was never released at the time, I'm just glad I had the opportunity to get it now. I haven't stopped playing it for the last 2 weeks.Now who on earth is Peter Hewson (mentioned in the liner notes) ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite","review":"I am a huge Depeche Mode, and I enjoy Vince Clarke's other work with Yaz (Yazoo) and Erasure. His contribution as producer is what drew me to this album. Based on his other work, it's not up to snuff. The synths are good but the songs and vocals lack whatever it is that makes songs listen-able. This one comes out mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprised it got great reviews","review":"I ordered this because of all the great reviews - but now I'm wondering why. Mine arrived dented (and it seems to dent very easily) and overall it seems like cheap Chinese junk. I might be happy if I only paid a dollar - but honestly at this price I find it hard to say much that is positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the use intended!","review":"This is much cheaper than buying a double broiler which is missing since our kitchen remodel. I like the grooves, since it will fit in different size pans! Definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay for peppermint bark!","review":"This double boiler is exactly what I was looking for! It's so incredibly convenient -- fits in just about any sized pan you want to use -- and the chocolate I was melting to make peppermint bark turned out GREAT! I would highly recommend this product for anyone who doesn't want to buy an entire double boiler but still wants to make melted chocolate goodness. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"I was looking for a handy, cheap and not-very-big double boiler. This seemed like the best option, and so it was. I already used it and I am very happy because it requires only very little space to store it. The material is very good, and for some recipes this is very important, because you have to use the water underneath, so you have to be sure that it is very clean. All the other options I found might be fancier, but also more expensive and bulkier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, but it gets the job done","review":"Every Christmas I make goodies for my husband and his co-workers. Chocolate/white chocolate pretzels are one of their favorites. I ordered two of these and they worked great. Small, but enough for my needs. No burning or scorching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for occasional use","review":"This was great for melting chocolate for my Christmas candy! It was a bit difficult to scrape it all out of the ridges, but I think a rubber spatula would do the trick. It was also hard to hold it still since I was constantly stirring. If it had a handle that didn't conduct heat, this boiler would be perfect. However, If you're planning on using a double boiler more than once or twice a month, I would recommend investing in the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"This is supposed to be a universal double boiler, but it's hard to use because it fits no pan well -- making it hard to stir, and giving you a limited \\"surface area\\" for use. Also, due to it's curved bottom, it won't stand up on its own if you remove it from the \\"boiling\\" pan (to set beside you as you mold candy, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves the purpose","review":"I bought this b/c my new pot & pan set did not come with a dbl broiler. It was cheaper to buy this dbl broiler than buying the next larger pot/pan set. This product serves the purpose! I cook/bake a lot. For the times I need a dbl broiler, this works just fine. Granted, it doesn't sit as tight as a \\"true\\" dbl broiler but it doesn't move or tip either. I have to use a pot holder when I am stirring, which is no big deal. As another review noted, you can't sit it down b/c of the rounded bottom. All I do is sit it in another pot from my cabinet. There is a hole if you want to hang it. I store mine inside of the pot I use it for, put a paper towel down, then the pot lid upside down inside of it. I don't have much storage space yet this works for me. Very easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This thing is a lot deeper than it looks on this photo. But that is good so that it can dip down into the pot with the water. I used this to make chocolate covered strawberries. Worked great.

And most of those quite expensive. This item was very reasonably priced and works with several of the pots I already have, allowing me the function of a double boiler w/o filling up the storage space with an entire new pot.It fits and works as you want it to, the rounded bottom is excellent for small jobs and whisking. Clean up is a snap with the non-stick coating as well. Just remember to use a non-metal whisk to avoid scratching the surface. I bought one from Amazon at the same time and am pleased with that as well. Good feel and function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"This is a great idea and well realized. Excellent for reheating sauces and dishes like chicken-a-la-king,beef bourguignon, doing slow scrambled eggs. Non stick feature is great. Fits several size sauce pans.Very useful.Wish I had found it years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly non-stick","review":"I have used this pan for eggs a couple of times and when I add a little cheese to the mix it took a lot to clean it off. Yes, I did coat with oil prior to use. Probably will not use much anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with purchase!","review":"I have been looking for a double boiler. As we are all aware this is not something you would want to spend $50 on unless you were going to use it alot. That is not my case. A banana pudding here and there is about it. It works GREAT and I saved lots of money on the purchase. As far as storage goes, I don't have to worry about finding a spot for another pan I just put this on top of my strainer and it stores as easy as it fits in the pan to cook in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I purchased this double boiler so that I could dip pretzels in chocolate. I've tried setting other pots or bowls inside of pots I already have, but many times water has gotten into the food, ruining everything. This Nordic Ware Universal 8 cup double boiler works with pretty much every size pot I own. It's also easy to clean and store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentary for addictions group","review":"I use this documentary in my substance abuse recovery group.

This particular model is new to me. The action and power is perfect for what it's made to do. It's limber enough to use on smaller species and with heavier line it's got enough backbone to haul in bigger fish.

I spoke with customer support no less than 5 times and received about 10 emails from them explaining what to do to fix the problem.

It was one of the textbooks highly recommended during the first days of my residency. I received this product today expecting to replace my printed 3rd edition. While the software has the pictures you expect to see in Zitelli, it appears to be lacking in text. I have emailed the software company to see if is indeed the intent. If this program is only supposed to have the pictures with only the legends as text, then this program can not serve as a replacement for the textbook. If there is no text, then it should be clearly indicated that the majority of text found in the printed version is lacking. Those who own the book might assume (as I did) that the software version would have everything the printed text has. If there is no text, pricing this product at twice the printed text with less than half of the material makes this product unworthy of purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware!","review":"This CD is simply great.It's true that EVERY song seems to become imbedded in your mind at one point or another and you find yourself whistling, humming and singing them at any point of the day.

He had a very popular hit single, Bella, from the CD titled \\"LORENZO 1997 - L'ABERGO\\". I was immediately attracted to his style and bought the CD before leaving for the States. Much like L'Albergo, I was pleasantly suprised with the wide range of styles found on the 90-95 collection. He is a master at blending rap with crisp brass and rythmic African beats, with a mellow ballad or two thrown in. The CD is a treat the first time through and will grow on you the more you listen.A must for any International Alternative music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of today's most creative artists","review":"This is one of, if the not the best, CD I own. I fell in love with Jovanotti in 94 when his \\"Lorenzo 1994\\" album came out, and since bought all his albums, older and newest, and they are all my favourites. In this compilation you will find a mix of many styles, ranging from pure old-school hip-hop to pop, cutting through funk, jazz, reggae and world music. In addition to his beautiful music, Jovanotti has some of the best and most meaningful lyrics I have ever heard. If you don't speak Italian, it is a big loss, but I am sure you will be able to appreciate the music nevertheless since it is, for lack of a better description, all but perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chance Back In Romance","review":"I must say this album is a great album, not only does it give romantics a chance to remember the ups and downs about their love lives, they are able to imagine and fall in love again.

I'd just like to make a few remarks to the other review here displayed: Piazzolla mentor in the 50's, when he went to Paris, was NADIA Boulanger; and kilombo does not mean whorehouse, it's an african word used to describe the fortified villages formed by black slaves that fled from their masters in colonial times in South America, it was a place of resistance where they fought attempts to be reduced again to servitude. Actually the original pre-Piazzolla tango was the musical style that received the influence of Buenos Aires waterfront life and its numerous bordellos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old for new computers!","review":"If you are thinking of buying this product be sure to check to see if your computer is compatible. We have a Mac OS X and the Tortoise and the Hare is too old a program for it. As far as we can tell it runs only on version 7. Don't be mislead by the fact that is says for Mac versions 7 or higher on the case, it is not true and I suspect it will be a similar situation for computers running Windows."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums","review":"Listenning to hard rock and new wave in the early 80s who would have guessed that TOTO IV, would have such an impact on me. The record flows consistantly from begining to end like the story of a crazed manic lover. The excellent guitar riffs and complex yet inspired melodies still bring chills to my spine. It reminds me of that first love and those powerful emotions and energy that I experienced at that time in my life. I was pleasantly surprised when it won best album of the year. The only album I like better is Prince's Purple Rain. Don't much care for most of Toto's other work however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic '80s pop rock","review":"Overall, Toto IV is great music, no bones about it. It covers the entire range of emotion, from heartbreak to exuberance. I feel these guys were severely underrated in the '80s (even I admit I underrated my review of their album \\"Turn Back\\"). However, I must say the second half of Toto IV (except for \\"Africa\\") is a little slow and the songs don't hold my interest nearly as much as the first side. \\"Rosanna\\" goes on my list of the 25 best pop songs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget CD, the 5.1 SACD renders the definitive experience of Toto IV","review":"I have the original vinyl pressing of Toto IV and I also have the SACD multi-channel pressing of Toto IV.Here's a fact - the multi-channel area of the SACD is richer, crisper and fuller than the vinyl. What a beautiful job Elliot Schriner has done with this recording, as he also has done with the REM - Out Of Time DVD-Audio and the DTS 5.1 release of Sting's Brand New Day.Absolutely gorgeous. The last reviewer of this item was obviously not listening to the SACD portion of the disc. If you have an SACD compatible player I can highly recommend this item.EDIT Mar/2009 - having since replaced the record player I have to now note that the vinyl is really fantastic, but the multi-channel layer is where this release excels and as such I will find myself continuing to choose the SACD over the vinyl. ES' surround mixes are just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest works of all time!","review":"TOTO is without a doubt one of the most talented and gifted bands of our time, and TOTO IV is nothing short of a masterpiece! The precision musicianship is only the beginning. The orchestration and engineering are without equal in the anals of popular music. My favorite track is 'I Won't Hold You Back'. The chorus fade at the end is enough to leave you with tears in your eyes. Study the lyrics and listen with your heart. It may have been Toto's fourth album, but IV is number one with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Toto's Best","review":"I am not great at writing reviews, but I will try my best. This is one of Toto's best albums. The fusion rock sound is great with the talent of this band. Toto has always had this jazz fusion and rock sound. They harmonize very well together. There are a lot of hits from this CD including \\"Rosanna\\" and \\"Africa\\". \\"I Won't Hold You Back\\" is also a song will you will recognize. Overall this is a really good CD. If you are a music fan of any kind you should own this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE...there's a multi-channel version available","review":"I give this SACD version just one star because there's an updated version in SACD that happens to be multi-channel, whereas this is just STEREO. I don't find much reason to have this one, or any stereo SACDS for that matter, cause the change from the CD is not worth it. So there's no reason for you to have this SACD version instead of the Multi-channel, except of course, if you have your player hooked to a stereo amplifier. But even then, you will miss the slightly different sound that the songs have because of the new mixing in the Multi-Channel SACD. It's a little more expensive, but is better. Just look for it here in Amazon. THE SOUND IS COMPLETELY AMAZING ! NOTE: look for it under \\"TOTO\\" in \\"POPULAR MUSIC\\". For some reason, the M.CH.TOTO IV is not listed in the search list of SACD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic album now even better in surround, high res.","review":"This is a great album and an excellent reissue in high resolution surround sound. I've enjoyed discovering it all over again in this wonderful new format. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A teens review","review":"Toto IV is one of the best albums ever made!!! This one and Toto's first album are the best ones they made! Every song on here is catchy except for It's a feeling. That song isn't quite as good as the rest. Rosanna is wonderful in every way. The instruments go well with the fabulous vocals of the guys in toto. \\"We Made it\\" shows just how wonderful Bobby Kimball's voice is! He definately has one of the greatest voices of all time! You will feel like you have gone to heaven when you listen to his voice! Buy this album if you like 80s pop/rock! This is a chance of a lifetime that you can't pass up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This is the best TOTO album they made and is an essential belonging in somebody who likes music's collection. It's from 1.982 and its production -to my point- made it an essential one in the following music production from the 80's.This is where Toto sounded like an armonyzed orchestra. The songs and maybe more important, the arrangements marked the sound of the following years... You could listen different artists in following years, 84, 85...and quality then meaned to sound like Toto IV. I never understood the absolute change of pace and sound that marked the following FARENHEIT and ISOLATION -although this was a good one-. In TOTO IV they found the sound they were always looking for in Toto, Hydra and Turn Back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toto rox my sox!","review":"I really don't have that much to say but my family bought this album as an LP from a Thrift store for a dollar and it has become one of my favorite ablums. At first I only listened to side 2 (Afraid of Love-Africa) But a few months ago I flipped it and fell in love with that side too. I can't get enought of this album! I'm going to wear down the needle with how much I listen to it O_o So yeah, it's an awesome record and I'm glad it was in the bin so we could pick it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the tracks are good, but CD is boring as a whole","review":"I remember when \\"Toto IV\\" was one of those albums everybody had to get, or at least was familiar with because of the radio play. So it was a favorite at the dances. \\"Rosanna\\" still resonates as perhaps the group's best song on any disc, and \\"Africa\\" was a lot of fun, too, for a while. Otherwise, what is there? Overall, this is a collection of unremarkable songs that start out OK, but become repetitive after about the first minute or so. \\"Afraid of Love\\" is the only other song that stands repeated listening. Tracks 3 and 7 work if you're in the right mood to put up with the lyrics, but that's about it. \\"Hydra\\" still stands as the group's most interesting album, in my opinion, even though it's pretty much overlooked and gets mixed reviews. It only produced one Top 40 single but, where \\"Toto IV\\" fails to be anything memorable after the first song ends, \\"Hydra\\" succeeds as an entire CD worth listening to repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Hits With Nothing In Between","review":"\\"Toto IV\\" can be summed up pretty simply. The album kicks off with the massive hit \\"Rosanna,\\" and concludes with another massive hit, \\"Africa.\\" In between it contains scarcely a song worth hearing. The strong pop hooks that make the two hits so appealing are utterly absent. The rest is merely midtempo filler material that no one other than an ardent fan will likely ever want to hear more than once. This stuff is the very difinition of soulless professionalism.Still, there are those two big hits, and given that Toto's only other successful single was \\"Hold the Line\\" from their first album, buying \\"Toto IV\\" makes almost as much sense as buying the band's greatest hits album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done Collection Of Songs","review":"This is my favorite album from Toto. They did a great job on this album. This is one of those rare albums that doesn't have any filler, and every song stands on its own. The musicanship is great and very tight. My favorites are \\"Africa,\\" \\"I Won't Hold You Back,\\" and \\"Make Believe.\\" \\"I Won't Hold You Back,\\" is a classic ballad with great vocals from Steve Lukather. Toto's best album.

To young people with no prior knowledge of politics, this book can be very influential, with inaccrate portrayals of many key events and Constitutional Amendments. An example is the extremely biased interpretations of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. For every clause and amendment, this book gives its own opinions of what it means. One blatant example is how it says the \\"militia\\" in the Constitution is the \\"National Guard\\" today.

The Onkyo had better sound, more inputs and outputs, and a 3 disc changer (as opposed to single), plus it looked sharp. The sound is great across many music types (classical, jazz, electronica) and has the power to fill a good sized living room with rich music.

I was dismayed to learn upon reading the manuals that accessory units of a CD Recorder and a Cassette Deck were available only in European markets, not in the USA or Canada. [I have over 500 cassette tapes of recordings of opera from the radio which I would like to find an easy way to record over to CD's.] Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the AM/FM radio and CD changer.

I've been a Maria McKee fan for 15 years-yet after one listening I sold this CD to the used-CD store up the street. The album is a mess-its mood is inconsistent and its lyrics uninteresting. And Mckee's voice, so lovely, is little more then background noise. What happened to the Maria Mckee that appeared in her first solo albums-the southern savant with the haunting voice? This is an unmotivated offering from a woman who can belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.....What a mess","review":"I will start by saying that there was a time when I thought anything this woman wrote or sang was gold. I have listened to this album three times now and, at best, it is sounds like \\"B\\" sides and throw aways from other efforts. A few times, I thought I was listening to a bad lounge act. Maria, you can do much more! I wanted badly to like this album.

Put in everything but the kitchen sink! The overboard production takes away from Maria Mckee's beautiful voice, artistry, and mystic. True genius knows restraint and that's not demonstrated here. I guess he never heard \\"less is more\\", especially on his bass playing which totally takes center stage on this record. I'm a big fan of Maria's and think a different producer on this project would have really been a better choice. Some good songs, some great moments, if again you can hear past the \\"notice me\\" production. Don't get me wrong there are some great moments, but those are quite dirivitive of lots of obvious acts.Still worth a listen though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's missing...","review":"I remember the hype surrounding the first Lone Justice album back in the 80's. It took me a long time to listen to the entire album, but there was something about it that drew me in and made me a fan of Maria's voice and the songs. This continued through her first two solo albums; I enjoyed the changes in the music and found all of the albums most enjoyable.That has really changed in \\"High Dive\\" -- I don't care for the album at all. Maria's voice is as beautiful as ever, but I just don't get into the songs. When listening I can't escape the feeling that all of the music was recorded elsewhere, and she's just singing on top of it; the emotion just doesn't come through. My wife commented that it sounded like a soundtrack for a Broadway musical or something; not bad in its own right but not what she (or I) in general want to listen to.It's not likely I'll be playing this CD very much. I hope her next effort will be little (if anything) like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maria's best since her debut album","review":"For those that found High Dive to be too dense (sort of speaking) they need to revisit and replay which is probably Maria's masterpiece, along with her self-titled classic debut solo album. It takes a couple of listenings to really get into the groove of this gems. I definitely like the strings and horns arrangements along with the whole band sound. This is a remarkable disc that really deserves to get more attention and more audience.

About the only good things I can recommend about this film are the creature makeup and the fact that Tyler Mane is probably using this movie as acting practice to reprise Sabertooth with many more speaking lines in either an X-Men sequel or a Wolverine spinoff movie.

The material I like in Lang's book is in the second and third chapters, where he proves results like estimating the number of integers so that certain remainders modulo 1 are less than a certain size, or estimating the sum of reciprocals of remainders. However I'm not happy with the proofs that I've read in detail, like the lemma on p. 39. A careful reader can probably rewrite most proofs in the book to make them understandable. Lang tries to avoid writing out some ugly details that would really help someone unfamiliar with the subject understand the proofs.

I recommend my patients read this book and follow the authors' dietary guidelines."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All In The Diet","review":"As usual, Jack Challam's scholarship is excellent. Challem (and company) present a well-researched look at one of the most common health conditions of the 20th and 21st centuries, based on the American diet. I'm pleased to see solutions to the dietary problems outlined in the text, solutions that will be easy for the interested listener to follow. For example, correlating mineral deficiencies with metabolic imbalances is good scholarship and good clinical practice. Readers should take the book, and the advice, seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great understanding on insulin resistance and sound strategy","review":"I have type two diabetes and have found this book helpful.

Also, I would recommend following the nutrient guidelines on antioxidants that the authors give. I would get \\"needles\\" from my polyneuropathy every time my sugars got high 200's and above.

When I did further research on these supplements, it had said that we really don't need the Lipoic acid and the Carnitine because it is already present in our systems!So the authors owe me $$$ back for those supplements that got me sick!

No problem, get a SLEEVE instead of this hybrid sleeve messenger.The bag tries to be more than one thing and fails at both unfortunately. The bulk and stupidity of a non removable shoulder strap on a bag this size makes someone wanting the ultra compactness of a sleeve go that route, while anyone wanting space for at least ONE sheet of paper will need to look elsewhere.Really wanted to like this, but just not practical so cannot recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than expected","review":"I have the 17\\" CityGear Miami for my 17\\" MacBook Pro, and love it, so when I got a MacBook Air I bought the CityGear Atlanta bag for it.

It's light, flimsy and feels very cheap.The worst part is the main zipper that (allegedly) holds this bag closed, supposedly securing your valuable camera. I had this bag less than ONE week before the zipper quit holding. You know the deal, the teeth come apart and the zipper is hopelessly stuck in the middle. Tug it back and try again, same thing.

It's also big enough to hold all of his beach toys. The other bag is used for when we travel. We use it for a laundry bag. The mesh lets the dirty clothes ventilate while keeping them all in one place. This is way more organized than scattered around the room or in a pile on the floor in the closet.

Arguably, these serve to highlight his stylistic innovations.However, the non-standard packaging is truly annoying. Unless they have very narrow musical interests, most people purchasing these CDs will have fairly large music collections. Although wonderfully written and informative, the way oversized booklet is doomed to be lost on a back shelf or perhaps in the dustbin of history. The oversized cardboard cigar box that replaces the standard jewel case is a cheesy gimmick that must either be enshrined or, more probably, thrown out. What you're left with is 3 CDs in paper sleeves that will become lost among your other CDs once they're no longer in the immediate rotation on your CD player. For these reasons, minus three stars from the five this compilation deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"They were sure talkin' to me","review":"This collection is an absolute treasure for music buffs interested in exploring original talent and the music that deeply influenced bluegrass, folk and country.

If you like the new autechre style then you should invest in this album. The sounds of each song progress into something else that gets twisted up, mangled, and re-tempo'd. A lot of people dislike this album because it does not have the accessable sounds such as Incunabula or Amber. People need to realize that artists like to explore new areas, and that is what autechre has done. This is a personal listening album, and it does take time to appreciate, don't expect to pop in the cd and expect to love it immediately, it could take a few weeks, but the album is genius.

It's ultimately a very rewarding experience if you invest some time in it. I'm totally baffled by how they make all these amazing noises - and that the same minds that brought us the danceable \\"Incunabula\\" are capable of bringing us this highly deconstructed, angular soundscape.\\"Surripere\\" (track 5) is one of my all-time favorite electronic compositions. It's absolutely brilliant. Although created entirely with very cold digital sounds, it manages to convey an impressive emotional depth.My only complaint is that certain tracks do not have much of a direction; they start out strong and then gradually dissolve into something weaker.

Chiastic slide was the start of something new and interesting, but ever since then, it's been downhill from there. Seriously, they need to get in touch with their roots and dial back the chaos a bit. What made them enjoyable before was the BALANCE between melody and chaos. You could go on a sonic journey, from the delightfully subtle to overloading noise in the span of a few minutes, and it all made some kind of weird sense. One or two songs touch on this, but hopefully the next release will show more balance and less BS noodling and over-intellectualization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"Nothing new here.

That was 4 months ago, and 4 months after we returned the coffee maker, and we still haven't heard from DeLonghi. I hated the swivel control center also.

Within two weeks after that it was completely dead. For the price this coffee maker is a complete rip-off. It really is as cheap as it looks. For me it was not even worth it to have it repaired.

The carafe spills coffee each pouring due to a design that has a lid flap interfering with the pouring itself, causing coffee to run down the front (doh!).

This one took about three minutes. It had no story that makes sense; the worst acting; even worse special CGI and fake rubber snake effects (comparable to the 70s). This is a FF movie. The only moments that may capture some attention, and they were brief, is seeing snake woman as an attractive human actress.Storyline: Takes place in India. Snake, with laughable CGI effects, turns into a woman who journeys to find her snake boyfriend who was stolen by a stereotypic fat greedy American and on the way fangs a couple of bad people. Finds her snake boyfriend and then leaves as a snake woman - end of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, except for one hilarious mistake.","review":"Hisss was incredibly bad, as I expected. Forced to say one good thing about the movie, I would note that the lead actress is physically stunning. The CGI barely rose to the level of last-generation video games. The only thing that kept me watching is the fact that (for the DVD) the English subtitles (I have a hearing deficit) were for a DIFFERENT MOVIE. In fact, for one of the movies that was advertised in a trailer before the feature. The pairing--or juxtaposition--of the images in \\"Hisss\\" and the dialog from the other movie made for some very funny moments. If it hadn't been for that stupid mistake on the part of the DVD producer, \\"Hisss\\" would have been truly unwatchable. So perhaps it was intentional after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely different kind of movie mindset","review":"Good gawd this was bad. In a MST3K kind of way. I know India's bollywood produce way more pictures than American studio's, but 1) they do not know how to produce a good movie or 2) their tastes are very far removed than other cultures.The CGI was OK. Sci-Fi channel OK. The lead actress, Mallika Sherawat, was absolutely stunning. Bad actress, but amazingly beautiful.The other actors were OK, but still pretty flat. The directing and editing was horrendous. Long, long shots that should have been edited down. Very little dialogue (and in hindsight, that's a good thing).

Also good index, source list, and list of organizations in the back of the book are helpful. The REAL STORY series from Odonian press is excellent with a comfy format.(If you want to know who ODO was, read Ursula LeGuin's \\"The Dispossessed\\") Chomsky is MUST READ material for people who just dont buy it and are not afraid of ugly truth.

It is not only a poorly made film, I am sure that Dickens must be rolling over in his grave at the rape that has been committted upon his classic story. Not only are important details missing, but characters identities have been changed, as well as their names! In addition, this portrayal does not depict character's personalities as I believe Dickens intended. Finally, this book is lacking, in that, it does not evoke any emotional response from the reader -- unless you count boredom. Take my advice. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of two cities dvd - great","review":"dvd was in great condition. good movie. arrival time from purchase date was excellent. makes you laugh, makes your cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cn't even light a match","review":"I totally agree with Leonard Maltin's review. This version of \\"Tale of Two Cities\\" can't even light a match in comparison to the 1935 classic. It tries; the pacing is very similar, and even some of the dialogue is identical. However, the actors in the 1935 version are only several thousand times better in the original. (Steven Seagal would have been better in the lead role than Chris Sarandon.) The 1935 version is shorter, and yet the characters and the story are better developed and more interesting.

And that is the crux of my criticism; given the dated production, one can only watch this movie and not partake in it.More specifically, compared to today's productions of Austen, Dickens, etc. from the BBC and elsewhere, this production is rather bland.The lines are delivered as if they were being read, passion is reserved to the level that one wonders if it exists that all. There is no heated exchange, no believable human interaction, the scenes are devoid of the dirt and chaos of reality.In total, compared to today's productions, there is no \\"suspension of disbelief\\".The best I can say about this production is perhaps it would have gotten four stars back in 1980 when he was released.For now, I'll keep it on a shelf while I live the most recent realistic renditions of Austin, Dickens, and the other classics.Regards,"},{"rating":"1","title":"My $.02","review":"The first set was pretty cool.

I'm not saying anything against females but rather, I spent my money for some gun fighting and action that the typical Joe stuff had. This is not that kind of a video set. If you have to have some more Joe videos, by all means get a copy of this.

They love it. The game pieces are especially unique; pewter figures of main characters. I was amazed at the tiny details that my kids remembered from the movies, from Yoda's last word (\\"Skywalker\\") to the color of the glove Luke wore to cover his replaced hand (black).

The questions range from very, very, very simple to extremely hard - I mean, I didn't watch the credits, so there are a few details which I just don't know about the actors who played minor characters.This game is a lot of fun just to sit back and relax for a bit and to see how much you really do know about the Star Wars Universe.

But it's still a fun family game, and a terrific Saturday night activity (just add pizza) for when you want to get away from the TV.The game pieces are quite intricate and the R2D2 random number generator is a hoot. My only complaint is that there are only four game pieces and there is no die to substitute for the sometimes-annoying R2 beeps. But you can just take those pieces from another game set.

Far from a Galahad, Rebus is a deeply flawed man, tough on family and any who try to get too near, entirely too dependent on alcohol to quell the feeling of rage and hurt he feels.The gradual shift from a search for a solution to some mysterious suicides to finding a way to punish those who seem to be beyond punishment is classic Rankin. Rebus's response to the class system seems much more than a plot device; it becomes a vital link to understanding Rebus a bit better. His rage, when directed at injustice is a fearsome weapon, but it also becomes evident how important his life as policeman is to his continued existence. Rankin continues to combine an excellent procedural with a truly interesting and believable figure.

Putting the metal cross-bars in place takes a bit of strength -- certainly nothing my 5 or 9 year old is/was capable of doing.

If you are using some great standard AA rechargeables, I use Eneloop by the way, than you can do something like 50-80 exposures depending on flash use, again this doesn't mean that the batteries are dead, they still have 90% power left. So at the end this toy report only if batteries are at least at 90% of their capacity, else the camera shuts down.The only pro fact....price, but even this it's deceiving because its luring you in buying a stupid useless product...so at the end....just save yourself the moment about being pissed off for such a crappy buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This product was a deception I thought I was buying a battery pack with an extra shutter, and grip in stead I paid for a cheap useless piece of plastic!

Thats right MUTANT FLIES! The problem is that flies are not scary at all they do not have the shriek factor of spiders, scorpions or roaches.

Pouring is very easy and safe as it doesn't let spill.Update: 05/24/2012After using it for almost an year, it started acting weird. When I would wash it after using it for tea, dirty water would keep coming no matter how much I would rinse it. It was driving me nuts. Eventually I discovered that the content was leaking into the vaccum space. I realized there was corrosion in the bottom which I had been thinking was dried stains. Thats why the trapped left over tea would leak back to contaminate the rinsing water through the corrosive holes. Obviously its of no use anymore. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't use it if the paid me $11.","review":"For the first month or two we used it, and it was fine if we didn't need the water to stay warm long. Keep in mind it is not a thermos.However, when we realized the inside had filled with corrosion we returned it and Amazon as always handled the return professionally. So if you want chemically enhanced lukewarm food or drink, this barely 'vacuum insulated bottle' that isn't a thermos is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit","review":"Great fit for my iPhone 4. The material is perfect to prevent slipping yet it is smooth. I don't give it five stars because it only has the back camera, the mute switch and head set openings. I wish the screen lock and volume areas would be opened too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case","review":"I'm very happy with this case. I've read some other reviews about poor fit but mine fits perfectly. It is made of a flexible vinyl/rubber(not a hard case), not like those silicone ones that stick in your pocket and attract lint. Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case. At $19 it's probably a bit over priced but other than that I have no complaints. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for now","review":"I brought this case mostly to have something to protect my iphone 4 until a better case comes out. The case fits, but there's a slight gap at the top due to the lack of room provided for the power button. The case does offers a better grip and improved signal strength however. Since there are just a few iphone 4 cases out there, the price is a bit steep for the quality it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missionary stories for primaries","review":"I was very happy first to be able to find this out-of-date book for my grandhcildren.

There is no brilliant, melodic Peter Gabriel era Genesis-esque prog to be found here. Rather, you will be unmercifully assaulted w/ noxious death metal! To paraphrase, this is not the same band. I waited 3 1/2 months for a kick in the teeth. It is a shame no music outlet (Amazon included) was aware that 2 Crucibles exist.However, if you like shoddy musicianship, demonic vocals & woe-is-me lyrics; this disc is for you. I got that out of the horrific 15 seconds or so I listened to this waste of my hard-earned dough."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful coming of age","review":"This is an enormously heartwarming coming-of-age tale, which is well-written and engaging. I particularly enjoyed all of the pop culture references, since I was growing up in the '70s as well. Once I finished the book, I felt like the characters were still living with me, which is always a sign of a good book. I'd highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A coming of age gem with universal appeal","review":"This finely written, exquisitely detailed coming of age story may be called Miss Black America, but its appeal is universal. Veronica Chambers skillfully explores the delicate, fraught, often confusing and competing ties that bind daughters to both their mothers and fathers. The mother's dominant presence -- heightened cleverly by her absence --is beautifully woven throughout the story without diminishing the strong presence and influence of Teddo on the woman Angela becomes. Frequent interwoven references to touchstones of popular cultural throughout Angela's life --from news clips to fashion trends-- help place and pace the story in a colorful way that should conjure up fun personal memories for many readers. Miss Black America is a fast paced, thoroughly enjoyable, and ultimately uplifting take on the resilience of us all, because of, and in spite of, our families. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant story about fathers and daughters","review":"I am a big fan of Veronica's and her latest did not disappoint. Miss Black America really captured Angela's stuggles as she tries to navigate growing up and a world without her mom. I felt Veronica nailed the time period as well. I was in elementary school in NYC during 70's and this brought back some fun memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal work at a vintage concert","review":"Brubeck's quartet had been in full swing for several years when they played this set at Newport. The band is tight, the sound is great, and everyone is swinging.Desmond's solo, especially his blues on \\"Things Ain't\\" have been considered some of his best. In fact, it was later transcribed by Luckey ... one of only 5 solos of that era that Luckey chose to transcribe to illustrate Desmond's style to future alto players.Sound is good in this recording to, having been remastered for this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"I had seen this watch on the website and wanted it for a while and when i finally got it i wasn't disappointed its really nice and its a unique feature with the dog tag"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice blast from the past","review":"I had this record years ago, then spent many years looking for a replacement, to no avail. It was great to find it available thanks to Amazon. Radio seems to think The Guess Who only recorded a few songs, so its good to hear them outside their AOR contemporary box. Heartbroken Bopper really captures Burton Cummings' intense vocal style, and sounds like no other group. Get Your Ribbons On has a great boogie woogie feel, and I still remembered Running Bear almost verbatim. Back to the City is one that stays in your mind for a long time after you hear it again. This record is worth every penny!Rockin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exsquisite Delight! Showtunes + Jazz = Chris Bennett on Broadway","review":"Of all of Chris Bennett's CDs, this latest release, \\"Bennett on Broadway,\\" is her finest jazz release yet! With a voice that is confident, sensual and delicate, the lady has created an aural experience that is sophisticated, classic and totally hip. Gems like \\"Just One Of Those Things,\\" \\"September Song\\" and \\"Old Devil Moon\\" are sublimely brought into focus by the talents of contemporary arrangements of Bill Augustine. Unexpected touches like samba elements and percussion nuances spice these standards for a musical experience that is ideal for a sparkle of elegance from a jazz singer who is quickly maturing into the mold of a modern day Anita O'Day, June Christy and Jeri Southern. Chris Bennett on Broadway is beautifully packaged with nostalgic-quality images and imaginatively seductive liner notes. This is definately the CD I am giving as my Christmas gift this year! Bravo Chris! -and thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a solid solo effort from Glenn Hughes","review":"Glenn Hughes has been very uneven throughout the years. During his time with Deep Purple (as well as Trapeze) he gave us some excellent music. After leaving Purple, Hughes buried his feet deep in the mud of funk/soul but in opinion he never got it right. Later albums like \\"From now on\\" have had its share of good songs but also a decent amount of fillers. With \\"Addiction\\", Hughes were in my opinion too heavy, too slow, too low key. His latest release titled \\"Songs in the key of rock\\" follows the direction from Hughes Turner Project (Glenn Hughes & Joe Lynn Turner), and is the best album from him ever. The songs bare connection to earlier rock efforts (for example compare \\"Gasoline\\" with \\"Burn\\") and Hughes have written songs of high quality. \\"Songs in the key of rock\\" is a solid rock album and should please fans of traditional hard rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ESP classes!","review":"I teach a course on International Trade for students of English as a Second Language and this book has proved very useful to introduce the basic concepts of business.

The woman beckons for her to follow. The incident frightens Lara, and she passes it off as a nightmare. When it keeps happening, she begins to suspect that someone is breaking into her house. By the end of the story, Lara will realize who this woman was, what she was trying to say, and the shocking secret her husband tried to hide. The plot was rich and tight, with several subplots weaving into it. However, I thought Lara was too whiny and passive. I would recommend it, though, to anyone who likes ghost stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOHUM HORROR","review":"As with most Rick Hautala books, SHADES OF NIGHT suffers from being overly long and padded with redundant introspective narrative and a lack of sustained suspense. Although Hautala has good plotting, his excessiveness tends to diminish their impact.In this rather tedious story, a young woman recently married finds herself stalked by a mysterious man; nightmares of an unknown woman beckoning her to a secret in her husband's cellar. A rocket scientist is not necessary to figure out what is going on, and the main character, Lara, becomes too whiny and self-pitying to become empathic with.Labored and derivative, it's not one of Hautala's strongest entries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book in JAVA","review":"This is the Book that beats every one in Java2. Great insight and technical stuff. Mr. Horton know the presentation in and out. I recommend this book to anyone who is new to Java. Great Job Mr Horton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and abstract examples...","review":"The book looks good but it is clear that the author is not a Java programmer but rather just an academic. What I mean by that statement is that he presents JAVA as you would expect to view in a lab. So we have lots of mathematical equations to illustrate concepts instead some 'real world' examples. This may not sound too bad, and I guess it isn't if you are interested in learning Java to teach it, or if you are already well versed in OO concepts but if you want to learn the real world use of JAVA avoid this book or wait until Ivor actually uses JAVA to write a commercial appication for a client! The book reeks of soemone who never actually used the language in real work.Stefan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"This book is horribly written. I plan on burning it when my java class is finished. Chapters 8, 9, and 10 are exceptionally bad. They cover file io, and it tells you how to instantiate a class, but not how to use it. Amid the maze and jumble of words, some have been able to glean a meaning from the examples he's given. Most of us weren't so lucky. Rest in peace, Java class.. rest in peace.More than 2/3 my java class is failing because the book isn't worth the pages it's printed on. He could not have chosen a more obtuse way of wording things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know why this book got 5 stars","review":"Seriously, As a Sun Certified Java Programmer, I don't recommend this book. I don't know what it is with the author, but he seems to love to write code that computes primes.A good book is one that is informative as well as explanative and easy to follow. Most of this book is easy to follow, but the problem is that it doen't take you anywhere.Not much to be learned about the language and the rules of Java from this book as a beginners book should concentrate on.The author writes code and explains 'Heres how it works', with an explanation not easy to understand.It seems like a modified version of the Deitel, Java How to Program book.Sybex or better yet Addison Wesley have some very good introductory Java books that may be a much wiser choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for Beginners","review":"I would like to start with saying thanks to Ivor Horton! Bravo on the great book! This is the single best technical book I have read. This book gives you the absolute foundations for building a strong background with JAVA. I think JAVA is great and this book has made learning a lot of fun.If there were any problems with this book, then I would say it is with the chapter review problems. Although, if I was a programmer these problems shouldn't be all that difficult. I am lacking in the traditional programming background, so some of the math tends to slow me down since it has been over 10 years since I have had a math class.But, this book is still the best out there that I have read! Keep up the good work Ivor!Oh, and I love the p2p.wrox.com Beginning Java list."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have bought","review":"This book is essentially a re-organization of technical manuals, Java specifications and help files.

I found this out after I read other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Ivor seems to go out of his way to over complicate what should be very simple examples.

Don't be fooled by the title \\"beginning java 2\\" This book is a whopping 1100 pages plus (and smaller than usual font). Covers Java Core, I/O Streams, util package, Threads, Basic to Intermediate Swing (graphics) and JDBC (database). It is well written with good explanations, Code Snip lets and \\"Diagrams!\\". The explanations are detailed which is great for novice programmers and useful for seasoned programmers moving from another language to Java when stuck with a concept. Seasoned non java programmers can read through the code snip-lets and grasp concepts through the numerous diagrams that explain key concepts easily. It is not a skim by the surface book leaving you with holes of thought nor is it a book that just covers elementary topics. The author goes from the elementary to intermediate level with good detail. It is not a quick reference. Well Done!

Horton seem to take an opposite approach. The thing that bothers me most about this book is the examples. Some of them can span over several chapters with Horton making tweeks to code fragments as you go. If you would like to step through the code, you're in for a major page flipping session. So what should have been a simple 5 minute explanation, turns into a two hour ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the whole point","review":"As with his other books Beginning Java2 and his Learning Visual C++ his books miss the mark as a good tutorial or a reference guide. I am sure Mr. Horton is an excellent programmer, but the code examples are to spread out and incomplete. I do not want to see how he solves a problem but would rather he imparts the neccessary information for me to be able solve the problem using the language. So instead of wasting $40.00 goto the sun site and use their tutorial for free and then get the Java core books(available at Amazon).

Lots of babble about what releigious leader - name and so forth of who came up with which concept. A child who saw the otherside from a near-death experience is inspirational - they go a bit into the angle of terrorists and If they go to Heaven (too much time spent on them).I also bought and watched the Barbara Walters Special (DVD) on Heaven - and it was less disappointing than this one.

I almost hate to admit that, but it's true. He covers all of the bases and the story isn't too bad, but all of it is way too predictable. There's no mystery in this book at all! The reader has if figured from the beginning. If you are a fan of Douglas's previous works, you probably won't like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Uninventive","review":"In this highly touted collaboration between author Mark Olshaker and former FBI profiler John Douglas, the storyline seems secondary to the ruminations of a former career-focused criminologist. While the information that the authors impart in telling this story is somewhat engaging, the language used felt flat and unimaginative. Even the emotional makeup of the lead characters, Jake Donovan and his supporting crew, seemed as if they were filtered through the same electronic surveillance devices used by the Agency in gathering evidence. Had the story been told with more dynamic flair for the material, it would not have resembled a walk through a garden papered with cut-out impressions of real flowers. The ideas were intriguing, but not enough to carry the idea through to a satisfying end. It is as if this book exists primarily to cash in on the popularity of the science of profiling, as done so well in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doc Savage Lives Again!","review":"This book is basically an updated version of the old Doc Savage stories; a brilliant hero leads a group of outstanding experts who will all fly anywhere at a moments notice to solve baffling cases of homicide. Since, however, most readers of today do not remember Doc Savage, the authors are on firm ground. This is obviously the first of a series of novels (again, like Doc) and we may even see a TV series or a movies for the authors. Not a bad plot; the writing is good too. But original? Uh-uh. It's all been done before and at least as good as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, smart & unpredictable!","review":"This suspense novel keeps you wondering until the end, and Douglas' incomparable understanding of the criminal mind makes this book as creepily believable as those Hannibal Lechter stories.

Disjointed, jumps around chronologically like a kid with ADD, and generally writes like a modern academic. Interspersed with politically correct garbage projecting 21st century anxieties about Halley's attitude to the poor and everything else. A particularly egregious anachronism is the author's reference to the position of Astronomer Royal as Halley's \\"dream job\\" - a grating reminder of the author's inappropriate use of flip modernisms at every opportunity.Worth plowing through if you are interested in the era - just hold your nose and ignore the clumsy and graceless writing. The author seems to have done the necessary research - unfortunately the facts are sprayed around randomly like the stuff on the walls of a casual restaurant.

Book never mentions why the police didn't bother to question or talk to John (the fake Max)while he was living in the Grandma's apartment.There were times towards the end of the book when Mel, the lead character majorly got on my nerves. I started to root for her to get fired. Forty-nine tardies...please, what boss would put up with that? Also the emails between Mel and her parents were really boring.
