Having written about this in my new book, \\"Not in My Neighborhood: How Bigotry Shaped a Great American City,\\" I was particularly eager to read Ordover's work. The deeper I got into it, the more excited I got. She writes with grace and effectiveness about such gruesome events as phycisian-ordered butchery of sexual organs. Her documentation is first rate.

Of course, that is just my opinion.Many moods are covered here: Sheer poetry in \\"Tiempo Y Silencio\\" (Time and Silence), plaintive love in \\"Dor Di Amor\\" (Painful Love), disapproval of changing morals in \\"Nutridinha\\"(The Chubby Little Girl), mature love in \\"Regresso\\" (Return) sung with Caetano Veloso, loneliness in \\"Crepuscular Solidao\\" (Twilight Loneliness).This is world music at its best, a truly spectacular woman's voice to stand and be heard with the greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"New directions","review":"Similar to the way Cafe Atlantico took off in a slightly different direction, Sao Vicente also expands the modalities of Evora's musical celebration. This is a great album for a party or for dancing. Many of the songs have a Latin or Brazilian rhythm to them and depart from Evora's idiosyncratic plaintive expression. Not all of the songs follow this track and there is plenty of the forlorn, deep, beautiful and touching expression fans are used to. I listen to the album and can hear the many ways in which Evora has been touched by fame and notoriety. She wants to share her joy and excitement with the world, without giving up her integrity as a musician. Her duet with Bonnie Raitt is beautiful as well as her work with ChuChu Vales.

They also allow me to store the power cables and the mounting brackets in the bags, which means less of a chance of losing items necessary for the proper use of the lights.Four stars for these bags.

The plot is promising...but it doesn't begin until more than halfway through the book and never really reaches its peak.

Lovejoy does a very good job with his characterizations, I really connected with most of them. The the bad news: Technically speaking this novel is more wrong than right. Lovejoy has us telnetting to email addresses, refers to the world wide web as a different network and in many cases leaves me with the impression that he thinks that computers are magic. If Lovejoy would have allowed a network engineer to read the book before it was published many if his small mistakes could have been fixed, but in addition to those, his major premise is also flawed. In short this book is like then old B movies. If you have a real working knowlodge of computers of the Internet, you'll need to leave that _reality_ at the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for whats it's intented audience is.......","review":"I belive William H.

Other than the technical errors, the book is very worth the time it takes to read....I have read it twice and enjoy is very much...If perhaps Mr. Lovejoy could have the book reviewed by a person knowledgeable in IW, the book would be more enjoyable to those people who have more knowledge about this area and it's technicalities........"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read information wars thriller","review":"I am impressed with the authors research abilities and accuracy shown in his book back\\\\slash.

Lovejoy's reasearch into the subject of the internet was pretty superficial; the book contained loads of technical inaccuracies. Although the preface of the book stated that many details of the internet were concealed or changed in order to prevent computer crime, he should have at least preserved _some_ credibility. (The part where a character downloads a multi-gigabyte file over a 9600 baud modem an a few hours was one of my favorites) Aside from the inaccuracies, most of the characters in the book weren't very likable, and the hero of the novel bears an uncomfortable resemblence to the Unabomber. Finally, the author never really explains the motivations behind the villain's actions, and those that are revealed don't really fit in with the crimes which s/he committed. I really wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's the one you're looking for...","review":"I consider this one my biblical reference of our country's oldest continually operating railroad, the Delaware & Hudson.

At that time the music he was playing was closer to hard bop though there are some elements of soul that he would become more influenced by. As a live set, it is excellent, great sound quality especially with the remaster. The extra tracks are classic as well. The in between stage banter is dated but amusing and nostalgic and fits with the disc. Any fan of hard bop or soul jazz will want to pick this one up. Hard bop took away the somewhat sterile sound of bebop and made jazz populist again without selling. Anything from Horace Silver from the 60's is great. This is an especially good album though."},{"rating":"1","title":"it [stunk]","review":"I'm a huge Britney fan, but this cd [stunk] so bad.

However, Diana Palmer cannot keep to viewpoint (probably doesn't know what it is) to save her soul and her characters are made of cardboard.

Instead, read John Gilmore's new book about LA Despair,. which has a more colorful account of the life and times of Payton"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Informative","review":"My mother was recently diagnosed, and I bought this book hoping it would be an informative summary of treatment methods, statistics, and coping strategies. Unfortunately, it is not. It contains pretty much the same general information that can be found on the American Cancer Society web site, and I would recommend the National Cancer Institute's PDQ service for much more comprehensive clinical information. Also, my mother's oncologist provided several pamphlets that were just as good or better on treatment side effects and coping strategies. As far as I can tell, this book's main merit is its case studies, all of which have positive outcomes. These may give patients more hope. However, the price of the book is a little steep if that's all one gets from it. I would recommend that patients and families do their own research: it's more empowering, it's free, and the information is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Album","review":"Great Album, we saw this tour in 94 at the Boston Orpheum Theater.

The previews from other videos made it seem better. The story takes off after very important events have already occured. At times I found myself wondering \\"what the heck just happened?\\" because the story skips forward very often. However, the fight scenes were very well done, with great animation and more realistic swordplay, not your typical energy-blast-attack-that-sends-the-enemy-screaming-through-the-air.It's ok, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great anime, based on a vintage video game from Japan!","review":"Fire Emblem was originally a game on the Nintendo Famicom (Japanese version of the NES).

However this rare anime was brought to the US long before that, 1998 according to Amazon.com and [...]. It is really awesome, and when I saw it from watching this video tape it was the first time I'd seen the character Marth do battle OUTSIDE of the game Super Smash Bros Melee. It's really cool being able to see one of your favorite video game characters do battle in an anime, just seriously AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Line has Major Flaws !","review":"If your interested in creating anime professionaly I suggest getting this title as a reference. If your on the other hand looking for a great story line as well as animation I suggest \\"Lodos War\\". Which has both. It's obvious that the company decided to spend more time on the characters animation than on a story line. The character animation was very detailed. Very high quality renderings of battle scenes.

It goes into a good level of detail regarding the history of this great guitar and how it has changed over time. I found the section on dating Strats especially useful. I have referenced the book quite a bit in describing what I wanted on my Custom Strat. The only drawbacks would be some of the formatting of the text (no biggie) and many of the b/w photos would be more effective in color.

I would love to see an updated version repressed.I purchased the Kindle for Mac version of the book on Amazon to have access to the book electronically & in turn minimize my physical library. Big Mistake! The Kindle version does not support color. Think; black & white scanned PDF type document. Bummer. I will reconsider future Kindle book purchases as the result of this transaction. This would not have been a problem had it been a traditional text book, but not a book with detailed color photography.

He has good control over the music and can really make you feel the words. His version of \\"The One I love\\" by R.E.M. is wonderful. A very powerful and yet simple rendition. The only fault I could truly find is that the sing along song (Wild Rover) lacked punch. There should have been more people singing. It fell short of a real party atmosphere. Its his slower songs that drive this album. His duet with Melanie is touching and \\"Green Fields of France\\" could turn on the waterworks if you've had too much to drink.This is an excellent gem to be added to anyone's collection. I hope to hear more from him soon. Keep your ears open for this man.

The author, though obviously an expert in the field, should stick to writing for archaeological journals and stay away from books for the general public. Simple, declarative sentences, engaging graphics, fascinating photographs would make this little-known subject come to life, but unfortunately not one of these is to be found in this book. Instead you'll be subjected to such dreadful prose as \\"When compared with the material evidence of orthodoxy at Lohmann phase Cahokia, these lines of evidence indicate cultural diversity, persistence, hybridity, and creolization.\\" Unless your idea of fun is reading 177 pages like this, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"egotistical","review":"Walter Piston is a composer, but in his music theory textbook, he can bring in samples from the work of other composers.

At first I resisted, because it sounded ridiculous, but finally I caved and bought it. I'm glad I did. The art is really nice, although different from other styles I've seen. I'm really interested in what happens between the various couples. It sucks you in. It doesn't have superheroes or magical girls. Just a bunch of fairly normal girls and their relationships. I highly recommend it.

I learned not to judge a book by its cover long ago w/ Daupne Du Mauriers Rebecca, w/ its sleazy looking cover. The main difference is that that turned out to be great, when I thought it would be slutsy... (And also, I.N.V.U. is a graphic/anime novel...)But, this one was just plain stale. Honestly, I have heared this same souped up story numerous times in many other anime. A teenage girls life turns topsy-turvy, and she falls in love w/ two differnt people (w/one whos older than her). Wow. How totally unique. I've never seen or heared anything like it before. NOT. Also, it was just plain boring. I forced myself to get it over w/ but couldint even finsih the last five pages, or so.

When I heard \\"Teen Spirit\\" by the A*Teens I became addicted. I loved their happy, innocent sound and enthusiasm. So I was very excited to finally get 'Pop 'Til You Drop' from amazon.com. Until I heard it. The A Teens have grown up, and in doing so have switched their material from the kind that set them apart to the type of music which is being mass produced. I can buy any CD now and hear this type of music. I miss the A*Teens with all their innocence and fun; their catchy melodies and great fun lyrics. I was disappointed with this album... one of the lead female's singers (I think it's Sara) sounds horrible on \\"This Year\\"; what happened to that beautiful voice of hers? The only song that sounds like their old happy upbeat selves has got to be 'Can't Help Falling in Love'. I was disappointed by this CD; if you want good music buy their first two CD's, but I would skip over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this one is stupid","review":"I'm sorry, a bunch of whiny teenagers singing to horrible techno is not good. I love electronica of all different kind. I also like pop music but his is [bad]. Floorfiller is so annoying that it sounds like Eiffel 65's offspring. If you want some upbeat electronica try Alien Factory (which is very hard to find) even Happy Hardcore maker Scooter is way better than this. The A*Teens are just [bad] pop along with Dreamstreet and Play. Please record agencies, no more Lil Romeo's and Aaron Carter's. Leave the music up to the grown ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret buying this","review":"I'm usually a huge A-teens fan, but this changed my attitude. They should've stuck w/ just ABBA songs. The lyrics are dumb, their outfits on the cover are dumb, everything's just fluffy and DUMB. Example of lyrics: Let's finish what we started/ don't be so chickenhearted. I gave it 2 stars, though, because there are 2 songs on here that I like-1)Can't Help Fallin' in Love. I bought the CD because I loved this song and thought that the rest of the CD would follow in its footsteps.2)Hi and Goodbye. @ first I didn't like this, but it's really a sweet ballad about a couple who really doesn't know why it all didn't work out and want to fit the pieces back together. Or at least that's how I interpret it. Don't buy this CD, spend your money on a Hi and Goodbye or a CHFIL single."},{"rating":"1","title":"POP SUCKS!","review":"The title alone is enough to make someone suicidal, I mean c'mon \\"Pop Till You Drop,\\" WTF?!

Besides the songs \\"I can't help falling in love with you\\" and \\"Floorfiller\\" the cd is not worth listening to in my opinion. I thouht some of the songs had no meanings.

Pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops, They Did It Again","review":"All right, so I'm not sure exactly what image the A-Teen are trying to conjure with their new album, but I must say that the songs, while somewhat annoying at times, are catchy little masterpieces that I can seem to get out of my head. Sure, the songs are trivial and trite, but hey...songs don't have to be chock full of meaning. Sometimes it's better if they're meaningless. \\"Let Your Heart Do All the Talking\\" and \\"Oh Oh Yeah\\" are definitely my favorite songs on the album. The only song that HAS to go is the remake of \\"School's Out\\" with (gasp) Alice Cooper? The song is, in a word, moronic, and it makes everyone singing look like they have a degenerative brain disorder. But cut off the last track and the album is great...it'd get five stars except for \\"School's Out\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is coming from a person who dosent like the A*Teens...","review":"Well, looks like they pulled this one off, very well actually.

Well they sang a few abba songs, then songs from their other cd including sugar rush *grrrrrrr*, then they sang a bunch of songs from their new cd and i must admit they are very catchy. I even bought the pop till you drop CD, ME!!!

A classic album, one for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply dreadful","review":"I can honestly say that Deeply Dippy remains my most loathed pop single of all time, with Don\`t Talk Just Kiss a runner-up.Deeply Dippy is a love song with no love, no heart, no soul, no sincerity. RSF are all camp, no substance. They hark back to thevapid archness of Spandau & Human League yet manage to be EVEN WORSE!With so much great music out there, why does anyone bother with stuff like this? One\`s mind boggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just fun","review":"I always thought Right Said Fred was a one-hit wonder and they probably are.

Lots of good dance music and the album is definitely more than I'm Too Sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's too funny, but this band still rocks!","review":"When I was a junior in high school this album was HUGE. Of course, now I play this cd for my husband and I have to watch myself because he likes some of the lyrics on most of the songs, espeically the ones with certain \\"Mature\\" overtones to them, because of what kind of things happen afterwards to me. (Put it this way -- the songs get my husband in a good mood to be with me in a married person sort of way, if you know what I mean!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"yep!!!","review":"This is the best book i have found on drawing the head. Andrew loomis has a good method as well, I have kind of started using a hybrid of the 2.

After applying the book's techniques it occurred to me that I could photograph actual people from variety of angles (from a longer distance and with a med/long camera lens, to reduce distortion). I laid a transparent sheet of paper over the photos and traced the main facial feature lines (simplifying the face to its component forms). I applied the rules to a theoretical face with the same width and height of two friends I used as subjects. Using the books suggestions led to drawings that did not appear obviously wrong, but bore no relation to reality. This process took me 3 hours. Take my word for it, or try it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Book","review":"If you want to improve your understanding and skill in depicting the human figure, you must read Hogarth's books.

Why would shoes from a sub-par player have much appeal?Just as the title states - extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"If you are looking for a book to learn something about MJ, this one is the right choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"was that a book or shoes advertisement?","review":"i was waiting to read some things to help me get to know mj's psychology and way of thinking.unfortunately the pages concerning that were minimum and the book is a long winded advertisement.Embarrasing and dissapointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand Jordan, Brand Jordan, Brand Jordan, Brand Jordan","review":"That's all this book cares about it. They use the words Brand Jordan constantly. We all know he is the most fierce competitor, the hardest worker, best dresser, etc. I finished this book in two short sittings. It's mostly pictures of his Air Jordan sneakers. A huge dissapointment, I am returning it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great motivation...sports fan or not","review":"You will like this book much more if you are a Jordan worshipper, but there is also much to learn if you are not a Jordan fan or even a sports fan. This book is about how Jordan approaches life, basketball, and business. There are wonderful anecdotes from his mom, his agent, friends, and Nike executives. Regardless of what you think of Jordan, you will get something out of this book if you respect his work ethic. You will also realize that being true to who you are is very important in life, no matter how many people disagree with your decisions or criticize you. Maybe I read a little deeper into this book than most, but I thought it was great. Definitely worth the two hours it took to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way ahead of the field","review":"The book is very thorough and informative, and at least 5 to 7 years ahead of the doctors who prescribe lipid lowering drugs. The book pointed out the dangers of Homosystene and Lp(a) well before it was labeled the \\"really bad cholesterol\\", and getting Doctors to prescribe such tests was like pulling teath. And after all thats said and done, It seems Niacin (well supported in the book) is proving to be better than the statins that are currently touted...particularly since the statins can not effect Lp(a), whereas,Niacin is the only cure for Lp(a). As a result, we are only now hearing about combination therapy of Niacin and statins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"At the price offered I expected to get four of these. I got that impression due to the fact that other offerings of similar products come in sets of four. I got one, and the total cost including shipping came to almost eleven dollars.

Rick Altman needs to go back to school and learn how to write. To be be fair though the man does raise interesting and important points on Genre Theory, but again such knowledge is useless if it cannot be discerned from the large amounts of fluff he has in this book as filler. He never gets to the point and the points he does have can be summarized very easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING","review":"This annoying CD starts off with the promise of well selected songs being sung by two singers with a lot of personality and deteriorates into whining sameness cut after cut. This album is just too much work to listen to, and I had to stop after the sixth song. I probably didn't miss anything except a splitting headache. Try a Betty Buckley or Patti Lupone CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH! DUETS HAVE SOUNDED BETTER THAN THIS MESS!","review":"It's not that it's a terrible CD, a more apt description would be that it's cloying. They're voices are too similar and too high to mix all that interestingly on duets, the result sounds like two cats in heat, only two octave higher. The song choices aren't bad either, only their styles on this album make the songs sound too similar. I think that if their ranges were more disparate, it would have been a more successful project. It sounds like one of them is singing duets with herself. After the fifth song, we were getting headaches from these women and had to move on to more soothing music and some alcoholic beverages. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING Talent, but...","review":"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this CD very much, and I think these ladies have phenomenal voices, but on many of the songs I couldn't get past the not-so-hot arrangements. Two such disappointments were \\"In His Eyes\\" from \\"Jekyll & Hyde,\\" and \\"My Own Best Friend/Nowadays\\" from \\"Chicago.\\" On the flip side, there were some absolutely wonderful tracks. Highlights are \\"If Momma Was Married,\\" \\"Sisters,\\" and \\"My friend.\\" Regardless of the less than perfect arrangements, this is a very very good CD. You will fall in love with Alice & Emily...however for a MORE enjoyable listening experience, i do suggest that you check out their most recent recording \\"Unsuspecting Hearts.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't live up to potential","review":"Don't get me wrong, because I love Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner, but this particular CD doesn't give them the spotlight they deserve. The mixing on the songs is a little off with detracts from their lovely voices. Nevertheless, Alice and Emily shine with beautiful harmonies and equally powerful solos. Overall, I recommend this CD, but don't expect another \\"Side Show.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The most talented actresses on and off Broadway!!!!","review":"This the secong best cd in the world!

When I read in Playbill that they had recorded an album together I knew I had to purchase it.As I listened to each selection it was goose bump after goose bump. Their selection of duets contained so many of my favorites ... starting from the happy \\"Little Me\\" tune, to the heartfelt \\"A Little Night Music\\" song, and the infrequently heard \\"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\\" perfect confection. Every track a winner!And a special thanks for the hidden bonus on the last track. What a hoot! I was happy to read others who reviewed this CD enjoyed the bonus as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I have very small wrists and the bracelet was very large.

Every song on this album is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clarks voice is great but this CD isn't .","review":"I've been a long time fan of Petula Clark even though she was popular a little before my time. I bought this CD when I saw it in the store and noticed it was done by the people who produced Helen Reddy's new \\"Center Stage\\" CD which I reaaly liked. I bought \\"Here for You\\" without listening first and was just a little dissapointed. This collection has some good tracks but only a few. I think I wanted more stuff in the style of \\"Oxygen\\" from her \\"Treasure's\\" CD from around 1990. What I got was an odd mix of songs including \\"Pinball Wizard\\" which is just too weird to listen to. If you're a big fan of Petula Clark you will probably really enjoy it. Otherwise get one her \\"Greatest Hits\\" and save some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"If you are looking for a mission manual written by a seminary professor, move on and keep looking. This simple book shares anecdotes and pointers from a many who has decades of experience working as a minister and blue-collar factory worker. He knows what it's like, and offers in this book some very good insight for the church member who is considering going into ministry. This book focuses mostly on bivocational work with small congregations in an area where the prospective minister already lives. It does not deal with bivocational church planting in new areas. \\"The Tentmaking Pastor\\" was enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seminary trained bivocational pastors...","review":"don't waste your time or money on this book. While Bickers has had great success as a bivocational pastor, most of us could have written this better ourselves (if we had the time!). His format is anti-intellectual, denominational specific, poorly organized, and is more of a testimonial than a solid pastoral resource. Bickers gives no suggestions on how to manage time properly as a bivocational pastor, but rather just gives one story after another of his experience. The book is pure experience, which he even admits is \\"just him.\\" His lack of scholarly, theological training makes this book a waste of money and time- two things bivocational pastors have very little of. A big disappointment. Recommend to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The box does not represent the product description","review":"The box shows it being of the 12, 3\\"x 3 yards type.

It's a gross misrepensentation of the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing change","review":"This book is an important reminder of how much the battlefields of WW1 changed from the slaughter of the Somme/Verdun and how the generals were finally grasping the importance of the Tank and mobile warfare. Although Cambrai itself gained little in terms of territory it provided a blueprint to the Allies on how to fight future battles.The fact that the tank was comming to the Western Front in ever increasing numbers would prove a death knel to imperial Germany. Whilst the comming arrival of American troops (who never really contributed to any overwhelming defeat of Germany) was on the German high command's radar; it was this opperation that forced the Germans to launch the disasterous \\"Kaiser's Battle\\" before British warfare adapted to a point where Germany could no longer defeat them. The book is packed with detail on who supported (Winston Churchill amongst others) this new method of warfare and who opposed it. An interesting addition to a military historians collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"pet shop boys \\"VERY\\"","review":"I despise people who review a CD/DVD in every detail.

I based what my cooking process on the advice from this book, finding it simple and straightforward. I think most folks will have similar results if they have a decent smoker. The hard part is choosing seasonings (rubs in particular) so I did hit the local bbq store and buy their recommended rub, but I really think choosing the right wood is just as important as seasoning.

Marisela's voice is made for tunes like \\"Ya no te vayas\\", \\"Sin el\\", \\"Si no te hubieras\\", and \\"Solo con mi soledad\\". Marco Antonio has obviously written these songs with Marisela in mind. This is great Mexican style rock, without ranchero influence. The album pumps right along. If you like Marisela, you'll love this one. My only lament is that Marisela does not sing all of Marco Antonio's songs she's recorded here. And I wish she would do a whole album of duets with Marco."},{"rating":"1","title":"For an opposing view...","review":"Let me preface by saying that I liked THIS book. It was well written with intriguing characters, good plot, and some interesting ideas. But the books that follow are simply terrible.The world is flat, with little to distinguish cultures. Religion is one-sided (with all the fear of the Dark One, why is there NO church to the Creator?) The characters are annoying at best, stereotypical at worst, with sexist overtones. (Female mages, for want of a better word, get their power by being passive and receptive, males by being aggressive and dominating it, etc.)I quit reading the series somewhere in the 6th book. I kept hoping that Jordan would do something that showed the promise of the first book, but it doesn't seem likely. The reason for the praise that is lavished on this series is beyond me, but to each their own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best fantasy series I have ever read","review":"It takes a vast mind to write a story this complex. I is long, and just keeps getting longer, but I don't believe it could all fit into three or four books. With the tremendous length of the story, you have a chance to observe the characters as they mature from innocent country youths into men with, literally, the fate of the world resting on their shoulders. You see how people interact, how some people grow closer together, and others apart. I believe it to be a symbolic mirror of what happens, and is happening, in our own world. There is much to be learned about ourselves and about each other from these insightful books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jordan's Series No Rip Off","review":"Many people have claimed that Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series is a rip off of one story or another. They claim similarities such as a Messiah figure, or mystical castes...if taken in this light, nearly all fiction is a rip off from the world's religious texts. These are standard fixtures in ANY great fantast because they are so deeply rooted in the human psyche. It hits home, and that is what makes it great. Robert Jordan is the best author, in my opinion, to write fantasy in my entire generation. I would strongly encourage ANYone who enjoys reading to check these books out. Also, please feel free to respond to this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading","review":"I purchased this set for my son at Christmas and he has enjoyed them very much.

Particularly when the story was originally intended to be no more than three installments. Fans and publishers alike were clamouring for more and reluctantly Robert Jordan conceded. In his attempt to broaden the story, it became overburdened with sideplots and such that added to the slowing of pace. But this reader wouldn't have had it any other way.

Having read my fair share of fantasy novels I was in utter shock when I picked up \\"The eye of the World\\". Never before had a story mezmorized me so completely. I found myself crying when the characters suffered and laughing when they got thier revenge. I have only one regret about reading this series, THAT FUTURE BOOKS WILL PALE IN COMPARISON AND NOT GET THE RESPECT THE DESERVE.

And believe me I have read a lot of fantasy series and know a good book when I see one. Before I read the wheel of time I probably never would have read a book close to a thousand pages long and now I have read ten. The amazing thing about Jordan is that he can keep your attention no matter how boring it gets. His books are a veritable weaving of plots and sub-plots, the best I have ever seen, except for the Lord of the Rings. Some people say that his later works aren't as good as the other ones and were only written to make money. Personaly I don't think so or care, I hope he never quits writting.

The way it keeps on keeping on, and keeps on being interesting, is quite astonishing. However, RJ has made numerous editing errors which take away from his work. Whilst, IMHO, the work could be so much better, it is still good enough that people are buying the books in droves. Character development is brilliant although Rand is beginning to become a little repetetive, and there are possibly a few too many intertwining plots and characters with separate agendas (especially for male readers) but on the whole a great series. Oh, and the Daughter of Nine Moons is the Empress of Seanchan, or at the very least, a relative. And Bela is just a horse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I should be able to give it a higher number","review":"Because it certainly desrves it. Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney, this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift, but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl, and keep hoping that it will be released.One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace.

Blood World marked the band's morph of death/grind to a mix of death/thrash and a sort of groove metal. Blood World contains probably some of the fastest drumming Mortification has experienced. The double kick factor is outrageous! The guitars are still very heavy, but lack the punchy grind that was very prevelant in previous albums.

I remember it as being much better than this, more exciting, and despite (or because of) the 1938 sound, more atmospheric. To hear the original Goodman band at its best, get \\"Benny Goodman on the Air (1937-1938)\\", Columbia 48836.

Amazing! Wonderful! These are but a few of the accolades that are inadequate to describe the Jasmine Records release of the Benny Goodman Carnegie Hall Concert. I've owned the CBS version for nearly 20 years and have played it through home stereo systems, car stereos, CD/headsets and MP3/headsets hundreds of times. But, listening to the Jasmine 2-CD set the very first time revealed that what I had previously heard was incomplete and inadequate! This recording is as if an acoustic veil has been lifted. Because of Jamine's complete removal of all extraneous noise remnants left from the imperfect recording process and medium of 1938, I heard, with complete clarity, more subtleties, more nuances, and more artistry in the music than I ever imagined possible. I truly felt like I was sitting in Carnegie Hall during the concert!

This is the second album i bought of hers, and my favourite of the two i own. My first remark is that this is a woman not afraid to really sing, and i mean it. In many respects though quite a feminine voice, she sings in a very masculine way, which adds to her charm. The album itself is a mix of solemn ballads and quite jumpy dance techo themes (i dunno if that's the right term). My favourite of them is probably A perfect Day Elise, in many ways reminiscent of Cave's songwriting style. All in all, a difficult one to get into but good for fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"dark and gloomy","review":"its a dark album but the album still incredible and great.It is the greatest albums of 1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful yet understated","review":"The songs on \\"Is This Desire?\\" are more minimalistic, more understated and less emotional than on \\"To Bring You My Love,\\" but no less powerful.

PJ Harvey continues to astound me with a lyrical and musical depth that a lot of her contemporaries completely lack. I can't quite describe Is This Desire?...it is simply fascinating. It's great to hear PJ varying her vocal style with each song. I don't know what it is about her music, but some of it downright scares me. Angelene is a great beginning, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"grand and elegant torment.....","review":"I think we owe it to Polly Jean not to compare this record with To Bring...Love. There may not be a new story to tell, but as in fiction the voice can make or break the tale.And so it is here, as always, provided that we don't dwell on the words: Olympian fury, cascading sadness, an aching, grinding, violent need. Yes, it is subdued, dressed up in sometimes jarring or superfluous gothic affectations. Perhaps, as already hinted on Dance Hall..., it no longer burns - the sound of defeat.But it is this new maturity, this note of resignation and anxiety-perfectly summed up in the title track-that makes this record so compelling. It is that new quaver in the famously raw soprano that makes us think of possibilities ending, doors shutting, and fear and loneliness remaining in a cold dark room. A fabulously Rilkean, despairing record, and almost too painfully vulnerable considering the quasi mythical defiance of her previous work. Still, after all these years, a revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still Polly Jean","review":"P.J. Harvey has been busy the last few years going out on a tangent and making music (soundtracks, compilation albums, etc., etc.)but what we have all been waiting for is now finally here. Polly Jean has emerged from the studio with Flood right behind her and they have in their hands the latest collection of dwelling, screaming, and storytelling from an original and truly unique individual. It seems as though these two really learned quite a bit from their last work together, because this album is definetly an improvement. You might call it mellower than usual, as you will be hard pressed to hear any guitars, but don't be fooled. You don't as much listen to her as you do feel her, and there is a lot to feel here."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAVING MUSIC is a tough job. Give the lady some slack!","review":"Sure like most I was a little disappointed on the first listen of Is this Desire, but within the two years Ive owned this cd, it has become a favourite of mine. Is This Desire, was disappointing at first only because it didnt satisfy my expectations, you know the intense ones that a revolatory artist like Polly is held to from her fans and critics et al. Upon hearing the electronic bleeps and roars on this album I was disapointed Polly was distancing herself from bluesy funk guitar based songs, and sounding more like a dark gothic lady in a black velure robe chanting wicca prayers while surfing the net. But Ive grown up alot in the past two years, and now that I am slightly more mature and finally listening to artists like Ute Lemper and Kurt Weill, I appreciate the sophistication and decadence of Is This Desire. Is This Desire provides unlimited listening, and in that listening delivers unlimited inspiration and mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Like some of the other reviewers I should have paid more attention before I bought. I am unsure how this is titled \\"Original Soundtrack\\". Most of the cuts from the movie are not even on here.

However, this frame does not deliver. As some of the other reviews indicate, I've had problems with the resolution on pictures when viewed on the frame. Actually, one of my biggest complaints is that the software doesn't have a randomize or shuffle feature for your pictures. I suppose this is my fault for not researching better but I figured it was so basic that every frame would have it, but this frame doesn't, so if you slip a 1 or 2 gig card in the frame you'll have to go through every single picture in order. Without random, instead of the nice surprise, \\"Oh, hey, remember that picture?\\" it becomes like sitting through a relative's boring vacation slideshow."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE DIGITAL PHOTO FRAME","review":"IT'S A GOOD DEAL, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A NICE, AFFORDABLE DIGITAL PHOTO FRAME, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DEALS,IT'S PRETTY NICE FRAME, NICE COLOR, NICE RESOLUTION, I LOVED IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"This frame displays pictures ok. But DO NOT USE KODAK'S EASYSHARE SOFTWARE, your better off using windows to transfer files.

When I experienced a problem and sought help from Kodak tech support, I never got the right answer. They danced around the question and never gave me a solution.

VERY simple to use, LOVE that it has internal memory-I put about 55 pictures on the internal memory before wrapping it and left it up to the new owner to decide if they needed to purchase an additional memory card or not. The on/off timer is a great perk, you can set the frame to turn on/off every morning and evening at a specified time. The remote control is another great perk, you have the control to pause and play just like a DVD. The color and clarity of this frame is awesome, fits well with any decor- from office to formal room.

On Dec. 27, I received instructions to fax the sales document and other information to Kodak Accessory Services. I faxed that on Dec. 28. I've heard nothing from Kodak.

You have to be somewhat of a techno nerd to figure it all out.When I read the other reviews for this product, I wondered if the reviewers were actually commenting on the right product.

My only problems with this knife are that the blade is a little short to be used every day and that the handle is too thin to be used comfortably. This knife is probably best suited for small amounts of vegetable prep and can also be used almost like a paring knife with a choke grip. Anything more and its just inefficient. I'd use a larger knife for that. Using a pinch grip you get an okay hold on the knife but still the handle is very thin and is hard to get a good grip. I would recommend getting the 8\\" or even 10\\" version of this knife.

Absolutely!!!","review":"This live (Milan) performance is a wonderful companion to the EMI classic version, which was recorded the same year (if I'm not mistaken--1954). The two versions share the dynamic conducting of Karajan and the exquisite Gretel of Schwarzkopf. Jurinac is a wonderful Hansel, and the rest of the cast is as good as it gets, with the unfamiliar (to me) Vittoria Palombini as hammy a Witch as any German hexe but a much better singer than most. How does it sound in Italian? Unfamiliar, of course, but ultimately just fine--certainly better than in English. The sound is clean mono with virtually no audience noise--the attendees were obviously even more enchanted than I.

In real life the main character is an actual MMA fighter and does all of the stunts. My husband didn't want to see it, but I had heard positive reviews on it, that I had to see it. He actually liked it more than I did. Youtube has some great videos on her training for the movie- look at the fighting scenes and here the actors talk about the bruises they all received. The movie is believable, unlike some of the other more prominent movies with an 80 pound actresses able to bring down a Russian..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Dull","review":"When I saw the list of actors in this movie, I assumed wrongly that it would be more than just a few action scenes held together with a rather dull, uninteresting plot, and bland acting. As a previous reviewer mentioned, why were several very good actors in this movie given the lack of substance with no real chance for good acting? Carano is beautiful, good at what she does obviously, but she is not an actress; you would have thought she would be included to spice it up a bit but not the main show. Once again I was left disappointed as I have been with so many new releases in recent years. They throw some good actors into a movie with a weak plot simply to make a dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnected, disjointed.","review":"This movie was one I had looked forward to for quite a while and now I can't remember why. Without giving anything away, let's say it jumps around a lot, there is very little rhyme and reason as to why things are happening and the cast seems to have less a clue about what was going on than I did. Poor editting, mediocre cinema, poor writing, bad plot, horrible dialog. It's all there. It's just a sad movie and yet I might suggest you watch it . . . so I don't have to suffer alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I love chick-kicks-ass movies, but this one is simply confusing. It's all happening because of an incident in Barcelona, but it's never clear exactly what the incident was. We're left confused as to who are the good guys and bad guys. And the people trying to kill the heroine seem awfully inept. This is the second movie from director Steven Soderbergh to go into the sell-back box. Contagion went there as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow!","review":"I love Gina from American Gladiators and MMA of course. I was so looking foward to see more of her in this movie, but after 20 mins I turned it off. The script was awful, I am not a fan of Tatum because of his lack of enthisiasm on roles. That really made me shut it off. Great stars but that did not help the movie. Hope she gets more roles with a better script so she can shine like I know she can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Poor story - confusing and boring. I almost stopped watching mid-way which is something I hardly ever do. I expected more from this director and cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about hype...","review":"I was excited to see this movie from what I saw of the previews. But when I got it I wish I had rented it first. The plot was at best fair. The story was slow and ill formed. It bordered on cliche with the way it was played out. The characters were not well established and I did not like how the female lead role was beaten more times than I can count in the film. It made the male leads seem very cowardly. I found the movie in many parts to be boring with the ending that was simply laughable and very poorly done. Don't buy it, rent it first and save yourself a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A conversation with a wino would be easier to follow than this movie","review":"The previews looked good, but within 15 minutes of watching the film, I had no idea whether the sequence I was watching was in the past or present. The movie jumped around so much that, before long, I did not care anymore. There are plenty of passable action films out there. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to stop Watching","review":"I gave this movie a full hour to develop and yet it kept dragging. The plot is the usual as other spy double cross movies and it just seemed like it was not going to deviate much from it. Maybe the ending will be good, but I could not take it any longer. First movie in a long time I had to stop watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I demand a refund!","review":"I rented this movie on google and paid $2.99 for it. I want my money back. It was so horrible I didn't even finish watching it. It was sloppy and all over the place. Other than the fight scenes, there was no plot or story line. It was just a hot mess. Spare yourself the frowns of bewilderment and anger. You'll never get those precious moment of life back if you watch it, and believe me - you will want that time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I can't believe how bad the acting is in this movie. For the small parts and bits of lines that the big name, big film, popular GUYS in this movie had it wasn't enough to carry the low budget film through the 1:30 hours. It was BRUTAL to finish. The female, while she had a nice body, was absolutely terrible throughout the film. She couldn't have saved her acting career even if she had done a topless scene. Who is Steven Soberberg? lol. I feel like my 3.99 was totally wasted when I rented this from amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Live Up To Its Hype","review":"Men's Fitness magazine lauded this movie and I was excited to see it.

Her body makes her movement like a sausage spinning on it's end. I may be fussy, I work at a gymnastics academy, but her build is short limbed and her balance is poor. She moves with the grace and power of a three legged dog.She has no sense of comedic timing and delivers her lines with little presence or affect. She doesn't really do much with the dialogue. I could go on but the movie was bad enough.Don't rent this, even if you have trouble sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"this move is horrible and boring all the action you see in the preview is all the action thats in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!","review":"The good: very nice fight sequences.The bad: very POOR storyline and REALLY SLOW between fights.The ugly: I wasted both my time (which I can never get back) & my $!The rest: This was a recommendation for me and boy did they miss the mark!, simply put it was just plan BORING. If you desire to see a much better female spy movie get Salt, it's at least 10 times better. The ONLY reason it gets 2 **s is for the fight scenes, otherwise it would be -1 star.

No the acting wasn't great but that wasn't the problem. The backstory was drawn out and boring. Made it impossible to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie that I want to like, but.","review":"Well, I really wanted to like this movie because of the MA star Gina Carano. She steams up the Octagon with her true fighting skills, but unfortunately MA stars have a hard time making the transition to acting. You would think that with Ewan McGregor that the movie would have some real acting to beef up the other poor acting, but, not so much. It's seemed that the bad acting bug was contagious. The method in which the story line progresses is also bad. I hope that Ms Carano a) does not come hunt me down for this review and b) get turned off with this experience (first movie). I would hope she takes some acting lessons and band together with a better director. I would say watch the movie for some eye candy but it's so bad it's just not worth it, I would say watch one of her real MA fights instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Movie","review":"What to say about this movie.

Love to see a sequel but I'm afraid it won't happen due to box office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Flick","review":"I am an unabashed Soderbergh fan, but I know there is good Soderbergh and bad Soderbergh. This had the potential to be a real knockout in the Bourne vein, but I don't believe it was aiming for such great heights. This is just a fun movie that is really enjoyable. The music really lets us know that this is fun escapism and the set pieces are really cool. And say what you will but Gina Carino was actually pretty good for someone who is not a professional actress. I can see why its getting the negative reviews it's getting but If you know going in that this movie likes to take it's time I think you can see how much fun it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad","review":"I really like and admire Gina Carrano, and I hate to pan this movie, but the directing and screenplay were both just so painfully bad that honesty compels me to do so. Gina Carrano tried her best, and she gives an entirely credible performance, especially considering her background is that of an MMA cage fighter, not an actress. But Steven Soderbergh was a very poor choice of a director for an action film. The Sitcom is his forte, and he apparently has no understanding of any other genre.The story is the same trite, cliche nonsense we have all seen 100 times before, \\"secret agent set up and betrayed by her own agency, and now she's on the run and looking for revenge\\".The military uses the term \\"blivet\\" to mean 20 pounds of steer manure stuffed into a ten-pound bag, and that's a good description of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE! !!¡","review":"OMG! one of the worst movies Ive ever seen! Reminded me of those 1980's B movies they use to do by a company called Golan and Globus. You know the same people who did superman 4 . The fighting scenes are stiff and the story laughable.

Now that all the actors have paid the rent hopefully they can make better action flicks next time. This movie sucked sour grapes. The acting was bad. The plot I'm still trying to grasp. A Bourne movie it is not. The characters are forgettable. The action is sub-par. And if you can keep up with present day and the flash backs, kudos to you. I'm still trying to figure out why the people she worked for even felt the need to set her up. Just an all around confusing mash-up of movie styles and acting that did not work well. Not worth the rental price and certainly not worth the price a theater would charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should've listened to the reviews!","review":"I was going to rent this movie online through Amazon but the reviews mainly stated the movie was horrible. So I decided to save a couple bucks and rented it through Redbox. Geez, I should've listened to the reviews and not rented it period!I forced myself to watch at least half of the movie before turning it off. The few fight scenes I viewed are so slow, it literally looks as if the actors are saying \\"ok now you hit me\\"...\\"ok now I kick you\\". The music during the fight scenes make it even more boring. The only thing I can get out of this movie is that Gina is beautiful...but I could google pics of her for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Such a disappointment with so many good actors involved.

Bravo!I do hope we see her in more films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best action movie of the year!","review":"Finally an action movie that doesn't have only gun fights.

What a terrible mistake. I am not a UFC fan but I am a fan of strong female characters so I think I can give a less agenda-driven opinion on this movie.The main character could barely act, the famous actors in this film were terrible, the story was not complicated but the director kept flashing back to make it appear more complicated, the fight scenes were totally unrealistic (except for one), the lighting was lousy, minutes spent watching the main character walk through the streets or meander over the roof (????), totally uncreative swipes between scenes.....I could go on but I think I've wasted enough of my life on this piece of junk.Unless you're an unwavering disciple of this director or a cheerleader for this untalented female fighter, your chances of really enjoying this movie are slim to none."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe people have been eagerly waiting for this to come out...","review":"This movie sucks, simple as that.

No reason to torture yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring movie","review":"A very disappointing and boring movie. Especially the first half, the pace is too slow for audience to care. And the flashback narrative makes the story chaotic and draw-out. For all your people out there who want to watch Gina Carano, there are not many fighting scenes in the movie. That did make me wonder why they cast her in the first place. The movie was only in my local theater for one week, so I have to spend $7 on train in addition to the movie ticket. After I finished watching, I understood why it made so little money at boxoffce.The casts are talented, but that doesn't make the movie much more watchable since they weren't given much to do.Bottom line is, ordinary people won't enjoy this movie, and neither will most extraordinary people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a terrible rip-off Salt...","review":"Yes, I did see the movie, on demand. It was atrociously boring for the first 45 minutes. The lead actress does a good job in her role, but everyone else is expendable and brings nothing to the table.The real issue is that this movie is a terrible rip-off of the exciting, action-packed Angelina Jolie flick \\"Salt.\\" That movie was fast-paced, had a lot going on, and every actor delivered greatly. This movie is the exact opposite. The makers of \\"Haywire\\" should be sued for literally stealing exact scenes, which include the accused woman trying to get out of the main building.Their working on a script to \\"Salt 2\\" right now, just wait for it's release-don't do we I did and watch this garbage to suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Salt","review":"This film unfairly cast some allure due to the expansive supporting cast and director. While it was entertaining, in a sense, to see so many favorite actors age; that wasn't the reason I purchased the film. I purchased the film expecting to enjoy a B+ movie with some satisfying direction and a good supporting cast rooting around in a film written by Lem Dobbs who actually hasn't written anything worthwhile since the \\"Score\\" 10 years ago (hence the B+). I also lulled myself into thinking that Steven Soderbergh may have had some real influence in the film besides subsequently whiling away his time boring me with 5 minutes of Gina Carano running around in the film. Yes she can run. Yes, she can beat up guys. But can she act? Poorly directed, poorly written and the poorest acting by the \\"star\\"; I can only recommend this film to...no one!

The lead actress wasn't even big name (nor will she ever be) and she was just awful. Poor acting, Poor script, poor dialog, all-round disappointing. Even the fight scenes didn't look real. The actors looked like they were just practicing their choreography in the fight scenes. You could actually see them move into position to take a hit. I knew after the first totally unbelievable scene the whole movie would be bad but watched the whole thing anyway. The film jumps all over the place without making it clear why, and drops characters without explanation shortly after they are inserted into the plot.My copy had subtitles I couldn't get rid of, but they came in handy when I realized half the dialog was mumbled. Glad I got it from the library, because I would have felt bad even paying $1 at Redbox for this.

Now, all not is bad, the fight scenes were good...the MMA background really shows, Her acting wasn't bad for a beginner (call it first movie gitters), and I guess the producers figured out that the movie could sell and keep most of the male attention by getting and incredibly sexy woman to kick a$$ and take names while at it... Well it worked, but not for long. If you really had nothing to do one day, and are just vegging out on the couch and the remote happens to be right by your hand, aaaand the movie is either on tv or already loaded in whatever device you have.... then watch it, other than that dont go out of your way to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gina's acting debut....","review":"Gina's acting was good but the movie itself was terrible.

No one seems to know what happened but everyone wants to know. I'll tell you what happened in Barcelona, she didn't like loose ends. Which of course means she'll chase someone for about 15 minutes through the streets of Spain, after being shot at by said person, all so she can hit him a few times and leave him alive. In the end she tells her team mates who ask, 'where'd you go?', that she doesn't like loose ends... Cause when I think of tieing up loose ends, I'm talking about punching someone a couple times then walking away after they took me on a 15 minute chase... Fail.So much more but I won't ruin the rest in case someone wants to watch it for an action flick. If it was intended to be a cheesey comedy with a little action, then it was...acceptable... But a rock your sox off action flick of epic proportions...no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast forward failure","review":"On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this movie a 1, but only because I couldn't give it a 0.The plot is so slow and boring that I had to fast forward over 95% of it at 4X speed to keep from falling asleep. And even at that I couldn't take it anymore about halfway through and ejected the DVD so I could watch a rerun of Gunsmoke.Gina is hot, but her fight scenes mainly consist of her getting jumped from behind and getting beat up. She ultimately prevails with some ground submission thing out of Gracie jujitsu which is inconsistent with the rest of the fight.The other action scenes mainly consist of her running away from someone.I don't know if the second half of the movie is any better, but I didn't want to fast forward through it long enough to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST BUT NICE RACK","review":"Lost in the beginning, lost in the middle, figured it out in the end, But what saves the movie is the pretty women with the nice rack! lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!","review":"I'm an action movie lover from way back and my wife normally tells me the movies I say were not that bad were in fact really bad.

Not once, because I gave it the benefit of the doubt that I may have been more tired than I thought and tried watching it again when I woke up at 12:30 am (I usually go to bed around 2am but fell asleep at 10pm watching this film) and ended up falling asleep again and sleeping on the couch all night.

Do not make the same mistake, ever!! The movie moved along at a torturously slow pace and is a good cure for insomnia. Even the soundtrack and sound effects are muffled n obviously third rate. If u must get this movie, save some money n get the DVD. The bluray is not HD and is so blurry I had to check the box to make sure I had not inserted a DVD by mistake.Still wondering why established actors will get themselves involved in such a pathetic excuse for a movie.One of the worst movies on bluray I have purchased in the last 3 years.

After all, the rest of the project is packed with veteran actors and a genius director.You would be wrong. Carano is a credible actress with charisma, sex appeal, and unusual beauty. Plus, she kicks ass. She is the only reason to watch this terrible movie.The plot is shopworn, the dialog trite, the direction lifeless. Even Irish and Spanish locales seem to be chosen randomly. A couple of fight scenes are okay though not inventive.Only Gina Carano is worth seeing. Let's hope this is not her only feature, and that next time she gets a proper showcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad B movie","review":"This is almost as pathetic as striptease. Awful acting.

I wasn't even sober and it still was terrible! Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"Well that was two hours I'll never get back. Plot never came together and Michael Douglas & Bill Paxton seem to just be thrown into plot for star power. Action scenes were lame. Yeah she can kick box but her acting was forced. Funny there's a photo of her on cover shooting tow guns at once. I think I saw her shoot one gun maybe one time during movie. Don't waste your time and I can't believe anyone said this was a good movie. It belongs in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldnt wait for it to end","review":"just not enjoyable at all. alot of scenes could have been shortened, so much long silences. only thing that was descent was the fighting, but even thaT looked too choreographed. and i just didnt believe her as an actress. best she sticks to MMA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right actor picked to play the part","review":"They did a superb job in filling the female lead for this movie, she plays the part well. On the other hand she didn't have a lot script to work with, most of the story doesn't start (present time) till the middle of the movie. The first half is just filler and back story. I really liked it, and it seems they may try to make a sequel with the way the movie ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action flick","review":"Really enjoyed this movie.

There were so many terrific actors in it that it should have been better. Unfortunately, the primary character, was not one of those actors. The plot was underdeveloped, the main character unlikeable, and it seemed to go on forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie; great fight sequences","review":"Given the amount of A-List talent in this film, it's surprising how bad it is.Contrary to what others have said, it's not Carano's acting ability that's at fault; she's not a stuper-star, but she was competent enough.It wasn't the music, either, though admittedly, it was pretty bad.No, it was the script's fault, primarily, followed by the directing. The film just didn't have much of a story to tell: at least, not one we hadn't already seen five hundred million times before. Character development was inadequate, too; Carano's character is a cipher.But the fight sequences were damn good. If only there had been more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really should have paid more attention to the reviews","review":"Let this be a lesson - don't look at the number of stars, read the reviews. With the number of big name actors, how could this movie be so blah? About the only positive point I can make is that the unarmed fight scenes looked realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so with very long running scenes","review":"The fight scenes were realistic, but short compared to the time they spent filming her run after bad guys or the really long time she spent getting away from the police in the first chase with little to no action.The movie should of been titled \\"The Running Girl\\".The music was awful as well, presumably in an effort to make up for the lack of dialogue and the main characters extremely bad acting skills.With the number of \\"A\\" list actors in the cast, the movie should of been a lot better, but they appeared to sleep walk through the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad date... You can only take so much.","review":"I have to admit, i watch more movies then a socially acceptable person should. So when i saw the previews for this action/thriller i knew i would have to see it. What a waste of 10 bucks.... The only memorable part (and it is only memorable to me cause i laughed so hard) is the L.E.O part. The rest of the movie was over shadowed my how completely bad the main actress (quite possibly could be an actor, the verdict is still out)is through out the entire film. The fight sceens are pretty good, but they way they filmed it makes it look staged. But hey, what do I know. If you think this movie looks like your cup of tea, i incourage you to give it a sip. Its all about a persons point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Unfortunately i was super excited to go see this movie in theaters, and was super disappointed. they used the music from ocean's 11 to mission impossible action. and it was silent during some fight scenes. good parts completely given away in trailers. the actors were fine, some of my favorites to this day, i would even like to see the break-thru-female lead in more action films, but the direction of this film was a snore. the story could have been told much better. you could have added another hour of filming to the story and cut out the parts that you snooze through. just very disappointing all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"I want my two hours back!

And let's face it that is the only reason any man would watch it. Gina Carano is a very gifted athlete and is extemely skilled in martial arts.

I found myself thinking okay she's in trouble but its a flash back, so that kinda destroyed the film for me along with the phrase \\" get to the point \\", with a great cast this was a bust of a movie which was sad.

I literally fell asleep about 20 minutes into this movie. There is very little character development, dialogue, or background, all of which would have been helpful to explain the loosely woven fight scenes.Overall this was no \\"Taken,\\" and definitely not a Jason Statham movie (unless maybe Killer Elite). I had such high hopes for a female focused movie - very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow boring burn","review":"Haywire makes no sense whatsoever.

There was no plot and little rhyme or reason for the next action sequence. It was a shock that Michael Douglas made a cameo in this film. He must be hard up for cash. This was a waste of time making it and viewing it. Don't waste your money or time. This film is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly dull","review":"This movie could not decide what it wanted to be. One the one hand, it tried to be an intelligent Le Carre style spy thriller, but the plot and the acting were simply not good enough to pull that off. On the other hand, it also tried to be the female Bourne, but the action sequences felt contrived and thrown in for no logical reason. Gina Carano is not going to be the next action heroine, and I would be very surprised if we see her at all in another film. Haywire is a perfect example of how amalgamating a significant amount of talent in one place does not necessarily result in a good or even decent product. Half way through the movie, I grabbed my laptop and just kept the film running in the background; I simply did not care about what happened next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and unbelievable","review":"I watched this movie yesterday and I want my $2 rental fee back! :/ The plot is extremely thin, the acting, especially of the lead actress, is awful, and towards the end the heroine's dad makes a mistake that should have been obvious to the bad guy but apparently nobody notices it. The lead actress runs around hiding in a very identifiable hat and has next to no morals...that's probably the only realistic part of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Montage movie","review":"This movie is one large series of montages.

I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Bad","review":"This movie revealed to me how difficult it must be to make a good action thriller. Sure, Gina's acting is awful, even painful, but that wasn't the worst part. The movie spends long stretches of time exploring boring, tedious moments set to ridiculous, comically bad smooth jazz. You keep waiting for a reason to care, and it never comes. Watch the four action scenes on Youtube instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most anticipated of 2012? My bad.","review":"SO-DER-BEEEEERRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! This was one of my most anticipated films of 2012, and now, after seeing it, I feel like it fizzled. The film was OK but not as good as the trailer makes it out to be. The story is simple, which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that a lot of needless plot points were thrown in. I've always felt like director Steven Soderbergh is very overrated; his films aren't that good. And this proves that point. The cast itself was stellar (Carano is beautiful and can majorly kick butt), and I like the way the hand-to-hand combat scenes had no music or fancy sound effects, but a so-so story and lackluster ending make this film forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haywire a terrible movie","review":"With all the big stars this was an absolute waste of their talent.

He may be made 3 cameo appearances-seems they added him to get people to watch. This movie is not worth seeing. It is so UNDER budget, just running threw the city streets fighting. There really is no plot, if you can figure out what was going on by the end of the movie you are lucky. This was almost as bad as a documentary.

I'm glad I did not waste my 5.00. It was confusing throughout the whole movie. Yes, there were a lot of action scenes but it appears to me that the main character was always walking somewhere.

Usually at worst we can entertain ourselves by mocking the movie if it is lame. This was an exception. It wasn't even worth mocking... we just all sat there scratching our heads. The movie struck me as an art students attempt to overuse every possible film stylization ad nauseam. As some of the other reviewers said; absolute waste of time and money. If only we had stuck with watching the trailer.... it was the most entertaining thing they filmed for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"good action very thin plot","review":"The movie showed lots of promise on the trailer, but the plot was too thin and the story line invisible over the action sequences, great delivery by Gina Cararo, better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Movie, Great Action Scenes!","review":"Although I would venture to say this movie was really more of a 3.5 in my book, since I had to chose 3 or 4, I decided to round it up to 4 rather than mark it down any more. While I felt the plot could have been strengthened a little and that some of the acting was kinda subpar, I felt that in the end it was a decent movie and did have a fairly good premis. Plus, the action scenes in it, I must admit, were pretty awesome. She kicked some serious @$$ on many occasions throughout this movie. If you're an action/thriller fan, give this movie a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot action","review":"Great action and awesome performance from Gina Carano. One of her hand to hand combat scenes is worth the whole movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, even better Karate Nina...","review":"I had to share my opinion of this movie as it is under rated by others. This is a movie you should watch. It has an interesting plot although is at times difficult to follow easily. I chose it for the plot while expecting I would see mediocre \\"non realistic\\" fight scenes presented by regular actors like most films present to us. I was pleasantly surprised! What I found was not a high budget film but it had a solid plot, solid acting, an interesting story line with very realistic fight scenes. As a woman in the martial arts, I could actually believe those techniques would work as presented to us by Gina. Little did I know when I watched the movie that Gina was an MMA champion turned actress but it all made sense later when I learned this. What a nice change and a great movie idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Angelina...","review":"Gina Carano was fantastic and beautiful to watch in this movie. Enjoyed the real life feeling of the movie and the fighting style. No slow motion or recap of take downs. The story flowed well...only disappointed the movie wasn't about 30 minutes longer. I'll look for her in future movies. Really loved her style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even A Good Family Film","review":"Saw this on VHS a few years ago and figured all the copies had been burned and the ashes spread to the four corners of the Earth. Imagine my surprise to see it appear on DVD now. Was somebody clamouring to see a movie starring John Astin, Lou Rawls and Judge Reinhold? I think not. The story involves some nonsense about a camp called betaville where leaders of the world send their children to be safe and sound...until two warring planets decide to get Earth mixed up in their squabble. An Emissary comes to Camp Betaville to warn the children and now President Sender (John Astin) and his scientists have to come up with a secret weapon to stop the alien invaders led by the \\"charismatic\\" Tim Kazurinsky.

I actually chose it by accident for a school assignment, the cover art reminded me somewhat of the game Zelda64, which I was really into at the time. I loved the book so much, I stepped out of reality and into the world created by the novel every time I picked it up, and that says a lot, because I am not a reader in general. Everything was crafted flawlessly, from the beautiful environment to the interaction of the characters with each other. I highly recommend this book, it's an incredible story. I rated it 5 stars, but it really deserves more. It's a masterpiece. Powerful. Exceptional. Unbeatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"faraway lurs review","review":"I am in the process of reading The Faraway Lurs. It is a really enjoyable book; the author doesn't make the tribes sound primative, rather the way you have lived for your whole life. Wolfstone is a wonderful Romeo character, and Heather poses as a gutsy Julliet. The Swampwife and Buzz also add interest to the story. It is so intriguing that it is based on a true story of a Danish girl found in a peat bog, who dissolved almost immediatly after reaching the air.

They have improved the graphics and gameplay tomake it more realistic. Its improved owner mode will make footballrage with joy. The new owner mode will allow you to make new andbetter stadiums. You'll be able to keep players but your cap roomwon't go down as much. And greatest thing is you actually haveto play like an all-star to score, which you're scores won'tbe 80 poitns to 70.

The QB doesn't have a quick release after a bootleg. your QB stops cold if he's going to be sacked (before your tackled). The game crashed to my desktop a number of times. The animation is choppy. The only part that's go is being able to control your Defense which works just part of the time. Your corners get beat deep in and are stupid half the time. The game still decides who is going to win and allow oppnents mircale plays that just seem to get past your coverage designed against the play. OVER ALL IT SUCKS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $7","review":"This is by far one of the worst unrealistic stories I have ever read. Everything centered around money and sex and there are many other factors of life that come into play when you are successful, middle-aged, and black. If Jada & Wellingtion had a real relationship than sure it would be believable that they were soulmates. Sex doesn't mean they needed to be together forever. In my opinion the storyline about Wellington's adoption was more interesting. I will never read the sequel to this mess of a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but I just don't see it.","review":"I usually do not like to write deconstructive reviews. However, I just finished this book and I am annoyed at myself for spending the time to get to the end of it! I don't understand why so many people were excited about this book. I counted at least four times where the author decided to say, \\"He looked like *so \`n so celebrity*,\\" instead of actually describing the person. That made me feel cheated, and it was certainly condescending. The idea of \\"soulmates\\" was never developed, and the only thing that we saw between the two main characters was that they were sexually compatible. Also, if it was an underdeveloped story but had some great sex scenes, that might have at least been entertaining. However, there was no passion, no sensuality in those scenes. There were just graphic words describing the mechanical act of sex. My feeling at the end was, \\"so what???\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the worst","review":"I have been out of the loop of reading these type of books. I started with Eric J.

I was not use to how the lead character Jada would go to Church on Sunday and have a threesomes and lots of sex acts the rest of the week. Even though I am in my 20's I guess i'm just to much of a prude for a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Story Dissipates","review":"I really was not feeling this book at all. The characters seemed to be very material people and I agree with the other reviewers that wondered how Jada and Wellington were soulmates.

Its poorly written, with flat characters, an undeveloped storyline, and absolutely no depth. As a reader, it was much like watching people you hate make a total mess of their lives, and because you don't get to care about the characters, you just don't feel anything. I did, however, come up with a lengthy list of typos and grammatical misfortunes, as they were plentiful.If you like trashy soaps just for the sake of entertainment, this MAY satisfy you. As horrible as it sounds, even the trashiest soap operas are more thoroughly thought out than this waste of dead trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghetto Book","review":"Even though the book was ok.

The only reason I can assume that it even got good ratings was because of the sex scenes. But otherwise it didn't live up to the name at all. There was no valid reason why the reader should think that Jada & Wellington were soulmates. I agree with the review from the reader who also pointed out that neither of them got to know each other...this was poor character developement & subtext. And it was unrealistic to believe that Jada would so easily participate on the threesome given how she hated Wellington's house guest/friend. It's a good thing that this is fiction cause it surely read like a bad soap opera. And the ending was the worst, it was soooo obvious that the author wanted to bait the reader to buy the sequel. Well it won't get my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Mars Colonization Novels Ever","review":"I had not read any of Jerry Pournelle's other books, when I picked this up years ago. It is an amazingly good yarn dealing with the now cliched notion of the colonization of Mars. The lead protagonist Garrett is given the option to stay in jail in overcrowded earth or get shipped out to Mars on a work detail.He opts for the latter and gets involved in a revolution to free Mars from the oppressive multinational corporations back on earth.

In the end, this husband is the one who kills the beast, almost completely out of the blue.

The premise was promising, but Henry failed to deliver. I found myself disappointed with the 2-dimensional characterization, predictable plot turns, and lack of innovation on the author's part. This book could have been so much more. At many junctures it read like a poor imitation of David Weber's Honor Harrington. Henry needs to be able to take us deeper into the character's head, and to create characters that seem more like real people instead of just action-oriented pawns through which to move the plot along.The other thing I took issue with was the author's lack of innovation when it came to his hero's problem solving abilities. Throughout most of the book, it seemed to me as if solutions kept falling into Sinclair's lap, and many of his problems were also solved seemingly by accident or through some convenient act of serendipity.A letdown.Read Honor Harrington instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for a short visit or for travel planning","review":"If I was taking just one guide, 'Eyewitness Travel Guide to Moscow' would be my first choice. Although it is starting to age (published in 1998) it is a good visual and historic guide to Moscow, with enough color photographs to both inspire and guide you.As other reviewers have noted, this book is ideal to use to review with a tour guide the sights and areas that you want to see because of its diagrams, pictures and suggested itineraries.The history and art sections are reasonably good for a guide book.The restaurant and hotel suggestions are a bit stale, and the pricing is out of date (although the range of pricing is still reasonably accurate)."},{"rating":"2","title":"First trip to Moscow","review":"I consider this book a best offer to buy, as it is fully illustrated and very informative about Moscow, including a brief introduction to its history, places to visit, everyday and cultural lives, tips to sightseeing and whatever a tourist whishes to know in first hand before visiting Moscow and around. It's also a how-to guide for those who want to be well informed about Moscow, which includes informatios about trains, subway, bus, trolleybus, taxis and car rental.

Many insights were given that explained alot of what we see over the short T.V. bursts that we get here in the States. If you admire Michael now, you will adore him after reading this book. If you are neutral about him I bet you will be cheering him on at the next GP you watch. If you hate him now you at least will understand a lot of what he thinks about himself and why.

I understand McCartney's wish for a cool approach, to go along with the subtlety of the music, but what's the point of releasing a record if nobody knows about it?I love this record--there is a guitar riff that floats in and out of \\"fluid\\" that I can't get enough of. Oddly enough, this instrumental record reminds me more of the first \\"McCartney\\" solo LP than anything else (except, perhaps, early Pink Floyd) (kidding).So quick--why does McCartney choose \\"The Fireman\\" for his alter ego?Because \\"The Fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,\\" as he said in \\"Penny Lane.\\"Very strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tubular Bells' with more drums.....","review":"We were always told that John was the most 'avant-garde' Beatle......wrong !

Despite being divided into 8 tracks, this works best as one complete work, as musical themes keep re-appearing all the way through.

There just were too many competitive girl singers around when she had the big label record deal, and too few \\"killer songs\\" up for grabs. Suzy's immediate predecessor, Lacy J.

Meanwhile Hazel Marie, Miss Julia's erstwhile housemate, is involved in a beauty pageant which will raise money for the sheriff's department. She, Miss Julia, and the flirtatious Etta Mae Wiggins, are in charge of the pageant and the contestants, a rag-tag group of six girls which present a real challenge to their mentors.

The only other reason to get it would be the cool Japanese packaging, with a completely different cover (two badazz girls instead of one), & some extra pictures (including a little cartoon of each band member) inside.I actually like the post-Ramones ramones, mostly cause they didn't change much or experiment. Maybe they know they can't. But Marky especially sounds like he thinks the Ramones are still together but with renewed energy & dirtier songs. Maybe Johnny was the problem all along as far as that goes. Of course, the Beatles & the Ramones were a group of four people each who had a special musical chemisty together, but I still welcome these solo albums & their echoes of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, cliched story-Predicible plot","review":"Okay, first of all, Nick was Jessica's true love, but now he's disappeared??

Jessica, who loves the limelight turns down the chance to STAR in a major play?? It doesn't fit. The ending of this story is totally predictable. I hate that the summer books are so unrelated to the rest of the series--why not just write them as a separate edition instead of fitting them in the regular, numbered SVU books? The whole New York story would have been better off on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this book","review":"Sorry guys, I really liked this one! I agree, it's kind of irritating that the summer books have so little to do with the rest of the series, but still, I thought that these were about a million times better than the lifeguard books last summer! Basically, I like any books that have to do with the New York acting scene, it's so much more hip than lifeguards! I just read a really great non SVU book about that (the NY acting thing) called \\"Acting Normal\\". I'd love to know if any SVU fans have read it also, and what they think about it. Last thing -- doesn't everyone wish that Tom and Elizabeth would \\"get on\\" with their relationship?"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book was pretty good","review":"this was a good book! the only thing i don't like about the summer books is that they have nothing to do with the books during the year! the author should connect all the books instead of seperating things and confusing the readers! the play was a great success and everything turned out well in the end, with everyone being happy again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid follow up to a great debut disc","review":"When I first bought this CD, I wasn't sure because I hadn't heard any of the songs, but it's been stuck in my CD player ever since.

Why in the heck did they let put out a record that is so bad. Why Do They Rock So Hard? is horrible. It isn't ska. It isn't punk/ska. It is a rock n' roll album with some ska beats every once in a while. Not a ska album with some rock beats like before. Reel Big Fish used to be my favorite band. I was so looking forward to this album but now that I've heard it I am very disappointed. They are playing music they think will sell, not what they like. Think about that. Why did they do this? They are starting to sound like Chicago, but Chicago was good at what they did. Just like RBF was good at ska. Guess they don't play that anymore. I think you the guys should start asking hemselves what happened to their music. Ask them how much money they think they are gonna make. They just lost 13 bucks because I'm bringing this back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a bunch of really good fun ska songs.","review":"Reel big Fish are now known across not only California but now the nation. Their last release \\"turn The Radio off\\" was a success. Now they're back with even more funny, sarcastic songs. Including the first single \\"The Setup (You Need This)\\" is a great wild song that truly shows Reel Big Fish's expertise in the ska area. While other songs such as \\"Everything Is Cool\\" displays their infamous hardcore action. One last note, watch out for the naughty hidden track at the end"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why they rock so hard!","review":"The first song I ever heard on this CD was \\"Scott's A Dork\\". I appreciated it since Scott is my brother's name. I insisted that my friend loan it to me. Now I listen to it every day in the morning! The horns are a great pick-me-up.

RBF still have a hint of their old ska foundation, however, on this CD they seem more like a hard rock band from the seventies than a ska band. Even though the ska/punk sound isn't so distinctive on Why do the rock... you stll know that it's a RBF album because their usual humore is still there and there a plenty of great songs like, \\"Somebody Hates Me\\" and \\"The Set Up\\".

If you are a Reel Big Fish fan, then what are you waiting for? But it! This CD rocks. There are plenty of awesome songs, like Somebody Hates Me, The Set Up (You Need This), and definately Down In Flames. My favorite is Down In Flames. It has to be one of the best songs Reel Big Fish has ever done and is one of the best ska songs! it is very catchy, it is not 2 minutes long (try 4:49), and it takes seconds to fall in love with it. Slightly better than their other album \\"Turn The Radio Off\\", it is just a rockin' CD. But, it still has its \\"ok\\" songs that you might skip when listening to it. This is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. But this is NO reason NOT to buy it -- about 90% of the music on this CD is ska-punk goodness that you'll eat right up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Reel Big Fish God?","review":"Yes, absolutely yes. This is one of the best produced ska albums around that I have heard. This cd has sat in my cd player since the day i got it.

Any fan of Save Ferris, Less Than jake, or early Catch 22 should love this cd. BUY IT AND LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the question should be, \\"HOW do they rock this hard?\\"","review":"It should not be possible for a band to be this skilled. i love reel big fish, and this cd, is probably my favorite.

I didn't approve. Then I pulled it out again a month later and listened again, and it began to grow on me. Thought the lyrics aren't as sophisticated as in Turn The Radio Off, it sounds like the boys are having a hell of a lot of fun with this one. Now this album is the main attraction on my stereo, and I get something different out of it each time. And dangit if The Set Up isn't the most singable song I've heard in a long time!! I love the guitar work and the Pilfers crossover. I say this is one of the best albums I've bought in a long time, and I can't wait for the next evoulution in the RBF discography. REEL BIG FISH ROCKS SO HARD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Because nobody else will!","review":"Reel Big Fish has taken it upon themselves to save the face of rock, and they definitly succeed! Lyricaly, it's no different from any other albums they have made, but musicaly, it showcases some of the best guitar oriented rock that we've seen in quite some time. the horn section is Magnificent, and the rythem section combines ska and rock beats to perfection. Through in the fact the Aarron Barrett is newly established as a premier rock guitarist, and you have some of the heaviest, crunchiest, funnest rock to hit the radio this decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll learn to love it!","review":"i didn't like it first the first time i listened to it all, and i went back to \\"turn the radio off\\" but after a few days of getting used to their new sound, it totally kicked a$$!!

First off, although some of the music is very good, the lyrics have obviousely not been developed into anything particularly rememberable. The hooks are generally pretty weak. The song \\"Scott's a Dork\\" actually has a section where they repeat the word \\"dork\\" like 32 times. Plus, throughout the album they display this morbid obsession with the fact that they had one really popular single and now they can't get back on the radio. For a band that rocked so hard because they DIDN'T want to be big rock stars, this is pretty dissapointing. I could relate to just about all the songs on the first album but I can't relate to these at all.

This is the one I stick in the stereo when I'm tired of everything. I could listen to this front-to-back a dozen times and rock out to it on every trip.That said, if you like ska, you can't do without this album. It takes a classic ska band and blends a hip pop/rock sense with their self-deprecating lyrics, slick guitar riffs, infectious drumming and honey-sweet horns. My favorite songs include \\"Down in Flames\\", \\"We Care\\" and \\"The Setup (You Need This).\\" It also includes the classic...tear that is \\"Everything Is Cool.\\" Trust me, if you like songs about the ... things in life set to music that'll make you dance in spite of it, you will NOT regret buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Freud or Jung but close enough","review":"I have been facinated with dreams since I was a child (I think we all are fascinated with dreams) so I have read as much material on this subject, from the mystic to the more cognitive stuff.

He is good on the guitar but he just hasn't got the voice to carry off a good blues vocal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Steve Miller Band","review":"An excellent 3 CD set tracing the entire spectrum of Miller's career highlighting his varied musical styles. Most of his finest works appear here. Childs Medley and Les Paul & Steve add little and could have been omitted. What detracts from this set however, is that there are only small excerpts from Jackson-Kent Blues, Sacrifice, Baby's House, and Song for Our Ancestors. A 4 CD set would have been a more polished effort to include full-length versions of the aforementioned titles and other Miller standout tunes such as Sugar Babe, Brave New World, Window, and Heart Like a Wheel. Overall a fine effort worth the price and probably the best compilation of Miller tunes around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use, but mine drops connection often","review":"I purchased the Microsoft Wireless G Base Station and matching PCI card for my desktop. The base station works great and is rock solid with my notebook.The Microsoft Desktop Wireless card is a different story. Sure it was easy to set up, but is constantly losing the wireless connection, forcing me to tell it to reconnect. My desktop is just on the other side of the room from the base station, so range isn't a problem. When I'm connected the software tells me I've got a Strong connection, then it just loses it every 5 minutes or so. I can't download any large files on this computer because it loses the connection too often.This baby is being exchanged for a different brand of Wireless G PCI card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improper description","review":"Recieved the product in a timely manner but the product description indicates this will work with windows 98 version 1 but the box reads that I need Windows 98 SE"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very compatible.","review":"I have an airport extreme network which works fine with my iBook, my Motion computing wireless (intel) and even the xbox MN-740 wireless adapter.

This is the BEST musical version of Christmas Carol. The cast for this show was wonderful. Partice Munsel is fantastic as Belle, Scrooge's almost wife. Her duets with Vic Damone \\"Golden Dreams\\" and \\"It Might Have Been\\" are truely memorable. There is one song that shouldbe a Christmas staple, \\"Birthday Party for the King\\". Another is \\"Yes, There is a Santa Claus\\".The idea of using the Four Lads as caroleers who bracket parts of the story was inspired. Their \\"Stingiest Man In Town\\" is just great. The whole cast is simply perfect.There are many extra tracks on this CD that only add to making it terrific.The Four Lads calypso \\"Mary's Boy Child\\" is exciting and will make you want to start dancing.If you have seen the cartoon version using the same songs, it just can not give an idea of how wonderful this original version is. This is a CD that can be played all year, not just during Christman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful memories and songs. If only a video survived!","review":"I grew up with this music during the holiday's. It is a wonderful combination of inspired actors and songs. Basil Rathbone is a terrific Scrooge (who knew he could sing!?) and The Four Lads as good as any Greek chorus. For many years I'd wander into used record stores just to see if there was a copy of this album only to have record players go the way of the dodo. I do have the album and a record player but they are both well beyond their prime. This is a treat to find available on CD. The animated video does not do the music or story justice.

These guys don't know the meaning of the word \\"snoozefest\\"! OH, YEAH!! Hearing Steven screech \\"WALK THIS WAAAY!!\\" is music to my ears! And when they start playing \\"Dream On\\", I can just picutre all the fans waving their lighters.When they finally finish the second set (CD nuber two), I can just picture the fans SCREAMING for more.

There are two discs, and there are twelve songs on disc one and eleven songs on disc two. The best songs on this album ( because of how good the songs actually are and how good they sound performed live) are \\"Angel\\", \\"Janie's Got a Gun\\", \\" Walk On Down\\", and \\"Crazy\\".

This is what ROCK is all about. The mastery of Steven and the artistry of The group shines with every note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Aerosmith","review":"\\"A Little South of Sanity\\" is an awesome live album by one of the best rock bands ever. It is a must have item in every music fan's collection. The sound is of great quality, the execution is perfect and the feeling is the best part. Something to be noticed is Steven Tyler's incredible voice. He reaches the high notes as if he was still 20 something, but we must remember he's nowhere near that age anymore. The guitars sound amazing, the drums are so fulfilling and the bass is effective. Joe Perry is an icon with those Gibson Les Pauls he plays, him and Slash and Jimmy Page are the best at what they do with those guitars. The set list is great, because it selects songs from old and recent Aerosmith records. If people complain about some missing tunes, well, if those you wanted were included, they would've removed other songs, so stop it and enjoy one of the best live-greatest hits records to ever hit the stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith Rocks!!!!!!!!","review":"Aerosmith is the best band of all time! They could rip it up in the 70's, 80's, and can still do it now. They have some of the best guitar riffs, and this album shows it so well. Steven Tyler is awesome(even if he is ancient). Again this album is awesome, SO BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thing that rocked harder was the concert","review":"Aerosmith may be rapidly approaching the \\"social security\\" age, but they can still play a kick@$$ concert to sold out stadiums. The energy is high, all the songs are tight, and nobody is more alive than the band on stage. And amazingly, \\"A Little South of Sanity\\" manages to capture that same energy on a CD. It's a great place to start your collection, and if you're already an Aerohead, it's a vital addition to an Aerosmith collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good live show of a band in decay.","review":"Ok, don't let the title of this review fool you. Aerosmith is one of the greatest american rock band, blah, blah, blah. But let's face it: their records aren't getting any better. So why is this live album good? Because it can work as a live greatest hits collection, having classics tunes like \\"Mama Kin\\", \\"Dream On\\" and \\"Last Child\\" and songs from the later Aerosmith Era like \\"Rag Doll\\", \\"Eat The Rich\\" and \\"Living On The Edge\\".Along the music, Aerosmith shows that they are alive, they can still rock hard (and they know how to). But also that their songs, as the red wine, get better with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale of two Aerosmiths","review":"Aerosmith has been transformed.. from a great rock and roll band into a collection of aging rock stars whose main purpose in life seems to be getting all dressed up but with no musical place to go.Originally Aerosmith was synonymous with hard driving blues based rock, but sadly this album shows more of a penchant for sloppy sentimental ballads than for paint peelin' rockers.It all depends on what you are looking for. A lot of people like the new Aerosmith, with the 'sensitive' ballads, and politically correct songs like Janie's Got a Gun. Personally I liked it when they were obnoxious punks. Rock and roll was made to be played loud by angry young men. When superstars are merely going through the motions to sell records it gets a little BORING!I should probably have given this CD 3 stars, there is some good stuff here, but this is AEROSMITH! This was one of the best rock bands in the world, they should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to give up on this one","review":"Great track list on \\"A Little South Of Sanity\\". I'm quite fond of Aerosmith, and I bought this double live album right after it came out. I listened to it several times, and then I sold it on eBay.I just couldn't come to terms with this CD...the noise of the crowd is way too prominent in the mix, which also manages to be both cluttered and slick, sanding away all of the grit.Sure, there are many great songs here, but they're all swamped by the hideous production. There is no separation, and the sound is just not realistic, it's synthetic and flat, and I never got to terms with it.Weird, noisy album. And not in a good way. Go for \\"Live Bootleg\\" instead, that one sounds like a REAL live recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show!","review":"Un ecellent CD sur toute la ligne. Il regroupe vraiment tout les gros canon de Aorosmith. Toute les bombes que ce grand groupe musicaux ont crée se retrouve en un seul album live.

They are the best Rock performers EVER! Too much style, too much attitude, too much class!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those About to Rock","review":"For anyone who hasn't seen Aerosmith on tour lately, here is an album for you. And for anyone who has, you'll enjoy it just as much. Ever since they've been off drugs, the band's shows have been nothing short of spectacular. This album shows you why with every song full of life.My only major complaint is that there isn't more from \\"Nine Lives.\\" The reason is that this album was released in order to fulfill Aerosmith's contract with Geffen so they could get back to recording for Columbia. As a result, this album is just filled with all those songs we know and love off their Geffen albums plus a few that might not have deserved to be there. It would have been nicer if there were more than 2 songs off their current album, NL.However, that's not enough to get me from loving this album. With all the classic from the '70s, this is the only legal document of their tours of the past 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothin' Left but the Squeal sums it up","review":"Aerosmith has churned out so many hits over the years: Love in an Elevator, Cryin', Rag Doll, Angel, Janie's Got a Gun, who can't help but love them?

This album is not very good. Aerosmith sound pretty crappy live and should probably just stick to studio power ballads for movie soundtracks. These guys are pretty much washed up. I saw them in concert recently and was near the front row. The band was clearly just going through the motions...it's almost like they said \\"well, time to get on stage and pretend to be Aerosmith for 90 minutes\\". It's too bad that Aerosmith has such a loyal fan base that they can release any piece of garbage like this, and stil have people buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No other band compares on stage!","review":"Aerosmith is the greatest band in the world!

It may also help their music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb live recording!","review":"A Little South of Sanity is one of the best live albums of any rock band out there today. Aerosmith proves they are still at the top of the pile. Steven Tyler's vocals are crisp, clean, loud and proud, and the rest of the band comes through with a gutsy style matched by no one. Definitely the best live recording by one of the most enduring bands today. Try it with headphones and you are right there on stage with them. It's the best!

You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boys doing what they do best","review":"This is their best live CD yet. It's great to finally hear some of their newer stuff live. Best tracks are Eat The Rich, an incredible performance of Walk This Way, and What It Takes. The only thing I wished they would have done is put more new songs (pink,get a grip, nine lives, taste of india) on the CD's instead of Back in the Saddle, Sweet Emotion, Same Old Song and Dance, and others that are already on so many live CD's. All in all though you can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trevis 24 oz. tumbler","review":"These tumblers have exceeded my expectations. They are large - which is what I sought.

The difference is price. The cost on Amazon for Claratin is $0.61 per table. At a retail store, you will pay about $1.00 per tablet. The Sam's Club generic is $12.48 for 360 tablets! That's $0.035 per tablet. If you take 2 tablets per day, like me, for congestion, that is a savings of $419 per year over Amazon's reduced price.This is stupid marketing by Schering-Plough.

However, Claritin has predatory pricing that makes taking it 365 days a years cost between $200 and $400, depending on the size box you purchase and the vendor.In contrast, generic Loratadine is sold at Costco for $12 for 300 tablets in the 24 hour dosage. That means a year's supply costs only about $15. The fact that Claritin charges $15 a month, compared with $15 per year for generic Loratadine indicates a markup of TWELVE TIMES the actual cost.This sort of criminal activity on the part of drug companies is the reason that health care costs in America are DOUBLE the costs of medical care in Canada, and yet the lifespan of the average American is five years less than the average Canadian.

Orishas first album \\"A lo Cubano\\" is one of my favorite rap albums of all time. \\"Emigrante\\" is a good encore for them but they clearly miss Flaco-Pro who in my opinion was by far their best flower and rhyme spitter. Apparently he had a falling out with the rest of them. He is the reason that their first album was so good. Without him, it seems that they got away from rap and went into more hip hop which is fine. Emigrante is good, but Orishas badly misses Flaco-Pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"parade your ignorance around town...","review":"I have no problem seeing a Kerry/Edwards sticker on a car - at least those people claim to stand for something.

So many folks aren't even registered to vote and those who are sadly make a presidential candidate into a devil or a savior.

I like it better than the new edition. It is clear and eazy to read and understand. For a critical care nurse starting out I would recommend it as a basic text. The doctor I use to work with in ICU used it all the time, and he was really smart. It was one of his favorites too. Like I said, it is kind of old, so I didn't expect anything that looked new and pretty, just something that served the purpose, was eazy to read, and explained things in plain English. It's a great teaching tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.

This movie was so bad I had to turn it off. It was just killing too many brain cells, which leads me to believe this movie may actually be a social experiment on the dumbing down of America. I'm not sure who would've heard the songs and lyrics in this one and green lighted the project, but I'm fairly certain they no longer have a job. Bad, bad, bad.

Yes it ties in the real meaning of Christmas, and that is a refreshing change, but the singing is AWFUL throughout. The heroine has a cane that she obviously doesn't need. Just because it mentions Jesus doesn't make it a wonderful film. I LIKE that it mentions Jesus, but it's so difficult to listen to the singing and to watch the heroine, Sophiana, run with her cane never limping. It was awful.

The character designs and animation are terrific and bright, the songs are hummable and with talents like Shirley Jones signing (Mrs. Claus), you can't go wrong. Loved the elves. Loved the bear.

I wanted to read more about the initial explosion in the engine, the anxiety of the people on the plane, the knowing they were going to likely crash. It seemed that part of the story was rushed in the first two chapters, and the rest of the book was about his meeting with other survivors and what they had to eat at these meetings. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for crash or investigation details. Trombello does do an adequate job of relating how crash survivors like himself struggle with their emotions years after the ordeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"God had to be the co-pilot on this flight.","review":"I was so impressed with the details of the crash as I was reading that I kept turning back to where all the pictures were and after viewing the those pictures I can only say it's unbelieveable that anybody got out of that crash alive. The book keeps us informed on airline safety issues and also child restrain seats. I was interested in the book because I can remember where I was when I heard about this crash and viewed it later on the news.

He is a brilliant singer and guitarist, perfectly in tune with his songwriting skills. Second: I don't see how everybody sees him as a merely *funny* guy. I think he's not *funny* (in the classic sorta way) at all; he's more on the sarcastic side, which *is* funny, but at the same time hardweighty painful. Take One Man Guy as an example; you can't say it is a funny song, do ya? It's bitterly sarcastic, I'd say. Anyway, this CD is great.

Kids won't appreciate this.","review":"I looked forward to this since reading on the internet that she planned to record an album.In that interview, Linda compared herself to Julie London, but her voice is much more full (although just a tad nasal).Her song selection is terrific. Her band's arrangements are very good, but I hope that on her next album she will be in front of either an acoustic piano trio or a guitar/bass duo a la \\"Julie Is Her Name\\". (Bag the synthesizer, dear.)Forty years ago there were singers who made albums as good as this, but today this is the best that's being done."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the voice of Linda, but not the other things ....","review":"After having read a lot of reviews about this cd and i talked my self into buying it. What a mistake that was. I think Linda has a good voice, one that you will want to listen to, over and over, without burn out. The song selection for this cd was ok. Now comes the bad news. The band that backed up Linda was not the kind of band i enjoy listening to. For one thing, they used a lot of heavy rhythm. Also they used a lot of electronic instrumentation. I'm an acoustic fan, and i love to hear this kind of sound.All in all i'm rather disapppointed in this cd. I think it could have and should have been a lot better.I Can Not Recommend This Cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual...","review":"It is a little embarassing to hear the beautiful and talented linda Purl attempt Bachrach's standard, \\"This Guy's...\\".

Not quite enough variety in the material, though. I recommend a mix of slow and some up-tempo pieces to make it more interesting.

I knew Linda as an actress, and had her on a Gershwin tribute and a Burt Bacharach tribute. And, I'm a sucker for female vocalist! I'm 30 years old and love this type of album. The songs are great and her voice sparkles! Some people have critiqued minor points-mics, synths, etc. But if you're looking for a luminous, adult cd, look no further. Linda, I hope you put out another cd real soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art of Flowering Bonsai","review":"Book was very informative on different types of Flowering trees used as Bonsai.

Although I disagree with her concepts of 'giving' and 'rightness of mind', because of my own very different experiences, I humbly acknowledge Savard's truth on \\"Stripping off old natures\\"; to the point of ceasing 'self-opposition' and the resultant shattering of the strongholds, within the old natures.Included is invaluable and simple advice, for all Christians to embrace on a \\"daily\\" basis, to become \\"a new creature in Christ\\". A fail-proof process when it is constructed on \\"whole truth\\" directly from God's Word AND DAILY PRAYER. Her \\"PRAYER WHEEL\\" recipe of \\"loosing\\" and \\"binding\\", \\"really works\\"!

Also bought the workbook but don't really like the workbook. There is no answer guide and the questions do not come out of the book the same way they are asked. For me this is not handy for people who want to \\"know for sure\\" the answer is the right one. I do like the book very much. She is honest about her beginnings and the doubts and concerns she had when she began to study the binding and loosing concept in the Bible. Good read.

Had intended to use it in the reusable filter we also bought, to save money on the filter replacements. It came in a HUGE container, like a life-time supply! LOL! That would have been fine, except that it doesn't work at all well for our application. It is so full of fine dust, even after repeated rinsings, that it clogs the screen at both ends of the filter almost immediately. It almost burned out our fountain motor. Back to the refills for us.

Well it is carbon you say, well the other carbon is not as black and doesn't need as much as a gallon of water to get clear. There's so much ash its not even funny.Customer service from the manufacturer is none existent. I wrote an email and no one replied yet.For all the fish owners out there, high quality carbon is with less than 2% ash count. When these real high quality carbons can lower your PH to 6.2 (since they are rinsed with acid to clear the ashes), its something you can fix with a product call PH UP. So high quality carbon and PH UP is a combo you must have when changing carbon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowan and Greenwood At Their Best!","review":"I have seen this movie when I was 15 years old back in 1995 and have recently purchased this flick last week on DVD and enjoy this movie like crazy. This movie features Kelly Rowan and Bruce Greenwood at their best acting. I personally felt they were the entire movie and without their finest performances as the deranged villains this movie would be a pure bore because I am not that crazy about Kate Jackson or Kenneth Welsh's acting in it. They didn't give a tremendous and impressive performance as Greenwood and Rowan did. I watch this flick a lot because I love Rowan and Greenwood and they made this movie a total thriller to watch!

As a fan of imports and VCDs, I got it because it played DVDs from all territories and VCD/SVCD without a hiccup. It plays MP3s and even JPEG files very well too. All through composite videos, compression artifacting is almost non-existent. We're talking extra-crisp visuals and sound. This has become my primary DVD player, unseating a much more expensive DVD player thanks to all the features. I've got to say, for people looking for an entry-level player, this is THE player.

At least they recorded some killer music! My favorite track:\\"Ghost at Number One\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally overlooked album","review":"This album is a great driving album, and a good sing-along as well. It rocks hard, but it's a giant genre-skipping tour of music styles ranging from Beatles, Beach Boys, Queen, and even some Disney-esque orchestral moments. It's a typical 3rd album in that the band probably knew they were breaking up so they pulled out all the stops in the studio. I wish I made it. Hell, the Beatles wish they made it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I hate to write this review as a swan song to a demised group but I must. This album and BellyButton are absolutely wonderful. Spilt Milk and Bellybutton are two albums that touch on so many styles and with those styles so many emotions.

The only other pieces of music that I can say that about are Beach Boy's Pet Sounds and The Beatle's Rubber Soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUN....DON'T WALK TO PICK THIS CD UP","review":"In an era where \\"whoomp there it is\\" and \\"i'll swear\\" got shoved down your throat......Jellyfish puts out this amazing record. Not to mention a tour with Tears for Fears which must have been amazing. Grady G was lucky enough to see these guys out in Portland on the first tour. I wish I could say the same. Do yourself a favor and pick up this disc. Buy a second copy and throw it in a time capsule.

Pepper's, Pet Sounds, Dark Side of the Moon, and Boston's first two albums.This is truly an inspired piece.Indeed, the music sounds like Queen, Supertramp, The Beach Boys - and even the Beatles. Perhaps the authors - Sturmer and Manning - were channeling the same intelligence that Brian Wilson and Paul McCartney had years ago.This album can be listened to annually for about a week and stay breathtaking for years.Each time a true music lover hears this album for the first time it is a heavenly experience.This album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Crying Over","review":"Ah, the late, great Jellyfish. So much has already been said about these guys and I'm not about to bore you by repeating it for the upteenth time. But for those of you that remain curious, here's the gist of it: this is their second and last album; it has a decidedly strong Queen/Supertramp -and Beatles, of course- influence; it rocks, so buy it. There, that wasn't so bad.As for what happened to them: keyboardist Roger Manning plays in Beck's touring band; Tim Smith is Sheryl Crow's bassist/guitarist (check out his hard to find Umajets project); and aside from producing and playing drums on The Merrymen's Bubblegun album, vocalist Andy Stuermer is M.I.A.Highlights: \\"Joining A Fan Club\\", \\"My Best Friend\\", \\"All Is Forgiven\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"E TICKET REQUIRED TO LISTEN TO THIS MASTERPIECE","review":"THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE COOLEST CD's EVER RECORDED!

This is a masterpiece in every respect, the lyrics, the lush instrumentation, the ironic edge. All the cuts are good, some are fanstastic, such as \\"Ghost of number one\\", \\"Joining a fan club\\", \\"New mistake\\", and \\"Too much, too little, too late\\". This music isn't for everyone, as shown by Jellyfish's lack of superstardom, but if you are a certain type of personality this music is a drug! If you like hooks, as I do, this music is an ecstacy of well delivered hooks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY?","review":"This is the best CD of the 90's by far.

What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one original idea on this album!","review":"I was surprised to read the glowing reviews on Amazon for this album given that there literally isn't one original idea with any of the songs on the entire CD.Its a masterpiece in production but I would put it in the same category as The Rutles or maybe Todd Rundgren's Beatle spoof (Utopia) Deface The Music.The \\"send ups\\" of Queen, The Beach Boys and The Beatles are brilliant, but is this how we now rate music these days?Excellent playing, beautifully recorded but rather than simply be inspired by their heros, Jellyfish just created carbon copies of their sings hoping that perhaps a younger audience might not make the connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No use cryiing...","review":"Most music listeners have asked themselves the question \\"What would ASIA sound like if they decided to cover the Ohio Express after being trapped in a closet hearing nothing but \\"Pet Sounds,\\" \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"A Night at the Opera\\" for ten years? The answer: Jellyfish.Here's another clue for you all: The Walrus was Paul. And imitating (or blatantly RIPPING OFF) good bands doesn't make you a good band. This album is SOOO limit of delta x as delta x approaches zero of function x plus delta x minus function x divided by delta x (i.e. DERIVATIVE), you can almost quote the inadvertant references line by line.\\"Ghost of Number One\\" reminds me of a really \\"killer\\" Queen tune. I can't remember the name of it. The bridge is an EXACT copy of the theme to The Guiding Light.If making a good Dukes of Stratosphear album was Jellyfish's intention, a parody of pop and psychedica, they succeeded. If it was to make a real and not a cartoon characture of an album... well, no use crying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not good","review":"Wow. This is terrible. After hearing of this band for years and reading all the glowing reviews of their two albums I had decent expectations for listening to Split Milk. I must not have the same ears as the other reviewers on amazon.com as I think this is album is a poor amalgam of it's 60's and 70's influences: Beatles, Moody Blues, Beach Boys, Eno's Roxy Music, Badfinger, et al. It's derivitive, tiring and pompous. I already own CD's by The Flaming Lips, XTC/Dukes of Stratosphere, Divine Comedy, Pink Floyd, Starlight Mints, Beck, ELO, Queen, and Moxy Fruvous. Save yourself some dough and buy something by one of these artists - they all are better musicians and use the same influences to make something fresh and new. Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS THIS REALLY VANILLA ICE??","review":"Vanilla Ice's new album is great. It's hard to believe this is the same guy from a few years ago.

I think Rob Van Winkle was thinking \\"Gee, I wonder how many forms of music can I cheapen by trying to preform them?\\" Well, we all know he did that to rap, now he's moved on to metal.

This one touches both turfs. The music is hardcore rock, but the lyrics are hardcore rap. I think Rob (Vanwinkle, heh) is trying to be something that he obviously is not, that being a rock star. The CD is awesome until he opens his mouth, then it just goes downhill from there. In one of his tracks he mentions \\"you tried to do me like Ginuwine\\"(a rapper), and makes several references to it throughout the whole song. This CD wouldn't appeal to hardcore rockers cause his lyrics voice rap ideas, and rappers wouldn't like it cause the music is hardcore rock. Whoever you are, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything that's wrong with music","review":"OK, look.

Vanilla Ice thinks he's Korn. And with Korn's producer behind the boards on this one, who's to tell him he isn't? Though the drums pound and the guitars roar, no amount of hard-rock trimmings can hide the painfully obvious: the Ice still can't rap. He proved it recently with his unintentionally hilarious cameo on the last Bloodhound Gang album. Hell, he proved it with \\"To the Extreme.\\" The scary thing is that \\"Hard to Swallow\\" has actually been selling decently. Personally, listening to this entire CD was a grueling experience; I had to fight the temptation to tear it out of my stereo and put on something more stimulating. Like the Spice Girls.

Maybe he'll play some venues slightly larger than the highschool auditoriums he has been relegated to, but give him another few months and he'll be appearing at your local dive bar in that old \\"Word to Your Mother\\" jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO is swallowing THIS?!?!?!?!","review":"Can we pinpoint the date when the Van Winkster stopped pacing around his mansion, trying not to think about the fact that he had become a laughing stock in music, and decided to latch onto the hard rock / rap whatever you wanna call Korn trend? Just a bit late Rob. But sure enough, America never gets tired of a has-been, right? Even though most of the people who bought To The Extreme and made it a 14 million copy seller have grown up and have either sold, destroyed or completely denied they own or ever owned the album, I have to give an iota of credit to Vanilla for sucking it up and going forward. And hey, some people actually like this album. Then again, some people like the Backstreet Boys. And Dishwalla. At least God looks over the stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Iceman Stinketh","review":"Hard To Swallow, Vanilla Ice's new album is a hard rockin album whose only distinct song is \\"Too Cold\\", in which he yells the lyrics to \\"Ice Ice baby\\" with the backing of a horrible Korn-type band.

That would have sold, but this awful garbage sound will never sell, and thus nailed the coffin shut on his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh for the love of God Vanilla, let it go!","review":"Another example of a career in decline.

I do respect your efforts, but that doesn't save the album. The anger projected on the record sounds sincere but it's not geniune. The lyrics sound contrived, to thought out and it doesn't have a natural flow. The musicians on the record are the only saving grace and at times carry the songs to an acceptable level only to be brought back down again by the vocals. I really wanted to like this album because I think everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves, but alas VN fails to do this and the album is truly \\"Hard to Swallow\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like early 90s Ice at all","review":"V-Ice changed himself after his first album was done. He went from being that packaged subject to being this drug addicted, tattooed, pierced man who wrote violent lyrics. His drug addictions clouded his mind, but also let him write some great music for his period (mid 90s to 2001). This album, as some have noted, sounds just like a Korn or Limp Bizkit album. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's hard, it's hitting, it's awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that hard to swallow","review":"All I can say is Vanilla Ice has finally become his own person and makes the music that he wants to make.

The little amount of respect for Ice that we all shared has totally left, because he is such a sell out, just like MC Hammer, who makes gospel music now, after a turn at gansta rap.A message to all of the old-school artists out there: keep it real for your fans and for your image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yo,yo yo,this is ****!","review":"The VIP needs to return to his former glory days instead of ripping off the metal/rap/hip-hop bands of today.\\"To The Extreme\\" remains the greatest gift for adolesent white boys of suburbia trying to get a little more flavor into their mix.

Rob Van Winkle must feel that he must redeem himself for the trash he most graciously dumped on the music industry a few years ago, but unfortunately, he came up a little short.

It entails everything from hardcore lyrics to very meaningful lyrics. All in all, this album rocks with the best of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out!!!!!!!!","review":"Vanilla Ice surely disappoints true fans by playing this fake hard stuff that he insists be his new style. Why give up the bleach blonde hair and the hip hop culture for this junk? I really feel bad for Korn, who keeps getting associated with Ice because they share the same producer.

I never liked Vanilla Ice much before it (except maybe Ice Ice Baby and Ninja Rap for there comedic value), but after hearing the new version of Ice Ice Baby (Too Cold) and d/l a few more songs. I thought they were good, KoRn-ish, metal. I would reccomend it just for the songs Too Cold, Living, F__k Me, and Scars. The rest of the album is good, except when he puts in small samples about god right before he does a really bad (bad as in filthy, smutty, or any other one of those lovely words) song, like Zig Zag Stories, or The Horny Song. But other than that it's a really good album in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing change...","review":"A good album... definately not old-school Vanilla Ice in the least.

To go from rap to a acid rock album doesn't display versatility but stupidity. He lied about his \\"past,\\" became a homey-G in \\"Roll 'em up\\" and now he thinks he is KORN. This man is not only a disgrace to the music industry, but he has tainted good white rap acts like SNOW and the Beastie BOYZ. Don't waist your time with this garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Latest Effort a Let-down","review":"Vanilla Ice's newest CD, Hard to Swallow is a far different product than many expected. Unlike his past ventures in the music world, this album sounds at times like a cross between bad 311 tribute band and a bad TOOL imitator. Fans waiting for his PG rated rap can stay away from this album, for Vanilla Ice has suddenly taken to cursing like there was no tommorow. Overall, it would be better received if he stuck to his rap roots and didn't seel out to yelling over hard, heavy guitar riffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!","review":"This has got to be one of the WORST albums ever recorded in any musical genre.

I listened to the samples on here on Amazon, and I felt like I just wasted 30 minutes of my life listening to the samples. Vanilla Ice, your first CD To the Extreme was much better, but this piece of garbage does not deserve to exist in this world. This has got to be the worst CD ever made. This is not the kind of ice cream music that people would want to scream for. It is the most retarded CD on EARTH! I really loved your first CD to the Extreme, but Vanilla Ice, Please leave metal and rap music alone. Rap music is black people's music, not white people's music. Listening to the samples on this CD, My advice would be for you to stick to rap music since you did good on that first album. Better advice yet, just stop making music.

Jackie McCullough is becoming one of my favorite ministers of the gospel because she hits the points at their source and you know that the Lord has dealt with her greatly over the years. I'm drawn to the expressiveness of her teachings. She's truly a woman sent by God for the body's edification.

The video picture quality is very poor and made from a very scratchy film print. on top of that you will most likely NOT be able to read the subtitles (unless you can read Cantonese)as they are cropped off the bottom of the screen. Different televisions have different overscan rates (they amount the crop off the edges of the picture you are watching). This problem may not be as bad on another t.v. set, but the amount they were cut off on mine was far greater then the standard differences in overscan across different t.v. manufacturers lines so I doubt you will have a different experience.

If you are a huge fan, as I am. you must get the fifth season.

Happy Day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Addition To Any Collection","review":"Absolutely love all the seasons of Murder She Wrote. They are relaxing and interesting to watch before bed. In the Fifth Season Jessica (Angela Lansbury) pretends to be other people several times, including a gambling fluezy and an eccentric wealthy hypochondriac, which is totally out of character and hilarious to watch. I was excited to see a young Megan Mullaley (Karen from Will & Grace) guest starring in an episode and Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's daughter Lucie Arnaz in another. Im only 23 but have always been a huge fan of Lucille ball so it was cool seeing her daughter acting.

I'd heard of him of course, but I'd never listened to his music. Morning Joy is my Lacy debut and, boy, what an introduction! Glorious music, be it the Monk interpretations or the other selections on the album. This is the type of album that gives jazz a good name. Fantastically talented musicians, yes!, but not only in terms of their individual achievements, the group interaction is absolutely spot-on also (since I've bought this album it has hardly been out the CD player).In short, Morning Joy will be the first of a large number of Lacy CDs that will find its way to my collection. Please note that the only reason why I did not rate this music with 5 stars, is because I can't compare with other Lacy material. If this would be his only one, I would have definitely rated it with 5 however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacom Tablet","review":"I bought this for my daughter, who is a junior in college studying graphic design.

The characterization is superb and the action is unrelenting! Gemmell is the master of \\"How do you handle a no-win situation?

I would highly recommend any of his work especially to those who have an imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroic Fantasy","review":"Good if you like that sort of thing. This is fantasy, not science fiction (some of these tags are misleading). There is something in these novels referred to as the Source, which is also revered as a god, and it's used like the Force but without its telekinetic qualities. These are fun stories that espouse sacrifice and death before dishonor. There's no \\"live to fight another day\\" in Gemmel's world. The Source is their magic (astral projection, mind-reading, remote viewing, psychic communication, etc). Anyway, I enjoyed it. Some epic fantasy battles require a huge investment of time.

The way David Gemmell writes the story allows your imagination to run with it. The way David goes into the details you almost feel like your there with Tanaka Khan and Renya on there trip to the Nadir, as well as, in the battle to hold off the Emperor. So far David's stories are the only one's I feel like I can get into, and I recommend his books to everyone. Keep it up David."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second in the Drenai Series","review":"Sadly David Gemmell died a short while ago and I find it difficult to review a book that I first read when David was very much alive and only just beginning his trade as a writer of fantasy novels. Admittedly his first offering were acceptable but not great, but he honed his skills and grew to be one of the greatest fantasy writers ever. If you have not read any of his books then now is the time to start, I am sure you will not be disappointed. The only sad thing is that David will not be around to write new books that would bring even more pleasure to his multitude of fans.A hundred years have past since the defeat of Dros Delnoch. An heroic defeat, but a defeat nonetheless. Now the people of Drenai face a new enemy, an emperor, kept in power by the Joinings, beasts of awesome strength and power, plus the Dark Templars, warriors who are virtually unstoppable. Only one man can save the Drenai and defeat and destroy Tenaka Khan, the prince of Shadows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Legand","review":"I love the way that this book follows on from \\"Legend\\". It relates to civil war, and sets things up nicely for the sequel (Quest for lost heros). The leading three characters are fantastic. The badies bring real intrest to the story also. The Dark templar are wicked, but I think the werebeasts known as the Joinings are an absulote master stroke!! The end battle delivers more excitment than that of Legend, espicially the final stand against the Joinings.After this, read Quest for Lost Heros strait after."},{"rating":"2","title":"utterly amazing","review":"this book is impossible to put down.

And, as any listener of contemporary music in the last 10 years knows, we all lost that challenge! Continuing from the spectacular success of his self-titled first album, and last single (the #1 Hold On To The Nights) \\"Repeat Offender\\" picks up right where Marx left off. The first single \\"Satisfied\\" rocked and rocketed to the top of the charts in just a few weeks. The follow-up single \\"Right Here Waiting\\" gave Marx a three-peat at the top, and has become one of the legendary love songs of all time. Following that success, \\"Angelia\\" (#3), \\"Too Late To Say Goodbye\\" (#7), and the uplifting benefit song \\"Children Of The Night\\" (#13), all proved that we just could not, and would not ignore this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"i bought myself the tape of this one and came to love it and the songs on it..when that wore out i bought the cd..great sound to it and richard marx has a great voice that can match any song"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"This a great CD with Richard's best song ever!

I was impressed. A take on Fall of the House of Usher redone to be an Andy Milligan film- and I mean that as a compliment, this film had as much a stage play reference as a horror film refernce point. Solid performances- Suzanne Bertish was phenomenal and she reminded me of Claire Higgins from Hellraiser (at some point those two should work together, just a wish!)I love it when this kind of thing happens: you pick up a film with a shoddy cover just to try it out for a bit of \\"movie exploring\\" and you wind up with something really impressive.

They are sharp, so you will likely accidentally catch your skin and it will leave a red mark or puncture it (and hurt). The tweezers cut or slide off of thicker eyebrow hairs, and are par, at best, at plucking thinner hair. They are lightweight, unlike my other Revlon tweezers, which were substantially heavier and better. I imagine my old ones are discontinued, so I tried this one. What a waste and can't even return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a good pair of tweezers. The ends are a bit bulky and seem like they could lead to the product not maintaining it's sharpness and accuracy.I would easily buy these again in the future.Also, they send you whatever they have in this style.

To be fair, though the original battery that came with the phones lasted only about two years, and the problem, I think, has mostly to do with the phones. The wireless Vtech phones that I have have this nasty flaw of turning on and looking like they are functioning, but if the battery gets too old, the phones seem to lose connection to the bases and they will not make or receive calls. Perhaps the phones need a little more power than the batteries can provide after a certain number of recharging, or maybe it's something else, but what ever the case, they became useless for my use after about a year.

Two stars were added because of the inclusion of the bonus tracks such as \\"Hot Sex\\" from the \\"Boomerang\\" soundtrack and the hard-to-find classic remix to \\"Scenario\\" (but the \\"Oh My God\\" remix is wack). On the other hand, those old-school tracks placed with these newer songs show just how much Tribe has fallen off. The newer songs feature boring production that makes every song sound the same and Q-Tip and Phife sound like they came in the studio saying, \\"All right, but this is the last time.\\" This was supposed to be their swan song but they tried to make a comeback in 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR ALBUM","review":"repetitive and just boring in comparison with low end, beats rhymes, and midnight marauders."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fitting Finale.","review":"For most Tribe Fans, this final studio LP was a big dissapointment, and while some of the criticism was warranted, the truth is this is actually a fitting finale to one of the greatest rap groups in history. While some of the performances here do seem a bit contrived and half-hearted, the musical foundation on sterling tracks like \\"Get It Started\\", \\"Common Ground (Get It Going On)\\" and the superb guitar showcase \\"For Moms\\" (featuring Spanky)are reason alone to own this collection. Q-Tip, Shaheed and Phife tried to go out with a bang, but it's obvious that their spirit was gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tribe Called Flop","review":"Can you say strugglin'? As much as I admire Shaheed, Phife and Q, it was all too evident on this album that the boys had been through enough and need to call it quits. The first two albums were out of this world and they established themselves as lyrical geniuses, but ever since they have been struggling to regain prominence and find their niche. Sorry, this album really isn't worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ground-breaking addition from my favorite music group.","review":"I have to give it to Tribe. I've been listening to them for years and though some listeners may have fallen from their path, they have never ceased to amaze me. With this album they leave behind an incredible legacy of ground-breaking hip-hop. The concept for the album is both original and very risky. In a musical genre that is often dominated by violent themes it is good to know that through the strength of their music they are able to bring across some very positive vibes through a style of expression that is both unique and awesome. The Love Movement is a fitting testament to true hip-hop pioneering."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"I just dont listen to it for personal reasons but it is just a little sad 2 me not as good as the first 4 but a good last cd A tribe called quest was my favorite group and for them 2 break up it just hurt me to see that because I grew up listening to them but anyway get it its a good CD so buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, diz puts to me sleep...","review":"When i heard A tribe called quest's \\" the love movement\\" it made me want to sleep coz its boringggggggggggggg and every song sounds exectly the same even their single \\"find a way\\" can put you to sleep and the most upbeat song here rock rock yall and scenario remix both plain dull and boring and it doesn't get any better but worse & worse with wack lirycs and a weak effort dat i wasn't surprise at \\"a tribe called quest\\" coz they suck, and their weak, and BORING.

They are not like the traditional groups out today, and they still manage to get much love and respect worldwide. The new record is a masterpiece because they have managed to stay with the style they created and still succeed. Every album isn't going to be what you expect and this is no exception.

It seems that now, more than ever, as represented in their lyrics, that they have achieved the ultimate enlightenment of the Hip Hop scene and the functions within. Listening to it, you can't help but hear a more mature Q-tip and Phife, and a smoother and more rhythmic balanced Ummah. They have managed to slip away from the beat-packing, hard-hitting, hardcore music that is symbolic of the late nineties and add a simplistic relaxing sound that epitomizes the growth of Tribe from day one. Anyone who loves Tribe and has respected their work from the beginning would understand how good and accomplished this album is. For those who don't know Tribe, don't expect anything too glamorous for this one seems to have been made for those who have loved and gfrown up with Tribe. On that note, TRIBE RULES!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribe Called Quest - Old-School Even In 1998!","review":"Wow!

The lyrics may not have been the usual Tribe, and the beats may not have been the usual Tribe, but the album was still fresh...and that always comes from the usual Tribe. At this time though, it seemed like Tribe was commercializing too much, and even though that had an affect on their attitudes toward one another, the album was nothing less than extraordinary. This album may not have been \\"People's Instinctive Paths...,\\" \\"Low End Theory,\\" or \\"Midnight Marauders,\\" but it still showed people that Tribe still knew how to put it down for hip-hop and that they would always be remembered. \\"Love Movement\\" is one of those albums that you can always put on when you're having a bad day...and the fresh rhythmic groove will always make things better. Tribe Called Quest is one of the reasons why I love hip-hop so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would take it back if i could","review":"As a Muslim and a fanatic about Hip-Hop and Tribe Called Quest, i believe that this is the worst album put out by the Tribe.

But the album is not their best work to date....we know what the guys can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death bows don't always sound good.","review":"I love A Tribe Called Quest. They produced some of the finest albums of any genre in the 90's, period. When I heard they were breaking up because they pretty much said it all, I was saddened. But did they have to drag that exaustion into the studio and come up with this weak piece of crap?? This is a sad album because they really sound like they're going through the motions just to fulfill their contract. Even the six extra \\"rarities\\" sound like throwaways. Sure, there's the odd track or two (the Busta Rhymes collaboration is brilliant), but it's not enough to spend the list price. I'm sorry. It pains me to write this what with so much crap that was released in hip-hop this year. If anything, \\"The Love Movement\\" is a death knell for hip-hop. I hope the Roots do better in keeping the faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Whack!","review":"I am a big fan of Tribe Called Quest, and Love Movement didn't appeal to me like their last three CD's did. The only song that I cared for, and a lot about is \\"Find My Way\\". The rest of the songs seemed to be nothing but fillers corny crap like \\"Tha Booty\\". That song is the corniest I had heard since The Beastie Boys \\"Brass Monkey\\". I am particularly dissapointed that the song \\"The Jazz\\" was an awful remix instead of that beautiful melodious song on thier Low End Theory album. I hate that the boys would part after putting out something as bad as Love Movement. They have got to be joking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"You on point, Tribe?\\" \\"Uh, no.\\"","review":"For the longest time I swore this was a tight album and I couldn't figure out why everyone said it was wack. I figured out about two days ago (after not listening to it for a year or two) that the reason was that I never listened past track three. Find a Way and Da Booty are both tight jams, but every other song on the album, barring the remixes, makes me sick. They have lame beats, wack rhymes, and some bad cameos (Noreaga?! Are you kidding me?) Whenever I accidentally forget to change the CD after Da Booty, I feel like an idiot for ignoring my friends' pleas not to buy this album. For the longest time I thought I didn't even like Tribe. As I listen to Low End Theory as I write this, I realize that I was mistaken. The Love Movement is a bad album and a bad way for a good group to go out."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK","review":"They're gonna stay homeless putting stuff like this out! Time to get real jobs (hanging around outside Amoeba music in Hollywood doesn't count) kiddos! You tried..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks creativity and any kind of longevity.","review":"I have simply stopped listening to this album, because the songs get old so fast. There are so much better things to listen to out there. Go look at my listmania lists or my wish list to see what they are. This CD is a generally boring rap-rock fusion with a couple electronics as a lame attempt at originality. I now realize that the singer's voice is really annoying. It's true that these guys are homeless, but if they want to get houses they should first get better at what they do. In the same category as Adema, a truly boring and annoying band. As some other reviewers said, this group might have a good live show, but this album isnt worth your time. I bought this on an impulse and got burned (though it was cheap). Don't do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"eek........","review":"Well, Edgy 59 from Burning Witch is indeed still alive surprisingly, but he's somehow found himself in this band... Ughh...

If you're thinking about buying this, listen to real metal and buy Burning Witch or Khanate instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This is the reason why Grokster/Kazaa need to exist. There are only 3 songs worth listening too on this album and low and behold one of them is there single(hold me back from the shock). Porcelain, Freak Of Nature, and Haunted are the only three songs worth wasting any effort of listening too. If you are looking for an arena industrial rock album you should pick up any Manson album cause even though his artistic vision has majorly declined, albums like this one makes Manson out to be a genious which is sad. I give this a one star rating because even the 3 decent songs on this album arent even all that great. My question to Sinisstar is \\"why bother?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinisstar live","review":"Sinisstar is one of the best bands i have ever seen live. I first saw them when they opened for Adema in Portland, and ever since, i have been a huge fan.

This CD is a powerful piece of music that is long overdue."},{"rating":"2","title":"even better live","review":"I don't have this CD yet but I will get it soon. When I went to the Rob Zombie concert SINISSTAR was opening up for him and the were cool. There bass player seemed the loudest.

If you don't like there CD go check them out live the are cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool stuff","review":"This is a pretty good album, Sinisstar definitely know how to rock and still keep a catchy beat and tune up. Sort of a punk-type band, really, there isn't a whole lot to say about it, except to say that I'd recommend checking them out for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expert Obedience Training for Dogs","review":"Two main comments. Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it. This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform \\"tricks\\" with much on showmanship. I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog. Problems handlers encounter in \\"greeting\\" of your dog with other dogs and people.Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on. I felt intimidated by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying!","review":"This book is FILLED with disgusting, violent, outdated methods. This barbaric moronic woman actually suggests setting mousetraps on couches if your pet jumps up unwantedly. REALLY?! Why?! So that you can go to the vet to fix your pets shattered bones?! She also suggests slapping puppies in the face if they bark when left alone. This book is an example of how pathetically thin our understanding of the canine mind has been. The majority of the methods described in this book are wrong-minde, harsh and ineffective. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very old information....","review":"A good book....for the 1960's. Dog training has evolved *far* past what this trainer had taught in the past. Her methods are behind the times and they show that she no longer is a serious competitor.An OK book for a historical reference, but not much use otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read if you know anything about training","review":"I bought this because I love German Shepherds, but Strickland is an old time trainer who hasn't changed. The old pictures make the book dated as it is. If youv'e been training at all or have read more updated material don't waist time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expert Obedience Training for Dogs","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It was more about training a dog for show than for obedience training. I needed to know how to train my dog how to come when called, stay, walk without pulling and general information. I never plan on showing my dog. I just want a good, obedient dog and was looking for a book that would tell me how to achieve that. I need help with a strong willed large one year old puppy. I did not find it in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth owning","review":"This is a good training book. Her methods are loving yet firm. I found it especially helpful with providing information on training a dog to heel. This book is very technical and geared towards those who wish to compete at elite level obedience competition. Those of us who own ordinary dogs can also benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I rented this book from the library and was shocked at some of the information I read, for the same reasons the other 1 * reviews stated. The author instructs \\"slapping,\\" \\"water pistols\\" and \\"mouse traps\\" as some problem solving guides. This is out of the question for my 10 pound dog. Although this may be how most of the obedience ring trains their dogs, this is not how I train my dogs.It did have a lot of information on the AKC regulations and equipment and addresses what happens when handlers over \\"jerk\\" their dogs. However it didn't address possible underlying issues that the dog may be having, from what I read. I felt this book gave a lot of problem solving advice, but not enough explanations on the WHY's. As an \\"expert obedience\\" book, I think it should address some sort of dog behavior. I personally wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends or family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this exact translation for free on the internet!","review":"This book is an exact duplicate of E.M. Edhill's translation, which is easily found via a Google search.

Purchased an LS20 and used it with good results, and figured to match an LS10 with a 5.5 medium action for grubs without a sinker. Figured lighter and smaller would be better for an old man. The 20 did seem to be a little front heavy but could be my short, chubby fingers. The 10 was a big disappointment. No similarity to the quality of the 20. Bail mechanism kept grabbing the line and wrapping it around the bottom of the spool and the bail wire got progressively closer to the mechanism and would not allow the line to travel to the pick up. Thought it might be just me, so I found an old Shimano 10 series and put the same line on the same rod and it performed like it should. The seller,[...], was fabulous about it and took it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than junk","review":"This is by far the worst reel I've ever used. the trigger system worked an amazing three times before it stopped working.

I want sugar that nature provides, not sugar that has been genetically modified in a laboratory. Primarily, that is why I really like this sugar. I also noticed my herbal tea seems to taste better with this sugar, possibly due to the larger crystals. It is also a beautiful golden color that makes it look more natural. The packet size is perfect for me to keep some in my desk at work, and the cost for 1000 packets is actually quite reasonable - compared to the cost per packet to regular sugar packets in the smaller grocery store quantities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service and convenience","review":"Nice alternative to Sugar in the Raw. It tells our customers about who we are and that we care about quality products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent To Date","review":"I purchased this item for my husband to remind him to take his eye drops on time for his eye problem. He takes one particular drop four times a day and this alarm is a godsent. It beeps loudly or it can be put on vibrate, if he is working with his machinery. From reading some of the reviews, it was said to be difficult to program, but my husband, who is electronically challenged, found it simple to program with the quick start guide. I had looked and looked for such an alarm and many had pill containers encased, were too large, or just did not fit the bill. We are just hoping this item will hold up to the wear and tear of his active life style. Only time will tell, but to date, we are extemely please with this alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"All for one....\\" -- all four stars, that is, for ONE CUT!","review":"All four stars I've given this album are for one cut -- a FIVE-star cut -- \\"Chemical Residue,\\" which I find fascinating, never-tiresome.

THIS ALBUM IS A MUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Wow, this is truly Conflict's best cd. You can say all you want about the debut or \\"Increase The Pressure\\", but this is and always will be Conflicts best cd, and is their last truly great one. From the chilling intro of \\"You Cannot Win\\" to the beautiful \\"To Be Continued\\", Conflict combines many different styles of music, such as punk, spoken word, and soft rock on this album. But the music is still 100% punk at heart, with classics like \\"Piss in the Ocean\\", \\"C.R.A.S.S.\\", and \\"This is the ALF\\". Sure, it's a short album, but the flow is beautiful, and there are no filler songs. A must have for fans of Crass and the Subhumans, and definately not for posers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cookbook, ever.","review":"My Dad bought this cookbook in 1970 and passed it on to me when I started life after college.

What we got was a game that somehow totally ruined the franchise. Monkey target all of a sudden requires no skill, they basically throw points at you, and 2 players going at once? Sounds good but it just makes the huge stages harder to see. Monkey bowlings still god though right? No! All of the monkeys now bowl drastically differently, meaning that if you liked gongon in monkey ball one, you now will have to pick a totally different character to bowl like you want to. Oh and the one player story mode.... let me just barf now. Amazingly kiddy ish, it might as well have been designed by 2 years olds who like bright colors and the word poo.

It's basically just an update of the original game, with a few new games and a new single player format. It's really not that great, although with all the hype surrounding it, you probably think it is. By the way, I'm not one of those guys that just hates everything Sega. I used to own a Genesis, and I love most of their sports games. But this game and it's predecessor are just ridiculous.

Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Latin music's most beautiful voices","review":"When I first got Michael Stuart's CD \\"Retratos,\\" I joked that with a name like his, I expected Scottish bagpipe music rather than salsa. But don't be fooled by his name! This performer is bursting with Latin soul. And his voice is just amazing: clear and strong, with a sweetness and vulnerability that make his performances very appealing. All the songs are in Spanish, with tropical Latin rhythms.The CD starts off strong with \\"Nina Bella,\\" a joyfully upbeat song. Some of the selections have a more aggressive Latin flavor, while others have a slower, gentler sound. The disc includes Stuart's version of the song \\"Destino,\\" which has also been recorded by the Latin duo Donato y Estefano. Michael Stuart is an exciting talent on the Latin music scene, and this is a wonderful collection of his passionate artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Stuart, A legend in the making","review":"The great thing about Michael Stuart's CDs is his ability to evolve and inovate his sound with each album. The thing that stands out most in his Retratos CD is the diverse sounds and blending of different genres. It is no wonder he produced 3 number 1 hits off this Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous watch and super fast shipping","review":"Seiko SUJ214 is a gorgeous watch! The face is smaller(width is about 2cm including the crown and lengh is about 2.5cm) than I expected and indeed it looks better in that way. The blue dial is very dark and hands look very clear so that it's easy to read the time even though the face is small. The strap length(when closed and including the face of watch) is 215mm(about 8.5inches). I have small wrists and I need to adjust it. If you have small wrists, this watch will look great on you. The watch looks classy and sleek at the same time not too formal. I ordered it from WatchZone(in Amazon) and they shipped the right next business day. I added just $2 more to regular shipping and ordered it by an expedite shipping and the item arrived a day after they shipped. Item was very well packed and arrived in original box with warranty and instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Stone Cold, baby!","review":"This is an awesome tape for anyone who loves the Rattlesnake!

He doesn't take BS from anyone, and if you get in his way, he will take you out! This video takes you on the journey with Stone Cold as he goes after the WWF title at Wrestlemania 14.

I got this because the good bacteria in my tanks all died off at once due to a friend helping out and over zealously cleaning all my filters at one time. Well, I had to re-cycle the tanks and of course during this time the ammonia sky rocketed. I got this product in an attempt to control the ammonia as the tanks cycled. Sorry, this product did absolutely nothing. It may remove ammonia but certainly not large amounts nor small amounts from what I could see. I can only assume it removes trace amounts. I ended up using a liquid ammonia lock instead. Maybe I'll sprinkle what I have left in the kitty litter box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batchelor is a fellow studetn, not a teacher . . . and this isa commentary","review":"In some ways I agree with \\"Jim Williams\\" review, though I do not see this commentary as harshly as he does -- and I see Batchelor as I always do, as a commentator, not a teacher. Not a good beginner's book on Nagarjuna's seminal work, but I am currently studying this in depth, and so appreciated Batchelor's work as I might enjoy sitting talking to another serious student, even when I saw his shortcomings.

Like I said, if you like the songs, and would love to hear them acoustic with 2 masters of country music, then this CD is a great buy... but if you were hoping for a CD full of duets by the 2, its a let down.For me this product was a let down, but I was under the impression that it was johnny and willie singing together the entire CD. I did give it 4 stars, because quality-wise, its excellent. Music wise, its excellent. I love the songs, I just thought it was going to be more of both singing together. So be forewarned, most of the CD are johnny and willie singing independently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Got this for my Dad and my boyfriend, and they both LOVED it!

You won't get one here either. This CD just gets better with each listening. Producer Rick Rubin's gift for making stripped down music works again. He produced all John's records from 1993 until John's death. It was one of the best producer/artist teams ever. On this CD, starting with \\"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\\" right up 'till \\"On The Road Again,\\" all cuts flow smoothly. Intimate? Spin this CD in your rec. room and you'll think John and Willie came over for coffee, sang some songs, said they had a ball and left. Play it in the car and it's like they came along for a ride. It's a great recording. It's highly recommended. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting overview of the entire Celtic spectrum","review":"I bought this book 2 months ago for a Celtic theme party I was doing.

It seems to have the right balance of restricting violent motions without restricting motions altogether. I play goalie in ice hockey and had a fairly minor groin strain - took a few weeks off and then started using this support after that. No setbacks, and definitely had more peace of mind.

Post pregnancy, I've suffered from PSD (pubic symphysis dysfunction) and this strain support really helped isolate my inner thigh muscles so that they would contract less while walking. (Anyone who has experienced this type of pain understands how awkward it is to walk when your thighs are thoroughly tensed up.) Unfortunately, I cannot rate it highly because it began to fall apart after one week. The material used in the making is very soft -- to minimize chaffing -- which is wonderful, but, as a result, the velcro that secures the support tears it to shreds. Hope this helps you decide before you purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"I purchased this to help support my hip that I have chronic pain issues with after a hip replacement.I bought it with the intentions of being to wear it either over or under my work pants at my job to give me standing support. It worked fine for about a few days then it started to unravel or just come lose durning my work day. this is probably best to use at home where you can wear shorts or sweatpants. Not a reliable support for someone whom is somewhat active or just running errands. Would be better off using a cane or walker for support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I couldn't get it to stay on, couldn't walk in it, there were no clear instructions.

I liked it well enough that I am going to buy another. I have two german shepherds that like to run through my garden and this worked great. Only took one touch and since then just the little beep it makes was enough to keep them away. Feels similar to a strong static shock. It keeps out other critters, but possums can go under it. I am going to try putting the wires closer together again. It seems to go through batteries about one a month...not to bad. Much better than replacing my garden weekly. I do advise using stronger fence posts..the included pvc ones are not really strong enough. Wood or metal is fine.Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep groundhog out","review":"I bought this for my veggie garden to keep a nearby ground hog out.

No hardcore rap on this album ie..KoRn..Limp Bizkit. Album came out in 1993 and the single \\"Independent\\" was played in the college football movie \\"The Program\\". The majority of the songs are just power chords and the lead singer doesn't do the death metal growl which can get annoyning quick. SR has their own sound but reminds me of a cross between old Megadeth and Metallica's \\"Kill Em' All\\". I don't know what the statis of the band is right now but what I do know is these guys just rule! Excellent album, an all out metal fest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Yes, the often mentioned \\"under appreciated\\" SR with a brilliant follow up to 1990's American Way. To say this is a great thrash album alone does not do it justice.

I believe that birds of a feather flock together in the same record company, so this album should hold up. In fact, it is in its own way, a more refined psychedelic experience. The string arrangements (which I am a sucker for) are marvelous. Umbrella and Song Throu Perception are absolutely brilliant. Buy this album, if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!!

It is almost as loud as a wrist watch alarm, which I suspect is where the beeper came from. Might be OK for $5.00. If your pills or timed activities are critical at all, look somewhere else.

Favorites come and go, but The Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, with Saraste at the helm, always comes back with a vengeance. This set is simply the most satisfying rendition in my book. Brisk, but true to Sibelius' score. Superb sonics thanks to the famous Philharmonia Hall in St. Petersburg. Live recordings, as in this case, often add to the sence of authenticity. Sadly, Finlandia Records is history. The recordings can be purchased from another label, but if you can get your hands on this nice box-set from Finlandia, don't think twice.

While all of the individual pieces seem to be good quality the flag pole sits very loosely in the socket. The instructions suggest that when mounting the flag pole in a 3/4-inch socket you need to cut off a bottom section of the flag pole. This clearly will not fix the problem as the flag pole already rests on the lip of the socket without needing to be shortened. Ultimately I went to office max and purchased a box of rubber finger protectors and was able to cut one to fit on the bottom of the flag pole and create a tight fit.Overall this is a great looking product that is very poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with Gamecube","review":"I bought this product to clean my Gamecube and Wii.

It was beaten at the box office by Star Wars(1977), Smokey and the Bandit(1977) and The Spy Who Loved Me(1977). The film was based on a novel by Thomas Harris(The creator of Hannibal Lecter). The film has a good, nail biter music score by John Williams. The film portrays its bad guys as human and its heroes as \\"anti-heroes\\". The film does get violent at times. People get shot and blown up! A terrorist goes on a killing spree in one scene. The late Robert Shaw played Kabakov, an Israeli officer who must stop a terrorist attack during the Superbowl. Bruce Dern played a crazy Vietnam Vet who helps the bad guys. Black Sunday has a gritty, real world feel. Parts of the film look like a documentary. Black Sunday is an underrated 1970's thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"GENERIC","review":"A box office flop when it came out, and forgotten now, though the book was from the author of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, this movie is just another middle east terrorist story mixed with the cliched crazy Vietnam vet. Nothing special about the action, or acting.The lead-up is more interesting than the climax! It's not enough that tens of thousands of Americans might die, 10 times as many as with 911, so the movie has President Carter show up at the football game, to make the terrorists really seem bad!Not exactly boring, there are enough action scenes, it's just that the overall movie is so uninspired. TWO MINUTE WARNING, another football terrorist movie, came out about 6 months before BLACK SUNDAY, and has a better cast, partly cause it's treated like some 70s disaster movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cheap political propaganda movie.","review":"I don't know why a writer took the time to write this movie.

The result is a dense, druggy complicated mix of a few core analog synthesizers twisting and melting, overlapping and fading in and out of each other. The sequences and patterns these three guys come up with are consistently inventive and the tweakage is intense and fluid-2nd to none. Though they continued to work this way live, they largely abandoned this free-form acid techno jam style in favor of more straighforward techno trax on the subsequent albums.

Ive tried lights with the covers on and off and do not notice a difference is light output. They work great. Very sturdy and secure when snapped on properly. They are plastic so I would use caution if trying to install/remove them in colder temps. I liked the yellow, kinda pops more than the blk/whi 7210's and the color matches the factory covers. Again these are much heavier gauge plastic than the factory covers and have held up to multiple trips thru the car wash (with brushes), without loosening or coming off.

For example, it brings up the four P's (Place, Promotion, Price, Product) with a paragraph or two for each. It completely misses the idea that place might have changed from this new Internet thing.

It seemed to be derogatory towards gays, in the way that Noli (the female character) despised T.J. after she found out that he was gay. She uses derogatory terms towards him, and declares herself the enemy of T.J. and his new boyfriend. She is thoroughly selfish, and turns against him because she wanted to be his lover, and couldn't because he is gay. She didn't seem to understand what that meant. As a gay activist, and always looking out for the feelings of gays, I would have to say that this book does more harm to the reader then good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whistle Me Home","review":"This book was ok.

Forget that's it's a gay bashing book, forget that the main character is an alcoholic who is like totally harsh. It's BORING. It's poorly written. The theme could have produced a really excellent book, but it fell way short. There's no compassion on Nolie's part, and even TJ isn't so great, though I naturally feel for him a bit more than her. Please believe me, it's a bad book. Don't waste your money, in fact don't even waste your time. I wouldn't even reccommend you take it out of the library. It has no redeeming qualities, the only nice thing I can say about it is, it has a decent cover. Beware. P.S, I didn't want to give it one star, I wanted to give it MINUS stars, but apparently you're required to give a book at least one.

Wood. On thisfive song EP, Raymond wrote and sings all the songs, and Walden and Salvayprovide the sensitive folk guitar and string arrangements. The result issomething like the soundtrack to Thirtysomething with vocals, though with agreater melodic focus. Whatever you thought of the show, that's acomplement. Raymond's lyrics display the kind of sensitivity that mostmusicians haven't been willing to share since the pinnacle of the sensitivesinger-songwriter movement in the early '70's.

What I found is that Cosco has a different kind of tether latch for the rear hook that is much more difficult to adjust than other seats. I have to do it manually instead of just pulling on the strap the way I have done previously with Graco, for example. The tether system for the bottom hooks are uncomfortable to tighten as well and the seat does not remain in place as one would hope. I use it without the base as suggested by the worker from Babies 'R Us who installed it the first time. It sits much too high with the base in. Other than that it is a comfortable seat. Not one that you would want to buy if you ever need to remove and reinstall.

After using it twice, the straps began to twist. When the straps are twisted, you can't tighten the straps. Then, you can't use the car seat. Also, I bought it because of the recline. You can't use the recline in any car because the car seat is half off the seat. I called Cosco and they told me that all cars won't support the car seat. So, I called GM because I have a trailblazer. They told me that my seat is longer than on a car. So, the seat should fit. Even though it was a safety issue with the straps and tightening of the seat, ...refuses to take them back. There is nothing they will do for me. I would watch out when you buy at... We bought a Graco Platinum instead and the straps never twist. You can feel the difference in the quality of the straps.

Easy to install using the seatbelt in my car (of course no car seat I have ever owned is exactly the easiest thing I have ever done) . The advertising is misleading as one would think you can use the relicne feature for comfort, BUT if you read the instructions throughly, and if you get it installed correctly, the recline is only to help fit the car seat to your car. Once the car seat is in correctly, it is immpossilbe to recline. The base needs to slide forward, and if you can do that the car seat is NOT IN CORRECTLY, which defeats the whole purpose of a car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I bought this car seat in 2003 for my son, who was just turning one. It was easy to install, I do not have latch, so i used the seat belt. I love the recline option, his little head didnt slump forward. It is kinda a pain in the rear to take the cover off, but it's not to difficult. I have the hang of it now, and it only takes about 2-3 minutes to take it off completely. The only thing I dont like about it is the fact that the child has to be forward facing, it would be nice if it had a rear facing option. My daughter is 9 months old and too big for a infant carrier but not big enough for a forward facing car seat. So I'm not left with to many options.

Last year the reviews from consumer reports came out and this chair was on top. I have to question if they actually used the chair to have given it such a high rating. The LATCH is horrible to get to tighen sufficently. And when you need to release it as I often do since I tend to change cars frequently, it is next to impossible to get the buckel for it to work. The rear tether is impossible to tightnen. The harness straps CANNOT be tightned appropriately. There is always just a little too much give. I have used Fisher Price when the made seats, Graco, and Britax. ALL are better than this death trap. DON'T BUY IT!!! You will either end up replacing or returning in. And, it takes up so much room on a seat that your 3 person bench seat can only fit 2 seats. And it hangs over the front as well. HORRIBLE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read before buying!","review":"I think it is amazing that I wrote a review on this carseat and they didn't submit it.

They informed me that the seat is not made for SUV's and you can't use them in an SUV because of the base, therefore it is not safe to use in an SUV. They have not printed this on the box, because their sales will go down. Please do not remove this message. Im only concerned about safety of children, not the sale of this product.

Well he got his freedom alright. I could not keep him in the seat. The harness system is entirley way too easy for children to figure out and he did figure it out in 1 day. I had the same problem just using the belt and tether straps. He kept undoing the seat belt.Another issue. When I actually did have him in the seat the straps are a major pain... They twist on a daily basis and are a pain to fix. I also was unable to get the straps tight enough.I think the only way you can recline this seat is if it is not in your car. I have a mini-van and a suv and could not recline the seats.The only plus about this seat was that it is a nice looking seat.

The hassle I have with it is the clip on the seat belt, it is like a puzzle and is so annoying, my 5yr old gets stressed out every time she has to do as it takes such concentration and is just a total pain. I cannot tell you how many tears and stressed out times we have had trying to get her into this seat, the Graco I have in my other vehicle is such a breeze and she can clip herself in everytime without a fuss. The one star is ONLY for that it sits up higher allowing her to see out the window really nicely.

The latch & rear tether straps are virtually impossible to get tight because of the buckle mechanism. The drink holder is unreachable for a 5 point harness strapped in child.

I bought this one, and I am returning it.The tether is extrememly difficult to use. It should be like the Britax kind when you can tighten it after the seat is in place, but you have to adjust it to the right length BEFORE you put the car seat in! Also when using the 5pt harness, the shoulder strap is not held as secure as I am used to with the roundabout.

The cup holder is also out of reach for little arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know what all the complaining is about","review":"My son, age 2 loves his new Summit carseat and so do I. I researched all the booster seats and decided on this one. He fits well in it and he loves that it sits up high so he can see out. I have a compact car and it fits fine in the seat. It was a breeze to install, though it is a little heavier that his convertible seat was. I was able to install it all by myself, being 7 months pregnant. The straps don't twist. I don't see what all the complaining is about. My ONLY complaint is the price - being a single mom it was a little out of my price range, but my dad, not wanting to get my son yet another toy or outfit that he didn't need, purchased the carseat for his Christmas present. I would recommend this seat to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carseat, with some reservations...","review":"Bought this on the recommendation of Consumer Reports (the only one they actually recommended in their review -- all other seats failed their tests).

Have no problems like the other reviewers reported and it adjusts many different ways (including location of the crotch buckle). We have not yet used it as a seatbelt-positioning booster so I can't review that yet.The only problem: the rear tether anchor has a dumb strap design that I can't get to tighten. On our Britax seat you just pull on it and it tightens, this one is a loop-de-loop and the designers must have never actually tried to do it. This keeps it from the 5-star rating..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but uncomfortable","review":"This car seat features look great but the back of our son's thigh turned red and complained that it hurts when he's riding in it.

It is a good seat if you can use the base, but if you have bucket type seats in your car, or leather, I would not purchase this seat (the sides dig into the leather). Spend the extra $ and go for the Alpha Omega!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with the belts...","review":"I bought this seat for my daughter when she was 3 1/2. The belts are thin and twist so easily, they are thin and cheap. the little plastic latch broke in less than a year and had to be replaced. The seat she graduated out of had belts 1000X better, they were as thick as regular seat belts in your car and never twist. I really wish I had paid better attention to this when buying it b/c now I am in the market for a better one. Also it is very tall and is taller than my back seat (we have a Dodge Durango). I think it looks tacky, which is not very important, but I will be paying attention to this feature also as I fork out another 100+ bucks for a seat that is worth my child sitting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice seat, but BIG","review":"I bought this seat for my 2 year old daughter, hoping it would be her last carseat since it can be used as a seatbelt booster and accomodates a larger child than some convertible boosters. It is comfortable and relatively easy to get her in/out. However, this seat is huge! It takes up more backseat than we anticipated. We used to be able to fit a small adult fairly comfortably in the center backseat between my kids' carseats. It's doable now, but not comfortable for more than a quick trip. Would probably be a great fitting seat for huskier kids. Also, the attached cupholder is out of my daughter's reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"The title says it all. I was apprehensive after buying the seat, before having it installed I read some consumer reviews and was really nervous. I took it to a child seat safety station to install it, and have not looked back.My daughter loves it and she enjoys the roominess. The straps have not twisted yet in almost six months or so, but her Evenflo one did all the time. The buckle was not hard to figure out. The only drawback is the light colored fabric, but one day I will take off the cover to wash it. I am seriously considering getting my younger daughter one when she is old enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is a big deal if the straps get twisted!","review":"I bought this car seat for my son several months ago. After continuously trying to keep the straps from twisting we tried using it as a booster seat. He is 35lbs but only 26 months and too immature for that so I am going to buy a britax marathon. The straps twisting is a big deal because if you are in an accident and they are twisted they act as a rope and cut your child. They dont twist in all car seats. I have never had this problem with our fisher price seat.. ever. Thicker straps dont twist. The other thing about this seat is I have never been able to get it tight in any car with the seatbelt only. It does very well with the LATCH. Oh yes, and the tether is a pain in the rear to tighten. It takes forever and is unneccesarily difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't get the pencil to work at ...","review":"I couldn't get the pencil to work at first, then followed the directions of soaking my fingertips in warm water for about a minute. That made a big difference. The nail whitener pencil makes the tips of my nails white and well defined. It also survived many hand washings without wearing off. I like this pencil; it's easy to use and does what it says it will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never tried a nail whitener before ...","review":"I have never tried a nail whitener before and was very pleased with my experience. My nails are very short and thus not very noticeable. The Revlon nail whitener made my nail tips much whiter and more attractive in appearance; now I don't mind if someone looks at my hands. I would certainly recommend that family and friends give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product may work better for someone with ...","review":"This product may work better for someone with long nails. Mine are medium length and it was kind of messy, leaving white all over my fingers. But as for whitening, it wasn't a very noticeable whitening. It's not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Revlon Nail Whitener Pencil sounds like a ...","review":"The Revlon Nail Whitener Pencil sounds like a wonderful idea. The idea that you can make the tips of your nails extra white is fantastic. The problem is that it didn't make much of a difference to my nails. Also, the white of the pencil came off on the tips of my fingers. If they improved this product, I would be willing to try it one more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter and I enjoyed this product. It ...","review":"My daughter and I enjoyed this product. It was easy to use and gave the illusion of a French manicure without the time or expense of a salon visit. The fact that it would also just wash off kept the nails neat without the peeling polish look. Low cost, low maintenance, and high-fashion look -- I like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first time I tried the nail whitening ...","review":"The first time I tried the nail whitening pencil I thought it was great. I had the look of a French manicure without the cost. Being a mom of two boys under 4 years old, I am at the sink a lot washing my hands. I noticed after washing my hands that the whitening pencil had also washed off. I reapplied and washed my hands again. Again it washed off. I like the product, however would recommend someone use it only if they aren't going to be washing their hands anytime soon. Like maybe if they are going out to eat or a party, but even still, the chances are that you would wash your hands and end up with dull nails again. That could be embarrassing depending on the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MOVIE","review":"The previous review mentions much of what I would say, except that it becomes clear with about 40 mins ( and that is still a lot of time )left that this movie is totally lost. You hold on for a intelligent resolution that could have happened but is a mess. That leaves only that this is a misleading and quite bad movie on all counts. There's even mention of werewolves without any story reasoning. Worse a brother sister rape, and late needless swearing that only adds to the sadness of this broken story. Buy, no. Rent, you could do worse but you will be throwing away money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"The finish on the watch and band is cheap.

He covers everything from the most exquisite Japanese cuisine to his quest for the perfect American pie crust. The only thing that keeps me from giving this book a fifth star is the fact that Jeffrey seems to be a little confused about his barbecue. I always have to look with suspicion at anyone who thinks that Memphis is the world capitol of barbecue and that the Memphis in May contest is the ultimate barbecue competition. His writing regarding the subject was certainly entertaining, but perhaps could have been better had he utilized a side-by-side comparison with Kansas City barbecue. (Kansas City would have won, hands down)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"Once I picked this book up, I could not put it down for the life of me! Yes, the guy sounds a bit off-putting at first, but the book is so incredibly thorough, so well written, so funny, informative, exhaustive, I cannot say enough! If you like to cook, love to eat, and want to read about it, you need to read this book. It was so funny at times I laughed out loud. This guy has SUCH a passion for food, such awesome research! I'm a vegetarian, so even though I couldn't eat \\"everything\\", I was sure jealous of his job."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can't eat it, read it!","review":"I subscribe to VOGUE magazine primarily to get Steingarten's monthly food column. His essay on Parmesan brought tears of longing to my eyes, and his search for the perfect hors d'oeuvre 'cake' was a hoot. I am glad he's collected some of his gems in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, wry, and delectable","review":"Steingarten combines passion, curiosity, erudition, and his lovely wry writing to make a great food book. His scholarly digging and his willingness to use the scientific method to test things is remarkable (his chapter on water, for example). He also finds some real food curiosities such as the Thompson Turkey.Anyone who relishes seeing an active, far ranging mind at work will love this book. Great gift book. Easy to read a chapter at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I devoured this book. Steingarten is an amazingly funny writer and it's fascinating to read about his experiments with food. If you love to eat, read this book - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have never liked Jeffrey Steingarten and find him stuffy and odd. I wanted to give this book a chance since the food industryis complex and it may give me an insight. I just couldn't finish the book tho, I still find him weird. Don't buy this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop being so damn fussy!","review":"For all the fussy eaters out there - read this book! Your allergies are a lie, your dislikes are irrational. Jeffrey Steingarten shows how anyone can get used to anything, and that most people who claim \\"allergies\\" to a particular food aren't allergic at all, but need a socially acceptable excuse to not eat it.Stop it now. Read the book and stop making your life into a hell of \\"Oh no, I can't eat that, I'm allergic, I'm so sorry, but you know, I realise you put a lot of effort into making that, I wish I could eat it etc. etc.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of prejudice and, well... Lots of prejudice","review":"Steingarten tries so hard to be clever and witty, but his prejudice gets in the way all the time. Maybe he should ask some advice from Glenn O'Brien and Chandler Burr on how to be provocative and yet funny. And how much would you trust someone who thinks it's togue in cheek to assert his love for Diet Coke? Very boring. Also, reading all the gratuitous offenses Steingarten directs at Yanomami indians in Brazil (\\"a bunch of bloodthirsty maniacs\\", according to the author) left me paralized. I don't get his point..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the reviews sounded.","review":"I was pretty disappointed in Steingarten's book. It's certainly not as riveting or entertaining as I expected from other reviews. What I found really annoying was the way he goes into intense, excruciating detail about some aspect of food, e.g. the taste of water. Then suddenly, as if he stopped, counted words, and realized he had made the required limit for his column, he cuts the article off with a unfullfilling, anti-climatic \\"That's the way it is!\\" (Not an exact quote of course!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man who Complained about Everything","review":"The title of this book drew me in. I love reading any book about food. I imagined Steingarten was going to memorize me with his lifelong stories of delicious treats and fabulous meals from far and wide. Instead, I read about a finicky man who drinks entirely too much diet Coke to comment on dietary needs. What am I supposed to eat Mr. Steingarten? Apparently spinach will kill me, but foie gras should be served for breakfast, lunch and dinner. His yo-yo dieting of veganism and high fat French fad diets doesn't exactly make him a trusting source for nutritional information. This book left me hungry, bored, scared to eat, and too intimidated to make mashed potatoes ever again. Instead of eating today, I guess I'll just call all those 1-800 numbers Steingarten likes to give out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, an unexpectedly funny and riveting book","review":"I would never have bought this book if a friend hadn't insisted that I sit down and read at least the first chapter. I like to eat food, not read about it. But Jeffrey Steingarten is a riveting, funny, argumentative, bloshy, emphatic writer. I laughed my way through this. I bought a copy for myself, then went back for two more to give as gifts. A surprising treat. In the beginning Steingarten writes about how he ate his way all the foods he had convinced himself he was repulsed by. And found some of them surprisingly good (others revolting). I would have argued that a book about food by the food critic for Vogue could only be a stuffy, pompous self-satisfied piece of writing. I was wrong, wrong, wrong. If Steingarten was an item of food I'd convinced myself I couldn't possibly like, I must now go back on myself and say, love it, DELICIOUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane","review":"What was the point? Not funny. Not insightful. Not entertaining. I tried hard, but I couldn't get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guy who likes to hear himself ramble","review":"After reading all of the reviews, I thought this would be a good, insightful read for someone who is interesting in the culinary arts. Instead, it's like listening to someone tell you a long boring story and you don't have the heart to stop them. He goes on about little projects like finding the cheapest subsistence diet, the difference between ketchups, and all the ridiculous diets he has been on. Very boring, inconclusive, and uninteresting. Also, I wouldn't trust anyone's palette who likes Diet Coke as much as this guy. $14 bucks wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was eagerly waiting for the arrival of this book. It seemed so interesting and original... Wrong! I started reading it and found myself just skipping page after page. I have a pretty good sense of humour, but I found nothing funny in this book. Just some rattling of someone who thinks he is funny and who is apparently as much in love with himself as he is with some of the food he eats. I really do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, maybe - nutritionally responsible not!","review":"This may be a mildy entertaining and informative book on food around the world, but to make such wide claims as salad consumption leading to death is absurd. Steingarten obviously loves food and food high in fat, calories and cholesterol so this book will certainly make you, and himself, feel better about eating these foods, that is until you keel over from a heart attack. His advice on nutrition is out-dated, selectively researched and all together wrong in many areas. Please use caution when taking health advice from somone who spends days, weeks and a lifetime searching for the best french fry or ice cream cone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One For The Boys","review":"In Jerry Styner's \\"One For The Boys\\", he has given us all a precious gift of music and sentiment. While particularly targeting the gay community, the music and lyrics transcend sexual preference, speaking to the hearts and minds of us all as we cope with the vicissitudes of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience Is Its Own Reward","review":"Finally!... An album of love songs targeted at the gay life-style that isn't either so high-camp it's embarrassing to listen to, or so maudlin-sweet you need a dose of insulin between tracks. Each song rings true in both lyric and musical content and the instrumentation supporting Jerry Styner's voice is lush without being overpowering. All-in-all this is by far the best album of its genre offered today. More, Mr. Styner... MORE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JMER","review":"My thanks to Jerry Styner for producing this CD. I was glad to purchase the item, but I must report that I found it disappointing. I might have been expecting too much but I found that I don't like the songs, too slow for my taste, even for romatic ballads. And, the material seemed dated. Maybe that's what the producer was going for, but I could have heard this stuff in 1955. It really didn't sound \\"gay\\" to me either, if that makes any sense. I don't want to discourage anyone from buying the CD and I think it would help if potential buyers could hear some of the album via their computers. It may be available now, but I didn't have a chance to listen to any of the songs before I bought the CD. Anyway good luck to Jerry Styner, at least he made the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"So You Want To Write A Book\\"","review":"\\"The book, written in entertaining, common-prose style, not only provides useful insight into the writing process, but also the self-publishing, marketing and selling process of the non-fiction book.\\" (Mr. Witt did not actually \\"star rate\\" the book)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, could be better","review":"Well, it was ok.

She loves her snorkel vest and has even been able use it while snorkeling with the schools of leopard sharks and bat rays that come to a beach annually near our home in San Diego. The vest is bright yellow so keeps her visible from nearby boat and kayak traffic. Very well constructed, I know it will last her for many years. I was so impressed, I bought an adult size for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a potty training doll","review":"After watching Dr. Phil's Primetime Special on how to potty train in one day, I bought this doll as suggested. It's a great baby doll for pretend play, but not for potty training. It does NOT hold the water so that you can show the \\"trickling\\" effect into the potty. The water goes straight through while you're feeding the water from the bottle. So my search for the perfect potty training doll continues. The doll I find, needs to hold the water so that my toddler gets the idea when she sees it going in the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm all wet","review":"I bought this doll to help potty train my toddler. We're starting tomorrow, so I took it out of the box tonight to try it. The tip of the bottle was too short, so when I tried to give the bottle to the doll, the water dribbled all over her, me, and the floor. A tiny bit made it into the potty. I tried and tried to make it work, but I just got soaked. I'm an intelligent person who doesn't usually struggle with assembling toys, but this stupid doll has been peeing all over me all night. Then, to top it all off, a really creepy looking bug crawled out of the packaging. So the whole thing went in the garbage outside, and now I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow. I wish I had that money back. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"intelligent woman can't figure out how to give doll a bottle!","review":"Maybe its me, but we purchased this doll so my daughter could have a baby to feed and play with and reinforce the potty training issue. Number 1: the lid doesn't come off the bottle you have to fill a sink/pan up with water and suck the water into the bottle. 2: the bottle doesn't seem to fit in the doll's mouth 3: big mess..luckily its only water! This has been sitting in the corner since we brought it home. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence","review":"Queensryche Is By Far One Of My Favorite Bands And This EP Is An excellent start for anybody wanting to get into them, each track is better than the last, The First 4 tracks are older sound comparaed to the prophecy which was made in a different studio and sounds much claerer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Pumping, High Energy Rock","review":"A friend turned me on to Queensryche with this EP in 1986 and I was hooked.

This product met all of my expectations with the exception of the product description. The toy is wonderful, but the description made it sound like it did a little more than it actually does. i.e. it takes forever to get water to come out of the squeeze faucett and a few of the toys don't stay on the sink well. However, I do love the mesh basin (kids can put things in and take things out) and the hanging part of the toy (will prevent the toy from mildew). Obviously, the above irritations would not keep me from buying this product again, because I would suggest this for anyone with a busy boy or girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, nothing special","review":"I bought this for my almost 2 year old after reading the rave reviews. It's pretty disappointing. It doesn't do anything but float. The blue spray nozzle doesn't really work. You're supposed to squeeze it and it acts like a squeeze toy and is SUPPOSED to make the water run. Instead you get a airy spray of water. The only thing my daughter really seems to like about it is the orange cup that has holes on the bottom. She likes to scoop up water in it and watch it trickle out from the bottom. It's an okay toy I guess, but don't expect anything spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geomags are the best!","review":"These are fun for the whole family.

The idea of soundtracks is that it resonates with the movie, adds to the atmosphere and even helps move the story forward.This soundtrack did all of those. The main titles is a masterpiece in its sinister theme and shifting, oppressive beats; it really draws out the mood of Bourne's world, where everything could be a possible threat and his memory is a distant blur. Actually, there are some catchy beats in the soundtrack, such as Hotel Regina, Treadstone assassins, and even The Apartment. Another nice track I liked is 'At the Bank'.All in all, this is an excellent soundtrack, especially if you have seen the movie. I thought this soundtrack was better than Bourne Supremacy (except a few tracks I liked in the second movie)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't rate this if you're looking for chase music","review":"The music contained on this cd is not part of an album, rather a soundtrack.

Then I checked these reviews and found that the chase tune isn't in the CD. BUT! I stumbled across it in Apple's new online music store, just by freakin' chance. The tune for the big chase is Paul Oakenfold's \\"Ready, Set, Go\\" from his Bunkka album. Go hear it for yourself and see if I didn't get it right (could be wrong, y'know)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that...","review":"I am frankly puzzled by the rave reviews of this CD. I have listened to it several times and while it makes for good background listening (I have used it to track into my home videos), it's not all THAT.John Powell has done much better, more interesting work and while his string arrangements and interesting orchestrations here do deserve some attention, the score as a whole comes across as decidedly un-memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistent & Enjoyable","review":"The composer (Powell) had an equally great feel for the action as for the poignant scenes in the movie. It was obvious that he was very much in touch with each scene as he scored it, which led me to believe that he watched the movie and enjoyed (as well as took pride in) his contribution to it. Found no disparity anywhere.Matt Damon, who had previously led me to believe (as Keanu Reeves before \\"The Matrix\\"), that he was just another pretty face with a good agent and, like Dyan Cannon, who was once reviewed as \\"having no end to her 'lack of talent'\\", ultimately rose to the occasion and made this movie extremely enjoyable escapism entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the soundtrack","review":"I bought this CD expecting a soundtrack. Instead it is a score of the basic theme music of the movie. While enjoyable as backgound music, Powell is stretching to find 19 ways to explore the theme, and I grow tired of it after a while.I wish the package had been properly marked (\\"Score for the Bourne Identity\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of help please!","review":"I love the movie and the soundtrack.

However the rest of soundtrack is top-notch, and a very worthy film score. The scores for the action scenes are done very well, which support the movie well, and stand admirably on their own. Overall it's an original, varied, and moody soundtrack, and I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this CD. What you really want is Paul Oakenfold","review":"After watching The Bourne Identity, I was impressed with how cool the music was, and wanted to get my hands on it. So, I did the natural thing - went and bought the sound track. That's when I figured it out. The music I wanted to hear wasn't there. The song played during the car chase is \\"Ready Steady, Go\\" from Paul Oakenfold, and the other cool song is \\"Extreme Ways\\" from Moby (plays during the credits.) The sound track CD is merely a collection of 2-3 minute shorts that were obviously meant to be listen to in combination with a movie, and they fail to stand on their own. (Okay, there's about 3 tracks that are halfway cool, but one of these also wasn't in the movie - it's the remix at the end of the album.) Save yourself a few bucks and go buy the music you remember form the movie. (Also, if you like the music in the trailers, check out the sound track to \\"Run Lola Run\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting and Original Score- Buy It Now!","review":"This is an awesome soundtrack! The music was stuck in my head after watching the movie, so I bought it the very next day. John Powell does a fantastic job of creating great melodies and arranging them with a variety of instruments. You hear drums, bass, violins, guitars and techno sounds, all working together to give an exciting and original score. The fight music is some of the most exciting music I have ever heard. Kind of like Crouching Tiger, but 10 times better. I have been playing this CD at home, in my truck and even in the background at work. It really gets me energized.

People who didn't like this book probably didn't really have the dirve to stop cutting anyway. You have to want to change, and it says that a million times. Yes, of course they promote their own program, but who wouldn't. It provides a ton of useful tools to quit self injuring. It even provieds sample impulse control logs and ways to interview a potential therapist. The only thing I dissagree with is that they do not consider SI to be an addiction, and I think that it is. Either way, the book is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've been to the author's website and it is wonderful. I ordered this book with high expectations which were crushed in the first few pages. As one who has struggled with self-injury, I say that they didn't necessarily say anything wrong, but somehow I felt more frustrated, hopeless, and even looked down upon the farther I got into the book. Whether it was what was said or how the message was delivered, I don't know. Perhaps for helpers it's a good book. But to self-injurers looking for hope, GET A DIFFERENT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Used as a tool for small group work","review":"The authors of the book didn't write this as an instruction manual for running a small group of middle school girls who were cutting.

The program changed my life and I originally read the book because I'm one of the case studies. I think the best part is the discussion on why people self injure, and how the reasoning self injurers use is flawed. I would especially recommend the book for family members and friends of self injurers because it explains a lot and takes away some of mystery around why people engage in these behaviors."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"This book as some good points and the program it discusses may be very successful. My main problem with this book and most others on SI is it's emphasis on SI stemming from childhood abuse or trauma. I self-injured for nearly 4 years as a teen and have never been abused in any way. According to this book if I wasn't overtly abused, I was biologically frail and sensitive to less obvious abuse or trauma. That is just insulting. I am now a counselor myself and I can assure you, I was never abused. While many individuals who self-injure may have been abused I think it is time to acknowledge those who self-injure and weren't abused instead of simply dismissing their experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect party accesory","review":"The bucket works great and keep ice cold for many hours with no condensation.

I was sadly disappointed, to learn that he only has ONE CD out and it is not representative of Blackstone.

There was a whole section of sex that served no purpose whatsoever and so much arbitrary background data that I skimmed over a ton of it. I don't know what happened to Mr. McBain with this book, but it was sure a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"McBain Fails","review":"This is not your typical McBain book. The plot and the characters are not believable at all. This seems to be a put down on all local law enforcement as well as FBI. I long for new Matthew Hope or the 87th stories, which are the author's strong points. I will keep this in my library but unlike all my others by McBain this will not be reread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Jeop Fare","review":"The jeop genre depends on a heroine who has no common sense and insists on proving that at every plot juncture. It's hard to imagine this came from McBain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"There's the usual snappy dialogue, and this is certainly an easy read, but I just didn't like this book. I never believed in Alice, and the identity of the villain is blindingly obvious. What I found particularly distasteful were two long descriptions of Alice's methods of contraception, just dropped into the narrative for no particular reason. What on earth is McBain up to here? Is this supposed to be an insight into the female mind, or what? I just found it creepy. In fact the whole book is slightly creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No surprises here","review":"After reading an overview regarding the plot of this book, I decided to give Ed McBain's latest novel a whirl. After 20 minutes into the book, I had the mystery figured out. Okay, I was a little off on one of the characters (I surmised it was a girl in the Caribbean and actually it was a black girl who worked at the local ice cream depot, but still...). I read the entire book in one day and while enjoyable, it is predictable even to the politically correct Bush bashing (bad economy and he stole the election from Gore, dag-nabbit) which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot. If you want a mindless, easy-to-put-down and finish quickly book, \\"Alice in Jeopardy\\" is for you. If you want a novel full of surprises and twists, amazing characters and an author who leaves his personal politics out of the story, pick up a Harlan Coben novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Ed McBain gone?","review":"This truly was the most disappointing Ed McBain book I have read! By the time I had read 150 pages I decided I'd had enough...the plot is too easy to figure out, no suspense, the cops are a farce and put a bad name on Florida law enforcemente, etc., etc. I sure hope McBain goes back to the 87th Precinct and \\"finds himself\\" once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!","review":"I have never heard of Ed McBain, and after this, I'm not inclined to try any of his other books. I read a lot, but I also listen to books in the car, as I drive a lot. I picked this out at the library, as the blurbs made it sound interesting. I'm only about 1/2 way through, and trying to make myself finish it, so that Mr. McBain will be redeemed in my eyes. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to do so. The local police seemed, at first, to be doing a good job, and I thought it might be them against the FBI. But now I've decided that none of the characters are in the least believable with their responses to each situation. The faithful housekeeper is ridiculous. The police are ridiculous. Even the kidnappers are ridiculous. Luckily, I haven't wasted my money, but I would also encourage you not to waste either your money OR your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contractural obligation, or what?","review":"I've read at least 25 McBain/Hunter books and this is probably the only one I wouldn't recommend. The plot is full of holes, such as the police leaving the main character totally alone in the middle of an investigation.As a few have mentioned, there are characters that contribute nothing to the story and serve no purpose. There are some misplaced political asides that appear from nowhere also. I guess they made Ed feel better at the time. Both the characters and the commentary are distractions and nothing but filler.It's sad that Ed/Evan has passed on, and he was a great, some would argue the greatest, author of the police procedural, but this isn't one of them by a longshot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vovo dos manuais de instrucao do kitesurf","review":"Desatualizado.

I bought it to learn how to kitesurf but the section was only about 40 pages without much technical details. The other sections are about land, snow, etc...

The MK1 and 2 stages, too. Plus, it could have featured tutorials on how to do combos, stage fatalities, Shang Tsung's morphs, et cetera. If Midway or the MK team were to take these suggestions, then there wouldn't be a reason to challenge the title of the game: Ultimate Mortal Kombat.By the way, I can't understand why Midway wouldn't make any ending portraits as used in MK3.

Kim Darby had the leading role in it, not John Wayne; and even with anticipating his arrival onscreen a half-hour into it, I became so bothered by Mattie Ross's (Kim Darby) repugnant character that I almost gave up on it.

Back in 1970, when John Wayne got the Academy Award over Dustin Hoffman, I thought an injustice had been done. I was wrong. The Oscar is awarded for accomplishment. Sometimes it's purely for acting but sometimes other elements are taken into consideration. The Academy made the right call.

He even crinkles his nose when he delivers his lines.The Coen brothers remake is very good but the script adheres very closely to the Charles Portis novel.The story is filled with old fashioned English and the tone is much darker.

Readers who want to know what Einstein was really like should obtain a used copy of the original full version."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a wise choice","review":"The content is good, but I don't recommend you buy it.

I have rarely seen so many errors that are obviously printer/scanning errors, that should have been caught by an editor, average about two errors per page. Where the word should be \\"in\\" they use \\"m\\", they use odd symbols for the letters \\"ae\\" and other oddball things. It is kind of like reading Einstein's work and working a crossword puzzle at the same time as you have to figure out two puzzle per page! This book, the work of the great man, due to the bad errors is worth maybe two bucks tops....no photos, no subject index, scores of errors that should have been editorially caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noble Scientist and Humanitarian","review":"Given his genius and unique humor, Albert Einstein was perhaps one of the greatest scientists and humanitarians that ever lived. His brilliance and simplicity of contemplation, thinking, and scientific conclusions glow like no other.Given the posture and essence of his being, so many of his complex theories enamor the scientist, the layman and all humanity. His mind and thought processes were simplicity at its best. Einstein's humor is thought provoking and hits the heart like none other. I came away enlightened.

This book shows you what the scene was on that day and the days afterwards. Many comments have been made about the 1 photo of the unbelievable horror that occured that day. Yes, there was no sticker to tell you it was coming, but do you really think a book about 9/11 wouldn't include some photos that make us all disgusted? I have found too many publications that whitewash the event so as not to offend, but we lose our desire not to let it happen again as it becomes a distant memory. Many in this country have already forgotten that day and what it felt like and how sickening it was and if this book, however small, makes us remember how we felt that day and how proud we were to be Americans, then it is worth it over 1 photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick and Self-Promoting","review":"The pictures in this book are collected from some of the best professionals in the business along with photos from talented amateurs. Sadly these are all packaged in a slick/arty coffee table tome that makes the event feel like another Hollywood product, one image after the next. The only words in the book are saved for the organisers to talk about themselves and how popular their effort to sell photos of the event has been (and the celebrities who came to visit). As the \\"New York Times\\" book reviewer said, it would be great to be able to rip the photos out of the book and present them in a much simpler and more honest format."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful surprise","review":"I picked up this cd without every hearing any of their stuff.

I would say: when it doesn't tweeze. This thing can't pull or grasp a hair of any diameter. The hair just slips through the tweezing pads. The problem is that the tips don't come together when you close the tweezer. Tweezers are made of two steel legs welded at one end and ground flat at the other end where the tweezing pads come together. If the pads are misaligned at the welding operation they are going to be out of alignment at the grinding operation. The result is a defective unit. To compensate a secondary operation can be used to force the weldment to come into alignment. However, this type of alignment is never perfect. Also, if the tweezer legs are too hard from the heat treating operation, too much force can actually cause to tips to flay open and they will not function properly. I think they had better review their manufacturing and capabilities processes on this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAND FUNK RAILROAD THE '71 TOUR","review":"GRAND FUNK RAILROAD THE '71 TOUR is simply the GREATEST live album ever.

Along with Bachman Turner Overdrive, they defined the sweaty, blue-collar hard rock sound that was the antithesis of such egg-headed contemporaries as Yes and Emmerson, Lake and Palmer. This single disc collection gathers just about all the Funk worth hearing in one economically priced package.The disc includes all of the Funk standards, the anthemic \\"We're an American Band,\\" \\"Mean Mistreater,\\" \\"Shining On,\\" the bowlderdized covers of Traffic's \\"Feelin' Alright,\\" the Stones's \\"Gimmie Shelter,\\" Little Eva's \\"The Loco-Motion\\" and the reworking of \\"Walk Like a Man.\\" This collection gets bonus points for containing the full length (over ten minute) \\"I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home\\" and the last big funk single, \\"Some Kind of Wonderful,\\" that was left off of most earlier Funk anthologies.Overall, a fine representative collection from a band that virtually defines the term 70's nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Lemon","review":"The watch is much better looking than in the picture.

Not only did I waste my $30 in cash, I wasted hours of my time. This is the worst product I think I have ever used. The instructions suggest cutting a slightly over sized piece of material and trimming it during application. This is a mistake as the material tears along a cut VERY easily, and will likely tear right into the area covering the window (this happened on all 3 attempts as I wasted the entire roll). Once I finally got it trimmed (with gouges, tears, and all) I couldn't keep the corners from curling up no matter how hard I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating product!!","review":"Glad to see I'm not the only one having troubles! this is hands down my most frustrating DIY project and I'm quite a patient person.

I do think this would be easier on 1 big window. Working in these small areas is so difficult and trimming has been my nightmare. I definitely bought my own razor as the one in the pack lasted for about 2 panes. The corners are what drives me nuts - b/c they are NOT sticking. Also, while trimming the small space, it shifts causing it to not be a flush trim job on the other side.Would NOT recommend this product for small panes ..

There is a glossary of medical terminology at the back of the book, a good bibliography for further reading and a section of notes for interesting material that didn't make it into the main text.

Very disappointed. Amazon should pull this product as it reflects very poorly on the retailer in my opinion ... and Amazon is almost always my go to website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk","review":"I went to the grocery store to hopefully get a generic one, but only found this one.

I was ecstatic when he gave it to me and promptly put it on. Unfortunately, about a week later, the flimsy latch finally gave way after several attempts by me to keep the ring from suddenly popping open. I emailed the company right away to see if I could send it back for repair, and over a week later, have still not received a reply from them.I love this ring and will go to a local jeweler to see if the latch can be repaired, but am very upset that I have not heard back from Silver Insanity.

I love the jungle scene where they're whipping through on the wires. That was breathless! It's got everything: adventure (danger, mystery, intrigue), romance (gotta have some mushy stuff but doesn't overdo it), and a great ecological slant. Hopefully something like this couldn't really happen in real life. What will Hemm & Kohari's next big adventure be? I'll be one of the first to buy & read on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one and only way to loose and keep healthy weight","review":"There are so many weight loss methods available in the market. Inspite of them I always believed there is no substitute for a balanced diet. I did not know properly about portion size, food pyramid, how to shop healthy and so many different things. But this particular DVD is so simple to understand and follow I felt as if I found the magic wand to loose weight. I honestly believe there is no shortcut to weight loss and maintaining healthy weight. This DVD taught me to imbibe healthy lifestyle as a part of my everyday life. I lost weight couple of times and gained back but this time I am confident I will be able to maintain and retain my healthy weight throughout my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Satisfied","review":"Documents to go is everything I hoped it would be.

There is no real formatting in the word processor, you can't set the font, the spreadsheet frequently looses information, and stuff.But for first time users, it is a nice way to see what the Palm can do I think.Eddie"},{"rating":"1","title":"GET A NEW JOB YOU HORRIBLE PIANIST","review":"Your music has NO melody.

It is just simply put, too unbelievable to make any sense. I think Ms. Clark must have decided her readers are morons and decided to just throw a lot of nonsense in a blender and then pour it onto pages.The lead character, Celia, has to be about the most simple minded fool to ever have made it to print and all the rest of the characters are just plain boring. It had no suspense to it because you really can figure out who the villian is before the 2nd chapter, even with the growing dementia that MHC is sure we all suffer from. Save your time, save your money and say a prayer that Mary Higgins Clark is in a slump.

I've never written a review before, nor have I ever listened or read anything by Mary Higgins Clark before. This book is so awful that it's laughable and I just had to go to Amazon and read some other thoughts. Surprised I was, no flabbergasted, to find good reviews! If you're at all a discerning reader/listener, you can approach this epic for a good laugh, or forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT","review":"I'm surprised to see so many negative and lukewarm reviews.

Read 1/2 the book, just read the predictable ending. This is BS it wasn't written by Mary Higgins Clark it was written by Mary and Carol Higgins Clark. What a total load of BS. If Carol Higgins Clark wants to write, stand on your own two feet. Your mom is in her 70's give her a break. This reminds me of V C Andrewes and the lost novels after her death. So if something happens to Mary Higgins Clark is Carol going to say she found 15 unfinised novels that she will publish under her mothers name?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read for entertainment","review":"I read this book to keep me occupied during my son's soccer games and swimming lessons. Not very engaging. I knew the villain right in the very beginning, but just read on to see how the story goes. Usually, I don't take this long, but it took me 3 weeks to complete this book. Just didn't engage me enough to make me stay up and finish it like other MHC books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm SO dissapointed","review":"This was the first time that I found myself tempted to abandon a book midway. Is it just me, or did this work of MHC come across as boring, mechanical, and just plain uninspired? I have read and loved most of MHC's earlier works, but this one read more like a hastily thrown together newspaper story. I especially found the scene where the landscaper is supposedly mulling over his situation ( where he had to buy another cell phone), to be redundant, boring, and begging to be weeded out of the manuscript. I agree with the other review I just read. Please, MHC, you're killing me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love Mary Higgins Clark, and have read all of her books. Some in the recent past have been sort of predictable to me, but this one, I loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my fav but still....","review":"I was driving to Ohio from North Carolina and borrowed this unabridged audio book cd from the video store I worked at. I figured it would be more stimulating than the radio (especially when going thru the back woods of Virginia & West Virginia - where signals are weak). I had never listened to an audio book before and thought, if I don't like it, I don't have to listen to it... Little did I know, I listened to it the entire trip. I even left it on when refilling my gas so I could still listen to it. I don't think that this is her BEST book, but I did bring the last cd into my friends house to finish it that night. I enjoyed it for what it was... and have since looked for additional audio books of hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best in years...","review":"Mary Higgins Clark has really set the bar high with her new riveting novel, NO PLACE LIKE HOME. This book is a gripper, and doesn't let you go. She has made a great book, and is possibly her best since ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book she has ever written","review":"I was horribly disappointed in this book. Mary Higgins Clark is not known for deep writing but I can count on her to provide a fast paced, suspenseful, and enjoyable book that keeps you guessing. This is most definitely not the case with No Place Like Home. If you are familiar with her work it will be painfully obvious who the bad guy is from the beginning. The coincidences are too much to take and the heroine left me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Point to this Book","review":"I am a fan of Mary Higgins Clark's so this book came as a major disappointment to me. I recognized the bad guy the minute he was introduced, and that was almost immediately. The characters were not as well fleshed out as her other novels and I simply couldn't care about any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd stinker","review":"I managed to finish the first cd of this audio book. Then rushed to the library to return it. What an absurd idiotic piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst MHC book I've read","review":"I haven't read many of her newer books but I saw this one in paperback and grabbed it. So disappointing!! The plot was formulaic and the continual, random introduction of a new character without explaining fully their significance was extremely annoying and confusing. I forced myself to read this book thinking that eventually it would hook me; it never did. I usually inhale good books (read in a couple days, a week max) but this one took me three weeks to read. The ending \\"twist \\" seemed forcibly abrupt and unbelievable. MHC is/was a great author, but I'd recommend sticking with her older books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Mary Higgins Clark's last few novels have been very up and down. One good, the next one not so good. This was not one of the better ones. The plot was far-fetched and easily figured out. The first person writing was not has good as the rest of her third-person writing and really narrowed the focus of the novel.If you want a good book, go back and read one of her early works, but skip this one. I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on the hardback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good storyline, disappointing style.","review":"I like Ms Clark's work, and have tried to read all her mysteries. This book, however, doesn't match her previous compositions. It almost reads like a first novel. The paragraph structure is weaker than previous books, although the story line is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Place Like Home","review":"I have read everyone of Mary Higgins Clarks books. Every spring I start getting excited for her new publication. This book did not disappoint. I loved the way she used Liza's history in telling the story. She is confident yet very vulnerable and this is played out very well. Thank You, Mary, for another great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real author please stand up?","review":"Not your typical good novel by MHC. It is more along the bad writing style of boring and ridiculous of that of her daughter Carol Higgins Clark. I am a true fan of Mary Higgins Clark, have the hardcover editions of every book she has ever written. Read a CHC book and then read one of the few really poor ones of MHC and there is a definite similarity in poor writing. The daughter has even tried her hand at acting in the made for TV movies of her mother's novels and that too is equally bad. For me, I can't help but think CHC is \\"assisting\\" in the writing that is having mom's name penned because it would be a definite sell. The Queen of Suspense has only disappointed me a few times over the years with a bad book, this being one. I could only recommend this book for a true collector to put on the shelf to complete a collection, but definitely not worth the time or effort to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"please make it end!","review":"I have read about 75% of this book and just can't motivate myself to get to the end.

You'll never hear Ronnie do Elvis'voice in the harder Rock mode ala \\"Hound dog\\" orthe Hard blues of \\"reconcider baby\\" because Elvis had a Gutsy voice.

But I guess food and wine is realy not the point of Le Cirque but clearly who sits where and with whom is. I lived in New York throughout the eighties, ate out two or three time a week, and in my circle of foodies Le Cirque was considered a joke. Reading this book only reinforces this view.

This book centers around the plague and murders related. The premise, like many of this series, is not what it appears. Ms. Vargas weaves french history and culture quite beautifully with the characters' personalities creating a page turning read.These are translated from French, and while some translations of books are ponderous and rather boring, these are not.If you like rather dark mysteries with many unique undertones of sadness, mystery, history and culture, these books are for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting historical mystery","review":"Both my wife and I really enjoyed this book.

The first few chapters are not smooth, this book was written in French and translated into a British style English. But once people start dying it moves right along, with an unconventional if not brilliant ending, a good read but not fantastic. Not as good as an Ian Rankin Inspector Rebus novel. It was entertaining to read but it did not leave me looking for more books by the same French author, a woman named Fred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mystery series","review":"Fred is our favorite mystery author.

I only bought the CD for the only song I like, which is Imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great soundtrack to a great film","review":"This 21-song disc makes an admirable effort at compressing John Lennon's entire remarkable carreer onto a single album. All the way from the early Beatles rendition of \\"Twist & Shout\\" through classics like \\"In My Life\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Revolution\\" to his later solo work, this album gives a quick overview of the high-points of Lennon's musical carreer. There are also two previously unreleased tracks included: an early rehearsal version of \\"Imagine\\" and the original acoustic \\"Real Love\\". If you've seen the film however, you'll notice the absence of \\"All You Need Is Love\\" which was used quite well in the film. \\"Across The Universe\\" also appeared in the film and is notably absent here. Everyone probably owns those tracks already of course, but it's still a pity they didn't make it onto this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced","review":"The footage for the dvd is pretty good.

Most of these have not been published elsewhere. The norm for the SF field is for single author anthologies to be composed mostly if not completely of previously published work. Take this as a warning that you may not be getting what you expected.The stories seem to follow a very common and uninteresting fairy tale format. Fairy tales can be made interesting-- for instance Italo Calvino's Italian Folk Tales. These were not.As a point of reference, I favor \\"literate\\" SF.

When I first picked it up I got excited because Katmandu & Travlin' Man were on the same album. When I got home and listened to it I was dismayed by the incrediblely slow pace of Travlin' Man. Where's the Silver Bullet Band? The weakness began with Beautiful Loser (still a heck of a good song). Katmandu is vintage. This is where the good times stop rolling unfortunately. Travlin' Man fails to enlighten me on Seger's \\"wealthy soul\\"; and the refrain is downright wussy! They would never play that kinda stuff on the radio. I'm sorry I got stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Seger's best lp's.","review":"This compilation was Bob Seger's nationwide, commercial breakout. Most Michigan natives were familiar with Seger long before this record came out. I love the entire album. I like the studio versions of all of the tracks that were redone for Live Bullet because the live versions were burned into our memories due to years of FM airplay. My personal favs are Black Night and Nutbush City Limits. This is a class album which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Seger","review":"This recording is one of the best \\"vintage\\" Seger albums available. It was recorded before he formed the Silver Bullet Band, so it has a different sound from his newer work, but it has a style all it's own. Many of the tracks are familiar to Seger fans, and the differences between this album and \\"Live Bullet\\" are very evident. It lacks Alto Reeds blaring sax, but makes up for it with some awesome harmonica parts. Again, for the Seger enthusiast, you can't go wrong with this title. Give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seger's Breakout Album","review":"Beautiful Loser represents the arrival, en masse, of Bob Seger as an artist known previously only in Michigan and SW Ontario. The title track would set the tone for Seger ballards for the next 15 years, while Katmandu would define his rock 'n' roll style - high powered, straight-ahead, with catchy guitar hooks.It could be argued that 'Live Bullet' actually brought Seger to the market, but the song list at Cobo Hall was pure Beautiful Loser.

Even if all the tracks on this wonderful release were not commercial hits, Bonnie Raitt proves with this one that she can play with the big boys and come out unscathed.Nothing tops \\"Have A Heart\\", a fantastic performance of a great song, which always makes me sigh, no matter how many times I've heard it. There is a longing, a need for love in Raitt's vocals that just grabs you by the throat and makes you listen.Other stand-outs are the appropriately named title track, \\"Nick of Time\\", the more bluesy-raunchy \\"Real Man\\" and the melancholic \\"Nobody's Girl\\". But there's really not a bad song on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play On","review":"I used to have this on a cassette and of course it was ruined by time, so I decided to get the cd.

And while they seem to have genuine affection for this material, the results are not often pretty. But while some tracks such as \\"Angel Baby\\" can be hilariously awful (some of these songs are WAY out of Roky's vocal range - not that he seems to care), the medley of What To Do/You're The One/Bashful Bob/One Last Kiss is actually quite good, even stirring at times. Had they made a truly serious attempt at recording it they probably could have easily surpassed the originals, but I'm very glad this version exists at all. Of the half dozen originals on the CD, a studio rendition of \\"Wake Up To Rock & Roll\\"( previously only available live) is a nice addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roky Trust Snookers the Fans with This One","review":"This album is a travesty. It finally puts to rest any doubt that Roky's former Manager has anything of value left. The sound is terrible. The recording processing/mastering is horrible. It's like they recorded this using a Realistic mono condensor mic onto K-Mart, normal bias, cassette tapes and then crapped on these tapes and let *that* sit in a basement for thirty years. Then they just ripped it to CD the cheapest and fastest way. Then they had the balls to talk about how \\"great\\" this utter piece of sheeeeeit was. This was the old Roky Trust under his brother's helm. Put Roky's little brother, Billy Alienate and Roky's former Manager in a room together and *this* is what they come up with. They are tools and this proves it. Stay away! Are you a Roky fan? STAY AWAY!

Well, we tried it three nights in a row, and absolutely NO results whatever. So we went out and for less money bought some Liquid Plumr and in fifteen minutes (per the label) the drain was clear. Maybe K-67 is just good for preventing blocked drains, but not good as a drain opener? In any case it doesn't seem to be worth the expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product to prevent sludge.","review":"We have a basement pipe where our laundry wash drains into. We noticed that it was starting to back up onto our basement floor. We paid a plumber $200 to clear the drain. He said it was due to sludge buildup because our kitchen sink also drains into the same pipe. He tried to sell me a similar product for $50. I was so happy to find this product for around $15. With monthly use it has kept our drain sludge free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"One of my favourite albums right now. Probably their best.

The sound art is mostly created using drum machines, turntables and samplers. \\"Hey Ladies\\" draws on distinctly funky samples to create a catchy dance tune. There appears in this song to be electroacoustic percussive samples with what appears to be the striking of cans. This creates a very organic, urban street feel to their otherwise highly sophisticated and technological brand of hip-hop. Thematic deviation occurs in the interlude, of a \\"5 Piece Chicken Dinner\\" where a bluegrass theme is presented. The lyrics include several pop-culture references, establishing a uniquely relevant brand of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best Beastie Boys album...","review":"Hey, what's up? This is my first review. At first I didn't feel it was necessary; Paul's Boutique already has five stars, and deserves every one of them. Still, the quality of this record compelled me to express my thoughts on it, too.This album is near perfect. The only track I feel is weak (and it's not even that bad) is Egg Man. I didn't dig it at first... but it grew on me, so I'll give it a listen, now, especially for the sampling (as mentioned by another reviewer).Every single track on the album is linked. I think this adds alot to it, because it's like a non-stop track. Very enjoyable. If you're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the Beastie Boys, definitely cop this album. Solid Gold Hits isn't great, and the anthology isn't worth it. All Beastie Boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker. Get Paul's Boutique."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genre-changing album","review":"With 192 reviews so far I'm not sure I'll sway the ratings much, but when this album came out, way back in 1989, it truly transformed rap. No album before it came anywhere close to the density and variety of sampling used on Paul's Boutique. The recurring theme of resurrection, unbelievable rhymes and cultural references (some pop, some not) and an unbelievable tapestry woven out of nearly every song that had ever come before it. Definitely on my short list for best album of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Party Album!!!","review":"Hip-Hop was never quite this tight again, due to a series lawsuits of sampling. This is the Beastie Boy's best album, yes, the best. License to Ill may have had more critical acclaim, but Paul's Boutique has a vision that is more stunning for great reasons: 1. This has the best use of sampling ever put on a hip-hop record, or any music record. 400 or more samples scattered throughout the whole album(Not Hyperbole) 2. This is the beastie boys at their best. It is unheard of today, but it still holds up as a cult favorite.My Favorites:1.Egg Man2.B-Boy Bouillabaisse3.Car Thief"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul's Boutique","review":"This album was the Beastie Boys second and greatest album. The way in some songs they go from dj rap to techno instruments. The content is a little off. They refer to women in a profound way in a few songs. Most of the song titles show it by hey ladies and to all the girls. The way they use different styles of music is very different and unique. Its almost like the beastie boys reincarnated after licensed to ill into pauls boutique. For every beastie boys fan this is one cd that is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul's Boutique","review":"A bit of late 80s nostalgia. Great fusion of different types of music.

Fans of old school or new school or any hip-hop at all will be enamored by this brilliant record. The abounding samples are all very well placed, and the rhymes are funny and clever as always. It's hard for me to pick favorites from this album; it's all so good. All hip-hop fans should own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way before it's time","review":"When this album came out in 1989, the rap game was shown what great production and lyrics could be. The Dust Brothers did an incredible production job on this album, and I wish they would do some more work with the Beasties, and with anyone else for that matter. My favorite song on this album is Egg Man, if not for anything else for it's intense feel and amazing production. I would recommend this album to anyone interested in hip-hop, and with a somewhat open mind (this isn't timbaland or puff daddy). Check this album out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORST album the Beastie Boys have done!","review":"I love the Beasties, and have 4 other albums of thiers, including ILL Communication which I love.

There was an angry tone throughout which I could live with but there was no melody behind the anger and the words had no meaning (at least to me).

You start a song and you get a brief snippet of the track before, then the song starts. Or without gapless playback, then even when played in order there is a hiccup just before the end of the song where you hear nothing, then the last half second of the song and then the next song starts.

Some people might think that it's good to practice with difficult questions so the easier (i.e. REAL lsat questions) questions will be a cakewalk. Not true - the logic provided in the explanations are so convulted and IRRATIONAL that you will second guess yourself on the real test too much. Try the actual LSAT questions, it's better to get 1 or 2 complex questions right rather than 20 easy questions wrong because you over-thought it.

Long story short, it reduced my confidence and wasted my time.... This book is not representative of the DIFFICULT problems on the LSAT.With questions that are overly difficult (logic games in particular), this book will waste your time... You will labor over interpreting ambiguous questions/solutions as opposed to practicing difficult, yet realistic problems... However, if you want a laugh (or cry), flip through the solutions pages of the Logic Games.If you want to strive for the highest score, buy Kaplan's LSAT 180 book.

After some quick searching online I realized that this book did not contain all LSAT questions, but made up examples of LSAT questions.If you're preparing for this test, do not use this book. All LSAT questions are highly formulaic and the creation of each question is done by LSAC employed test makers. There is definitely a science to the creation of a question and answer set used on the actual LSAT, and this prep book does not reflect this.

They were a fun party band, they often played fast and hard, and they had \\"Hit It and Run,\\" a song which is so catchy it's probably illegal. Well, now they've dried up. There is NO Hit It and Run on this record. (\\"Kill Myself Tonight\\" comes the closest, but it still doesn't come close.) This is just a CD full of bland, middle-of-the-road mid-tempo 'hard rock'.

I then concluded that therefore they must be illegally using copyrighted materials in their presentations, however some of the comics that are spoke of in the video turn out to be in their book Logical Fallacies.I don't know why on earth they would put the product out in this condition - as it seems illogical to presenting themselves in such an unprofessional manner.

To their credit, the original presentation must have had cartoon illustrations on the screen, but due to copyright infringement, they could not display them on the DVD.My children would have enjoyed a college level logic class more than this DVD.

Finally, someone who loves the Dead to have the freedom to put out the goods. However, that being said this is probably one of the biggest disappointments of the series. Dick Latvala died in 1999, while this was released in 2004, which may have been the problem. The biggest problem with this release is Jerry Garcia sounds like he is having a complete mind cramp. While the rest of the band has their act together, Jerry can't complete a musical thought, until about 2/3 way through the show. Unfortunately, it was a bad night for Jerry. Yes, it happened now and then. What's more unfortunate is nobody put a stop to this release. The real shame is there are better shows from 74', any which would have been better a choice (later releases prove this.) Oh well, scratch your head on this release and move on to something better.

I do too, it's excellent. Yes, I can pick at various parts and say the band played this particular section better at a concert two years earlier or three years later, but there aren't that many 45 minute plus jams that are this tight. Jerry finds a very nice line to jam on in the first segment of PITB, the segues between songs are as effortless as any I have heard, and I am sure the crowd was simply blown away at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ask Yourself...","review":"You have to ask yourself...is it worth it to purchase Dick's Picks #24 when the only tracks worth listening to are tracks 1 through 5 on CD 2? For me, the answer is DEFINITELY YES. The band ascends to levels of sheer magic on these tracks. There is a similar set of songs on the box set Winterland 1973...but I like this one even better...it has a real trippy sensibility...it carries you away.

I was rather disappointed though when I went to the Control Options to see there was absolutely no configuration for my Microsoft Sidewinder Game Pad.

You'd have to be part human, part \\"octopus\\" in order to comfortably move, run, shoot, use items, etc. using the MANY, MANY programmable keys on the keyboard. The Graphics were stunning, but I recommend you play both Hitman games on the game console platform like PlayStation, as opposed to trying to enjoy it on a PC. Maybe the developers at Eidos Interactive will add game pad support to the Hitman 3.

The plot is that you are a hitman with no name, who is in retirement at a church in Sicily. However, your priest friend has been kidnapped by the mafia. You must rescue him.The gameplay is incredible. There were much more gadgets and more stealthy ways to approach a situation than Metal Gear Solid, which was pretty linear if you ask me. Also, I really digged the Look Through Keyhole option and the fiberwire rules.The graphics are quite detailed. The church is perhaps the most beatiful thing I've ever seen in a video game. The only thing that bugged me was a few glitches. Sometimes, the people you interact with get frozen for a second.

Eidos 's choice to target a specific religious group in Hitman 2 is not only socially irresponsible, but also potentially dangerous to Sikhs worldwide, as their turbans have made them the focus of backlash attacks in the post-September 11th environment. By focusing on a religious minority and setting the violence in their sacred shrine, Hitman 2 mindlessly encourages racial and religious prejudice.

I liked the soft brushes that came with it but the plastic part kept hitting against my teeth, when I switched to the extra reach, also included, it was a much better fit for me.Unlike other reviewers I haven't had any trouble with the battery life, it lasts a couple of weeks for me. My only real complaint is that I have to be sure to brush before I do my make-up because I do find that this tooth brush is a bit messier than most.All in all I would recommend this brush, just make sure you try different brush heads to get the true \\"fit\\" for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"HydraBrush a better way to brush","review":"The HydraBrush is the fastest way to brush your teeth.

Until recently, I was never even aware of this Rush EP. Rush gives their longtime loyal followers this eight track EP of '60's rock legend icons who came (and in most cases, were gone) before them. Have to admit it - Rush does a great job on each of these cover songs - as I liked all eight of them the same - from Buffalo Springfield's \\"For What It's Worth\\" and \\"Mr. Soul\\" to the Yardbird's \\"Heart Full Of Soul\\" and the stunning \\"Shapes Of Things\\".

Rush reached its musical apex with Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures and Signals. Grace Under Pressure was acceptable with a couple high points. Then they spiralled into mediocrity and worse. They should have taken the 90's off.With this handful of covers, I guess I was hoping for a return-to-roots sort of sound. Instead it sounds like an uninspired Rush playing a few 60's standards. Ho-hum. No real spirit on any track except for Seven and Seven Is, which rocks. Musically, they sound fine, almost too polished for songs that sound good with a rough garage-band edge. Sorry guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush Feedback...","review":"I saw the 30th Anniversary show in Charlotte earlier this summer, and the rendition of \\"Heart Full Of Soul\\" all by itself, makes this CD a must have! While I liked the idea of the boys playin' some of their cover stuff from the early days, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical. But the songs on this disc are the covers that Rush should have been doing, and they all work pretty well. Also, it was kind of a fun thing to do to celebrate their 30th year.

This is a little gem for the fans as the band are on the road for their 30th anniversary tour, and it is well worth getting.

Great to hear them a little unpolished and having fun. Reminds me of Todd Rundgren's Faithful album from 76 when he paid tribute to the songs that influenced him from 1966. My only gripes are that five minutes more in length and you would have an LP instead of an EP, and although the cover art and notes are great, I prefer a real CD case or digipack instead of this kind of sleeve they give out free CD's with beer packs (Here in Canada anyways) and samplers.

If you can put this album on not want to listen to it again and again, I feel sorry for you. This little gem just proves what I've said for years and posted once or twice in Amazon - these guys are in the top echelon of rock players and always have been. They are at their best when it's Neil setting the beat, Geddy carrying the melody, and Alex goin' nuts. And whether it's multiple time changes and syncopated 5/8s or a steady 4/4 grove, these guys can play with anybody.

Why?1. The production is over-done with far too much high end frequencies2. Rush's weak spot has always been a lack of \\"soul\\" - a requirement for most of these songs3. Geddy Lee's voice really does not suite anything other than Rush songsI would much rather hear Rush do their own arrangements of cover tunes. Melodramatic, 2112-esque, prog rock satires of classic rock tunes could have been quite entertaining. Unfortunately, Rush just cannot pull off classic rock...at all. I have heard musicians of far less stature and ability do these songs justice.How could Rush have possibly released this? They MUST know how bad it is. I can only guess it was pressure from either their record label or from their fans neither of whom, according to these other reviews, are able to decipher good from horrible music."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUSH CAREER BOOST FAILS","review":"With their last really good album being 23 years ago(1981's Moving Pictures), a cover album was definitely in the cards to boost their career. However, this AIN'T it. There is no emotion here, and it almost seems like there playing these songs the way they did when they first learned them , circa 1967, as mentioned in the liner notes. Geddy's voice is absolutely only suited for rush originals as demonstrated here. Finally, i think this was a bit overpriced for 8 covers which PALE in comparison to the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new sub-genre for Rock - EMPTY!","review":"This is what you get when you take some of the best classics of 60's rock and go through the motions. Some of the greatest Rock 'N' Roll songs ever written that are represented on this collection are completely devoid of feeling and soul.You are much better off with going back to the original versions by the original artists who make 'em tight and did 'em right.One listen to Rush's versions was way too long, 'cuz they were done all wrong.It doesn't rock, it doesn't roll, these song of old will leave you cold!Save your money and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUSH + CLASSIC ROCK = HELL YEA!","review":"This EP combines one of the most rockin' power trios ever, with songs from some legends of the late 60's. Geddy & Co. do The Who, Cream, and the others proud with these covers. A perfect jam for summer partying season."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites in 2004","review":"Rush is an outstanding band. They have been a favorite of mine since 1978. I was delighted with this new album. It's full of rhythmic grooves and excellent bass and guitar lines.Every song on it is a previous favorite by the original artists. Though Rush has taken each song and made them just as good as the original and in a few cases even better. And though all the songs are remakes Rush manages to maintain a sense of originality in their renditions.I love every track on this disc although \\"Mr. Soul\\" and \\"Heart Full Of Soul\\" are my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and somewhat dull","review":"I love Rush, and have since I was a kid. But let me be honest here, this album is dull and is missing the energy that makes the band who they are. They follow the mold (mostly) of each song from its original recording, and never break out and add their own flavor. I feel this effort would be way better if they'd just jam, go off in a tanget, give us something beyond the 60's. If I wanted to hear these songs, I'd go to the orginal artists that made them...I just can't help but think how they should've released an EP with an instrumental or something of the like using their own material. Now that would be something to talk about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing for this Rush fan","review":"I would have much prefered a release of some early Rush shows where they were actually playing covers like \\"Bad Boy\\" and \\"Not Fade Away\\". Fortunately I have some boots of these performances but this could have been a much better present to the fans. Anyone expecting to find the energy of the early years will be dissapointed by such tepid covers as that of Buffalo Springfield. Even the most promising cover, Love's \\"7 and 7 is\\" is rendered bland in the hands of our favorite Canadian band. Maybe the fans will get better treatment with the 40th anniversary. My advice, avoid this disc and put your money towards catching these guys in concert instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geddy, Neil, and Alex...why did you do this to us?","review":"Let me preface the following with saying that I am a Rush fan from way back. This Canadian power trio is one of the most talented and innovative bands ever. It is truly a travesty that they are not in the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame. With that said, I really wish they had stuck to writing about their influences instead of trying to cover them.As the band explains, this album was done to celebrate their 30th Anniversary and the music that influenced them when they started. What is does is point out their flaws. Most prominent of those is Geddy's shrill voice which does not lend itself well to other people's material. Any decent cover band in a college town could churn out more entertaining versions of these songs. This is not fun. C'mon boys, why be distracted from what you do best and what you do better than most - create and play your own powerful, layered, innovative music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Contrary to A Music Fan from NY, NY who likes to \\"one star\\" all of the Rush library for kicks, this is a true rock and roll collection, albeit brief. Standouts include \\"Summertime Blues,\\" \\"Heart Full of Soul\\" and \\"Crossroads.\\"Pessimism runs rampant because of prejudice against Rush by \\"critics,\\" but the fact remains that Rush should be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for their talent, influence, sales and perseverance through the years. This EP puts them on solid footing for such an honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's growing on me ...","review":"I first heard Feedback a few weeks back when AOL was offering a listen for free. I wasn't sure, I didn't know if it was my computer speakers or Rush.Being a long time Rush fan I decided to give it a try. Heck, I have all of the other Rush cd's so why not this one. The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of \\"Summertime Blues\\".Not only did I not care for the original, I also felt that it was not the best song to open the album on. From now on I will automatically start the cd on Track 2.The highlights of this album are definately \\"Mr Soul\\", \\"For what it's worth\\" and \\"The Seeker\\". Can't wait to hear these songs live in a couple of weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traing for 2004!","review":"Nice photos and description of the product, they just never show you the back of the shirt which gives the date of the 2004 Chicago marathon, 10/10/2004.

I bought it as a present for people currently training for the Chicago marthon this year, 10/9/2005, and they were too nice to say anything until I was running with them and noticed the date!

Tommy Lee Jones is convincing as an ex-con, and Martha Plimpton steals the show as his tomboy daughter. A mystery in the film is where the stolen money is hidden. A far greater mystery is why this film is not on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"This movie is a all time fav. The plot is set on my back yard the Mississippi river.

I found this CD at the local library, strangely enough.Carmen McRae is an excellent vocalist, and she shines in this live, intimate setting, backed by a great rhythym section. She can really put inflection and attitude, not to mention emotion, into her voice.The title of this album is rather misleading, and something like \\"Live at Donte's\\" would be more appropriate. I'm a bit disappointed that they had to cut the spoken introductions, and I'll keep a lookout for those LPs (even though I have no record player...heh).Live jazz is like nothing else, pick up this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Carmen!","review":"It is a simple and disappointing fact that Carmen McRae spent much of her career in the collective shadow of Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. However, unlike many vocalists who would (and did) throw in the towel, she carved out and developed a style all her own; while leaving us some wonderful music in the process.This collection is a perfect example of that. She took these songs and interpreted them in ways that Ms. Vaughan and Ms. Fitzgerald couldn't touch. This collection proves that over most of her career she successfully resisted the temptation to try and sound more like Sarah or Ella. For that, we should be very thankful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Buy for Carmen Fans","review":"Best Carmen Mcrae album you will find. Wonderful song selection, incredible trio including bassist Joe Pass, priceless live dialogue. Carmen improvising and singing at her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Beautiful","review":"What a great album. So unique in its music style and lyrics.

Although it wasn't the orange haro, anyone is better than none. Great plush for people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not ordinary Christmas music","review":"Glad to see this in re-release and still available. Chuck Leavell put together a mixture of classic R&B Christmas songs alongside instrumental arrangements of Christmas classics. Chuck also wrote Bethlehem for this CD, and it is a wonderful instant classic. Some of the R&B songs don't suit Chuck's voice. He brings in his fellow Stones' band mate Lisa Fischer to help out on one song. But overall the CD is fun and something different than your usual holiday music fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of holiday music","review":"Leavell is the former leader of Sea Level, former keyboardist for the Allman Brothers (that's his piano you hear on \\"Jessica\\") and long time keyboardist for the Rolling Stones. Here he does a set of Christmas songs, mostly less familiar songs. Enjoyable and well done and quite a bit more uptempo than his \\"Forvever Blue\\" CD. For when you want something a little different for your holiday listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"Bought this from Target as an emergency replacement for my expensive Panasonic wet/dry (forgotten at home when I went on vacation). Have used this only as a wet shaver, with shaving cream, though it's not advertised as such - the literature only mentions cleaning it under a stream of water. Very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the shave - actually gets my neck closer than my cherished Panasonic does. On the other hand, it's loud enough to wake the dead...and, though I haven't suffered a catastrophic screen failure like 'malinate', I have noticed a gradual decrease in shave quality over the 3 months I've been using it. Also the battery's not the strongest in the world - it really needs to be recharged every night - but it'll run for closer to 30 minutes than 30 seconds when fully charged. (TK must've gotten one with a bad battery.) All in all, a pretty good lower-end shaver - it's been a fine back-up for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"New screen every two months!","review":"I bought this product and after about two months the screen wore out and got a big hole in it (and cut up my face in the process). The cost of a replacement screen is more than half the cost of the razor. For a few bucks more than purchasing the replacement screen, I will switch back to Norelco (my last Norelco lasted a couple of years and only cost about $35). I wanted to give Remington a try, but now I'm sorry that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor shave quality after 9 months","review":"I've had this shaver for approximately 9 months. Recently, within the last month, I've noticed it takes much more effort upon my part to get a clean shave from this shaver. The trimmer no longer cuts the coarse hair on my neck and the shaver has difficulty with the stubble on my chin such that I have to go over my chin repeatedly.I've kept the shaver clean and have replaced the foil every two months. Nothing seems to be obviously wrong with it other than the dramatically reduced shave quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six month test","review":"I have used a Wahl electric razor for years but last Fall the blade and screen needed replacement and the battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than a day on the road. My wife looked locally but couldn't find a Wahl anywhere but saw the Remington MS280. She figured Wahl had gone out of business and since the Remington looked much the same so she got it for me at Christmas. I tried for almost six months to \\"get used to it\\" and get a decent shave. Eventually, I started using the Remington and then going over my dry face with a disposable razor. Not a good solution! I also looked locally and couldn't find a Wahl but then thought of Amazon. I checked and sure enough they had them and it also qualified for Prime shipping. I received it yesterday and had a great shave this morning. Forget the Remington MS280 Titanium, go for a Wahl 4000 Wahl 7367-500 cord/cordless 4000 series electric razor.or anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book [is bad]","review":"This book needs some serious editingRight now I'm on Chapter 4 and so far this book is terrible in regards to the Projects. The project instructions don't correspond with the results intended and shown. For example, the instructions say open the Customer by Country report, but then it says 'your report should look like this' and shows you an entirely different report! And sometimes the report you worked on doesn't even work for the task you're trying to learn. The author must have had his friends write the other customer reviews. Don't buy this book! It's just unfortunate though that there aren't many choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading and very helpful","review":"This book read very easily. he software comes with a sample DB that the book uses which is great. You may find certain reduncies when working on each chapters examples but its so the reader can jump to any chapter. The book is set up so you dont have to staart from the beginning. It took me a little over a month to finish reading the book simply because the software was at the job. You really need the software to make sense of it.I only wished it delved deeper into table and formulas. But its a beginners book. I recommend it hands down as a starter book"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"It is a beginners book as the title says, but there is a pittfal, the author should consider for future books.Not every chapter has a step-by-step tutrial. The user have to download the samples and use them to be able to follow the author, which defeats the purpose of learning by doing.Chapters 4 & 5 make are mutually exlusive, since chp 5 requires reports from chp 4, that was not a step-by-step tutorial.Either make it a step-by-step or don't. Just be consistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Reports: A Beginner's Guide Review","review":"I am coming from a VBA background learning about this new software. This book is a great resource tool for making such a transition. Mr. McAmis stepped me through the learning process in a clear and concise manner.

It's her absolute favorite of all time. She wont listen to music without it- unfortunately, she wore it out. It's tail makes a crinkly noise - it sounds like it's made of scotch tape. Since it's only 3 months old, I had to knock off a star. In the por thing's defence, though- she's played with it nearly every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"So delightfuly random.","review":"I love it. It is just so odd, how could you not? It's so cute when it spins around and its tail moves. It has suprisingly good sound quality and volume. It is the perfect size. Not to big, not to small. And, not many other people have an iFish. Most have the iDog. But you can join the elite few with your iFish. My only critisism is that the controls sometimes can be difficult. It is controled by its fins. Pressing one, or both. Holding them down for a certain amount of time. It takes some practice to get it just right, to really get a feel for it. Also, the cord is somewhat short, so when you have your iPod or mp3 player in, and the fish is dancing, you have to make sure the iPod/mp3 player isn't near the edge of the table, or turn the dancing mode off. But overall, it is so much fun, and very handy. I totally recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Adventurous and exciting, this album captures history in the making.

I was floored the first time I read it, which made it the last time I read it. I'm not certain what the appeal of this story is, and I love stories of spunky little girls like Ramona Quimby and Matilda. This is not one of those stories.

My mother read this first Eloise to me when I was 8, and I still love her at 18. Eloise is not a book to pick apart and analyze; you just have to hold on and have fun. She lives in a fantastic world born from imagination that would probably never be real, and in that world is endless entertainment.

Parents might object to the condescending way she treats adults and her distain for education. (She has a private tutor who is \\"boring boring boring\\" who she doesn't listen to \\"very often.\\") Throughout the story she repeatedly says \\"Oh my Lord!\\" which some parents may find objectionable.

It is a modern day classic! Eloise is a headstrong, pushy, and very intelligent little girl. Her life at the Plaza is so different from what most children lead, it is almost fantasy. This little girl's intelligence, while not used to be \\"book smart\\" is instead used to imitate the adults around her which makes for a wildly hilarious book, and one that each and every one of us (unless they were absolutely PERFECT as a child) can relate to.

There's no charm in her adventures. (Example: whenever she gets into a crowded elevator she pretends she's dropped her skate key on the floor.)

I have a bunch of their actual ablums (LPs), and some tapes. I was thinking about upgrading my collection to CD, so I looked for a comprehensive box set, thinking I could get a better deal than buying each of their CDs individually.This, however, is not the case - I added up all of the Beatles' CDs individually, and came up with $231.19, including Past Masters I & II (including $15.85 for standard shipping/handling). This collection costs over $300.Maybe I am missing something, but I see no reason to buy this set.Dave Gruska"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF!

Trust me I have all the American Beatle albums and all the English CD's and had no idea the songs were recorded differently till I seen an article about it. HELP was the first English stereo album. All the other English albums before HELP were in Mono. Then buy these English Beatle CD's.

In order to switch from spray to stream, you have to turn the nozzle head. If you turn it too much, eventually it becomes detached and you'll get a jet of water to the face.

Great tasting in the morning coffe or tea.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it has a slightly higher moisture content than other brands, causing it to form a brick in the cellophane inside packaging. You can't really store it in the original package after opening.

I have learned to position myself to avoid any pain, but sometimes it takes resetting my footing once or twice. The pads are not very wide, so sometimes it will pinch the skin when you try to crap yourself onto it. Redesigns should hopefully make that part a little wider, or you can make something yourself.

This slant board is built well, but not designed well. If the company weren't so cheap they'd use a better grade of foam support and more of it.

The video clips for these videos are great too. Hangar 18, Holy Wars... if you ever get a chance to see them, please do so! Unfortunately the Rusted Pieces video is out of print, fingers cross and try ebay!You wonder why they didn't continue this album style and keep writing explosive Megadeth songs! If you want more of this sort of thing, check out other classic albums like So Far So Good So What! and Peace Sells!

If you are looking for technical thrash metal then this is a great place to look. The musicianship on this album is outstanding. Awesome riffs and amazing solos along with a killer rhythm section. ONLY PROBLEMS: Dave's voice is not for everyone (if you are not familiar with it then listen to some song samples to see if you're okay with it). Also: this album is remixed and hardcore fans of the original release may be dissapointed, especially with some of the vocals being re-recorded. ANYWAY... great thrash metal album, highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential thrash metal","review":"All things considered Rust in Peace probably stands as Megadeth's greatest album, though some might cite Peace Sells instead. Either way, Rust is a first-rate speed metal extravaganza which showcases the best elements of the genre: it's all fast, furious and aggressive (and yes, *heavy*); but it's also technically complex and precise, well-organized and features some socially-conscious lyrics as well. With the exception of the guitarless throwaway 'Dawn Patrol', every track is worth hearing. 'Hangar 18' has always been a fan favorite as have 'Holy Wars' and the raging title track. This comes at the tail-end of Megadeth's thrash years and indeed near the end of the genre's run of popularity, and it's a mighty fine way to recall the style's glory days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thundering riffs make up for sometimes shoddy lyrics","review":"Thrash at its best, thats about what Rust in Peace adds up to. Musically, the album shines very brightly. The opening track \\"Holy Wars..' is thrash metal to the extreme. Mustaine's rythmn work is amazing (though not as good as Hetfield's). \\"Hangar 18\\" and \\"Take No Prisoners\\" are my favorite songs. They're awesome, plain and simple. Actually the only weak song is \\"Dawn Patrol.\\" Everything else rocks relentlessly. My only complaint is the occasional cheesy lyric, but the endless riffs and drum work more than make up for this. A must have for fans of heavy metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Sound","review":"I don't have the remastered version, so I can't speak for it, but I own the original version which is very good. I really like the sound on this disc, it's got a different feel for me than other Megadeth albums. It's heavy, but not as heavy as their three previous albums, but it's faster and more complex, imo. All of the songs on it are good, but my favorites are Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Rust in Peace and my very favorite, Five Magics. As I've said, while this is their fourth album is sounds different from the first three and all others that follow it. I really like this disc and sometimes throw it in when I'm in the mood for some Megadeth but with a bit of a different sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUST IN PEACE","review":"This album is a masterpiece of incredibly complex & fast metal riffs that I'm sure any fan of Dream Theater (the kings of incredibly complex & fast metal riffs) will love!!!!

STAY AWAY FAAAAAARRRR AWAY FROM THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the original print","review":"Dave mustaine stole the soul of this album when he resang so many of the songs. The album was perfect to begin with it didn't need to be touched. When he resang five magicks he ruined a great song. When the deeper voice comes in it sounds like a happy retard. Buy the orginal print used and you will see that the album was perfect to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The original 1990 version of Rust In Peace was a true masterpiece in thrash metal. Perfect compositions, killer lyrics, and tight, and dynamic production that jumped out of the speakers. This 2004 version however is absolutely terrible. The replaced vocal tracks sound awful, and the new remixing/remastering makes the album sound plastic, bloated, and the fact that the audio is a victim of the Loudness War causes unnecessary clipping and distortion in places where it shouldn't be.If you're a true Megadeth fan, this version is worth getting just for the bonus tracks, but I highly recommend you look for the original 1990 version which can be found in used record stores, or even Amazon. It's truly disappointing that this version is the standard when it comes to broadcasting the songs through airplay on hard rock/metal stations, etc. The original should be re-issued/re-released, or whatever so that a fine recording isn't forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good cd","review":"A lot of people call this the best Megadeth CD. After revisiting it after about 10 years, I do agree that it's very good. In the top three. Probably in this order: Peace Sells, Youthanasia, Rust, So Far... I don't like the hokey Hangar 18 theme of aliens (isn't this kinda weird?) and was a bit embarrassed when the video came on VH1 the other day--had to turn it when the really bad muppet-type creatures came on.

All the songs on this album are excellent, there are no bad ones to speak of. The guitar work is great and extremely fast (Mustaine and Friedman must be two of the best guitarists there are) and it is melodic at times yet still very heavy. For anybody just getting into these guys I'd recommend either this, \\"Youthanasia\\" or \\"Countdown To Extinction\\", all three are awesome. Stand out songs are definetely \\"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\\", \\"Tornado Of Souls\\" and \\"Rust In Peace... Polaris\\". If you have heard any of Megadeth and like it, then definetely pick this one up, it's easily one of the best albums I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

This album can't be beat, changes or not.Every song rules and I like the higher volume levels--could never get the sound high enough on the highway with my lousy car stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"........?","review":"I bought four other Megadeth remasters and was extremely satisfied. Rust in Peace is a masterpiece, and probably the best Megadeth album. Instrumentally the remastered album sounds good. I would give it five stars based on that. The vocals on Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, and Lucretia, though, were redone. Why Dave? The new vocals are nothing short of offensive. I can see no reason, short of not having the original recordings, to re-sing ANY song. If he did not have them, which is inconceivable, he should have left the songs alone. If anyone wants to find out how to ruin a good album, this is the example. If you have the original don't waste your money here, the bonus tracks aren't worth it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Brother will kill brother, spillin' blood across the land...\\"","review":"Dave, Dave, Dave.... This is most definitely one of the GREATEST additions to the metal pantheon of the 20th century. I remember when I first heard that Marty Friedman was joining Megadeth. (Who was at the time, doing the 'Neo-classsical', shred-meister stuff with Jason Becker.) And I figured-- 'No way! It's not gonna work! But I was delightfully proven very wrong.'Rust in Peace' is absolutely... perfect. I'm finding it hard to describe. It rips your head off, but in such eloquent fashion, it let you know of a new era of metal that was on the rise. (Or should I say, already rising?)Searing guitar licks, with fearsome rhythms, and precise production, that made every upcoming, would-be guitar hero sit back in his chair, and wish he had wrote those riffs-- this was the metal album that to me, defined the mid-90's.So yes, definitely buy this CD. If you like heavy stuff-- start your collection with this. And besides-- Dave needs the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth hits prime!!!!","review":"This was the first album from the longest, most productive line up of Megadeth to date. Dave Mustaine, Dave Elfson, Nick Mensa, and Marty Friedman. Here the deuling guitars begins... Marty and Dave trade off solos beautifully in songs like Holy Wars and Tornado of Souls. The speed is blistering, and the precision is excellent. This was the beginning of the platinum sales of megadeth, and for a good reason. They kept doing what they do best, play metal. They do stray from the path in a few albums with cryptic writings and risk, but those can be overshadowed by this album.Highlights: Holy Wars, Lucretia, Tornado of Souls, Rust in Peace/Polarus, Hanger 18.I have seen megadeth 3 times, and everytime I do, these songs just blast through all others. This is a must have for any thrash metal fan/metal fan. A good place to start a Megadeth Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth at their best","review":"Rust In Peace is Megadeth's best album. This was the best lineup of Megadeth as they sound reborn here after the uneven So Far, So Good, So What. \\"Holy Wars\\", \\"Hangar 18\\", and \\"Lucretia\\" are among the best tracks they've ever done. \\"Hangar 18\\" indeed may be one of the most powerful tracks in metal, particularly the outro when Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman trade wicked lightning fast solos during the closing jackhammer riff. The rhythm section of David Ellefson and Nick Menza are fantastic here, particularly on tracks such as \\"Five Magics\\" and \\"Poison Was The Cure.\\" They would breakthrough to the masses on Countdown to Extinction, but that album isn't as consistent or heavy as this one. A thrash metal classic. This and the Peace Sells album are definitely their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential 'Deth album, an essential metal album.","review":"This is perceived by many not only as Megadeth's finest hour, but as a great moment in Metal history. the hellish, Iron maidenesque guitars and Dave Mustaine's obnoxiously bad vocals is guaranteed to make you vomit.'Five magics' is brilliant with it's haunting guitar riff. 'Holy wars' is arguably megadeth finest moment and it isn't selling out. I would rate this album up there as an all time metal classic up there with iron Maiden's 'No. of the beast', metallica's 'master of puppets', yep the 3rd greatest metal album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Metallica's Best?!","review":"Though I believe Metallica has more great albums to choose from in the metal genre, I think Megadeth's \\"Rust in Peace\\" just might be the BEST offering in the thrash genre (yes, even better than \\"Master of Puppets\\"). Nick Menza's pummeling double bass, combined with some of the wickedest riffs ever put to wax, make this absolutely indispensable. They took what was pretty good on their previous albums and turned it up to 11!! The first time I heard this, I think I drooled all over the floor at the thought of what my ears were hearing. EVERY single song hear is dynamite, from the opening crunch of \\"Holy Wars\\" to the closing salvo of \\"Rust in Peace.\\" I can see why soldiers listened to this so much during Desert Storm; it makes you want to go really really FAST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What metal should be!","review":"Why cant all metal sound like this? This is one of the best metal albums ever made. Good songs, good guitar work. I always feel the songs should come first and this is damn talented metal songwriting. I've always said the best metal music came out from 88-92. This isnt really thrash per se, because some songs are slower and theres too much talent in the songwriting.Theres a band called Sword - Metalized is the cd, that you will love if you like this. Its very rare but worth the wait - amazon sells it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album","review":"I bought this when it first came out and was blown away by the complexity and amazing skill that was utilized to make this album.

Vocals are a bit shoddy on this. Highly recommended. Technical musicianship, well written. Talented band. I like the tempo changes in their songs. Retains some of the jazz from past albums. Megadeth has always been unique in the metal world. Especially the singer. Catchy songs, but not mainstream. Above average Metal album, with a couple of dueling guitarists. Similar, maybe, to Iron Maiden, they didn't wander to far from their roots over the years putting out one winner after another. Both of their catalogs are solid collections and lengthy ones at that. Put this one on your list near the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooh the travesty!","review":"This remaster is worse then St.Anger. Get the original at any cost!!

It looked for a bit like Megadeth's career was starting to fade.Anyone who thought Megadeth was going to fizzle out because of these issues was completely WRONG. No question this album is a game changer and benefited from two MAJOR talent upgrades with Marty Friedman on guitar and Nick Menza on the drums. I don't think this album would have been nearly as good with Jeff Young and Chuck Behler.Without going into a detailed review, top to bottom this is the most solid album from one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Just listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The riffs keep coming, the best metal jamming of its time.","review":"Mustaine and Freidman's guitar playing is nearly unsurpassed by metal artists anywhere, Rust in Peace is a perfect example of the kind of metal album that should be kicking everyone in the [rear] today. Unlike most of the mindless noise you'll hear from bands like Cradle of Filth or Coal Chamber, Megadeth combined clever lyrics with awsome intrumentals to make Rust in Peace one hell of an album. At the price they're asking, this one should be a must buy for metal fans everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Metalaholic","review":"Rust In Peace is possibily, the finest guitar work ever recorded. Marty Friedman's blazing solos, and Dave's heavy riffs make RIP an awesome metal album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will this be the last one?","review":"This album really kicks. The riffs are from talented fingers. Won't even talk 'bout the solo's from Mr. Friedman. Only a shame that Megadeth together with Metallica aren't making this kind of heavy metal anymore...I think I've missed some good times (I started listening to Metallica in 1991, so...). Anyway, buy this album before it get's a collecter's item."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets...","review":"A fine album, indeed. Pretty much every track, with the exception of \\"Dawn Patrol,\\" is a standout. The guitar solos on this disk are truly mindboggling - Marty Friedman gets the job done. These songs never get repetitive or boring, unlike Metallica. Amazing lyrics, and very good vocals from Mustaine. A masterpiece by the (once) great masters of speed metal. I was hooked on the first listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure garbage","review":"Rust in peace has been in my favorite top five of all metal albums since I first heard it back when it first came out. I;ve replaced this album three times already and was excited to see that they finally had a remastered version. My excitement very shortly turned to disgust. After listening to this album I once called a masterpiece for the last seventeen years, hearing the rerecorded vocals (and possibly even some of the bass and drums) was agonizing. Dave Mustaine, in my opinion ruined the best thing he ever accomplished. My copy of this cd quickly became a frisbee. I suppose now if I want the original version, I'll have to settle with a used copy. Shame on you Dave Mustaine."},{"rating":"2","title":"[v]EGADET]-[","review":"Lemme start off by saying the original version is boss. Definatly look for it rather than the sucky remastered one.

This is music.","review":"This album transcends metal and rock. These \\"genres\\" that people apply to music are just a way of explaining why their music is inferior. Music is music, and garbage is garbage.That said, this album has all the trappings of rock, that is, electric guitars and drums, but these are a means to creating music, and Mustaine achieves that end. This review is about a man, and the musical pieces that he produced.So whether you like \\"metal\\" or \\"rock\\" has no bearing on whether or not you'll like this album because this is MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth's best album","review":"Rust In Peace is without a doubt, Megadeth's best album ever. You'll never get disappointed with an album like this, i mean, it has it all: Outstanding and hi-speed guitar riffs, very good lyrics and great guitar solos. Marty Friedman's collaboration in this album is great, remarkable.The next two Megadeth albums, Countdown To Extinction and Youthanasia, are very good too, but they don't have the furious speed and crushing riffs of this one. You can't go wrong with an album like this, truly a Metal Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best work ever.","review":"The title says it all, if you are interested in Megadeth, this is the pinnacle of their body of work. If you are a Megadeth fan and do not own this album, then you need to review your \\"fan\\" status. The band was at their technical and production peaks with Rust. The previous albums are more gritty sounding and unrefined and Megadeth's later albums are almost overproduced and the songs were radio length. Rust in Peace was a full blast thrash ride into head banger mania. A must for any metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of 'Deth's strongest....","review":"A thrash masterpiece. After the excellent (in my opinion) SFSGSW, Dave was arrested for (ironicaly, at the time) driving under the influence, went to rehab, and came out sober. Didn't stop him from putting out one of the metal world's strongest albums, though.The fact that Dave redid the vocals on many of the tracks doesn't bother me a bit; still sounds great to me. This is also the only remastered 'Deth CD that has worthwhile extra tracks - Chris Poland demos!It doesn't matter if you grew up with an old cassette of this or you are just getting into Megadeth, buy this now, it's actually the best place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the best track","review":"OK, I don't actually own this reproduction however it scares the s**t out of me that this album has been re-released without \\"Take no prisoners\\". which is the most powerful track on the album.

I stopped after this one. This is one of her dullest efforts and she definitely has done better. Reba is tremendously overrated as an artist, especially when she does material like this. This CD was only made to fulfill a contract obligation and the only reason it sold so well is because of Reba's loyal legion of fans. However, it would behoove those fans to know that a lot of them were left hanging high and dry in the hot sun one year by the grand diva herself when she failed to inform them that she would not sign autographs that year.

Obviously this woman, inexplicably has a huge fan base. I guess they'll buy anything she puts out. But this attempt sticks to high heaven, just like her \\"Rumor Has It\\" project. There is not ONE single good song in the entire bunch here. This CD was a big disappointment after her \\"triumph\\" in \\"For My Broken Heart\\", her tribute to the band members she lost in the plane crash. Reba said this was a continuation of her feelings but this CD lacks the emotional punch the former had. Some decent material would have helped her but there is not one single song here, as I said, that is worth it. Not even her duet with Vince Gill \\"The Heart Won't Lie\\". This is just more \\"bubblegum pop/country. Reba McEntire is tremendously overrated as an artist and as a singer. She wouldn't be if she would just go back to doing \\"traditional country\\". This CD....P.U.!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN I HEARD TAKE IT BACK THATS WHAT I WANTED TO DO!!","review":"If this was supposed to be a continuation of her downtrodden feelings from \\"For My Broken Heart\\" (the only one of her 90s albums that I really and truly love), Reba would have done better to leave well enough alone because sequels never match up to the originals. The songs are just there to fill up the product and Reba sounds as if she's bored to death with this!! There are better Reba albums out there!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER LET DOWN","review":"This is another let down from Reba.

Pick up Weird Tales, by Golden Smog and see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average rock album","review":"Is it rock? Folk? Country? Perhaps a hybrid of all these things and something more-something elusive, catchy, happy and sad all at the same time. The Jayhawks' harmonies are unlike any I've heard. Their haunting lyrics are set against upbeat melodies, bringing a curious dichotomy to their sound. Hollywood Town Hall's two best songs are Waiting for the Sun and Crowded in the Wings. This album gets 4 stars only because I also have Tomorrow the Green Grass, and it's a definite 5 star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A down-to-earth great!!!! rock CD - a top fiver for me","review":"The Jayhawks are pioneers of the Alt Country thing (I hate this genre name, but the cat is out of the bag). Ever since first hearing this album over 15 years ago, I viewed it as a nearly perfect. The recording is spot-on for the material - unpretentious, jangly, fuzzed guitars, a real piano - a perfect backdrop to well-written, tightly structured rock songs, with harmonies from Gary Louris and Mark Olson - they were meant to sing together. The Jayhawks pull their songs back to their roots, with hints of old electric Neil Young are in here (ala Zuma). Back-to-basics rock songs - a stellar album that has stood the test of time. Own it!

Yet here it is. I'm not sure anyone can plumb this album's lyrical depth, nor would they want to (as in the limpid \\"Waiting for the Sun.\\") But they make such a sharp and interesting contrast to the straightforward country-rock tunes, it adds up. \\"Witchita\\" in particular is heart-wrenching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and boring","review":"I know a lot of people really like this cd and that's why I took a chance on it. BORING! is the word for it. They sound like a bunch of high schoolers in the basement. The same rhythm guitar in every cut, hardly ever a solid guitar riff.Maybe the other reviewers were right, this is a cd for lovers of Neil Young who is a great songwriter but hardly a great musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in mediocrity","review":"A CD full of forgettable and mediocre songs, with no possible need to listen more than twice, the second listening to be sure you've heard the reasons you were disappointed. This isn't progressive country i.e. Gram Parsons, etc., this is self congratulatory bubblegum."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy listening for the alt-country types...","review":"This is some good, warm, down-home country-folk-rock. It's not boundary-pushing like Uncle Tupelo's early work, and it never raises its musical voice to a shout. It's a lot like Neil Young's \\"Zuma\\" record in my mind, and I'm sure there are other comparisons that would work as well. In fact, from the moment you put it on your stereo, it will sound like something you've heard before. But that familiarity is not a bad thing. It's kind of a comfort-food album for me, and one I tend to reach for when I'm not doing the best. It's got that simple, home-spun profundity that their later work seems to lack. I'd recommend it to someone who is already a fan of alt-country music, and is looking to broaden their horizons a bit. Classic stuff, if you're open to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sunday-Morning-Type Album","review":"With this CD, The Jayhawks have created a quietly intense masterpiece. Blending elements of country, folk, roots rock and soul, many of these tunes manage to be mellow AND rocking at the same time. After one listen, you'll likely be humming them for days afterwards. Gary Louris and Marc Olsen's distinctive sweet-n-sour Everly Brothers-like harmonies are right up front on tasty tracks like \\"Waiting For The Sun,\\" \\"Sister Cry,\\" \\"Settled Down Like Rain\\" and \\"Clouds,\\" showing a surprising adeptness at making melancholia sound downright joyful at times.Fans of classic artists like Neil Young, The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers shouldn't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've gotta be a Jayhawks fan; otherwise it all sounds the same.","review":"The songs are pleasant enough; the lyrics are clever enough; the musicianship is adequate. But the variety of melodies is just not there. I never knew of this band until Amazon recommended it, and I bought it; I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special here, surprisingly.","review":"I was really expecting to like this CD. I keep hearing good things about the Jayhawks, and the only song I've previously heard, \\"Nothing Left to Borrow,\\" was wonderfully catchy. Seemed like just my thing. \\"Hollywood Town Hall,\\" though, is just an expanse of blah from start to finish. There are tiny hints at greatness (\\"Nevada, California\\"), but nothing memorable otherwise. Other Jayhawks' CDs might be better, but I can't say much good about this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use!","review":"This book is a great way to introduce graphic organizers into the classroom.

But Robert Altman created a solid little piece of filmmaking here featuring some of the wickedest high school bastards you'll ever hope to encounter. It's a \\"message\\" film about \\"kids these days\\", but the director was smart enough not to get preachy and portrayed some pretty realistic and morally ambiguous situations teenagers face, particularly when dealing with their freedoms. While not quite the gem I was hoping it would be, it still is way above par and for my money better, more raw than \\"High School Confidential\\" or other similar 50s-60s films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

My son absolutely loved Dry Cereal and couldn't wait to try another Spy Fox mission. The Dry Cereal game involved such fun problem solving and exploration my son felt like a junior detective.

LC's beautiful voice is made distant, edgy and the volume is too low relative to the instrumentation. The dynamic range is compressed; the instrumnts are one big muddle, with too much upper midrange and little bass. This especially strange here, as her previous album (WTRosesBA) was mastered in pristine HDCD sound.Too bad about this one, as the perormances are very fine.Still, I am a huge admirer of LC's work, and hope that no one will be deterred by these comments from buying this, despite the mediocre sound. I hope that the next one will be mixed and mastered at the high level of Ms. Cantrell's artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album","review":"I've only bought this one and \\"When the Roses Bloom again\\". I bought \\"Humming\\" first and quite liked it. After that I followed it up with \\"Roses\\", but came up disappointed. If you want to try Laura try this one. There's sufficient variety in tempo and instrumentation from song to song as you play the CD to keep you interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another crappy box set","review":"The Black Crowes were a good band. So why is this yet another in the long line of crappy box sets?If the title had been \\"a box set of all their regularly released albums,\\" it would have been acceptable.

Paul is a genius and his brilliance shines through on songs like \\"Put It There\\" and \\"My Brave Face\\"- both songs Americans should have been buying in larger numbers instead of wasting their money on the \\"New Kids\\", Rick Astley and The Outfield (I'm thinking 1989 here). I just caught Paul in the Driving Rain Tour in Boston and saw the greatest concert of my life. A song or two from this album would have had the strength to hold the audience anyday.

I was 14, and my dad bought this tape which he constantly played in his car.Essentially, if you like Paul as a pop artist, then this is the ideal album. Great pop tunes like This One, We Got Married, Figure of Eight, and Put It There come to mind. I even remember turning on VH1 and seeing the video for My Brave Face on. Out of curiosity, I turned to see what was on MTV and it was...My Brave Face. Those were the good old days when these video channels didn't require that you had to be under 25 to get airplay.The only thing that keeps me from giving My Brave Face 5 stars is the fact that sometimes I'm in a mood for the rock-oriented side of Paul, which doesn't really show here. But it's still definitely one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCartney & Costello writing partnership in 1987","review":"I enjoyed hearing the partnership between these two creators of great songs. They worked together on four songs that appear on this MP3 album. 'My Brave Face' is the best but my second choice goes to 'That Day Is Done'. According to Graeme Thomson's excellent book \\"Complicated Shadows-The Life and Music of Elvis Costello\\", the song 'That Day Is Done' is based upon the funeral of Costello's grandmother.If you like this partnership, Thomson states that a dozen songs were writen together by them during this time.

I gave it a chance and made myself listen to the whole thing a few times but nothing struck a chord, which is very rare for a macca album, and i still cant understand why i dont like any songs on this album. One reason might be the way its drenched in 80's cliche, macca is usually ahead of his time, Tug of War was a good 80s album which kept its integrity but macca actually emerses his sonngs in unoriganallity on this letdown of an album. The other ppl who have reviewed this must like 80s music a fair bit. I can't dig it tho, if your used to the beatles 60's sound or the wings 70's sound your not gonna enjoy this album coz its far from this.

Buy this and you will be hungry for more McCartney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible CD","review":"Flowers in the Dirt is simply one of Paul's best efforts... his collaboration with Elvis Costello was a smashing success, despite lackluster sales by the public. This album is extremely varied, intelligent and well-arranged... and completely different than the Wings music he made before and now his works since this album. He would do well to reconsider working with Elvis, or perhaps somebody like Brian Wilson or Paul Simon in the future. In the meantime, one must be content enjoying the fine album - Flowers in the Dirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"The collaborative tracks with Costello are very good...the contrast between the two singers is striking..kinda reminds me of the difference between McCartney and Lennon, but more extreme...the similarities to the collaborative efforts between the two on \\"Mighty Like a Rose\\" are apparent. I like Paul's material in general, but the excitement and tension of the co-writing stands out in an appealing way.I prefer instrumental music over vocals, so the production is what I focus on. In this case, the instrumental arrangements are definitely worth a listen whether you you like the lyrics or not....there's even a track that George Martin pitched in on. The arrangements show influences from many different eras and genres....I like this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of McCartney's Best","review":"I thought about buying this for about a year before I took the plunge.

In any event, Jones' commanding and silky-smooth vocals combined with some truly wonderful and powerful arrangements make this album a must-have for reasons that go way beyond nostalgia.

When it's working it's awesome.It wasn't tall enough for our 60 pound dog, so we put it one stair up from the bottom to add 7\\" in height. Not recommended, but has worked fine for us as we are all healthy and careful.UPDATE - With some hard use the latch in the middle of the gate broke in half. I called North States and within a couple of days had a new one - no charge - and the gate is good as new. Impressed with North States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon lied to me","review":"I purchased this gate because the description specifically stated that no mounting hardware was required. You lied. It does require mounting cups to be glued or screwed to a wall. I bought this because I only wanted it installed temporarily while our dog is a puppy, so I did not want to leave any marks on the wall. Had I known it required hardware, I would have bought something else. Further, I am glad I bought it to keep my puppy from wandering in the house and not to keep a child safe. The latch is useless because I can push it open with very little force."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product, but delivered broken.","review":"This may have been a good product, but the boxes arrived damaged and the gates broken. (I bought two) Absolutely not the carriers fault. Amazon did such bad packing, there was no way it could have survived the trip. And since the delivery box was damaged, I would have to pay the local pack and ship to return the damaged gate and then wait for replacement.With a new puppy in dire need of gating, I went to the local PetSmart and bought this product off the shelf from them. Should have done that in the first place and saved myself the hassle. The Amazon extension is headed to the trash.As a side note, I also bought the gate extensions, and those arrived not damaged, but destroyed. An even worse packing job by amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gate with Missing Parts","review":"Recieved the gate with parts missing.

This is not a reflection of Amazon but on hte manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, but noisy","review":"Much sturdier than any plastic gate we tried. Make sure you measure the space and get the correct extensions to fit. There is very little leeway in terms of the width, you have to have the right extensions to fit. Makes a pretty loud noise when it closes, which is an issue for us as it's right next to the nursery at the top of the stairs. Doesn't require drilling for top-of-stairs use which is nice. The opening isn't real wide so maybe not good for older or wider people."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this gate","review":"We got this gate to keep our minature dachshunds from running off everytime some one came in the front door. We have an entry area that we were able to block off with this gate using the gate with the longer gate extension piece. Now when the kids go in and out the dogs are automatically kept back away from the front door by the autoclosing feature on the gate. The kids don't have to remember to close it and once they are on the other side of the gate they can fiddle around at the front door with it open and we don't have to worry about the dogs getting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible sound.","review":"I got this guitar over a year ago.

Their 1990 album still has the similar course but regains more of Pre-1983 classic taste despite the fact they still use songwriters outside the band.WILD CHILD the heavily edged opening is such a welcoming sign that Heart returns to a hard-rocker with grace. ALL I WANNA DO IS MAKE LOVE TO YOU which became top 10 hit is the extention of previous two albums. STRANDED also could have been 1984 selt-titled album. FALLEN FROM GRACE and UNDER THE SKY have classic HEART taste good works from the songwriters who love classic HEART music. CRUEL NIGHT mixes well with classic and 80s HEART.Verdict: Heart's culmination of past effort and search for the best they have got.Rating: 97 out of 100Recommended for: Every Heart fan and late 80s pop rock fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong pop-rock outing","review":"I gave up on Heart in the late-'80's, after the lukewarm \\"Bad Animals\\", but after hearing the power ballad \\"I Love You\\" on a radio station recently, I decided to give this one a try.

The hit was \\"All I wanna Do is Make Love To You\\", and it's a catchy tearjerker-wanna be(written by Mutt Lange!).

Their once-commendable stoicism now translates as banality, not aided by this lacklustre set, filled with beats that Eminem would be ashamed of.

There are plenty of descriptions of the fuel tank system, but the author provides no evidence to support her claim. Her conclusion was that the vents were accidentally left closed, but she cannot back this up. She also claims that there are plenty of sparks in the fuel tanks of the 747 frequently. Rubbish. She also refuses to indicate where the spark that brought down TWA 800 originated. There is some evidence that a shoulder-fired missile brought down the aircraft, yet she only discounts friendly-fire rather than terrorist activity. Thinking of buying this book? Do not bother. There is nothing but unsubstantiated nonsense. The author stated she wanted to discount all the nonsense, but she has only added to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you smoking crack","review":"Have you ever seen the size of fuel lines?

Gregory Stevenson has written an insightful polemic, defending the television show, Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, against all the criticism that claims the show lacks a moral compass or, more inaccurately, that the show is downright immoral. Stevenson, a theologian at Rochester College in Michigan, examines BtVS from every conceivable angle to show just how deeply moral it is, and how the question of morality pervades every episode. From the show's take on everything from family, religion, love, friendship, government and school, the author draws on his extensive knowledge of the stories to demonstrate just what a compelling \\"morality tale\\" Buffy the Vampire Slayer really is.Erudite without being pretentious, informed without being pedantic, this is definitely one of the better books on this well-chronicled television show.

After we spoke, I sent her my newly purchased copy and she called me back to agree that it was the single most destructive thing she had ever seen in her fifty-plus years.\\" Undoubtedly, Dr. Peck's strong emotional reaction was due to the destruction the book wrought in the life of one of Peck's patients.

But look carefully at the title and you have to wonder what the author's intent was when he titled the book GODS' MAN and not GOD'S MAN. The former may suggest a multitude of minor gods and the latter suggests one and only GOD. I will not buy or read this book based on DR M. Scott Peck's book titled 'Glimpses of the Devil'. I purchased and read Dr. Peck's book recently from Amazon and, in it, his review of the book \\"Gods' Man\\" warns it is an unhealthy book, especially so for children. Dr. Peck is a retired psychiatrist in good standing in his field of profession.

You will also realise it has a lot to live up to. AND IT DOES THAT AND MORE! Similar to Golden Axe 2 for the Sega Mega Drive , it provides hours of gameplay. The screenshots are perfectly super fun, and the gun battles are realistically hard. I mean, any real man can't absorb 6 shots to the cranium and still be standing as on some games!

But after giving it a rest a little bit and figuring out the controls more I have done a complete 180. The story is good, cutscenes Great and gameplay FANTASTIC!!! It just takes a little getting used too. But this game is a definate buy! You can switch between third person and first person view, many different weapons, and much more. But beware, this game is more about stealth than finishing a mission by killing everything in sight. The current mission I am on I cant be seen by anyone or else the mission is failed.

The beauty of this game is that you CAN play it as a shooter, and win, you can go in there and massacre every body, or you can play is safe and sneak in the back disquised as the delivery boy. You can take out your target with a sniper rifle from a safe distance, or you can get in close and strangle him to death with piano wire(so no one can hear him scream.)

First off there is no multiplayer so why would they even make it for a pc? Make it for playstation or x box but dont make a computer game that isnt multiplayer. 2nd thing moving around is hard to get use to and even after you do get use to it you find it annoying. Even picking things up off the ground in this game is a pain. E and then using the arrow keys to select it? I mean most games u can grab it with your mouse and even move your character with your mouse like quake.

It is well organized and even helps teachers out by categorizing the chapters by type of art and then from simple to more complex projects. My only complaint (and this is small) is that it would include better examples and descriptions of the steps to get to the finished product. All of the projects are shown in one page with a simple black-and-white picture on the opposite side. I would have liked to have seen the more step-by-step examples. most teachers will not have any problems using or adapting this book to their needs!

It claims to have lessons for grades 1-8 but after I looked through the entire book, the lessons seemed geared only toward elementary ages.

I wouldn't even recommend it for an elementary teacher who has to teach art in their room, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although the book has several art project ideas, I didn't feel they offered anything that isn't found in other curricular art books.

Far-fetched theories, conjecture, lack of credible sources, and a number of outright mis-cites where the source did not support the allegation. All that, woven with enough checkable stuff that Mr. Wasserman hopes will rub off on his theories. Just because something can happen does not mean it did happen. If he thinks the republicans orchestrated and executed a \\"theft\\" of the election, he certainly has not demonstrated it here.

It's more or less an attempt to update the Bardo Thodol for the modern (lazy) man. There's more here than there seems to be at first, but if the prospect of introductions by John Lilly and RAW doesn't excite you, then the book probably won't either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raga Bhankar by Ustad Vilayat Khan","review":"It is difficult to write about Bhankar, as this is a very uncommon Raga with almost unknown character. Sometimes it sounds like Bhatiyar, then there is a touch of Bhairav and also general Poorvi thaat. I guess this Raga could be played at any time. About Khansaab's playing, it really doesn't bring any color and never really rises to any height. For last several years its been noticed that whenever the great Ustad does his famous 'Gayaki Ang' work, he quite frequently goes out of tune which is quite hurting to the ears. After this CD, Ustad Vilayat produced a similar one, called Kedar-Bhankar. It is almost a repetition, except there is more strength to 'Shuddha Ma' as in 'Kedar'. Again, there is no particular color of that Raga. In both cases, the performance is quite depressing. I wish I could have given a better review for one of our greatest musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee or Shahid Parvez","review":"True Vilayat Khan was a great musician. but he certainly lacked the raagdari and laya Kari of Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Banerjee. Shahid Pervez observed this lack in the Etawah gharana and ameliorated his playing to a level never played by anyone in his lineage. Any one who truly knows Indian music will tell you Shahid Pervez has by far surpassed Vilayat. I understand Vilayat Khans fans have to keep the old glory alive, but lets call a spade a spade.Kishan maharaj recently played with Shahid Parvez and after the concert he also explicitly said that Shahid has topped the etawah clan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only shame should be nicole dere's","review":"Voyage of Shame describes this book well. It is a poorly written, uninteresting book that is blatantly trying to cash in some money by appearing as an erotic novel. The story is about a bunch of female naval recruits that have been sent to an all male naval vessel against the captain's wishes. In response, the captain allows his crew to take liberties with their new crewmates in order to \\"teach them a woman's place\\". And surprise of suprises, it turns out that the females really love this uninspiring humiliation.A weak storyline, which is further crippled by poor writing, makes this book worthless. The book is too short to develop any interesting characters, the situations that the characters are placed in are unimaginative and the descriptions of the actual sex is unexciting.If you are looking for good D&S writing, try Laura Rees or Laura Antinou instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutality is not erotic, and this book was too brutal!","review":"This book started off with six female naval personnel boarding a British warship on which they were not welcome or wanted. So far, so good. But then, on their first day out, the captain beats the one female officer, rapes her, and turns over the five other females to his crew to be repeatedly raped over the next several weeks, while the female officer is to be shared by the other male officers. Sound erotic to you? I didn't think so. Escapist fantasy is one thing, but it's like not one member of the crew felt the slightest bit guilty of raping & abusing these females without their consent? I can't relate to that. As for the reviewer below, I totally disagree with his contention that the lesbian sex between the women was uncalled for. I thought it was the most erotic part of the book! Let me clarify: the ONLY erotic part of the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Puss in Boots overwhelms an Arabian nights Fantasy.","review":"Although genies, sultans, and wish-makers abound in this book, the cat, Boabdil is the omniscienthero. The foibles of humans are evident as felineintelligence guides Hassam in his adventures with a rookie genie who knows the rules of magic but sometimes forgets his scenario. The story is a two-parter and some of the characters in the concluding episode are too predictable, but thehumor and clever dialog compensate for this minorflaw in a thoroughly entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I think the very beginning of the book was a little boring though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie for Guys!","review":"WHen I first saw the movie trailers I thought another blood and guts movie with no plot or character development. Therefore, I had low expectations of the movie. However, I was impressed enough with the plot and underlying moral dilemnas that Bruce WIllis's character faced while completing his mission. It still had the requisite shoot outs and last stand vs the thousands of well-dressed Nigerian rebels (those are proably the best dressed and armed rebels I have ever seen in a movie!). Naturally, Bruce and his small team survive, bloodied and worse for wear. Amazing how 8 Navy Seals could withstand a small army of rebels.Its perfect for a cold wintery or rainy weekend with a six pack and a couple of submarine heros with your buddies in an afternoon of male bonding when there the football season is over and baseball hasn't started yet or westling isn't until later. Best enjoyed with the wife/SO and or kids are out shopping or visiting the in-laws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb war movie","review":"What a great film! I am suspicious of Bruce Willis who has a tendency to get in front of the camera (the series of Die Hard). However, he is at his best in this mission taking place in the breathtaking scenery of a sumptuous and agonizing Africa (Nigeria). The horror of civil war is very well described. the story of the movie has lots of sense. The actors are brilliant. A great moment of cinema, which helps us to better assess situations of crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible movie","review":"This is probably the worst Bruce Willis movie, and that's saying a lot. The acting is stiff and the plot is thin. Not even all the action scenes can make up for it. The parts that are supposed to be emotional are dry and unconvincing. The movie is, in a word, boring. I'm glad I rented this one and didn't buy it. I would have given it one star, but the action was pretty decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthwhile","review":"Picture quality is impacted because so much of this film is shot in very dark conditions. Also, someone on the production team seems to think that Bruce Willis' face can be substituted for good scenery. I bet his face took up half of the overall area on film for this movie. My biggest single gripe is that I found the plot completely implausible, and the characters impossible to get attached to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful...","review":"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and no doubt, Willis' worst movie ever!

The movie is awesome and inspirational. The music, the cinematography, the plot, the development of the characters were all excellent.

By the film's excrutiating end, I was half expecting the helicopters to disembark a team of chiropractors. It's hard bashing something that is so sincere, you feel like a bully. However, might I suggest putting on the cans and listening to Peter Gabriel's Biko over and over for two hours while looking at postcards of Bruce Willis and Africa? The pain will remain the same but will work out cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"very amateurish","review":"This movie was a huge disappointment, in my opinion. The mission (rescuing a doctor who does not want to be rescued) is absolutely ridiculous, especially after sitting through the whole thing to find out why she was so important, and still never finding out. The ground tactics were embarrassing....mistakes that even the greenest of Basic Training graduates would never make. Who in their right mind would think it was a good idea to stand upright and walk right into 300 enemy soldiers who are firing on you? No wonder they got chewed up so badly. The only redeeming value of this movie is that it MIGHT open the eyes of SOME people to the atrocities that are going on in Africa even as we speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"save yourself","review":"It's a good bet that you already know EXACTLY what is going to happen in this movie.

It is so bad most people I have talked to have turned it off within the first 30 minutes of play time. I lasted about 10 minutes.

A different twist to war movies? Maybe. And most of the time the scenes were too dark to make out wat was goin on! Sure it was touching but i was kinda expecting more from tis movie. If you have time, watch it. If not, u can skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears of one of the movie goers","review":"It's boring and extremely illogical. The truth is nobody in that situation could have helped rescued so many people if he did not have the support of many air planes and infantries. I found the fighting scenes were not engaging either.I did not have to pay the full price for the ticket but I still think it's a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandon This Mission","review":"Let me be the first to say that I really wanted this movie to be great. Antonie Fuqua, Bruce Willis, Eammon Walker, Monica Bellucci and the rest of the cast really deserve for this film to succeed. Unfortunately, the film fails them in way too many ways to give it a good review. I agree with those who say that the film tackles interesting topics. I agree with those that say that the film is a technically competent film. But aside from a few histrionics by the ENTIRE cast (you'll know which scene I am referring to), the film makes no attempt to develop ANY of the characters beyond \\"plot funtions\\". And there are too many gaps in logic for this film to even begin to make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"You can figure out the end line of this movie within the first ten minutes. Even in terms of seeing this movie as just entertainment was difficult trying to accept the totally ridiculous decisions made by the Lieutenant (Bruce Willis). What Navy Seal would totally disobey the orders of his Commanders and knowingly risk the lives of his men and take on people he's not supposed to save, risking their lives, while at the same time the producers of this movie fail to make their heroic escape from 500 rebel soldiers look even half way believable??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"This is not just a horrible movie its a movie that gives the average person a fantasy impression of the military. If Bruce Willis's character was a real life officer he would have been court martialed and done 20 years in Levenworth, and rightfully so. This movie is way to far off the diving board, even for Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple pie and all that....","review":"In my opinion, this movie deserves a one-star rating (even though I found the last 20-minutes quite funny). I particularly liked Willis' final comment....\\"here, help her, she needs medical attention\\" when he's standing there seriously wounded (first, by a machete) then shot numerous times. I enjoyed the captain of the aircraft carrier miraculously showing up within minutes after the last altercation with the \\"rebels\\", as well. Particularly because it took the two fighter jets quite some time (at hyperspeed) just to get to the battle site.Corny, apple pie, terribly overacted... and most of all ridiculous. We all know, don't we, that Americans never need to load their guns... the bullets just seem to keep coming. I rate this one right in there with John Travolta's Broken Arrow. Same genre', only a bit more foolish. Believe me, this one will be forgotten quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tears of boredom","review":"Maybe the ending saves this movie. I rarely only watch half a movie, but after about 45 minutes I had to stop this DVD. Incredibly cliche beginning, followed by scenes that left me wondering why it took 15 minutes to convey to the movie watcher something that could be summed up in about 15 seconds. Really, I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best military drama since \\"Black Hawk Down\\"","review":"If you get past the whole unbelievable parts, and into the story itself, its a dam good movie.

The supporting cast was stupendous, and really felt for the africans in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA Near the End....","review":"Rent it when you've seen the better combat stories. Well I had high hopes for this one at the theater, and the first half was good enough. Then on the second half the whole \\"reality\\" of the movie fell through. If you ever read any real SEAL stories you will wonder what happened at the end. Bad tactics, bad acting, and just poor story. They all died about the start of the \\"big battle\\", somehow walking out in the B-movie end. Total science fiction. Sorry, that was just too much. And Why? No one to write a realistic script? Ran out of ideas? What a waste for the budget and huge effort. Thats my take. BlackHawk down Was a good movie though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Flaw","review":"I'll admit that this film was fairly intense. And it did have good acting from Bruce Willis and Eamonn Walker (Karim Said on HBO's \\"OZ\\"). And it had some good action set-pieces. And it has a good premise. And it starred the almost disturbingly beautiful Monica Bellucci. But it has one central question that it does not answer ... soldiers Willis and Walker go in to the jungle to extract Dr. Bellucci, but the film never bothers to answer why they would be sent to do this.

Altogether a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie [was bad]","review":"and the lead female actress (the doctor) was extremely irritating, whiny, and seemed totally unable to grasp how much danger she and her refugees were in and how much Bruce Willis had gone against direct orders for her. oh how I wanted him to just shoot HER and put ME out of my misery.

Monica Bellucci was a miss-fit, I didnt think she fit in at all as an American doctor helping poor Africans. Bruce Willis is always good. The action scene in the village was probably the best part. The last scene were not all that great at all, very ameaturish in my opinion. I found it really funny, that none of the Nigerian soldiers could shoot straight. Its ironic that all the people trying to do something good for the Africans were either Americans or Europeans, considering the fact that much of Africa's problems today could be attributed to European Colonization, or how everyone turned a blind-eye to what happened in Rwanda.If you want to watch a really good movie on this subject, then watch HOTEL RWANDA."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little for everyone","review":"Lots of things that go boom for the little boys in us all.Politics and social criticism for the thinker as well.Not for the faint of heart, ugly scenes with evil armed men.Bruce Willis plays a thoughtful, had-enough-of-the-evil in this world LT sent to rescue a italian-american doctor in Nigeria. Civil War has broken out and both she and 3 Catholic Church workers are in danger.Nigeria has oil, the different groups are fighting for control of the money flow, and butchering anyone in their way. Child soldiers, rape as a means of terror, keeping your word and honesty. All touched on, but the movie is finally a shoot-em-up bang bang movie. Nicely done, gives you enough justification to root for the good guys and holler when the bad guys get wasted.Worth a watch, if nothing else then for the absolutely beautiful scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"This is one of the best modern warfare movies, even though it's been out for a few years now, somehow I just got around to seeing this film.

After 40 minutes.Sorry, I have a childhood friend who is a currently serving SEAL, and this movie made me physically ill.If you're looking for a liberal-oriented, we-need-to-hug-and-save-everyone film, if you're looking for a film set in Fairyland, then this film is for you.If you have any knowledge whatsoever of military operations or history, if you believe in pragmatic reality, if you have any respect for the men who wear the Trident, DO NOT WATCH THIS HORRIBLE STEAMING PILE DOG PILE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the film as originally written or made","review":"I think that it is important to note that this film was moved halfway 'round the earth and the entire plot changed BECAUSE OF THE SO-CALLED \\"ACCIDENTAL\\" DEATH OF KEVIN TOD SMITH, who goes uncredited in THIS version. Originally, it was shot in China, and was Smith's first \\"big American film role.\\" Apparently, Bruce Willis couldn't take the competition of a taller, more-skilled, more handsome, funnier, more physically-adept and built like a brick house \\"co-star.\\" Although I doubt that, had Kev lived, he would've gotten THAT much credit from Mr. 5'7\\" New Jersey Boy. If they'd finished this war-mongering diatribe in China, and left Tod's scenes in, I might want to watch it. But as a Willis vehicle, it sounds like a load of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apalling racist claptrap","review":"Having chosen to set it in a real country, Nigeria, the movie then proceeds to play Nigerians as 'bad, evil' people who will commit atrocities because they can; the breakaway Igbo people as inherently good, but in need of protection from Americans; the last member of the Igbo royal family (the Igbo do not have a royal family) as a snivelling coward, until given a stiff talking to by Bruce Willis, helping turn him into a man; the Igbo desperate to assure the Americans that they are good people who will never be forgotten; and the Americans defenders of right against wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"bruce willis","review":"the movie was a good movie, good story, the sad part in this movie was the killing of all of thosepoor people, all they wanted was freedon for there people,bruce and his buddys gave a good performacethe action was great, i did not want to leave my seat. the costar was good in her playing the doctorwho was to have been saved.i give this dvd, four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great war movie?","review":"Far from it! This wants too bad to be too good and fails on so many levels, they should've just given up while in production. I can see during the film that Willis seemed upset that he even did this. Who knows, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps he liked the movie. I myself did not. It had no power. It had no real emotion. It seemed as flat as a pancake. I was expecting a lot coming from the director of \\"Training Day\\", but I'll think next time before being so naive. I say don't waste your time. This film was so flat I had to watch it in four segments just to get to the end.

Doesn't make much sense to risk all these soldiers' life to save a volunteer doctor in Africa given she doesn't want to be rescued -- is her like more valuable than the soldiers' ?Almost everyone in the movie are filled with rage (for no reason) and no humor in life. The movie feels like European instead of Good ol' American.simply put, no fun whats so ever to watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a complete waste of time","review":"I watched this last night with my brother, and literally after 10 minutes we were bored to death. Completely unbelievable. A Navy SEAL disobeying direct orders, the big-baby doctor, the \\"I'm sorry about your men\\" cheesy, lame dialogue, oh, it was painful. I like a good war flick...and I like thoughtful movies...but this movie was like the chameleon it showed in one of the segue shots: it just kept changing. Was it a war movie? Was it trying to make a political statement? Was it trying to feed off of America's corporate guilt for not doing anything about the numerous incidents of genocide in Africa? Was it a romance movie? It felt forced, contrived, and unrealistic. I'm sorry that watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture and sound","review":"I'm a fan of Bruce and this one is a my favorite movie too. This Blu-ray Dise is worth the price. The sound is great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Film","review":"This was an outstanding film that showed a tremendous performance by Bruce Willis and company.

Truly a 5* movie !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dissapointment, but still decent","review":"I have to say that i expected more from Tears of the Sun. I figured it would be like Black Hawk Down. I didnt think there were enough action scenes, i mean i understand that the seals arent always caught in crossfire but i thought it moved slow and I also thought it was unlikely that the 8 Seals would save all those refugees. The last scene with the jets is the best. Overall a decent movie. Dissapointing though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent action - intriguing story","review":"Willis and his soldiers are chased through the Nigerian Jungle. This is an edge of your seat, could it be true movie.It is touching, discusting at times, yet moving as they flee to the nearest border crossing to safety.The movie has many twists and turns and defines a new way to see war up close and personal.There are many issues that are challenging to the audience. Just how much intervention is needed by a free people? What can we do to help a world if and when in crisis?I recommend this movie because it seems so real, potentially true."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUH?! A pro-USA movie from Hollywood?!","review":"How did this happen? A pro-US movie from the out-of-touch drones in Hollywood? Who would have expected it? This is a good movie where the bad guy isn't made to be a good guy and the good guys really are good guys. The movie is not without a couple of flaws (e.g. the whiny, ignorant, supporting actress), but it is fun to watch and overall a good ride. Good filming and good acting (for a movie of this genre). In these times of 2-bit, simpleton, terrorists trying to justify their murderous activities in the name of \\"Allah\\" and killing women and children for their \\"god\\", it is refreshing to see a movie from the side of the freedom loving, good guys....If you believe in individual liberty you will probably enjoy this movie, if you don't.....well, I can't help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tears\\", not what it appears.","review":"I appreciate a trailer that gets you interested, but doesn't give the movie away. This movie is a good example of that. I walked in expecting a typical action film, and was pleasantly surprised with much more. A good storyline made better by believable characters struggling with their own inner conflicts concerning duty, honor, and morals. Cudo's to Bruce Willis for sticking to his guns about not doing the \\"kiss\\" scene, which would have compromised the believability of this well thought out action/war drama. Catch it on the big screen, it's one of the better movies so far this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better Version","review":"This Director's Extended Cut is much better than the theatrical release. This version places the film in a more understandble political context in Nigeria than merely rebel troops running after \\"indigenous\\" personnel. The Director's cut added scenes which explains how the story unfolded as oppose to a mere military action flick in the theatrical release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jungle Warfare","review":"Other than Black Hawk Down and Blood Diamond, I think this is probably my favorite war film of the contemporary era. The action scenes were very good, although some scenes it just seemed to focus on Willis and company shooting as opposed to the enemy dying. The drama was also excellent. I especially like when Willis and the boys rip apart the ethnic cleansers. Monica Belluci is also great to look at and she is a good actress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears of the Sun on Blu-Ray","review":"Tears of the Sun is one of the best war movies I have seen years.

Waters, a hard core, taciturn and ambivalent commander of a U.S. Navy Seal unit assigned to extract American foreign nationals from war torn Nigeria. His mission is to escort an American doctor, played emotionally by Monica Bellucci, who is based in a remote jungle mission. Unfortunately she won't acccompany Willis' team without a group of 70 refugees sheltered at the mission.Willis in a fit of compassion and urged on by Bellucci agrees to escort the rag tag bunch to the safety of neighboring Cameroon. Willis' team and the refugees are being pursued by a murderous band of rebels bent on their destruction. While fleeing they are confronted by horrendous acts of nauseatingly gruesome ethnic cleansing, which bolsters their resolve to complete their mission.Director Antoine Fuqua poignantly creates an excessively graphic allegory portraying the inhuman capablities of man against those perceived as being different or inferior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this movie...","review":"I am no movie critic, I am no soldier, I am an ordinary man.

Ya well, its in the movie but its at the very end for about five minutes. All i can say is DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE, DONT EVEN RENT IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't usually do this","review":"I watched this movie until Bruce Willis decides to turn back the helicopters to \\"save\\" the people he left behind. At that point I turned the movie off. why would he do this?? Because Monica Belluci is sooo beautiful? Because this hardcore career black ops military guy suddenly felt bad? At that moment I felt cheated. I first felt cheated when Wilis let all the people come along-but was redeemed when I saw what he was doing-and then he goes and spoils it all by going back for them and putting his own men in unnecessary danger. Mutiny anyone? Don't buy this movie-don't rent it-don't waste your time. You want to see a great war movie kids-watch Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter, even 3 Kings was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"95% of the whole team wasted because of some idiot female doctor","review":"The female doctor was SO ANNOYING. These Navy SEAL's show up to rescue her and 3 others and all she can do to show some thanks is bitch and moan and telling them to get their guns out of the village and to take over 70 people with them on a Helo that fits a normal infantry squad sized element. Stupid movie. She refused to leave said village and I wouldve left her there with all the trouble that it caused. I woulda told the CO that was thousands of miles away that she was WASTED already. Integrity isnt always the best option. By following her wishes almost the entire team and more than half the people they took along got wasted. Was it worth it? They shouldve just tranquilized her or left her there for dead like she wished. This movie SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the Ham Cure","review":"The only good parts of this movie were the inexplicable and annoyingly intentional shots of Monica Bellucci's cleavage.Acting was way overdone.

I would skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the commercials!!","review":"When I first saw the movie trailer, I quickly went ans watched it in theaters.

I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Willis goes soft","review":"Dubbed as the best Bruce Willis movie since Die Hard was definately far fetched. This movie not only had a far too slow story line but also involved far too much bad acting on Willis' part. Since when do his action films include boring drawn out love interests, multiple speeches, [bad]explosions and not a single good tag line .... I've alway loved Willis as an actor on film and TV but this movie was a sellout. Good idea, bad story, bad special effects, bad acting. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears for this bad attempt","review":"Nice start, a lot of typical over-dramatization and dragged out scenes, and a silly and predictable ending. The technical accuracy was lacking, with such things as handheld radios reaching miles inland and the whole idea of disobeying orders and putting the entire team at risk. Surely there had to be a better way of protecting those people. American ambassadors overseas aren't too keen on American military units formulating their own on-the-spot foreign policy. I would save your money for something a little less flashy and more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a huge Bruce Willis fan...","review":"If this movie had been intended to be a spoof on war movies, then i thought it was hilarious. They used every cliche in the book. Are all African relief workers so attractive? Frankly, I am a big Bruce Willis fan, and, i will say, if he wasn't in it this would have been one of the worst movies ever. Instead, it is a movie that tries to copy \\"Black Hawk Down\\" but fails in every way. From a former member of the military, avoid this one and get \\"Black Hawk Down\\" instead. Tom Skerrit on the deck of an aircraft carrier with a sat Phone, that would never happen. Did they even consult with the military?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Plot and Action","review":"I went into this movie with high expectations. However, I found the plot and the action sequences extremely predictable. This movie will require a very strong \\"willful suspension of disbelief\\" in order to buy some of the scenes, acting, and decisions made by the characters.

On the commercial of course they show the big action scenes and all that stuff, but in the movie, there is no action until the very end. There is some small action earlier but not enough to please me. I am a die hard action film fan, and this just doesnt reach the standards. i thought the movie would be about the Navy SEALS trying to survive, but really it was about rescueing (forgot how to spell) a prince from a war torn african country. i was like \\"WTF!!\\" i thought this was going to be like \\"Black Hawk Down\\" or \\"Die Hard\\". but unfortunatly it isnt. if you like big time action movies like the two listed above, dont buy or rent this movie. if you like corny \\"save this person\\" kind of movies, this might be just for you. oh well. now i have to break the news to my friend that the movie stunk big time.....-patrick (im unhappy)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a rental","review":"Yep!Its another rental!

Good, that the Nigerian patients survived? I don't think so. The most important aspect of this story is really quite simple: Lt. Waters disobeyed direct orders and sacrificed the lives of four SeALS. More than $5,000,000 in assets lost because his character had an emotional crisis? That's a steep price to pay. In the really real world, a deserved court martial would be awaiting Lt. Waters upon his return home. Besides all of this, the military tactics, or lack thereof, in this movie must have been 'developed' by a blind monkey. JoJo the Idiot Circus Boy must have been the military consultant. I can only hope that a sequel is made, with the end result being Lt.

In my opinion, a few of the recipes leave out *just a little bit*. I noticed in the pignoli cookies, for example, I believe the instruction should say \\"beat the egg whites\\", it does not tell you to do that. I have found the same in another recipe.

I read it and was very glad that I had listened to her, because if I hadn't, I would have been missing out on a really great book. It starts out with Onua, the horse manager for the king, looking around to buy horses. She meets Daine, a girl with only a horse for family. Onua hires Daine as a helper. Daine rescues Numair Salmalin, when he is in the shape of a hawk. When he is well and back in the shape of a human, he, Onua, and Daine go back to the palace. Numair finds out that Daine has Wild Magic, which is a type of magic that lets her talk to animals and heal animals. I don't want to give away the whole story, so that's all that I'll tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good wholesome fantasy...","review":"Well, although you are supposed to start with the Alanna seris, I started with this one when I was twelve. I was hooked immediately as I could relate to the main character and her relationship with horses. The characters are all strong and have their own way to them, and the plots are excellent, but the reason I knocked off a star on this book was because of two things: --It can get really dippy/cheesy at points --length...as this is a YA book they can't be more that 250 pages, and although I know the author is annoyed she can't make them longer, I like to continue with a book that's long when I like it.Recommended YA book. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"I picked this up at camp because i was all out of books to read, thinking if i hated it i didnt have to finish it... all i can say is i've read it 100000000000000000000 times since then and its GREAT! definetly at LEAST 50 stars! wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically Wild Enchantment","review":"If you are not familiar with Tamora Pierce you will be very pleased. Tamora Pierce is at her best writing Wild Magic. If all you fantasy freaks have been bored to death with all those girly fantasies you will be amazed at seeing how fantasy has changed. Fantasy has gone to a new level when a teenage girl is looking for a job and finds a witch that finds out that the teenager has a very powerful magic in her. When dangers strikes from another land she must muster up enough strength to find a deep sea creature... but will she be able to summon it or will it summon her first to find out read Wild Magic by Tamora Pierce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal lovers, fantasy lovers, this book is for you.","review":"I have read almost all of Tamora Pierce's books and this one is my favorite. It combines my love for fantasy and love of animals into one great adventure. This book got my imagination going and I couldn't put it down. If you like adventure, some humor, some mysterious characters, set at the time of castles, kings, queens and dragons, this is the book to spend some time with. Girls ages 12-15 might like it the most, but it would also make a good story to read aloud to younger kids and introduce them to another age. Tamora Pierce wrote this book so well that the reader can actually picture themselves in the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I read the entire series when I was home from school one winter. I was so entranced by this book that I made my sister go get the other books in the series. This is by far the best series I have read yet. It gives a female heroine instead of the typical male we have become used to seeing in our books. Ms. Pierce has incredible insight and a wonderful imagination and I look forward to reading all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely spellbinding!","review":"This book got me out of my feeling of loss when I finished Alanna series. I was looking for something else to read, when I found this BOok! This is such a great book. It brings back all the old characters as well, and lets you know what happens to them! (I hate it when I don't know what happens after ^^;;) And also introduces new characters as well. Veralidaine Sarrasri, Daine for short, a girl who has wild magic and her teacher Numair Salmalin, are the real main characters in this book. And.. well, I don't want to give too much away! I recommend this book to anybody who finished Alanna series and are looking for something like Alanna but more exciting. Wild Magic rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book by Tamora Pierce is Wild Magic!!!","review":"Honestly, out of all of Tamora Pierce's books this one, and all of the Immortal sieres, is my all time favorites. It's thrilling and has great characters and a good story. This book makes you want to keep going and read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!","review":"Wild Magic is a fabulous story. You become so familiar with Daine, you feel like she is your sister.The book has a seemingly magical essence that draws you in. If you like animals, fantasy, and a good book, you will enjoy this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Mytholigical Creatures","review":"It's a great book overall, but a 4-star. I loved it but it needed more action to hold my interest. The \\"training,\\" part of the novel went on too long and bogged it down some.I loved all the mythological creatures. The main character's communication with every day animals was cool too. The descriptions in the book were good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story","review":"I read this before I read the other series (Song of the Lioness)so I really had no background info on the setting. The plot is intriguing and the details back it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf-Speaker","review":"The book, Wolf-Speaker is an awsome book. There are some really great parts involing; wolves, dragons, basilisks, stormwing, hurroks, and more. If you like myth, animals and adventure, this is your type of book. You will never want to put it down. The story is about young Daine learning how to use her magic and helping humans, immortals and animals of all sorts. If you have read The Song Of The Lioness series, this will suit you also. It even has a little of Alanna and Roald in it! Well this is a great book and I say you should try it. From, Kitten The Dragon"},{"rating":"2","title":"wild magic","review":"omg this is the best book ever. Guess what? tamora is coming to my school tomorrow!!

I would suggest this book to any literature lover,young or old. Jessica L. age 13"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderous book filled with good and evil magic!","review":"Wild Magic was a thrilling story filled with never ending excitement. Diane's magic gives her the power to speak to animals. This magic proves to be very useful and powerful. The characters were easily pictured and this was an all together fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"My experience is that this book is of enormous value for young adult readers of all genders. It shows them something that mainstream media fail to do; that teenagers and adults of all genders can work together and can accomplish the same things at an equal value.This ebook was nicely formatted and I didn't find any errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesn't love Tamora?","review":"If you have ever read any of the other Tortal books then I assure you, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment!","review":"I don't even have the heart to write a decent review, and believe me when I say I'm hurting inside---this was my first Tamora Pierce book and I had such high expectations, but the poor darlings came all tumbling down as the story progressed. I just couldn't get into it. It's... it's all over the place, to the point that I had no idea whatsoever of what, who, when, where... I just---I just---it's not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"true work of art","review":"Wild Magic is the first book in the Immortals series. Our heroine, Diane, is an orphaned girl with a secret. She learns to trust herself, her magic, and her new friends. Wild Magic is a remarkable book that you won't be able to put down. Full of magic, suspense, action, friendship, and bits of humor, it's a wonderfully rounded tale. Tamora Pierce takes you on a wild and magical ride with characters, settings, and adventures that you will never forget. We journey with Daine as she comes to terms with her magic and herself and learns that, with the proper training, her magic could very well bring back balance to the world.An excellent addition to anyone's bookshelf. It's well written and won't be easy to put down. After you read Wild Magic, go to the bookstore or library to check out the rest of the Immortals series. I know i'm repeating myself, but this is one of the most magical, emotional, and action-packed books i've ever read. It's hard to describe so go read it for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book a long long time ago","review":"I first read this book a long time ago in middle school and I still have the full series both Lioness and the Immortals they are no joke bound with duck tape because over the last 11 years or so I have read them soo many times that they are indeed falling apart and I just had to replace my In the Realm of the Gods copy because half the book fell out. Once my kids get a little bit bigger these books will be read to them and I hope that when they get even older that they will pick up these books and read them over and over again like I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragons should lay eggs, not give birth","review":"Eh, maybe it's because I haven't read any other of this author's books and started out with this one first, but the book was mediocre at best. Good idea, but insipid prose, nice, bland, boring characters, and towards the end she starts throwing in random griffins, dragons, and even a kraken almost as an afterthough/deus ex machina plot device.But what really annoyed me was the dragon \\"in labor\\" toward the end of the book. Don't dragons typically hatch from eggs? I've never heard of one giving birth before, and the bit where the main character heals the dragon fetus in utero is just silly, not to mention that they're planning to feed it milk at the end. Who feeds a dragon MILK? Or any reptile, for that matter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I brought this book having been led to believe that it was suitable for an older audience. It didn't take long for me to realize that it's not. This book is clearly meant for young adults.Even so, I didn't think this was a good book. I've read books for young adults (I am 32) and enjoyed them very much. This was not enjoyable at all. The prose was weak, the characters boring, everyone was either too happy and nice, or too evil and mean. It was very slow and not very descriptive. I didn't care about anyone, or what happened to them. Many of the characters were unbelievable. Sometimes, I even found it hard to believe that the animals were real! I can't think of a single other book I've read when that has happened - when the animals in a book don't even seem like animals!Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...","review":"The book was interesting, but not interesting enough. It is machine fantasy, whipped out for hundreds of people who are fantasy nuts. There wasn't anything really good about them, but they were fun for times when you have nothing else to read. Not really worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Cool!","review":"I love this book, and all the others in the series. Tamora Pierce is a great author. I hope to see many other books adjecent to these. Keep up the good work, Tamora!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to read a great book read Wild Magic .","review":"I really like fantacy books. Wild maic is just that. I liked it because Veralidaine is original. Her talent is different from most magical talents. I am also original. Daine thought she was going to take some ponies to trianees. She does and finds herself with a mess of untamed magic as well as evil immortals to fight. This book is exiting but has some reality to it.

Wild Magic was the first Tamora Peirce book I read and now, I have just finished The Circle of Magic series. I have already read the Lioness Quartet and what is out for the Portector of the Small. This book is exactly what I was looking for, it has adventure, a little romance, mystery, magic and every thing else. Daine is a wonderful main character with all the troubles and is actually realistic. All the other books like Wild Magic I have read are all cheesy with un-realistic main characters but Wild Magic really makes you belive in magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I thought this story of a 13 year old girl named Daine was fasninating. In this book Daine has to overcome her past and start on her new life. I love how this book enchants the reader and how you cant put it down. I recomend this book to ages 11-15"},{"rating":"2","title":"Youth Fantasy Finest for Girls","review":"First I would like to say, that I love this book mostly because it was the book that introduced me into the world of fantasy. And because what animal-crazed junior high student doesn't want a book about a girl who can talk to animals.Plot: 4/5; Its not extremely complicated but very enjoyable, and not totally predictable.Characters: 4/5; Daine is the wounded soul that every teen thinks they are, and its easy to connect with her as she tries to find her place in the world. I really enjoyed the other characters as well, especially the Riders. They added a lot of fun. (Gotta Love Sarge)Sexuality(5/5=romance w/no sex): 4/5; No romance in this book, though it does develop later in the seriesRecommended Age: Jr. High Students (11ish and up)I do love this book because its a great story about magic and finding yourself. Not to mention lots of animals. Fantastic for animal loving preteen girls"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Magic review","review":"Wild Magic is the first in the immortals quartet, which is a truly magical tale of a young girl with an amazing talent that enables her to talk to animals.As Daine explores her newfound talent she opens up a world in which I find a place I can escape to when real life gets to hard. I have read the immortals quartet many, many times and still find it enthralling. Any fantasy admirer will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals Are Magic!","review":"I selected Wild Magic because of the animals, particularly horses, in the story. I am not easily amused by books such as The Hobbit or Harry Potter. The extraordinary creatures in Wild Magic nevertheless really are fun to read about. There is a map of the Kingdom of Tortall that made the story even more interesting to me.It's possible I might read the other three books in the series. I began reading children's books about animals occasionally after my beautiful cat passed away. The stories comfort me."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"I've never read anything like this before what a great format and story line that made you feel as if you are actually there like a book should be. I would recamend this book to any one who loves being absorbed into a book and whant to finish with the other books as soon as they can get a hold on them. And wanting more to read and to absorb and to learn some things that we can actually do on our own while still learning and reading. another great book it reminds me of even though it was somewhat borring is THE LAST OF THE REALLY GREAT WANGDOODLE witch works about the same as the immortals searies. gota have more more more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs it?","review":"This book was written by my grandmother and that is the only reason I bought it.

The idea of the Justice League beening under attack by plans that Batman devised is awesome. What sucks about the movie is, it felt like a long tv episode geared at little children only. The Justice League over come their problems without any consequences. At the end, it feels as if they were never attacked with Batman's contingency plan. So many great scenes could have been added to this movie, because of it's premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"This was truly a great story line. The artistry was great!

I just want to point out that the Ultraviolet/Flixster model of delivering digital copies is absolutely HORRIBLE. You have to create a Flixter account then an Ultraviolet account and then download a copy of their desktop software. The install for the desktop software is also Horrible. You need to download around 50 MB of data just to get the install and the install starts out telling you that it's getting around 16 MB, then when it reaches that, it says it is getting more and then more again. And even after that, you still can only stream the movie.I wasted about an hour doing all this and then cancelled my account(s). It appears you have to cancel both accounts separately.Won't be doing that again. Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best JL movie yet.","review":"It took me a few days debating with myself whether I should rent this movie or not but after doing so, I'm glad I did.

If your a fan of any outlet, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rental at best...","review":"I wish I could be leaving a glowing review but, there really isn't much to say. The artistic styling isn't the best. The characters are pretty ugly actually. The story wasn't very compelling either. As I couldn't care less what happened at the end either way.Music score was near non existent. The only redeeming quality was the voice casting.If you're like me and loved some of WB's previous works like \\"Superman:the animated series\\" and \\"Justice League Unlimited\\" you've probably bought most of the animated features WB/DC has produced since. You've might have noticed, as I have, the decline in quality too. Well, this feature follows that same declining path. I'm finally getting fed up with being let down by WB's. That's why I'm recommending this as a RENTAL first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, flat acting, laws of physics broken","review":"The story has a great amount of promise, and to a degree it delivers on it, but the acting falls flat and so do some of the events. There is one point near the end where the heros can see something in space travelling towards them at the speed of light, thereby making the light from said travelling phenomena travel faster than the speed of light. It kind of irritated me. It was mostly the flat acting and bad lines that got to me though."},{"rating":"1","title":"When in doubt, fight it out!","review":"Repetitive is the best way to describe this animated feature. The original story was an important one in the history of the Justice League due to the fact it really magnified the split that exists between the purely human heroes and the superheroes of the DC Universe. It portrayed Batman at his most paranoid and also his most vulnerable,but much of those original subtleties are lost here. It is now like the more recent DC releases, punching and zapping one another are the order of the day and any real thought or desire to push the envelope in the world of animated storytelling are abandoned. These are now nothing more than glorified Saturday morning cartoons and as such cannot be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I thought this movie would be as good as the movie, Batman and the Redhood, but it wasn't even close. This movie could had just been a regular episode of the JLA TV series.This movie failed to keep my attention many times. I just couldn't get into it. It seemed too well scripted to the point, you know the JLA will just find a easy way to fix all the stuff that is happing to them. Then, it happened. Every member of the JLA that had fallen to the Evil bad guys, came back very easily...too easily. Why? Because a non-JTL good guy was in the mix from the start had the solution all along.Half way though the movie, I pretty much wanted this movie to end. It was so boring to watch. After the half way point. I already knew that the JLA will just go find the evil team of super villains and take them out with ease.

In fact I would rate the movie itself at 4 stars.

I love the iTunes Digital copies because I can store the movie locally on my device and watch it on my computer or iDevice with no problems. But, with the UV stuff you have to be connected to the internet and cant store them locally. I want my iTunes Digital copy back or there is no reason for me to pay extra for digital copy I will not ever use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The one-star rating is because justice league doom is simply not worth buying.No better or worse than a standard justice league tv episode.If Warner's wants to continue the show through DVD releases then they should use the familiar animation style along with the regular voice actors.Aside from red hood and I suppose crisis on two earths, the dc Warner's direct to DVD releases have been mediocre, uninspired, and honestly somewhat boring.The whole pg-13 thing just makes these projects too heavy and somewhat depressing and needlessly violent to justify the rating.The fact the brave & bold and young justice were/are so entertaining seems to prove that dc characters fare best with an ongoing series, where a 75 minute cartoon or even a 2 hour live action film just doesn't serve them well ( Nolan batman movies excluded)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very underwhelming","review":"This was the DCAU's version of Mark Waid's STELLAR storyline \\"Tower of Babel\\". Tower of Babel involves a villain team using Batman's protocols for defeating the JLA against the team. It's a BRILLIANT idea. It setup years worth of stories, eventually culminating in Infinite Crisis. The whole point of the story was to create tension in the team. Batman was right to create back-up plans to defeat his fellow leaguers... But they should've talked about it. The result was a long standing air of distrust amongst a team of the World's most powerful superbeings.This movie, \\"Doom\\", took the central aspect of the storyline it was based on... and resolved the problem in 5 minutes. The rest of the movie was a by-the-numbers hero team vs. villain team. It SUCKED.

The movie is loosely based on Mark Waid's well-received 'Tower of Babel' storyline. It's dramatic, gripping and thought provoking. I don't want to spoil the story because I can not compare the DVD to the comic book without revealing too many details from both. However there are quite a few changes & alterations from the original source material which appear to be done just to coincide with the reboot of DC's Justice League comic book series.

Once the Whirlygirl played by Monet Mazur (Torque, 40 Days & 40 Nights) leaves James soon finds out that she has taken a valuable watch from him. So, he asks the head of the school if he can leave to go get the watch and he'll return before curfew. James tracks down the Whirlygirl at her apartment in which he soon starts to fall for her (as usual). Interesting look but there's nothing really here to get excited about. Mazur is beautiful and Morris gives a dull performance. Also starring Daniel Franzese (Bully, Mean Girls) and a surprising appearance by David Garrison (Married With Children, Op Center) as one of Mazur's customers. Well it was surprising to see him but he didnt have that much to do really.

And its cute seeing all the same goofy monsters from the TV show put into this game. And the basic idea of the game is simple enough for young kids to enjoy, but not too simple to entertain.The bad: In spite of the cool 3-D graphics, its still esentially a 1-D game because you only have the choice of going forward or backwards on what is usually a pretty narrow path. So if you can't figure out how to solve a task along the path, there's really nothing else to do. For the money I much prefer Mario Sunshine or even Rugrats, because my kids can always find something else to do even if they are stumped on a task. The content is \\"E\\" for everybody, but I think you'll need to be a \\"T\\" to get very far in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointing","review":"This game is, in my opinion, terrible. I found it vaguely amusing for the first...five minutes, but after that it was all downhill. The graphics are decent and the controls are easy to learn, but the game just feels like a task. Jump onto this platform, get the scooby snack there, jump on this monster here and Zoiks! What a monotonous nightmare. The levels are in a linear format that is often frustrating and makes some camera angles awkward. Collecting \\"scooby snacks\\" gets annoying, and you see the same monsters over and over again. The voiceovers are great, but what good is a voiceover if the game is weak?People who might like this game:~Kids just learning how play play video games~Diehard scooby fansPeople who might not like this game:~Everybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Laughs","review":"My kids are finally old enough where they want to learn to play video games.

Beautiful graphics, original voice characters and even a laugh track. There are some areas that are difficult for my boys to get past and even hard for me at times, but if you can be patient, then there shouldn't be a problem. There's a lot of great features to this game that my whole family has enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and dreary","review":"I confess I didn't get very far on this game before I quit and put it up for sale, but I intensely dislike games where you have to go back to an area and finish it after you've acquired additional skills somewhere else. And the camera angles are really bad. It's difficult to position Scooby for jumps and you can't see some areas you think you need to. I went to the mansion, the playground, the fishing village, the vault, and some area that might have been a cemetery and apparently the sun never comes out in Scoobyland because each level was dark and dreary. After I earned a warp power, it turned out there was no place I could warp to. Very frustrating. And you don't have much directional control of Scooby when he's supposed to be swinging on something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annoying, difficult, and slow","review":"We just got our Gamecube, so we are pathetic gamers. I rented this game to make sure that the 6 yr. old could do it. Nightmare. We have had it for 5 days and only completed 25% of the game. If you don't line up Scooby just right, he falls off things or doesn't make the jump. You have to complete all parts of a area before saving. So if you are stuck in a hard part of the game, forget it. You have to keep trying to make it through so that you can save. OR give up and redo the easier sections over again at a later time. The 6 yr old loves Scooby but gets bored as I struggle to get Scooby to the next section.

It's challenging, has a nice plot, takes a fair amount of time to complete, and has some comical elements as well. Some areas of the game are so challenging they're frustrating, and you'll be so happy when you get through it you'll quickly run to a mystery machine to save the game so you don't have to go through it again. It challenges you to think about how to get some of the monster tokens and some of the scooby snacks. The puzzles aren't super difficult, but they do give a fair amount of difficulty. i really like the cut scenes in the game; they remind me so much of the cartoon and they're cool. The only thing that keeps me from giving the game a perfect 5 stars is that all of the bosses (except for the mastermind) are too easy to defeat. everything else about the game is exceptional. The game is definitely worthy for buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best scooby doo game ever!!!","review":"I've played them all, but only this one gives me the nostalgia of the original show!

I also had to add a spacer on the \\"locking knob\\" that holds the leg pegs on the at the bottom because it too had different threads than the bolt. (It would not tighten even halfway.)

Her greatest claim to fame was being in the opening credits and singing \\"FOR YOUR EYES ONLY\\" in the smash 007 James Bond hit of the same name. With her Angelic voice and extream good looks she was the pop hit of the 80's and may also be remembered for her Duet hit with Kenny Rogers \\"We've got Tonight\\" Although the Album may be a little scarce, it was well worth obtaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story. Almost as good as A Fire Upon the Deep","review":"A very good sci-fi story. Not quite as good as his last novel, but a very good tale all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugo award for 1999 (at least, so far)","review":"I enjoyed \\"A Deepness in the Sky\\", and consider it nearly equal to \\"A Fire Upon the Deep\\". (I'd have to re-read AFUD to decide which is better.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Science Fiction Book Ever Written","review":"I read this book for the first time shortly after it came outlast year, and over a year later I'm still reading it. Since I readit for the first time, I've read Star Tide Rising, Stranger in a Strange Land, Farenheit 451, The Uplift War, and Ender's Shadow, and somehow this gem always keeps me coming back for more. The plot seamlessly combines three seemingly unrelated stories (Pham Nuwen's quest for power, the Emergent attack on the Qeng Ho, and the struggle on Arachna), although each on its own would still make Deepness more than worth reading. This book is better than A Fire Upon the Deep - in fact, it's better than any science fiction book written in the past ten years -- or ever. A must-read for anyone even remotely interested in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-Fi!","review":"This is my idea of great science fiction- new ideas and thoughts, an epic scale and setting, characters that actually develop and change, and are complex (although the bad guys do have a bit of a Dirk Dastardly tint), and situations that are not always black-and-white. My only complaint is the ending, which is an orgy of good happily triumphing over evil in such an overwhelmingly sappy way it was almost Scooby-Dooian in nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the OnOff Star, Off mostly","review":"Reading this book filled me with desperation - it was way too long. My guess is that Vinge must have been paid by the word. Also, it is really hard to believe (and, yes, I know this is science fiction!) that any human civilization this homicidal and avaricious would make it to Mars, never mind to another star. That is, this novel gives two and only two motives for interstellar travel: to peddle wares or to conquer and plunder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly terrible book","review":"Do not bother with this book -- it will be a waste of your time. If you like books with incredibly complex (and oftimes incomprehensible) milieus, try Iain M. Banks. If you like a touch of humor mized with action, try Charles Stross. If you like the in-depth human factor, try L.E. Modesitt. If you like a good, thought-provoking read, try David Brin. My book collection stands at about 1,000 and this Vinge was one of the worst. Full disclosure -- I could only get through Part One (about 170 pages); the last few pages of that section were so disappointing and illogically contrived that I simply could not go on and finish the remaining 600 pages. I gave it one star because the concept was fascinating, but the execution was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting to the point takes 85% of the book","review":"The story unfolds slowly, you read through most of it getting a mesh of names, things that happen, and background feel.You arrive to the \\"climax\\", and start to grasp what is happening, suddenly people make sense and the story unfolds.Both there is little to this story to make it more than an interesting idea.Sorry I didn't have fun reading this book, I kept reading as I like the author, and I was hoping things would change.Too bad it didn't.Hope you enjoy it more than I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelllent world building","review":"Like Vinge's other books, I found this to be not ideal for light bedtime reading (the way the book is written requires you to pay attention and think about what you're reading to get the full effect), but it was excellent. Multiple plot-lines, the inclusion of many characters that aren't obvious \\"good guys\\" or \\"bad guys\\", several complex yet understandable human and non-human cultures, and a good exploration of the murky ethical delimas of advancing technology all combine to create a well-woven web. Highly recommended to anybody looking for a non-formulaic SF tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Good","review":"This is an incredibly fun, interesting book that is both well written and intellectually compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deepness","review":"I have never read any other books by Vernor Vinge, so I don't really know how it compares. And though I've read a lot of sci-fi, I probably haven't read as much as many of you. But I've never read any book as good or compelling. This novel *is* long, but it reaches far and touches deep. It's true that there is no new funky science we haven't seen elsewhere. The characters are, in fact, similar to heroes and villians which we've all come to love and hate. But Vinge seems to understand much better than any of our new, young writers the elements of suspense and plot, the magic of enigma and epiphany. But most of all, Vinge understands the most noble, powerful, and difficult of all virtues: patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Many Hours to Read...","review":"\\"So high, so low, so many things to know.\\" For some reason, of all the poetry in Vernor Vinge's masterpiece, that is my favorite phrase. And indeed, A Deepness in the Sky is an instant classic. The book was both exciting, and had many subtleties that demanded repeated reading. The characters were believeable and the book's setting was fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read, but wait for the paperback, if you can.","review":"A good long read. A little jumpy, expecially if you read a little each day. One of those stories told from a multiple of persectives where you always want to get back to the other and then when you do you want to get back to the other. Very hard to put down, many a long night and longer days waiting to continue. Sherkaner (spider) and his family were well characterized. I had no problem imagining Anachna (the spider world) and its on/off star (200 years of darkness and cold/50 years of light and warmth). You have the two human sides The Qeng Ho (good) and the Emergents (evil). All in all a great cast of characters vividly portrayed in a suspensful page turning story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This Book First","review":"Until I read the reviews here, didn't realize this was the prequel to another book. That would explain my problem with \\"Deepness\\". Not only was it confusing, I really didn't care about any of the characters. Were parts of the book good? Absolutely. Did it drone on too long. Yes! Except for the spiders, I found myself not caring if everyone else died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a fiction..","review":"Truly it is just a fiction.. Too much of feminism leaves the science behind. Don't buy if you want to read a true science fiction. Golden Age has a lot more to offer. Read Stanislaw Lem instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Long and slow developing. To be fair I gave up on it about 1/3 of the way through. I had very high expectations after reading \\"A Fire Upon the Deep\\". Wow, what a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too deep---way too long!","review":"OK, I suppose this must be a great book, if all of the awards it has received are on the money. Problem is, I thought is was boring as heck. It moves at a snail's pace, and the characters are not all that interesting. The first two hundred pages held my interest, but then the plot became transparent. Even with the switching around from world to ship to world, everything just bogged down. I had to go into skim and scan mode to get by the next few hundred pages and then fast scan and burn to turn got me through the rest of it. NOT recommended unless you are into a long long slow moving read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This is an overlong book made worse by sloppy writing. The same distant, cold style is used for both technical descriptions and supposedly ardent human interactions. It's like reading one of those pseudo-English user manuals that come with overseas audio equipment. The reader is left clueless as to which characters/ideas are important and which aren't. Everything is painted with the same brush. Combine that with less substance than can sustain a long novel and tedium sets in very soon. I admit I gave up on the book after 300 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissappointment","review":"I was very much looking forward to this book as I had just reread Fire Upon the Deep for the third time. Unfortunately, this book doesn't live up the galaxy-wide richness and imagination of FUTD -- not even close. The characters are hackneyed and the plot is drawn out beyond my tolerance. The spiders are so anthropomorphic as to be embarrassing.Ho Hum. Wait for the paperback if you have to read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"simply brilliant.His characters are very realistic and his aliens are strange and real at the same time.this book was a very satisfying and absorbing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, not so great Kindle formatting","review":"This book is great but the kindle formatting is pretty bad, there are letters out of alignment, the phrase \\"it was\\" is rendered as \\"tas\\" nearly all the time, which brings you out of the action to try and figure out what the text is saying. Disappointing from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will be known as one of the classic SF novels","review":"This book is engaging on many levels. The one I found most clever was the way the author humanized the extremely alien \\"spider\\" race, and then later completely justified doing so. Brilliant!The villian, Tomas Nau, was extremely evil - and made even more chilling by his plesant outward nature. I thought it quite a portrait of the evil lurking in the real world, fully realized and fleshed out. It kept the tension level high.The vast canvas Vinge used to paint this story was breathtaking. It reminded me of classic Asimov, but better. More engaging. Filled with wonder and depth, and lots of detail without being bogged down in it.Yes, I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Sci-Fi books I've ever read!","review":"I've been reading and enjoying sci-fi books since I was little, and this book is easily one of the top 5 sci-fi books I ever read in my life! I highly recommend it to both sci-fi genre veterans and neophytes. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engrossing Story","review":"I am an avid science fiction reader. I found this to be a very engrossing story. It was hard to put the book down. My only complaint is that some of the major characters were one dimensional and one of them had a pretty rapid, not to well justified change in direction. A well thought out, well paced, unpredictable story. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful on many levels","review":"I loved this book; I bought it immediately when it came out, then did not stop reading it until I finished.Others have reviewed the plot; and I won't do that. What I keep going back to, in my mind, is his history of civilization that is in the background of this book. The thousand years between now and the setting of this book is unsettling, disturbing, and completely believable. The fact that 'programming' of that day is almost completely archaeology is also just right.Read this book. Then read the rest of Vinge -- you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but good","review":"Hard to believe he can fit all that story in just under 800 pages! Yeah, that's sarcasm. That being said, I don't know what he could have cut out... maybe the epilogue but that is only a few pages.Good book, good story, well written, I would recommend. I am not going to spoil the end but one of the bad guys is in for one hell of a ride at the end ; )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful novel by Vinge","review":"Once again Vernor Vinge, author of \\"A Fire upon the Deep\\", weaves a tight, thrilling tale of slavery, tyranny, and misdirection.The story tells the tale of the Qeng Ho traders and the Emergent dictators as they meet at an unusual star system, both expecting to exploit it. It is also the story of the inhabitants of that star system; a species of spiders just emerging into a technological age.Once again Vinge spins the details of an alien culture with such precision and detail that they become real to the reader.I'm pretty hard of novels, I tend to easily become annoyed with poor writing, grammar, and plot. So, when I give a novel 5 stars, IMHO it REALLY deserves it. Very satisfying, very deserving of its Hugo Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deepness in the book","review":"Very good read of what star faring society would be like. At the same time a good reverse first contact yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking and Original.","review":"The other reviewers have covered the plot better than I can but I felt I should leave my thoughts on the subject as I want as many people to enjoy this book as much as I have.Vernor Vinge is my new best friend! I have been familiar with the name for some time then I purchased a few books from the list of Hugo and Nebula award winners. This book won the Hugo Award and I can see why. It is, from start to finish, a thoroughly engrossing story. Vinge manages to create two entirely original storylines that parallel each other and culminate in the two comming together in a truly surprising ending. The characters are vivid and well developed, especially the arachnids and their civilization.I have read \\"A fire upon the Deep\\" and it is equally a winner. He is a very clever Author and I look forward to reading his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupendous","review":"One of the perhaps five best SF novels I've ever read, and I've read many. I liked Vinge's \\"Fire Upon the Deep\\" (which won the Hugo in 1993) tremendously, and I actually bought this book -- a prequel, though a very different work set in a very different melieu -- in hardcover, which I do only rarely. These two books put together convince me that Vinge is the best SF writer working today, better even than greats like Larry Niven and Lois McMaster Bujold, whom I love to pieces. The book has it all: A tremendously imaginative world, beautiful writing, and complex and interesting characters. An absolutely splendid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Anyone who enjoyed \\"fire upon the deep\\" or Vinge's style will at least like this book.

Maybe I just got a dud..?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Lame Execution","review":"I'm a great admirer of the Residents' output, and enjoy much of their later work just as much as the early stuff. Also, I've come to appreciate that many of their albums (such as The Big Bubble) require a number of listens before they truly grow on me. Tweedles, however, stands apart in that the more I hear it, the more I dislike it. I think the concept (the sexual vampire) is great, and the alleged backstory behind the album's creation is also a wonderful yarn. Unfortunately the songwriting and production suck. The fact is, the sound is way too glossy and slick; trendy instead of trend-setting. Even the passages of music that sound great are completely undermined by the unimaginative spoken word narrative that scars every song.

We played the CD 4 times on that trip, every time we heard a cut we would have different comments on the same song. Each time you listened you heard something you had not heard the time before.

Good vocals, good instrumentation, and great writing. Susan Werner takes on all comers - phony evangelists, exclusionary fundamentalism, and the boys club mentality of the Catholic Church.

The first chapters focus on the history of the Big Sur region; from Spanish Colonial days, through the American Period up the the construction of Hwy 1. She explains, in detail the conections between the significant figures in Big Sur history and how their lives affected the region.The latter chapters focus increasingly on her own life in Big Sur. Wall begins with life as a child in the wilderness through the time of the construction of Hwy 1 to the rediscovery of the California Sea Otter. After this point Wall sadly leaves the reader without more insight into the modern development of Big Sur and with it the fates of it's characters.Perhaps more time could have been spent on covering the whole Big Sur coast, but her insights into pre-highway life are very important to understanding the Big Sur of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Big Sur visitors...","review":"For anyone preparing to vacation at Big Sur, this book is a charming and compelling introduction to the \\"pioneers\\" of the coast, and to the Indians who preceeded them. In a warm, lively, personal and energetic style, Ms. Wall tells you fascinating stories of the 1800's and pre-Highway 1 Big Sur, always attempting to separate lore from fact, but reveling in both. She is also wonderfully sensitive to the \\"presence\\" and spirit of Big Sur, and tells compelling stories of protecting lights and \\"small brown people\\".

Several other labels reissue without cutting songs off. They did this with Johnny Rivers, Don McLean, etc. One would think they would reissue on CD with all the songs from the original album. NOT. Shame on EMI for this. Bring on the full greatest hits album, not a reissue of an abridged LP version.

Hubbard did it. Living in a small mountain town myself, the layers of secrets that fictional Trout Run hides are totally believable, and the disclosure of them is satisfying. Every one of the characters stands out as a real and distinctive person, including Janelle, the teenager who disappears before we ever meet her but then gains shape and substance until her fate matters as much to the reader as to the town and its tenacious police chief, Frank Bennett. This is an impressive debut.

I used the included stop nut with an optional locking hitch pin and upon removal, it seized on the pin, forcing a lot of work to cut the pin in order to remove the hitch. That is unrelated to the hitch, but try using a regular 3/4\\" nut with a lock washer on the pin instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I purchased this bike rack in January to carry bikes on the back of my travel trailer. I had been used 4 times successfully but the 5th time was not a charm. One of the bolts that the arms pivot up and down on broke as I was driving on the highway. I heard tire chirping and got out to see what the noise was, when I came around the back I saw my bicycle, which was on the outside, hanging down to the road and the back tire had been jumping up and down on the road as I was driving. The other two bikes were ok. One bolt had sheared in half and the other held.If you have this rack or are thinking about buying it, you might think about removing these bolts and replacing them with hardened bolts (which these are not).A bolt remover was unsuccessful.

Whether or not this is actually true we don't know, but I suspect that it is pretty much accurate.

Unskinny Bop is probably the most played of the songs on this album on the radio today and this album is worth obtaining for that great song alone.This album contains a mixture of fast catchy rock style songs and ballads and some songs which start off as ballads then get faster. There is even a blues type song in here, the last one Poor Boys Blues.If you like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, AC/DC and similar bands then you have to listen to Poison as well.

This is the largest amount of aquatic turtle food that I have found availible and buying in bulk really helps out the wallet. I recommend the pellet shape as opposed to the sticks, because they can be eaten in one bite. When the turtles eat the sticks, they tend to break them in pieces and that gets their water dirtier much quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you feel like cleaning your tank more","review":"This food dirtied my tank 3x as fast as other kinds of food.

She asks you to inhale when contracting and exhale when expanding making it extremely difficult to focus on the breath. She begins to describe movements when she's already more than halfway into them on screen so you are always slightly behind her. At other times, she describes movements and cuts to the musician leaving you with no idea of what she is describing. She takes regular asanas and renames them. I am very disappointed and wish I had been able to preview it before I wasted the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This video is nothing like I expected. From the previous reviews I thought it would be enjoyable and relaxing. Shiva Rea goes at a fast pace and is constantly talking, but doesn't do a good job of describing the moves. I would look away from the TV for a second to see if I could do the moves by just listening to her, and then when I looked back I was always on the wrong move. I'm not a stupid person and have done yoga many times. I am shocked by all the great reviews and willing to give this video another shot just because I really wanted to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As the spirit moves you","review":"Shiva Rea is amazing but this DVD is not for regular practice. I use it to spice up my daily practices with the moves she offers, but I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner. For one thing, she rarely offers other levels of moves than the one really complicated one she is doing right now. Also, the good old sun (and moon) salutations are somewhat obscured by additional dancing, which can be confusing. It's as if Isadora Duncan was incorporating yoga into her dance. Not a bad thing, but not really what I want to do everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast, too little of too much","review":"The inside of the DVD cover has a disclaimer saying that due to the amount of video she wanted to put on the DVD and the constraints of space, the yoga is much faster than she would teach in a class. For one, it makes it really difficult to move from one asana to the next, plus you don't stay in them once you get into them. I felt like she spent a lot of time on things that were less essential and I didn't find a really good practice amongst all the options. I bought this DVD for the options, and I have been practicing yoga for 15 years, but, while some of the movements are interesting, I do not like this DVD simply bc I do not feel like there is a straight forward succinct practice on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome and inspirational","review":"Very inspirational, especially if you've been practicing for some time and have started to get a bit bored or burnt out on your same old classes and same old routine. Beautiful setting and very helpful verbal adjustments throughout. I also purchased her Prenatal Yoga DVD which was good but did not fully demonstrate her power as an instructor. Also, this DVD shows variations up to very advanced poses, so should prove challenging and engaging for both the beginner as well as more advanced students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive DVD","review":"I absolutely love this DVD. I am very picky when it comes to yoga. I like a challenge, and I like to feel like I've earned my corpse pose at the end! This DVD does not fail. You are constantly moving. The first time through a practice, you may need to stop and watch, but after that, you don't even need to watch her, you can just listen to her with cues for the moves. I own many yoga DVDs and this is the best one so far. Shive Rea is amazing. My own personal goal is to be able to be uber flexible in my back, and as a gymnast in my youth, I am hoping this is attainable. Her back bending sequence really does a lot for the back and the spine. I also love the fact that she includes some meditiation in the beginning, but if you don't like this feature, you can fast forward to the good stuff. Excellent DVD, a must for your yoga library."},{"rating":"1","title":"a \\"unique\\" style of \\"dance movement\\" - that incorporates yoga","review":"Unfortunately this foam roller is not the high quality cast foam roller that you see in the gyms. It looks like it is, on the photo. It is made of tiny little Styrofoam pieces, that all look like they are about to fall apart, and can easily be damaged. It does not look like it will last, without getting lots of 'chips', and 'holes' in in very quickly after a few uses... It is nice and long, and very dense, but the construction lacks any durability. i am very disappointed!! I got black thinking it would be somehow more durable than the blue ones.. Boy am I sorry!! The description does not state it is made of tiny styrofoam pieces, not the \\"foam\\" rollers you see at the gym. This one will soon have so many divots that it will impede the function! I'm going to make some kind of protective cover in the hopes it will last longer!

It uses a lot of Yoga vocabulary so I had to constantly watch the TV to know what to do because I couldn't tell just from the audio. I consider myself flexible but not particularly graceful like a dancer and I had a difficult time keeping up with the fast pase. This DVD is not bad but just be aware that it is not for beginner to moderate. I would consider it very advanced and you'd better know your vocab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird","review":"I really like yoga, but this is just a bit too weird for me.

I find the sessions go a bit fast for a beginner; but practice should resolve that. I love the fact that there are both predesigned practices and a matrix where you can put together your own. The matrix makes for a flexible practice that doesn't get old or boring, and can be adjusted to fit the time you have available. Overall, I'm very happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat, pray, SHIVA","review":"This DVD is worth every penny - over 4 hours of vinyasa in a matrix format! Shiva leads you in a quiet, soothing voice through her workout which is set in a charming desert, among other places. You get to mess with a matrix which allows you to pick which poses you want to team together and which part of your body you'd rather do. Additional meditation clips are also included.However, the most important thing is how you feel once you work with her through just 1 or 2 clips! She has an amazing way of relaxing you while working your every muscle with these poses!! I highly recommend her. If you want just one, do her Shakti DVD though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was wanting!","review":"This yoga dvd brought so much more to my practice and I would 100% recommend it! The matrix is awesome: it keeps each day fresh and new and is so easy to use. I also really like the music only option. I plan on buying more Shiva Rea as soon as I can, though I have come nowhere near close to exhausting this dvd and probably never will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great interactive dvd moves are a little advanced for beginners","review":"This is a very good interactive dvd which allows you to custom your workout based on skill level, time, and problem areas. Some of the moves are hard to follow as a beginner but it will challenge you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as in love as with her Daily Energy DVD...yet","review":"I would definitely say this is not a beginning yoga DVD. Yet, it is beautiful and different and very expressive, working in yogic poses creatively. Music is tribal and inspiring of free form. I was ready for a change and I found it in Shiva Rea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"One of the standards of Brazilian Rock in the 80 and 90s, Legiao Urbana rarely put out anything bad. V, I would rate as either their best or second-best (As Quatro Estacoes- The Four Seasons is also exceptional). With an introspective melancholy that is atypical of most Brazilian music, Legiao's chief lyricist (the late Renato Russo) deals with issues of mortality, sexuality, love, loss and most of all spirituality. While the moods of the songs are as flighty and dark as those of the Cure, Legiao Urbana display a sophisticated minimalism in their instrumentals as if to emphasize the lyrics they are singing. On top of all that, LU captures what it's like to live in Brazil during hard times between the lines of songs such as 'O Teatro dos Vampiros' (Theatre of the Vampires)and 'Serenisima' (Very Serene).Altogether this CD is a must-have for anyone who loves Portuguese-language rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"splitline membrane trimmer line","review":"Couldn't find this product in the local stores altough I purchased the trimmer at Home Depot.

Their cover of Minnie the Moocher would make Cab Calloway proud. The rest of the songs are toe-tappin' originals written and performed by eight amazingly talented musicians. The Big Bad Voodoo Daddies are the best swing band around - and if you have a chance to see them live, don't miss it. It's great to go see a band that is obviously enjoying themselves as much as their audience is."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBVD does well, but doesn't have feel of Setzer","review":"This release by teh new group BBVD is a good mix of good smooth swing, but sometimes with a rock-ahead feel.Lots of good instrumentation, and not too many vocals.Doesn't have the swing guitar of Setzer which adds a certain flavor to the music, but really gets teh job done with outstanding instrumental solos.A must have for all of us new swing collectors"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy!","review":"Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is a cool CD with music that will get you back into a happy mood!

The lyrics are clean and I souly suggest that if you want swing music, add this to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Livin in the shadows","review":"In recommending this album, there are a couple of things I want to say. Firstly, I am a huge fan of jazz, especially jazz you can dance to, and secondly, they just don't make it like they used to. This recording is awesome for the dance floor and enjoyable to listen to, but it just doesn't quite have the originality and genious of the old style swing, which, in my opinion, was a bit better to dance to. But hey, like I said, anything that can get my feet movin' is part of the club, and while this band isn't necessarily the fountain of originality, it sure knows how to jive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best retro swing band ever!","review":"You have probably heard of retro swing bands like Brian Setzer Orchastra, and Cherry Popin Dadys. Well I'm here to tell you that Big Bad Voodoo Daddys are by far the best retro swing band ever! They have such a variety of songs. They are a real retro swing band, starting out playing in clubs. Other retro swing bands were popular before then decided to start playing retro swing to make a come back. The Big Bad Voodoo Daddys are a kickin swing band so get their CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific album! The best Swing Band I've heard.","review":"BBVD take the Swing style from the 40s and give it a 90's kind of excitement and energy. Definitely not a CD to listen to just before going to bed!

On the contrary YOU dont know what swing is. \\"I expect hatemail\\", hopefully you got flooded.This group has amazing vocals, superior to cherry poppin daddies. The album has a great beat to it. You and me and a bottle makes 3 tonight is very well made and catchy song. Boogie bumper is an excellent song to start the album with. And of course, the famous \\"Go Daddy O!\\" is their poster song. All in all BBVD has a great beat and I still enjoy it. You have to be dead if this group doesnt get you moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"I've alway's loved Swing, but never got a CD until now.

My personal favorite is Please Baby and Mambo Swing!Don't hesitate to get this CD! Yes, it's *THAT* good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Neo-Swing Music!","review":"BBVD is all around the best swing band if you want to dance.

Come on, they played at the Super Bowl! They rule. Swing Heil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best swing CD I've ever heard!!!!!!","review":"This CD is excellent. The music is very strong, and the lyrics are brilliant. This CD is perfect to listen to while driving. The energy of the horn section is apparent.

I recommend this CD for anyone who likes Swing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing is back and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's got it!","review":"Thank God for real music! The revival of 'swing' by contemporary artists such as BBVD has opened up this great music to an entire generation of young music fans who are now getting an earful of what real music ought to be. BBVD, Brian Setzer Orchestra, Cherry-Poppin Daddies, and Royal Crown Revue are all putting out some really terrific sounds with a swing beat, and this CD is at the top of the pack. If you want to check out what all the ruckus about 'swing' is today, buy this CD and let BBVD show you. It's a five-star performance! Greetings from Count Basie's Home Town."},{"rating":"2","title":"These cats are SMOKIN'","review":"Moving with seeming ease from classics like Minnie the Moocher to the incredibly danceable Mambo Swing this release from BBVD marks a high standard in the swing revival. The singer, horns, strings and percussion meld together to evoke images of both the bright lit bandstand and smoky corners I imagine existed in the swing era dance clubs. Located away from meccas of the swing revival I migrated to BBVD after devouring the Squirrel Nut Zippers collection and Zoot Suit Riot from the Cherry Poppin Daddies. While BBVD can't be compared with either of those groups in a strict sense, the musicality and performing strength of this BBVD recording placed it above all others at the top of my CD play list! Grab you voodoo hats and get a cool kitty on your arm because these Daddies are SMOKIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump With Big Bad Voodoo Daddy!","review":"Big Bad Voodoo Daddy are not of pioneers of Neo-Swing, but they made it big.

Sortly before midnight on Aug 17, 1959, the tectonically unstable Yellowstone area gave a shiver that measured 7.8 on the Richter scale, and a hillside slid down upon sleeping campers at West Yellowstone, Mt., and at the same time, a 20-ft wall of water slopped over a dam and rolled down upon the same campground. 28 people lost their lives. In 2006 I rolled up to the South Entrance from Grand Teton into Yellowstone, and while looking at the map of Yellowstone, I suddenly remembered the morning of August 18, 1959: My family had traveled from the Seattle area, across BC & into Alberta, and was at Glacier National Park that week when my Mother came down sick with some sort of sickness caused by thin air & altitude. We were disappointed when Dad had to call and cancel our reservation for the 17th....at that campground in West Yellowstone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Great book for those in the nursing field.

They usually make very elegant, impressive diamond watches. But this particullar one was somewhat dull, the diamonds were so tiny that you could not even see any blick at all. Plus they were way smaller in diameter than you would think by looking at the picture. I guess, for a price it was a match but I was hoping to get much more for a steal. Did not work out :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true story with all the suspense and thrills of a novel","review":"Colonel JE Corbett - hunter, naturalist and writer. This is his story of how the most notorious man-eating leopard in India was shot. The tale is recounted in an easy flowing style that captivates the reader. In the book one gets an insight into life in rural India in the mid-1920's. Colonel Corbett also manages to bring across his empathy for nature.All the ingredients of a suspense thriller and a horror movie is there. The hunter becomes the hunted, the bravery of people under the constant threat of a man-eater and the terror of loved ones dragged out of their homes by the leopard. Many a time when reading the Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag, I felt the hairs at the back of my neck rising.Best of all the story is true. In the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh a memorial has been erected that says \\"At this spot Colonel JE Corbett shot the man-eating leopard of Rudraprayag\\". The memorial still stands to this day. I have seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag","review":"An extraordinarily insightful, gripping and vivid description of what life must have been like when people were at the mercy of a maneater. As in all his books, Corbett showed a gift for writing his memoirs. They are thrilling in their matter-of-fact, understated way. His knowledge and love of the Indian people, the jungle and its animals was unusual for a white man of his era. I don't know of another who put it in writing so well. That his books are not widely read by kids anymore is very sad. Corbett's fine character and sensitivity are a lesson to us all and to boys in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag","review":"This is a great book to read. Colonel Edward James Corbett's narrative is a spensive true story about a man-eating leopard that terrorized 50,000 pilgrims in the Grawal District in India by killing over 125 people. For 18 years from 1918 until 1926 he stalked the hills of India. Unlike the other classics that Corbett wrote, this is only one story that is full of leopard information and it truly is a great man-eater story that is one of the best that we have to read. The book never ceases to amaze me when I read it. It is truly a page turner. Leopards are beautiful animals, but when they turn man-eater then it can be the worst and I think this book proves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality stinks!","review":"If you don't mind reading a book that you can see both sides of the page at once, this one's for you!

It's a 250 page whine about growing up with parent who have no money. Dellman is the daughter of an Ashkenazi Jew and an Indian Bene Israel Jew, so she's a minority within a minority group. There have been other autobiographies about similar lives, but this is by far the worst. She doesn't focus on any particular incident in her life that would illustrate her struggle. She just moans on and on about not having what other kids have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Culturally intriguing as expected","review":"This book was definitely a quick read and very interesting as the other reviewers have stated. The only \\"issue\\" I had with this book is that there were a bit too many sensual allusions that seemed were meant to appeal to a trash novel reader. I expected this book to speak of much more \\"Bene-Israel\\" traditions but instead it addressed mostly the rebellion of the writer against tradition and not much specifics on the traditions.I do give this book 4 stars though since it encaptured me immensely but not 5 stars since I expected it to be more wholesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a MUST READ- go out and get it now!","review":"This is one of the most superb books that I have read in a long time. The imagery and extraordinary writing bring Delman's compelling life story to life for the reader.If you are interested in learning about life on the fringes of mainstream American culture/ society, or if you are simply interested in a riveting human story, filled with humor, drama, elegance and raw human emotion, or if you have an interest in the American Jewish community and its ability to welcome and reject its own people, I highly recommend this book to you.Carmit Delman has the talent to become one of her generation's greatest writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Uninspiring","review":"I would not recommend this book - it is trite and uninteresting.

Not me, I personally feel this is one of their strongest albums. What makes one an artist is art, doing what you want to do, not what the media wants you too, or what will make you the most amount of money (ie. commercial music).

They have been my favorite band for five years, and I cringe with empathetic shame every time I hear this recording. I like the samples from \\"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,\\" a very cool 1969 Russ Meyer T&A camp-fest. The samples are,in fact, this album's only redeeming quality. I pray for a new album of Confessions-esque material. Buy 13 Above the Night or Confessions first."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad is it?.......","review":"This record is SO bad... that I didn't even go to see them when they toured it.

This album along with a later album they released A Crime For All Seasons were dissappointing. The retro 50s 60s acid lounge trip thing and the lyrics got annoying. The only song I enjoyed was \\"Portrait Of The Damned\\" only because I liked the lyrics and the beat and found it sexy. The rest of the songs and even the album cover are lame. I dont condemn them for trying something new but they shoulda stuck to their regulra sound cuz I feel they did a better job at it and mastered it. And Satan??I couldnt find nothing about Satan on here, just lyrics that made no sense, minus \\"Portrait Of The Damned\\". The reason it got 2 stars is cuz I dont hate the band and \\"Portrait Of The Damned\\" sounded tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another bomb","review":"Typical retro glam tripe that made me stop listening to them after \\"13 Above The Night.\\" They've lost their way and explains why they've lost band members.

So long as you're not repulsed by the overabundance of horns, it's a pretty decent album. Let me rephrase: there is nothing on this album that could be called \\"industrial.\\" The samples are pretty sparse, the guitars aren't usually distorted, and it's really upbeat for the most part.My favorite song on the album is \\"Portrait of the Damned\\" which has some pianos and horns as well as guitar. \\"Apollo 69\\" and \\"Babylon Drifter\\" are also worth mentioning. The booklet folds out to a cute mini-poster (given that your idea of \\"cute\\" involves a car surrounded by pills and reading \\"Drifting like a stoned dog, sister rebel outlaw...\\").Before buying this, I just have to warn you again about the horns and the happy vibe of this album. If that's ok with you, it's a good album with a lot of variety, proving again that the Kult are capable of just about anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, it's different, but it's still great","review":"Yeah, this album is different from TKK's other stuff. But that doesn't mean it's not good! This CD kicks ass, it's cheesy swinging rock, with a witty style and a lot of great songs. I would definitely recommend it; this album has a lot of really great stuff on it. If you've never heard them before, you might like this album, but you should hear their other stuff (13 Above the Night, Confessions of a Knife). If you're a fan, check it out. You might be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Two player game!","review":"My husband and I enjoy board games and discovered this two player game by Reiner Knizia a while ago.

I keep hoping they will get back together, occasionally they get together for a show. Also there is a live album out there somewhere but I have never been able to get it. Rick Robertson the sax player has a group Eon Beat Project that is also very good.

The police detectives are complete dolts, ignoring leads and insulting victims and following no standard police procedure. (Did the detectives really leave the victim's purse, i.d., and handgun sitting untouched in plain view at the crime scene for several days after they found the body??). The villain is a cardboard cutout. The dialogue of the African-American characters is exactly what you would expect to be written by an author who was an elderly suburban white guy. The lead detective needs his pre-teen child to explain the internet to him (mind you the book was written in 2004, so the internet wasn't exactly a novelty).It occurred to me part-way through that the whole plot was inspired by the fact that the author was toodling around on the internet one day and stumbled across an anagram-creator and a Shakespeare quote-finder.

McMurtry does his usual job of excellent story telling in the first half of the book, and mixes in the bizarre, quite consistent with this series.It then seems as he decides he doesn't have the energy to keep going, and he fast forwards to the end. New characters are introduced, but never inspected; hundreds of miles are covered in a page or 2; and the book wraps up very quickly.In my opinion this was the weakest of the series and a disappointment. Not as many laughs, and a race to the finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointingly cruel tale","review":"I want to start out by saying Larry McMurty is one of my favorite writers and that I enjoyed the descriptions of the Berrybender travels across the 1830s West. I don't think anyone sets a western scene as well as he does. But I was put off by the abject cruelty of this final book in that nearly all the characters were either outwardly cruel to others or were buffoons. The child killing scene was totally unnecessary and disturbing, and all the native Americas were shown to be fools, wanton murders, or both."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Thin Western \\"Soap Opry\\"","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The novel is shallow, the characters are poorly developed, and the action is widely spaced between sickly sweet chapters devoted to the decadent and spoiled Berrybender women and their equally coddled children. The only similarity between this novel and the \\"Lonesome Dove\\" series is McMurtry's fascination with strong-willed women. I was always a bit confused by Gus' long dedication to Clara in that series; in this novel stubborness and assertiveness is elevated to a paramount virtue.

I liked this book for two reasons. 1)It reminded me of lost loves that I let get away for the dumbest reasons. What might have been? 2)Through this romantic tale it was great to learn all about those shootings at Kent State. Had heard about it, but it was great to learn some history about it, and to learn about in a gingerly-paced very entertaining read.

I really felt for the way the characters related during the college years, but, maybe more importantly, felt for how they relate now, after a life time has been spent apart. Apowerful love story with a powerful backgound. And real good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emotional Read","review":"Silent Bell is probably the greatest romance novel I have ever read. There is a lot of emphasis placed on the way the characters feel about eachother, and how they deal with what they do and do not have in common. Regardless of their differences, and the action that is going on around their university that affects them, the outcome is proof that love does conquer all. Stuart and Melina's story is so engrossing and believable, I was surprised to read that Silent Bell is a book of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible historical romance!","review":"I love this love story! I couldn't put it down! I read the whole book in one sitting---twice! Not only was I intriqued by the romance, but I was fascinated with the history and religious aspects as well. The characters are so intelligent and it was refreshing to read about a romantic couple with problems that involve so much more than the typical love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"ah!---an intelligent romance novel!","review":"Silent Bell is a wonderfully written tale of lost love and lost hope and how love can return to renew hope. I loved the way the story played out with the characters---Stuart and Melina---in present day considering meeting for the first time in 25 years, and then reliving through flashbacks their young romance on the campus of Kent State University the year The National Guard shootings happened. While a teriffic romance novel, its intelligent for two reasons: 1)the characters are intelligent with more on their minds than just their love connection, and 2)the story has more on its mind that just love too, with politics and philosophy woven into the background (even Jewish angst!). Quite simply, Silent Bell is real good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book for traveling.","review":"The Silent Bell provides a great combination of love and history. What a great accompaniment for my flight to Denver. This book is perfect for an airplane trip. I couldn't wait to turn the page to learn the fate of Stuart and Melina. This story lets you learn about the history of Kent State while feeling the joys and frustrations of budding love. I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut-wrenching love story","review":"Now that I'm done crying,let me say I found this a gut-wrenching love story. I wish there was more on Melina and what all of her thoughts were (is there a sequel?). But it was fascinating to read this male's first person account and to know that men do pine for woman and for past loves. The \\"Mel came to save me\\" line blew me away, because then he realized her love was worth more to him than those passionate nights in her dorm room! And then you really want to know how she might affect or change his life around 25 year later. I really like the back and forth, too: Stuart in his lifeless condo, flashing back to his vital life in 1969-70. Made for entertaining reading, and a late night discussion with my boyfriend (who's reading it now!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it","review":"This CD has worse than poor interface which maybe was good enough in 1990.

I wish.","review":"At first, I thought this was camp. The allusions to George Noory/Coast to Coast and Scientology made me laugh as did the \\"experts\\" describing the church and the \\"physics\\" of time travel. The neo-Nazi like church members and their flying car were the funniest of all.Then, to my horror, I realized that the movie was actually taking itself seriously. Think Ghost Hunters on SyFy. Like a friend of mine likes to say: \\"It was like a train wreck after that. I couldn't avert my eyes until the bitter end.\\"I've seen worse movies available on Amazon Instant Video (Pi), so I'll grade on a curve and give this two stars.

Like \\"Cloverdale\\", a decent plot was wasted by substituting mock amateur footage for a budget which just results in a sub-standard movie. Even so, it might have been better if the entire movie was done that way because the intercut still-camera interviews of \\"experts\\" were probably the worst part of the movie and a distraction to the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome - Quirky & Cool - a Geek's Paradise!","review":"Too much fun - totally unexpected.

The 3 of us watching it were almost insane with frustration by the last part of the movie, but we were NOT going to give up at the last 15 minutes. Why sit thru that torture just to wimp out in the last round. At the end, we were all screaming.. \\"Give it BAAAAAAAAACK!

The absolutely worst movie of all time.Do you remember the movies you made in 6th grade for arts class with the script you wrote in an afternoon and cinematography shot in a single day?

The acting is so bad that you can't for a minute loose yourself in the movie and forget that you're watching a middle-school production.How on earth did this turd end up on Amazon?

I was grossly misled by the hyper-positive reviews so I kept watching it hoping that I was missing something.

As delicious as a dessert. I am a big fan of L'Occitane's Almond line - I am completely addicted to their Almond Firming Lotion. What I love about Mistral's Almond Milk soap though, is that the scent lingers throughout the day. It is not strong or perfumy, but tender and natural smelling.The little bits of exfoliant added to the bar are great too. They don't scratch the skin or feel too gritty, no nasty residue on the bottom of your tub.This soap does not leave a greasy feeling. It lathers nicely and cleans very well. It is so soft it can even be used on your face.If you like the scent of Almond, I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almond???","review":"How disappointed we were at the quality of this soap.

At first I thought it was rather high, but you get a lot for what you spend. It suds up extremely well and smells excellent. It also last a very long time and it didn't irritate my skin at all.

Cameras came to be weather proof, don't believe it. Amazon is and was no help when I tired to return them. Manufacturer is and was no help when I tired to return them.

As usual, Gemmell's heroes are flawed individuals who not only battle the evil in the world, but the evil in themselves as well.

A wonderful fantasy... one that proves not every book needs a happy ending. (not a spoiler, believe me.

Alternatives like Plantronics are NOT compatible with this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice \\"Human design\\" and features, BUT speakerphone problems","review":"First let me say that the speakerphone produces plenty of volume, much better than most other phones I have tried. This was especially important since I often participate on nightly conference calls overseas where low receive level is often a problem.However, there is one major problem that might be related to poor design or manufacturing variation. (I have 3 of these phones). If another person picks up an extension in another part of the house while using the 972 speakerphone, the 972 speaker will cut in and out often introducing an annoying clicking sound for all parties listening. The amount of muting and clicking is differs significantly between the 3 phones I own. In the worst case, the speakerphone is totally muted and I can't hear anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I bought two of these phones for my home office. I thought the menu-driven interface was a nice touch, but it cannot overcome the poor sound quality of the handset. The microphone on the handset is hyper-sensitive. My S's hiss and my P's pop so loudly that it almost hurts, and it's distracting to hear myself breathing while listening to the other person. I'm returning this phone for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love AT&T products... but this one disappoints","review":"The AT&T; 972 has some nice features to talk about (nice button arrangement, easy to access incoming/outgoing calls list, programming speed dials, etc.). The big problem is that it falls seriously short in outgoing voice quality from the handset and/or the speakerphone. The incoming side seems to be fine on the handset and speakerphone, that is, you can hear them just fine. The problem is that people I call say that my voice sounds \\"tinny\\" or is \\"clipping\\" (cutting off the high frequencies) when I use the handset. Using the speakerphone, no one could understand me unless I spoke with my mouth right next to the speakerphone. Obviously, this will not work for anyone.So, I would not recommend this phone to anyone that needs to conduct a conversation over a speakerphone. It will not work and you will have wasted your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I had problem with this phoen from the beginning: Headset button not working, speaker now just cuts out.

All worst-case scenarios.","review":"This book does a huge disservice to the majority of adopted children who do just fine in their adopted families, with no more difficulties than birth children. The authors seem to feel that they need to present all the worst-case scenarios, but the fact is that a lot seems to have gone wrong with those they present, not JUST the bad luck of the adoptive parents. A much better book is Myra Alperson's International Adoption Handbook and Robin O. Sweet's book. Knowledge is power and you owe it to yourself and your child to be as well-informed as possible, but this book is more likely to scare parents off international adoption. That aside, it's a bit dated. The adoption procedures in many countries are now running far more smoothly and professionally. It's probably worth looking at if you are adopting from eastern Europe, but please check out some more balanced sources as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Complete Guide to Foreign Adoption","review":"The title and subtitle are misleading; this is not a guide to foreign adoption but rather a compendium of horror stories about the worst Romanian orphan case histories. The slant is negative, journalistically sensationalist, and repetitive. Although the subject is of interest, the book is not a guide to the process of adoption, and has very little helpful information to offer.The focus is on the authors' good works in Romania with special needs toddlers and the book offers very little practical advice to those interested in adopting healthy infants or children internationally. Look elsewhere for guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps good as applies to Eastern Europe, but nowhere else","review":"I felt that the title of this book was misleading, because though the authors gave a little attention to other regions, they focused mostly on Eastern Europe. International adoptions from Eastern Europe are a very different matter from adoptions from Asia, South/Central America, etc. For families adopting from other regions, a different book would better serve them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Say what you want but this album's a classic...","review":"This album brings you back to a time where you didn't need to be shot 9 times to get a record deal, it was actually about skills and not many mcs could rock a flow and show the way MC Hammer could, that's why this album sold over 10 million albums,youcan't deny tracks like \\"U Can't Touch This\\", \\"Pray\\", \\"Black Is Black\\", \\"Can U See Her\\"and \\"Save The Children\\",If you appreciate hip-hop music that's fun and has a message unlike a lot of the crap out today that promotes violence and negativity then this album's for you, buy this album and every other MC Hammer while you're at it, he's a legend, peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like Vanilla Ice!","review":"Years later I can't for the life of me understand what Iever seen in this!

This book was written between the time of Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. If you are unknown to Henry Miller, I highly recommend that you read Tropic of Cancer first. In this short but good book, Miller reflects on the gay time he has while he is home visiting New York and getting ready to travel back to Paris. His writting style is more like a journal than a novel. He speeks of the I. State building.. the travel back on board a ship over the Atlantic... About the complete emptiness the sea cause a person to have.. about the mindnumbing boredom of life.. The entire novel is just one long letter which he continues over an extended period of time. I am an avid fan of millers way of writting because I connect so much to it, I hope you do too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sloan Bishop Review","review":"This is a great MK game. It features modes such as Konquest mode, A mode were you learn how to fight with every charactor, The Krypt, a mode that you purchase various items, and Kontent, were you can view your items purchased.Pros:*Great graphics*Many charactors*Many cool extras, like the MK history*You can impale your weapons into you opponents to make them lose life faster.Cons:*The fatalities are extremely hard to perform*Moloch is hard to beat*Konquest can get repetative and hard*Unlocking certain charactors is expensiveStory:Quan Chi escaped from the Netherrealm and has joined forces with Shang Tsung. They are resurecting the mummified army of Onaga, the Dragon King. If the succeed, they will be unstoppable. Now you must defend earthrealm from this deadly alliance.If you love MK, buy this game.

After some disappointments, midway finally took the concept back to the ground and rebuilt it. The new fighting system is great. Every character has three fighting styles (one of those includes a weapon). Old characters return such as: Scorpion, Sub Zero, Sonya, Jax. New character emerge like: Frost, Malvado, Nitara. Even the fighting arenas have been revamped. Most of the arenas have interactive environments. Knock your opponent into a pilar and watch it crack and crumble. Even watch your opponent start to sweat, bleed, get his or her clothing ripped and most important of all die from the new and improved fatalities. For those of you who thought Mortal Kombat was dead think again. Deadly Alliance will resurrect the MK craze."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice game","review":"great game. lovly graphics. too much blood. still too much blood.

Your cleavage, face, and lovely buttocks all revealed as you kick, throw, and freeeeeze. You have the face of a snow angel, the deadly touch of frostbite, and the moves of a white tiger.Your back kick revealing your thong is my favorite move because your icy ghetto booty is large and firm. It's so well rounded, like an igloo. Your deadly X,X,Y,Y, up Y is a match for any attacker.

The graphic is very good and also the sound is enjoyable, but the voices of these characters are sometimes the same. These voices are not good enough but everything else is fantastic. My favourite fighters are Jax (Height: 6'6\\" 198cm), Johnny Cage (Height: 6'1\\" 185cm) and that sexy woman named Sonya Blade (Height: 5'10\\" 179cm). Sonya Blade is one of the best created fighter. Sometimes I doubt to Sonya if there is a real actor behind her. Also the actors of Sonya like Kerri Hoskins and Elizabeth Malecki are not ugly. Sonya Blade is the most sexy fighter in whole Mortal Kombat. Take Kitana and and make that Kiss of Doom against Sonya. Kitana's Fatality: down, up, forward twice and press triangle. You will see that her fatality will blow up Sonya until she explodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did Mortal Kombat get worse on PS2?????","review":"For the first time since Mortal Kombat 1 do we find ourselves with one finishing move per character (most of which [stunk] more than a weekend with richard simmons). They tried to make a three stance fighting system work with MK and failed, the addition of weapons might have impressed some people but all in all was a let down. Further more the lacking of background fatalities was another let down. The only redeeming factor for this latest installment was the graphics were pretty nice, and the crypt feature was a little cool at first. But all in all you'd be better off if you skipped this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fighting game!","review":"This game beats Virtual Fighter 4 and Tekken by a WIDE MARGIN.

Neither were the wolves made of squishy material so they didn't even squeak/howl when I pushed on them.Double gyp.Also, they said the the shirt would be slimming on my robust frame, but instead it made the bottom wolf look like it had an enormous neck.Not really a gyp on the last one... but it just looked weird.What might be cool is two wolves mating while the male wolf howls at the moon.

First, there were only TWO actual wolves and the third animal turned out to be a mangy coyote with only one ear. Not nearly as cool. Secondly, my shirt has a silk screen of Saturn, not the moon. Have you ever seen a wolf howl at Saturn? NO! WTF? Finally, the shirt was scratch and sniff, so you could actually smell the wolves' breath, which turned out to be a putrid mix of rotting deer flesh and old ham sandwiches scavanged out of somebody's trash.Do yourself a favor!

My life changed forever. I lost the weight (chemo might've helped), a truck ran over the damn cats, made a few friends who want me to buy all their booze tonight and I managed to speak to 3 women in one day (and I didn't even have to pay!).

So when my cousin took it off to flex his muscles for his sisters...the shirt became mine. Score.Later that day while strolling through the trailer park the chili kicked in moving at high speed, pressure, spicy and liquid. I had to go so I ducked behind a doorless Vega on cinderblocks and started shooting hot mud. After what seemed like 2 gallons, I realised I had no T.P., only answer was to use my cousins Three Wolf shirt. So I sopped up my backdoor with the Wolf-Moon and to my amazement, the shirt was clean!

He and those wolves became inseparable.His improved health and social life prompted him to go camping in the woods in Alaska. This was his great mis-step. Sarah Palin came out of no where and shot him in the chest three times from a helicopter-- one time per wolf. This event demonstrates the downside of the three-wolf t-shirt.

I put on the shirt and walked out side only to find 5 beautiful college girls wandering about aimlessly in front of my apartment; as soon as I emerged they seemed to have smelled something in the air and looked directly at me with begging eyes. They all came straight at me and begged me to be the father of their children. They all wanted my now amazing power and began to fight each other for it. Somehow during the fight clothes were ripped off, one of them must have had a bottle of body oil in their pants it exploded. The fight then turned into a huge oil wresting match.

I read the reviews for this shirt and realized that if it worked it would be the only thing to keep me from killing myself. I imediatally ordered the shirt. Unfortunately when I place the order I was extremely high heroine so I order the shirt 4 sizes to big. But to my delight when I tried it on my mushles immediatally grew to size.

Its so powerful that merely holding it and looking at the image of the three wolves and the moon, I could feel a tingling in my arms as though power began flowing through my blood. I only wore it the once. I don't think the world is ready for the unleashing of the wolves, moon and myself combined in one pulsing, heaving, hulk of manliness that I become upon the donning of this t-shirt.

Now if I can only find a shirt with the combination of an 18 wheeler truck, a manly animal like a bear, eagle, or wolf, and lighting in the background then my t-shirt collection will be complete.

I ended up having to purchase that seperately adding additonal cost including shipping!That being said, once they are coupled together, the sheer magnificence of this combo truly does stand out.

When the package arrived in the mail I found that the Tuscan Cows must've stampeded or something and the three wolves were trampled to death. I don't want a shirt with dead wolves on it. It's gross.

During the intermission, I was approached by one of the performers who encouraged me to talk to the ring leader. After a brief conversation with the man himself, I was hired and my circumstances were changed forever. I now perform as a half-man half-wolf sideshow attraction, lost weight from installing the big-top when we perform, married Yolanda the Yak, and now appreciate my excessive body hair as the tool of my trade.I was married in my wolf shirt and now only wear it for other special occasions like trips to Wal-Mart.

I want my son to know the full power and glory of this shirt the day he gets home from the hospital. He deserves the protection and the beauty that this magical design affords. I'm confident that a newborns development in those critical earl days would be vastly improved with the power of the lupine.

Then she just got up and left. There is a good chance she didn't get a good look at the shirt, though. But this other girl did. She was like, nice dress, and I mean I did order it in XXL which is really big on me, even bigger than mom's clothes, but how could anyone think this was a dress??

At this point I ran from the Agri-center, across the midway, and finally came to the apparel shop where I had purchased the shirt to find that the booth had disappeared and had been replaced by a belt buckle stand.

Unfortunately, these shirts will be cheaply made, and will not rival the quality shirts you can buy from places like Pierce This 2 here on Amazon. You certainly get what you're willing to pay for. Considering Wal-Mart's price, and it's history, I'm sure that any magic inherent in the 3 Wolf Moon T-shirts will be highly censored.

When we decided to hit the town and test out the powers of the Three Wolf Moon my friend went to get it out of the drawer and found it missing.

The next day however, I found out that something DID happen. Apparently the employees at the shipping center passed out for two days and all items got delayed but when they woke up all the packages were ready to go....although my shirt somehow arrived on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot condone this sort of animal abuse","review":"I simply cannot condone the decapitation of animals for the purpose of selling t-shirts that attract stunningly attractive, amorous women. These poor animals were sacrificed in the name of mysogyny and I strongly urge all daughters of Lillith, PETA and Grizzly Mammas alike to unite, stand up and declare \\"We're not gonna take this! No, we aint gonna take it!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I am the new Chuck Norris.","review":"After I donned this shirt, something stirred deep inside me and I'm the new Chuck Norris. Eat that haters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Snazzy","review":"This shirt may not invoke otherworldly magic as some claim, but it is mighty handsome - and the self-esteem boost you get from wearing it is priceless. Plus, the black coloring hides food stains and armpit yellowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm cured...and larger, thank you 3 wolves.","review":"I was a hopeless wreck just a few days ago. See I was diagnosed diabetic a few months ago and recently caught Swine Flu from a passing team of Mexican hockey players and thought \\"Oh geez I'm done for, what am I to do now?\\" Then I saw this shirt here on Amazon while browsing for sweatpants and sandals to wear for my interview at the truck stop...and the wolves just called to me. 2 hours after I ordered this shirt I went in for my doctor's exam and was shocked...and I mean shocked to learn that not only is my Swine Flu gone but my diabetes has been cured also. Not only this but I've got an unexpected boost in the \\"male enhancement\\" department, I'M SITTIN AT A WHOPPING 4\\" NOW!!! Needless to say, the ladies on the street corner don't roll their eyes and run....as much anymore. THANK YOU WOLVES!! Your constant howling fixed my life!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetness","review":"I was sitting around in my silk boxers the other day basking the the glory that is, well, me. I was meditating on how I could become even more awesome than I am already (which is no small thing). As I was about ready to release my mantra, it came to me, wolves. If I had a black shirt with more than two but less that four wolves on it, I would transcend into super greatness. Low and behold, I found the perfect shirt on Amazon. It was black, which is sweet, and it had three freakin' wolves on it. Perfect. So watch out ladies and dudes in guyliner. I will soon be hitting the streets in this bad-buy looking sweeter than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are no LOL Cats on the back!?!","review":"Our customers [...] frequently buy the product, fully expecting it to do something that the product does not do, and which the product description clearly indicates it doesn't do. Naturally, therefore, I expected this Three Wolf Tee to magically arrive in a Baby Doll cut, with LOL Catz on the back. It was cut for middle aged fat guys, JUST LIKE IN THE PICTURE!!! and there wasn't a single LOL Cat on the back at all! When will you be adding LOL Catz to the back of my T Shirt, and when will you ship an upgrade for my shirt which refactors it into a baby doll cut? IF YOU DON'T PLAN TO DO THIS, LET ME KNOW BECAUSE I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! This t-shirt doesn't even RUN on my iPhone. I can't believe you developers. I'm going to report you to Apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shirt is a lie!","review":"So, I bought one of these shirts, and all I can say is it's a pack of lies. My luck with the ladies didn't change at all, everything stayed the same. The other reviews are all lies, it doesn't do what everyone says it would!!! Don't buy one if that's the reason you wanted to buy one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsolicited","review":"This product page uploads automatically into my browser without my having actively done anything. I do have no interests in t-shirts of any kind and especially this one. Very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too large","review":"I have ordered a large T-Shirt with the wolves on. I received promptly and I looked at it. A T-Shirt is a T-Shirt is a T-Shirt right? I noticed it was quite large so, I washed it in cold water. It has not shrunk at all. The T-Shirt goes down to my knees or almost. Are American blessed with a bigger/larger constitution than Canadians? It is also hard to stuff are this extra material into my jeans. What can I do? Can I return it? But this is a hasstle which I don't need. If I don't get satisfaction, I will never order any kind of clothing thru Amazon or any other company.

I just saw a video on yahoo.com by ABC News that said this is one of the most popular shirts on the internet.

Both of us, just to be doubly sure. All was well until she went and got me a 3 Wolf Tee for my birthday. I put it on; she was blown away. We were naive, foolish, ignorant. A couple of months later and she's expecting triplets. The docs were mystified until we mentioned the 3 Wolf Tee. Now we have to move to a bigger trailer.***** for the shirt. * for the outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"We rate this: Three Astleys!","review":"A superb addition to any kitchy closet. We give this shirt three Astleys, a Rick Roll Special! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really long","review":"This shirt is really good quality and my fiance really likes it.

But when I got into the office, this girl Kari W. was totally wearing the three wolves and the moon shirt (looks like someone took \\"casual Friday\\" a step too far!). At first I was like, \\"Dang, that shirt is the shizzy!\\" But my moment of admiration quickly faded when I realized that it was Kari and her lame buttface who was wearing it. I mean seriously, she would take an awesome thing like thing this t-shirt and make it lame. I only recommend this product if you want to be as lame or as much of a buttface as my coworker KW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im Sexy and I Know it.","review":"I pretty much gave this shirt 5 stars because of the ungodly amounts of vagina that it attracted once I dawned it. 60% of the time it works everytime. Once I spray on my sex panther im pretty much unstoppable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Don't buy this shirt if you are planning on driving a car. You'll get so distracted by your own shirt wolves, you'll run your pick up straight into a pile of dirty leaves, which wouldn't be so much of a problem on its own except that you'll leave the car running, which will ignite the leaves and eventually the truck. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Gift Idea!","review":"Bought this as a \`cheer me up' present for my second cousin after we lost the baby.

It comes imbued with numerous potent spells - but what to wear on laundry day? That's right, one of AMAZON's urban myths is actually true: there was a fourth wolf that got left behind!If you view yourself one of the pack, go for this one. However, if you are considered to be the alpha male (or a pack on yourself) go for the newly confirmed Missing Fourth Wolf shirt![WARNING: Material not tested against silver bullets]"},{"rating":"1","title":"So?","review":"I don't get all the reviews. I've got mine on right now and it's just a shirt??? Wait a minute, how are these words appearing without me touching the keyboard? Oh my God, I'm typing with my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a warning","review":"I purchased this shirt with the expectation that it would bless me with similar experiences as the other reviewers.It should have come with a warning label.Those of us unfamiliar with the power of this shirt may well regret the purchase.I have previously owned a single wolf shirt, as well as a wolf and eagle shirt, and a shirt with two wolves (though one on the front and one on the back). I've never owned a three wolf shirt before this. And frankly, I wasn't ready for it.The story is complicated, and my lawyer has advised me that discussing it could compromise my legal position, but simply allow me to say that two broken arms and a bruised chest later, I wish that I had understood what it meant to get a THREE wolf shirt.If you have experience with three wolf shirts, I think this would be excellent. If, like me, you are wolf noob, you may want to start with a two wolf, or perhaps two wolves and cub shirt, to be sure you're up to the task."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm...","review":"I purchased this shirt because it reminded me of my family. However, I discovered upon my first donning of said garment that a wolf wearing a shirt with wolves on it was just way too postmodern. My packmates just didn't \\"get it\\". I tried to explain the writings of the post-structuralist philosopher Jacques Derrida to justify my purchase, and they just stared at me blankly. I guess that's what I get for being the only wolf in my pack who went to college.I'm giving it one star, because this shirt made me realize that po-mo is a bunch of malarkey reserved for only pretentious canis lupuseseses."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Wolfs are a lot to feed","review":"While this shirt gets the chicks, long term, its a real problem. First, you have to wash it in warm water as the howls coming from the maching are deafing to the entire trailer park. Second, 3 wolfs are a lot to feed. I didn't mind them eating my soul - I wasn't using it anyway - but then it ate the dogs under my porch so I can't hunt like I used to. Then one of girls that it lured home put it on as a night shirt and in the morning, all that was left was a few well-knawed bones. Since then, I've had to troll political conventions to keep it fed, and we all know what kind of wonky chicks you find there.Great shirt, but the upkeep will kill ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howling...","review":"I wear this shirt, and just this shirt, when I go to bed and need to perform for the lady. It's better than Viagra and she ends up doing all the howling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!","review":"This shirt is a rip-off. You may be tempted by its promise of three wolves but don't be fooled! they're actually just three big dogs passed off as wolves. I was down at Joad's Bait & Tackle last week when my so-called \\"friends\\" pointed this out.Now I'm the laughing stock at that bait shop and have to buy all my worms at the Walmart two towns over. I would've returned the shirt, but I dribbled chew all over the front.TOTAL SCAM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I only wish there was a bottle opener attached between the fangs of each wolf.
