The writing is idiotic, the acting non existent and the production value lousy. I could go on and on about why I think this movie is horrible but I think it would be pointless. The only thing I can say is this was a BAD movie and people should stay away from it. I really don't understand how people can get money to put out this kind of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This is possibly the worse movie I have ever seen. I had read a brief summary of this film and the story seemed interesting. Talk about doing absolutely nothing with a potentially good idea. The acting is so bad; especially the role of Damian, the geek/nerd. We have seen this type of character over and over in teen flicks but never before have I been subjected to such a bad performance, the stereotype times ten.How any of these characters would get together in the first place is beyond belief. The dialogue throughout the entire thing is unbearable.If you plan to watch this movie, you might want to consider a lobotomy first.Truly painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable in all respects","review":"There is nothing to recommend about this movie unless you want to make a drinking game out of it. Each time the dead boyfriend speaks to someone, take a drink. Trust me, it's the only way to get through this wretchedly written, poorly performed piece of nonsense. I should have known that if they need to sex up the DVD cover, the insides are most likely bad. This is bad in every way--actors who can't act, an awful script, and bad everything else. The description of this movie may make it sound high-minded and beautiful--but it's clearly none of the above. If only they had gotten the DVD copy writer to write the script! Very, very, very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"it was a very difficult movie to follow. They jump into the angle without any reason.

It's from a his Sunday shows; it's not a weeknight Tonight Show.It has most of the regulars, Don Knots, Louis Nye, Tom Poston. And it has the best: The crazy sportscaster guy with Allen breaking up when he sees himself in the monitor.Considering that I cannot find any other video than this, I was glad to find it. I wish there would be a real way-back machine that we could see episodes from the original Tonight show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite toy from his birthday party","review":"I got this for my great nephew, and he loved the robots. It was the only toy he asked to take to the baby-sitters house the next day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"We gave these to our 3 year old on his birthday because he is obsessed with robots. These are the coolest toys! Very fun to stack, they give you pictures of some patterns you can try. My 6 and 7 year old girls were loving them and we were too. Definitely think 2 sets would be twice as good.It teaches kids balance because most of the stacks have to be balanced on both sides in order to stand up. And of course my 3 year old loves to knock them over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Educational","review":"Love these little guys. The kids get them out every so often to play with. We have 3 sets which increases the stacking possibilities and let more than one person play with them at a time. They do chip when they fall on a hard surface. However, every wooden toy we have ever had chips; I thought that was why they started making toys out of plastic back in the day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic toy that doesn't lose appeal","review":"We have a set of these stacking robots and we buy them for all my daughter's friends' birthdays. They are cool and colorful looking, and are really fun for the toddlers. Adults also seem to really like these toys as I've seen a number of parents, including myself, stack these robots up. It's definitely a toy that both the adults and kids will like. It's probably appropriate for 3+, but 2 year olds can enjoy them too although a good level of fine motor dexterity and ability to reason are needed to line up the robots so they will balance. It would be nice if they came in better packaging, or box rather than just the thin cardboard backing, so that you can reuse the box to put them away, but no big deal on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fashioned and charming","review":"My grandson is enjoying this toy. But, since it's so low tech it may not be for everyone. The only problem I see with it is that the paint chips easily -- especially when a 4 year old is playing with them. Just hope there is nothing hazardous in the paint! But, overall, I think this is a good toy for kids who like to build things. Also a good counting tool. And, the robots look really cool for now -- until the paint all chips off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy With Crossover Appeal","review":"I love robots. My son loves robots. Who doesn't love robots? These stacking robots are made of wood, are non toxic and (something we can all appreciate) nice and quiet. They stack in a variety of different ways, encourage cognitive skills and have that fascination factor. This robot set is not just a toy, but also makes for cool decor.They remind me of something you'd see on Big Bang Theory in Sheldon and Leonard's house. I recommend these robots for little kids and big kids. I think they'd be a fun conversation piece in an office setting or a college dorm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My son was so excited about this toy. He's crazy about robots. Unfortunately, the paint started chipping from day one. The next day I noticed it was not just the paint, but wood corners were chipping off everywhere. Cheaply made - especially for a toy that is intended to be knocked down! It's obviously a different toy than the one reviewers talked about years ago in these reviews. I wish they would go back to the quality product they used to have, because I would never recommend these to anyone with the way they are now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these Robots!!","review":"I'm pretty sure I enjoy these more than my 2 and 4 year old children! They are a great durable toy. I would recommend buying 2 sets which allows you to do lots of fun structures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price is too high on Amazon","review":"Search for this elsewhere. The price is very inflated. They are listed as $45 here. I just bought them for $15 from Target"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the basics fun toy!","review":"I purchased the stacking robots for my son's 5th Birthday. He wasn't so sure of them at first, didn't seem exciting compared to Transformers and such. However, once we started playing and building with them, he really enjoyed building and trying different patterns to balance. I like that the material is wood rather than plastic (however, the wood is not durable against my dogs teeth!). My 14 year old niece was playing with them as well. I would recommend this product for a child aged 4 - 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I ordered this as a present for my friend's son.The box that robots were packed in arrived already opened and robots were chipped and had pencil marks on them.Obviously the toy has been used!Giving it as a present is out of the question and returning requires a lot of work and time,in a nutshell I live overseas and even simple things like returning something are actually a problem.After years of ordering through Amazon and occasionally getting things with a little crack here,chip there,I am over it!By the way,the toy is actually fun,but I didn't want,nor did I pay for,a second hand one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"My two year old is crazy about the robot on his Max and Ruby cartoon, I found these on amazon and for the price, I thought I couldnt go wrong with them even if he didnt like them. Well he absolutely LOVES them! Finally a toy that he will play with that doesnt make noise. :) He enjoys stacking them up, then knocking them down. He also likes to just play with one or two of them. Excellent toy, if you have a little one that loves robots, you can't go wrong with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for everyone","review":"My son received these for his 3rd birthday. Everyone in the house from his age up to 50 has played with them. They are wonderful fun and a great learning and dexterity toy. I recommend getting 2 sets as we will probably order another soon. My 5 year old daughter wants a set now and it would be added fun to have 18 robots. So great to have a non-battery operated toy that doesn't make any annoying noises!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for coordination and thought","review":"This product and Bill Dings have been a wonderful addition to me and my daughters skillful play time."},{"rating":"1","title":"harder","review":"much harder to stack than I thought. the child was a little disappointed at not being at the riht skill level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cute - but chips easily","review":"These were perfect for my robot-obsessed 2 year old. He loves walking around with them in his hands. My 6 year old likes to stack them in all the ways shown on the packaging. The only negative is that the corners have chipped off from being dropped or from when they fall while stacking. Not a big issue but would not be appropriate for a younger toddler who might put them in his mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foreigner is the best!","review":"I am a huge Cat Stevens fan, and I can't stop listening to this album. Foreigner Suite is sort of like Bohemian Rhapsody was to Queen and Italian Restuarant to Billy Joel. It is genius in its own way, and I can't get over the last part of the suite. \\"Heaven mst've programmed you.\\" The lyrics are amazing, this album is Cat at his finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Amazing Album","review":"I have always really loved Cat Steven's, but a couple years ago was the peak of my admiration for him. Since then I've gotten sick of a lot of it and only listen occastionally. But, no doubt about it, I listen to Forieghner most often. Unlike other albums Foreighner seems to be one long song (maybe because it's composed of only 5, but still..) The music is amazing and the lyrics really make you think. In my opinion, it is Cat Steven's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat took risk with \\"Foreigner\\" but it paid off","review":"When this recording was released back in the '70s, Cat performed it on one of those pre-MTV rock concert shows. He performed the entire suite and several other selections, if not the entire album. The concert was hypnotic and the next day I pulled together my coins and bought the album, $6 or $7 back then. I've loved it since. Much was made of Cat's pulling in some R&B influence on this album: Was he abandoning folk-rock? Naw. He was exploring and stretching out. And he did a credible job of it. I give it five stars and it doesn't really matter to me that few folks bought it. It kicks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably his weakest","review":"I am very fond of the standard Cat records: \\"Tea\\", \\"Teaser\\", \\"Buddha\\", \\"Mona Bone Jakon\\". My personal favourite is \\"Catch Bull at Four\\". I have never heard \\"Izitso\\" but otherwise I believe \\"Foreigner\\" to be his poorest. That's why this record was hard to find even in the LP days. His '60's recordings even have more interest in my view. If you are one of the people who believes in the principle of boycotting Joe Islam because he supports the murder of the heroic Salman Rushdie, then \\"Foreigner\\" is as good a place to start as any. Don't buy it -- support freedom of speech in the face of state-sponsored terrorism, and buy a couple of Rushdie books from Amazon instead. Don't forget: One of Rushdie's editors was killed -- with the approval of that fanatic Mr. Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get better than this","review":"I purchased this CD re-release about 4 years ago, perhaps a different mix than the one referred to by Mr Vincze in his review. My CD version sounds just like the original vinyl release without the scratches. I own all except 1 or 2 releases by CS and saw him perform live twice. I care nothing about his spiritual quest, but his work is some of the greatest in all of pop music. Foreigner Suite is my favorite of all Cat's albums, followed by Numbers. This was a great musical experiment. I was in dis-belief the first 3 times I listened to the cut \\"Foreigner Suite\\". I couldn't believe that such a wonderful, musical, joyful, intense and l-o-n-g cut had been released by a major artist.Foreigner and Numbers are very different from his great commercial albums (Tea & Teaser) but if you are a Cat fan you should give these albums a chance.This CD rates in my top-10 \\"desert island essentials\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Old Navy, minus the clothes","review":"This album lacks the healtfelt honesty of his early work, and lacks the creative energy of his later work. If you enjoy R&B/soul then you might enjoy it. If you like Cat's early work, you will probably dislike this album. There's very few songs, and none of the songs stick out. I especially dislike the record-length-long \\"Foreigner Suite\\". It doesn't seem to go anywhere, and is filled with generic sounding instrumentals. This album doesn't sound like Cat Stevens, it sounds like something you'd hear in Old Navy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Remastering I've Ever Heard","review":"I'm a HUGE Cat Stevens fan. I have purchased all the remastered cd's. They all sound great except for this one. I seriously doubt they got the original master tapes on this one. The drums have absolutely no punch whatsoever on this disc. This disc has the dynamic range of a normal run-of-the-mill cassette tape. Please guys......I'm begging you......find the original master tapes and reissue this again to correct the blasphemy of this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Awesome book. Good for inspiration. You will see the artwork like mixing between vector base and photoshop, photocopied art work, wonderful vector based images, mix-media; collage using drawing style and photoshop etc. If you find something different from things you've seen, you should buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"For 300 count sheets with the detailed stitching, you can't beat the price. I've washed them a few times and the colour is holding up. Good quality. I'm very impressed with these sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok but not best......","review":"I enjoyed reading about the child actor Derek Masters who comes to Stoneybrooke in the story, since I'm so into theatre myself, but Jessi should stick to ballet. She doesn't know ANYTHING about acting! It's not as easy as she thinks. All of the sudden, she just think's she'll be famous and she'll be \\"chosen\\". She should start out smaller, with theatre, before looking into agents and TV and modeling. Plus, there's a lot of rejection in the show biz world, and Jessi doesn't even give that thought! It isn't that easy. Do not be fooled - Jessi and Ann M. Martin do not know what they are talking about when they talk show business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our bedtime favorite","review":"I love this book. The illustrations are beautiful, the rhymes are simple and repetative, and I like that the book includes lots of kinds of animals, not just mammals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"The pictures are beautiful and the words are soothing- just right for bedtime.

The rhymes are so sweet. I love reading it to my daughter and she enjoys it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our first choice for a bedtime book","review":"My son was 14 months old when he gave up his bottles before bedtime. As an alternative to the bottle, he chose this book. He responded to the rhythm of the poetry and was charmed by the little baby on the last page. He is always happy to see her, and seems inspired by her to curl up in his own bed and go to sleep too.We would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"The book had been water damaged with pages stuck together. Unreadable. I was so disappointed as the pictures that could be seen were very pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rhythm","review":"I received this book as a gift twice. Once for my first daughter, and again for my second. I never returned the second copy so they would each have their own. The pictures are lovely, and my older daughter likes to name all the animals. The rhyming, while not elaborate, is very rhythmical, and lulling for the babies. The age recommendation for this book is toddler years, but I found that both my daughters loved it from the beginning of their lives. This book is a good transition from bath to rocking chair to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully short","review":"I just received the book a couple of weeks ago and it is already my 21 month old son's new favorite. I love the beautiful illustrations and he seems to also. It is the perfect length for his age because there are only two lines per page and that is about as long as he is willing to wait before turning the page.

The illustrations are beautiful and the text is rhythmic and lulling. Every night, we snuggle together, just like the animals do in the book, and read this at least three times before bed, since she likes it so much. I cannot think of another book that I have that will allow my 9 month old to sit still for ONE reading, much less three in a row. This was a perfect gift and will be cherished for many years to come. Definitely a must-have for children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Nighttime Book for Toddlers","review":"As the mother of a toddler, I adore this book. The text rhymes, which is always nice and the flow is smooth. Mem Fox doesn't reach too far for her rhymes, either. Jane Dyer is an absolutely incredible watercolor artist and the depictions of all sorts of animals nuzzling together and saying good-night are truly lovely. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a beautiful book!","review":"This is such a beautiful book! I love the illustrations. Each page shows a mother animal putting her baby to sleep. There are only a few words on each page, perfect for bedtime. This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I gave it to my nephew for his first birthday. So cute (both the book and my nephew!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Fun","review":"I started reading this book to my son when he was one month old. He was colicky and didn't want to nap (he still fights sleep). This book was great because it has simple rhymes. After reading it a few times, I memorized it and would recite it even without the book. I'll never forget the first time I realized he recognized and even anticipated the next line as I always whispered in one spot. It's still part of our bedtime line-up. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific book for winding down at bedtime!","review":"This book is one of our daughter's favorites. She enjoys the rhymes and pointing out the animal babies who don't want to go to sleep. When she was going through a sleep-resistant stage, declaring \\"I am going to stay up aaallll night!\\", this book helped us to show her that every living creature has to rest sometime. Gorgeous illustrations. Makes a wonderful baby shower or new baby gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must Have","review":"This is an excellent bedtime story. Using short and gentle verse(part of which is mimicked on each page beginning with 'It's time for bed...' then, as the story continues, switches to 'It's time to sleep...') and depicting a different Mommy/Daddy animal cuddling with their little one, Fox helps to gently ease youngsters into dreamland. Dyer's magnificent water colors keep little ones interested but not so bright as to overstimulate. Finally, a young child is seen being put to bed by Mother -- 'The stars on high are shining bright -/Sweet dreams, my darling, sleep well...'. The last page -- an angelic head resting on a pillow and the words - 'good night!' A very peaceful and beautiful story to share at bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different animals make for lots of favorites","review":"I like reading this to my 15 month old.

One character in a later book is a Dutch Reform sea-captain who denies the earth is round on religious grounds, and has worked out an alternate navigation technique; who runs his tramp steamer as an anabaptist religious community, yet makes his living ferrying Muslim pilgims on the Haj from Indonesia to Arabia.This is the only book with Otto as submariner, in the next, \\"The Two Headed Eagle\\", he joins the air force, and then the final two books are prequels, going back to the start of WWI and the Archduke Ferdinand's household (\\"The Emperor's Coloured Coat\\"), and the last book in the series, \\"Tomorrow the World\\" has Otto as a Naval Cadet in 1900 on his around the world graduation training voyage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good children's game resource.","review":"This book is a good resource for well-known games, such as musical chairs, I spy, Twenty Questions, etc. but also similar games not so well known, but easy to learn. I was looking for a book with activities to utilize as icebreakers in group therapy with adolescents. Many of these activities are geared toward younger children (K-6). There are a good variety of indoor and outdoor, thinking and physical games, too. I think this would be a good book for teachers, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job SHOUT! for season 3 of a cult classic!","review":"The Dragnet franchise continues in the 3RD season as Friday & Gannon are on the case.The extras are pretty good.The officers deal with cases of Bigotry,young teens in trouble,extortion, homicides, fraud,Dirty Cops, a day in robbery division,Community Relations,Visit from the President Of USA to Los Angeles, a day in the life of a woman in the Police Academy to name a few.The guest stars in season 3 are fantastic from Howard Hessman,Don Marshall, A young Jan Michael Vincent.Well worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WORK HERE--I\\"M A COP","review":"Yes, it's Sgt.

I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enigma of Breaking the Code","review":"\\"Breaking the Code\\" is a well acted and produced film based on the true story of a hero of the Second World War - Alan Turing. Some will only know the name Turing from the \\"Turing Test\\" which determines levels of artificial intelligence, but it was the work that Turing did in breaking the German \\"Enigma Code\\" that helped the Allies win the war. This film is couched in these events but more directly addresses the fact that Alan Turing was gay and that he was arrested, jailed and persecuted for his unashamed behavior. Despite being instrumental in saving the world from the ruthless Nazi world view of racial purity and social-cultural intolerance, once the war was over, the British government enacted a similar intolerance which ultimately ends in tragedy. Derek Jacobi delivers a masterful performance as Turing. It is a shame that this production is not available on DVD - I was thrilled to be able to find an excellent VHS copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think its about!","review":"I was excited to see a story about Turing. He was a mathmatical genius and a real visionary in computing machines. Unfortunatly, this video barely touches those things and instead uses Turning to show how unfair homosexuals were treated. It should have focused more on his accomplishments!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JAILBREAK!!","review":"This was my second album my dad bought for me when it first came out (in the Reissue form back in 2003)i was 12 then(14 now)This was when i really started to like AC/DC and after i got BACK IN BLACK,they were my favorite band.This album may only have 5 songs but hey,its AC/DC!Pink floyds Wish you were Here only had five songs so stop whining!!These songs are great because im a guitar player and they're fun to play along to long solos so you can really jam.The best songs have to be Jailbreak,and Soul Stripper,because they're two of AC/DC's great song list(and they have a long list!)Brian does a great job of singing Jailbreak and i think hes better at singing it than Bon was,(i think brian is better)So go out and buy it,its worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best truly a 10 star cd","review":"this is the deepest album! i was, and still am in awe! ac/cd is the god of rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a JOKE","review":"5 songs? This is completely ridiculous. I don't care if they were the 5 greatest songs ever recorded, it's still a big rip off. Shame on you, Angus."},{"rating":"1","title":"In desperate need of an overhaul","review":"I really can't see how Atlantic records can justify selling this for the same price as \\"Dirty Deeds,\\" \\"High Voltage,\\" \\"Powerage,\\" or \\"Let There Be Rock,\\" especially in the age of the archival CD release. It's WAY too short, especially when you consider all of the unreleased-in-the-US songs from the Bon Scott era that could have been added to flesh this out. How about the early pre-Bon single \\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl/Rockin' In The Parlor?\\" Live tracks, anything! Make it worth the money! Look at what an excellent job MCA did with the Who's \\"Odds & Sods\\" reissue, or Columbia did with the Clash's \\"Super Black Market Clash.\\" Don't misunderstand...the music's great, but the package [stinks]. AC/DC's fans should be treated with a little more respect than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRUSHING, BRUTAL GUITAR RIFFS WILL KNOCK YOU ON YOUR ***!","review":"All you have to do is listen to the incredible title track and you will realize that early ac/dc was one of the purest, most ferocious rock bands there ever was. At a time when goofy \\"experimental rock\\"(Yes, Supertramp) and disco polluted the radio waves, Bon and the boys were dishing out some of the nastiest songs ever recorded. The title track alone is worth the price, and it makes today's \\"bad boy\\" bands(Bizkit, Korn) sound like talentless wussies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jailbreak","review":"I've heard a lot of complaints over the years about the fact that this album only has five songs, but it still remains among the elite AC/DC albums. For that matter, it is one of the best hard rock albums of all time. From the opening of Jailbreak to the rocking blues cover, Baby Please Don't Go, Bon and Angus show why the band went on to be rock and roll legends. In a time when cds have one or two radio hits and the rest of the cd is filler, I will gladly take these five rock and roll classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only five songs made the Jailbreak but its still awesome","review":"released in america after Bon Scotts death (origional singer) this is only a snippet of what he was . Songs like Jailbreak and Soulstripper shine ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd !","review":"To sell only five songs for almost the same price of whole album is the typical example of greedy decisions made by a record company. It's absurd, even being AC/DC, my favourite band.THere are five songs here: four from their first album, released only in Australia back in 1974, called \\"HIGH VOLTAGE\\", and one from the Australian version of \\"DIrty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\", the master piece track called \\"Jailbreak\\". Why on Earth, (back in 1981, when Atlantic finally released \\"Dirty Deeds\\" in the US) they chose to take \\"Jailbreak\\" out from the album and replace it is beyond my compreension....Well, you got my point... this album, altough the five songs are very good, makes no sense at all. IT was born as a greedy decision by Atlantic, nothing more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but quite short.","review":"The title track is great. It is my favorite Bon Scott song after Rosie, Dirty Deeds, and Highway To Hell. For those of you looking to get started on the thunder~get AC/DC Live. Jailbreak should be the last album you buy from them. They are my favorite band. Look for a new release in January."},{"rating":"1","title":"FUN, BUT MILES AWAY FROM WHAT THEY ACHIEVED LATER !","review":"This is funny. I can remember the video-clip from the song \\"JAILBREAK\\": hillarious! Bon and Angus making a escape from prison, and Bon getting shot in the end.. Fun! But, musically speaking, it was just a beginning for the band (it has a cover! ), and has only 5 songs. It was just an introduction for one of the best rock bands of all times (who, unfortunately, never wanted to write good lyrics...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"I use these almost every day to cut 14/4- up to 10/3 Metal Clad and they work amazing.The only \\"downside\\" is that they are pretty stiff when new, so I had to oil them quite a bit before they \\"loosened\\" up.

(I won't go into the details here but just hit up your favorite search engine and type in \\"Big 3 Upgrade\\". I purchased some good quality 0 gauge cables and was looking for some quality cutters to get a nice clean slice. I hate having frayed wires for two reasons: aesthetics and safety. Frayed wires look like you had your dog chew through it on purpose and it can also lead to metal splinters (which are not fun and worse than wood splinters). The Klein J63050 Cable Cutter is an amazing piece of tool. It is solidly built, comes with nice comfy grips and cut through those cables like they were string. They always say you have to have the right tools for the job. If I ever need to cut large gauge cables, I'm definitely going to use this tool. Great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific Details Not Needed","review":"This book on elementary metaphysics seems too short to be useful...but it turns out to be the first handbook you need to explore this subject (and, for many, the last as well).When I first read this book, I was AMAZED...because I found it to be 100% in keeping with my own experiences, experiences I had been trying for years to convey to others. I had been able to get through to some people who didn't mind my scientific explanations and support information; but a lot of my friends just don't care about that...they are only interested in results.This is a book about the results, and techniques to get them. If you want the science behind it, you'll need to look further; but \\"From Atoms to Angels\\" is a heck of a good introduction to by applying metaphysical principles to your life to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patti Smith Fans Beware","review":"As a Patti Smith fan for years I was very excited to see this video tape. Once I actually had the tape in my VCR, however, I was very disappointed. This tape centers on Ivan Kral. There is a little footage of interviews with Patti talking about Ivan Kral. There are some very short clips of the PSG in action. There are interviews with folks like Chris Stein and Debbie Harry and some of the Talking Heads commenting on the PSG.That is it, no songs in their entirety, no lengthy interview with Patti.If you are an Ivan Kral fan it's a great investment. If you want Patti Smith DO NOT purchase this tape. You will be very disappointed. Once you have seen the video it becomes very obvious that the title of the tape is deliberate in order to generate sales for the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"more action than sci-fi","review":"this book was pretty disappointing. on the back cover some comments seem to compare him to the likes of asimov, but after reading this book, let me say that he does not remotely touch the works of asimov. this books feels like a big-budget hollywood sci-fi movie. there really isn't a good underlying theme from the story, there's a lot of action, sex, some violence, and lots of cliche. there was a decent build up of the story in the first half that was pretty exciting, but then it lets down w/ the resolution. the background description was pretty intriguing and decently set up. at the end he does kind of insert some commentary, but all in all instead of being a good sci-fi, this book feels a bit cheap and trashy. hopefully this is not representative of his other works"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting examination of a possible future.","review":"Great character development. Good plot line.Bova is at his best regarding story telling and character building.I did not give a rating of 5 stars for the following reasons.--The story does not discover something new. I like Sci-Fi to examine science discoveries human or otherwise.--There are no mysteries. It is a typical story about business vs. government and human greed vs. altruism.--Bova lends credence to the notion of climate change.I recommend this story to Bova fans and Sci-Fi fans.Have a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Please Don't touch\\" still has it !!!","review":"When Steve Hackett left GENESIS in 1978 I wondered what he would do.The result was this record. I bought it then and have recently got it again on cd from Amazon.This production has lost nothing from its 28 years age.Guest singer Randy Crawford sings probably the best love song I have ever heard - Hoping Love will Last - Richie Havens vocals' also evoke visions of Woodstock all them years ago.Buy it - you'll like it !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Second Release","review":"Here is Steve Hackett's second solo album and his first after leaving Genesis in 1977. By now, he felt comfortable enough to stand on stage for an entire show...but apparently still somewhat nervous. He's got enough guests on this one to fill that stage. But it works--this album is a classic. Its range of styles and influences is all over the spectrum. Every track is a favorite, but I'll say \\"Racing In A\\" best illustrates Steve's music at the time. A powerful second release and a great clue of things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Many 4 Ratings","review":"I have read with dismay the many \\"good\\" ratings this disc has received. I think many smart critical reviewers have done it a disservice by comparing it to Voyage of the Acolyte. It is no Voyage, granted, but it is still a great recording.This one goes in a different direction with unexpected vocalists such as Randy Crawford, Richie Havens and even Steve Walsh of Kansas. While the Randy Crawford song, in particular, does not seem like a Steve Hackett tune, is it not fantastic. And, the rest of side 2 is a masterpiece. Side 1 falls a tad short of rating as a masterpiece, but is still superb.When it comes to Steve Hackett discs, this is a must have. Bring on the 5's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TRIPE!!","review":"This is the worst Steve hackett album i have ever heard. that is rubbish i love W&W; and love steve hackett guitar playing, i have been creating blood on the rooftops lots of times.

One CD is a boring reading of an encyclopedia version of Woody's life. The other CD is 52 of Woody's cuts in bad sound. A better intro to his life is Tribute to Woody Guthrie on Warner Brothers, at a good price at Amazon. Professional actors and top folk singers mix readings and songs to make the story come alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone should have sent out an S.O.S., because the S.O.S. Band is really in trouble here","review":"A group responsible for some of the best R&B of the 80s, The S.O.S. Band attempted to carry their career into the next decade with this album, and from listening to this, it quickly becomes clear that they shouldn't have. Unquestionably the weakest album of their career, nothing on here even makes a passable substitute for such classics as \\"The Finest\\", \\"Weekend Girl\\", \\"Take Your Time (Do It Right)\\", \\"Tell Me If You Still Care\\", or \\"Nothing But The Best\\". And, no matter how successful rapper Kurupt has become over the years, this was so not a good place for him to make his initial appearance. The S.O.S. Band is definitely not a rapper-friendly group, and even the greatest rappers would probably sound very out of place alongside it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good concert, but you'll need a PAL compatible DVD player","review":"Some purchasers have complained about an inability to play this item--with good reason. The DVD I received is not NTSC as listed on Amazon, but a European PAL DVD NOT compatible with standard American DVD players. I was able to watch it on my Mac computer DVD player and a No Regions DVD player I own, but my USA DVD player will NOT play it. Amazon should revised their description of this item to warn purchasers that MOST will not be able to watch it if they live in the USA.That said, I enjoy Anastacia. She has a powerful, soulful voice, a dynamic and compelling stage presence and a funky, fun-loving band. Not to mention she's quite pulchritudinous. I still can't understand why she hasn't been embraced by her home country. If she was a big hit in the US, maybe there'd be an NTSC DVD that everyone in this country could enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable","review":"This product its unplayable on any DVD Player that I have.

Sadly, it will not play in players not set up for PAL, which are most of the DVD players in the US. Other reviews of this product have said the same thing and Amazon continues to sell it in the US. On Anastacia's website, it even says this DVD is NOT available in North America. Nowhere on Amazon's website does it indicate that this DVD only comes in PAL, not NTSC.

It is unimaginable how this talented singer-songwriter has not gained popularity in the U.S. yet is considered to be the biggest female artist in the world and is originally from New York! Both her stage voice and presence are demanding and her dedication to and appreciation of her fans, unwavering. The only drawback to this DVD is that it is formatted in Region 2, common in Europe. Most of the newer DVD players here can adapt to it, however, mine is a few years old and will not play the disc. I had to watch it on my laptop. Other than that, this is definitely worth owning!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware !!!!","review":"I ordered this item because I am a huge Anastacia fan. However, I did not know about the region codes on DVD's therefore when I got the DVD's they would not play in any of my DVD players.

He never really made another one like this. I think it's one of those love-it-or-hate-it albums... the drenched-in-sorrow cuts \\"Autumn\\", \\"This side of the looking glass\\", and \\"Alice (Letting go)\\" are possible tear-inducers. The anger felt on \\"Betrayal\\" will touch anyone who has ever felt betrayed, particularly in a relationship.

I'm not large (a 38C), and I had to exhale all my air, and try to collapse my rib cage to get the zipper to go all the way up. My husband had to pull the ends together to get the clasp at the top to snap, and more pulling to get the zipper to go up. Once up, it was OK. I'm not about to inhale a huge breath and bend over or anything, cause it will burst. But for walking around the party, it will do fine.So, warning. If you have big boobs or a chest bigger then 38C, you better get the XL.And pull the snakes head dress out and air it out (along with the costume). The thing smells horribly of rubber and plastic.

For $60, I think I should at least get some kind of acknowledgement. I finally filed a complaint with the BBB and would recommend all the other critics do the same, if so inclined.

The little buckles are scratched and rusty. So I called to start the return process to find that I have to pay $8 to return them, $8 to get a new pair - and I won't get them til well after Christmas. I am so upset and cannot believe that this Christmas I will either be giving my mom something covered in dirt and obviously used - or nothing at all.

I listen to this album or atleast a couple of tracks off it everyday.

Every song is a winner. Anyone who likes AC/DC has to add this to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Scorcher!","review":"I have gradually accumulated all of AC/DC's discs, and Powerage was one of the last ones I bought. That was my loss, because it has jumped to the front of the line in terms of favorite hard rock cds. Malcolm and Angus come up with some of their best riffs ever, and Bon Scott is terrific. What I like most is the bluesiness of the tunes: \\"Down Payment Blues\\" is one of the best songs these boys have ever recorded. \\"Riff Raff\\" absolutely smokes. The production is excellent, featuring a stripped-down, no-frills guitar attack. Angus' solos are marvels of minimalism. This album is a definite peak in the band's long career. Sure, Highway to Hell is a great disc, but in many ways, Powerage is even stronger. In my opinion, this is the one AC/DC disc to own from the Bon Scott era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sin City and Down Payment Blues","review":"That Chet Young guy knows of what he speaks. Sin City and Down Payment Blues, two of the most perfect, hard-drinking b#*%#!tch-banging songs ever. And I don't mean just AC/DC songs, of all recorded rock.These 2 songs do everything, slow to fast, low to high, soft to hard, little to b-b-big. What I love the most about each tho is that toward the end, they both come to a near stop, then slowly build again to an orgasmic crescendo and BOOM...Knock you out! That is not easy to do if the lack of it from so many other bands thru history in any indication. It is the heart of blues rock.AC/DC made it their hallmark. God Save Their Queen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The MOST underrated AC/DC album!!!!","review":"Most people who don't have this cd have never heard any of these songs... Well now's your chance. Go out and buy this cd. All of the songs are great.. but my favorites are as follows...Rock and Roll Damnation is probably the highlight with it's power and its one of my all time favorites.. Down Payment Blues is different but once you hear it you'll love it.. RIFF RAFF is just what it says with awesome riffs and all!! Sin City, Gone Shootin, Up to my neck in you, and kicked in the teeth again are my other favorites on the album.. but i like all of the songs. I highly recommend this cd to everybody who loves AC/DC or any classic Rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of their best","review":"I like the band but this is not one of their best and it makes it so typical at times of trying to differentiate their albums and find what comes next"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM FROM THE BON SCOTT ERA","review":"POWERAGE-This album easily takes the cake as the best from the Bon era.Every single song off this record is awesome.My personal favorites are Down Payment Blues, Gimmie a Bullet, What's Next to the Moon, and Gone Shootin but they are all great. This isn't as polished as Highway to Hell but it makes up for the lack of fancy production with dirty raw powered riffs and blues based grooves. A must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of AC/DC's Finest Albums!","review":"Only in the rarest of cases have I heard a track from AC/DC's Powerage get radio play, yet it may, in fact, be their best album. This album has no \\"hits,\\" in the manner of Back in Black or Highway to Hell, but what it has aplenty are great, hard rockin' songs and some of the best writing the band has done. The first five tracks are all worthy of being compared to anything the band has done, and it's really just an incredible album all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a fine wine it gets better with age","review":"I recently purchased this CD to replace my old worn out record. Listening to it makes me feel 18 again - the age I was when I bought the aforementioned record.

If you're new to the band buy this before the big sellers - High Way To Hell and Black In Black - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Lacks a truly transcendent moment?\\" Are you kidding?!","review":"What do you call \\"Sin City\\" and \\"Down Payment Blues\\"? Two of AC/DC's greatest songs, I'd say. The former is a bonafide anthem that the band still plays in concert, and the latter has an absolutely killer riff--one of the best in the AC/DC catalogue. POWERAGE is a fantastic album. It holds up very well against HIGH VOLTAGE, DIRTY DEEDS, and HIGHWAY TO HELL...and it's better than LET THERE BE ROCK(yes, I know it sounds like blasphemy and I know that fans the world over will vehemently disagree with me, but that's how I feel!).The second \\"side\\"(i.e., the last four songs) does drag a bit, but so do the second sides of most albums. Get POWERAGE; it's pure AC/DC and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great classic","review":"This is a very good, although underrated album. There are many classics on here, such as \\"rock n roll damnation\\", \\"gimme a bullet\\", \\"riff raff\\", \\"sin city\\", and \\"up to my neck in you\\". As for Angus and Malcolm, this was there \\"breakthrough\\" album, containing some very impressive riffs. Any real AC/DC fan should definitley own this.

The Japanese built powerful warships - but with a different and fascinating perspective and appearance than the Western Powers. Unfortunately this book is a pamphlet: 75 or so pages, many pictures (good) but the accompanying description is merely a few paragraphs per ship - only a little more than a reader of the Pacific theatre would already know. Size of the book is also a detriment - thin; larger (height/ width) than a usual hardbound, much smaller than an illustrated book.

I remember sitting in my living room alone at night reading the part about Claudia hearing strange noises coming from outside while she was babysitting one night. I got frightened myself! The mystery element was terrific. Ann M. Martin is one of the greatest children's authors. She really understands preteens. No doubt she's so good because she was a teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK!","review":"I thought this was a really good book.

The BSC got some prank phone calls...ever heard of Caller ID or *69? I mean, come on! Besides, they should've just called the police first or their parents. They shouldn't have been keeping secrets like that. If it really was the Phantom Phone Caller, then they could get hurt or even killed if they were only in on it with each other. And so what if their parents wouldn't want them to sit until he was caught? I wouldn't want to sit myself if a criminal was on the loose! Think about it. Do you really want to waste your money on this book? Get it at the library before you buy it, I advise you. That way you'll know what you're buying before you buy it.

However, the BSC deal with it and the matter is resolved at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is entertaining and even a little scary.","review":"This book is really entertaining. Even a little scary the first time you read it. I know that it might sound silly, but still, wouldn't you be scared if a robber might be in the same house with you without you even knowing it until he's gone? This book is when Claudia falls in 'luv' with a poet named Trevor and the BSC reads in the newspaper that a phantom caller (a jewel thief) was loose in a town really close to Stoneybrook. This caller calls your house first to see if anyone answers the phone, if not, he robs your house and he sometimes even rob houses when there are people actually there with him. Scary things started happening to the BSC, such as being called with no one on the other end. Claudia is sure that she loves mysteries, but she's not so sure that if she likes mysteries actually happen to her. What will happen?

Among these is Quinn who goes from being a PI back to the FBI and then back again to a PI, Doug who has an affair with the victim in \\"Dead...\\" and then moves on to a relationship with Jane and then he says in the next book \\"I swore never to get involved with a dancer again\\".

It is a valid point that ritual designed specifically for non-transgendered women (so-called \\"women-born-women\\") is not all suitable for transgendered women. And while there may be many reasons to want certain types of women's space to be reserved for non-transgendered women, Ms. Barrett specifically insults transsexual women by calling them men who have been altered by hormones and surgery, descriptions which are essentialist, biologically determinist and frankly inaccurate. It doesn't behove a wise womyn who herself has been abused and discriminated against to turn and do the same to a group of women, transsexual women, who badly need the mentorship of non-transgendered women and who are most easily hurt by misinformation which already abounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Hackett defects the critics and releases another prog masterwork","review":"Another strong album from Hackett using the same band as Spectral Mornings, it has a similar sound to that album.

I loved the way the music went with it. The storyline has great twists and turns, and I ended up really liking all of the characters, despite the fact that they did some--naughty things. The artwork was excellent, as many have pointed out. The only reason it's not a 5 is because I found the ending to be lacking--I assumed there would be another volume and more episodes, but it does say complete series. I want some sense of closure, and I didn't get it. But it's still worth buying. My poor Catholic roomate was watching it with me--I'm not so sure that was a good idea.

Not a good idea. It's a great movie and if you like blood and sick obsesions, this movie is definetly for you. The story line is pretty simple, Setsuna is a teenage boy who is in love with his sister. He is also the reincarnation of an angel. After the angel inside him is awakened and kills a man, Setsuna is forced to leave his home and takes his sister with him. The movie is about the forces that slowly tear Setsuna/Alexiel (the angel inside him) and his family apart. It all comes down to one bloody battle and when the fate of the world, heaven and hell is decided."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is worth 10 if possible","review":"Hello, I got this DVD about a few months back and I have to say it is amaaaazing.

The reason I love this movie is the plot and the love Setsuna and Sara share, it's enough to make a grown man cry. Here's my advice to you, buy, or at least rent, its worth it. Just one complaint.....WHERE ARE THE OTHER EPISODES AT?! the 3rd is a cliff hanger and i wanna see the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and disappointing","review":"Being a fan of japanese animation I was terribly disappointed with this particular creation. Most likely this anime is only meant for the fans of Angel Sanctuary manga. Because otherwise you will have a hard time understanding what is happening and who are the random people you keep trying to add to the equation. To confuse you further male characters might turn out to be female and vice versa.The animation quality is disappointing. Characters spot huge disproportional chins and constantly dumb facial expressions. The main female character kept reminding me of some kind of alpine shepherdess...Well, open-mindedness aside the issue of forbidden sister-brother love totally lack subtlety and might scar you permanently with the way it's presented. The fact that the brother in question is in fact a reincarnated female angel is not helping.Unless you know what you are getting into I would not suggest this anime to anyone.

Now he has his \\"brother\\" Rosiel and demons Kurai and Arachne.I didn't watch more. To much blood.

Setsuna soon finds out that he is the reincarnation of Organic Angel Alexiel and is being stalked by her twin brother Inorganic Angel Rosiel and his henchman.

It is difficult to find a CD that is not only relaxing, but entertaining. The CD starts with a warm synthesized score (The Crystal Star), and moves through restful tracks of fluid piano, nature sounds, and flute (Rosewood and Silver).

The accompanying essay about Kubrick's color use is somewhat shallow and could use a lot more detail. This book is also loaded with pictures from the films, many of them behind the scenes, about 90% of them individual frame enlargements. Although they are black and white, they are clearly printed.

The pointless cover of Peter Gabriel's magnificent \\"Biko\\" is a case in point. The original can move me to tears but this attempt just makes me consult my watch!

I understand what they were trying to accomplish with this, and the sentiment involved, but the result is an album that is muddled it is so overly produced, bloated and boring. Simple Minds lost it on this album. Its like they decided to focus more on how they sounded instead of ACTUAL SONGS.

You will not be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Performance","review":"This performance of Moll Flanders is an excellent show. When this was released there was a theatrical release with Robin Wright playing simultaneously. This one is by far the superior. It tells the whole story. Diana Rigg is excellent as her long lost mother in later years. The DVD includes Russell Baker's commentary from the telecast which is unusual for a pre-recorded Masterpiece Theatre, but far be it from me to complain. Grab it while you can. UPDATE: 8/4/2007: The 2 disc copy (not THIS one) has been edited, see my separate review on that one. Also, this program is what TV rates as TV MA (Mature Audience, small screen equivalent of NC 17) do NOT let anyone under 17 watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping story of a girl's quest for what she wants","review":"Alex Kingston brings strength and integrity to the role of Moll Flanders. In this adaptation, Moll is seen not only as a character, but as a living, breathing person. As the story progresses, you get to see what's going on inside Moll's head when she turns to the camera and talks directly to the audience. This type of perspective is usally only found in books, and then only the best of books. What a refressing change to be included in the story line and not be just a spectator. As for the story, it's a heart-tearing tale of a girl born in a jail, raised by a mayor as \\"almost\\" one of his own. The story line follows with Moll first finding then losing, then finding her fortune. This is one of the greatest versions yet. Thanks, Alex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original Masterpiece Theatre presentation","review":"I first saw this film on Masterpiece Theatre in two parts. Each part had an interesting BBC intro. I later bought the film on two VHS tapes, each tape had the original intros at the beginning. This DVD set is missing the intros and whole scenes are missing. Worst of all, the soundtrack is completely different, changing the whole tone of the film. The original soundrack was definitely better as it was more appropriate to each scene. I still have the old VHS tapes and prefer them to the new DVD set because of these changes. I wouldn't have wasted my money if the product description had included the fact that this is an edited version with a different soundtrack -- as it should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrated?","review":"I feel that this movie should be R, just for the fact alone that there are many, many nudity scenes. We had to fast forward the movie so many times, the plot was confusing. My 9 year-old cousin owns this movie, and he watches it all of the time. If this movie was perhaps rated, and rated appropriately, maybe he and his family could have been warned ahead of time. While this movie did have a good plot, once it got going, and had a good portrayal of the book, I hardly think it was as good as everyone thinks. Maybe if they had cut back on the nudity, or covered the nudity up, this could have been as great of a movie as everyone says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as entertaining or interesting any","review":"I reviewed this movie two times already when I was 9 and I thought that it was all that before. Now, I really see that it is a big bunch of ignorant scenes put together. Like my cousin, Michelle said, the repetitive nudity in this movie is completely unnecessary and just the constant sex alone is so unneeded.I am find myself more to like the big screen version starring Robin Wright.

Unfortunately, BFS's transfer does not appear to do this superb show justice. There is no information on the BFS website about the aspect ratio of the transfer. The original is widescreen (1:66 or 1:78). The BFS transfer is, if Amazon is accurate (not always the case, by the way) 1:33. So if you don't mind missing a significant part of the show buy it. As for me I will stick with the ITV release in the correct oar I purchased some time back and will remain annoyed by the BFS tradition of not telling consumers anything about the oar on the packages or website and of and transforming a widescreen film or TV programme into a TV screen box oar. Pathetic and sad. I expect more but I never get it from BFS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun, and some depth as well","review":"Terrific 4 part UK television production.

At times maligned for his later gore films, Fulci really delivers loads of suspense with this one, proving that when it comes to coherent storytelling and tight direction he is miles above his peers Argento and Bava. Not much blood in this one, but when there is gore he makes it count. Those expecting a zombie brain feast may be disappointed, as this movie owes more to Hitchcock than Romero.

I'm apparently in the minority on this from the other reviews, and if you really love this album, I apologize. I honestly love Disney songs, but please go out and buy your favorite soundtracks or even a sing-along CD for the kids before you even consider listening to this album. In fairness, there are some decent versions, but there are two songs you need to run far, far away from. First, Sinead's \\"Someday my Prince Will Come\\", sounds like it's sung by a suicidal stalker; I expected the lyrics to continue \\"...and I will stab him through the heart, repeatedly.\\" Aaron Neville tries to make the \\"Mickey Mouse March\\" into a sexy ballad, which succeeded in making my skin crawl. I don't want to associate seductive love songs and Mickey, and his version is even over the top for a 70's era sultry ballad. It may be the worst re-interpretation of a song that I've heard in my entire life."},{"rating":"1","title":"~ eh","review":"So you wanna know what SINEAD O'CONNOR'S \\"One Day My Prince Will Come\\" sounds like? Maybe not, but that was the reason I hunted down this disc for so long and paid a pretty penny for it. Well, for the Sinead fans, I write this review. That song is little over ONE minute long. Sinead barely sings on it. She's basically TALKing out the lyrics in a breathy and deep voice, only throwing a pinch of melody into it at the last few lines. She could've done so much better!! I'll keep the old, enchanting Snow White. The music itself is a bare minimal amount guitar-strumming. So basically, completists shouldn't pay too much for this.As for the rest of the songs on this disc, sure, they all sang and played but none of the songs caught my interest. The overall sound IS more rock/pop than your usual lovely children's fluff. Final analysis: Blehhh."},{"rating":"2","title":"hi diddlee dee !","review":"This was the first CD that I bought via the internet. It was unobtainable in the UK as it was deleted.

Willner has also produced albums for Marianne Faithfull, Lou Reed, Bill Frisell, William S. Burroughs, Gavin Friday, Lucinda Williams and Allen Ginsberg, among others. So it should be no surprise that this album is an eclectic mix and highly theatrical in concept. Several reviewers have criticized the use of medleys, but a great many Disney songs have only one verse and a chorus, which makes it difficult to make a full length cut, hence the medleys. It's an album that has aged very well and bears many repeat listenings. Tom Waits, Harry Nilsson,Suzanne Vega, Bonnie Raitt, Los Lobos, Betty Carter,Sinead O'Connor, James Taylor, Yma Sumac, and narration by Ken Nordine. It sounds as though it should be a real mess, but Willner has put it together so it not only makes sense but is more than the sum of its parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One cut worth the cost!","review":"Bonnie Raitt's rendition of \\"Baby Mine\\" is worth buying this CD for all by itself.

Yet Nicolas Cage and T a Leoni pull it off pretty well.The basic story is a \\"what if?\\" a single successful man is shown what it would be like if he had married the girl he left. He wakes up in the new environment and is disoriented. One good touch that you do not see to often is that the daughter (Makenzie Vega) perceives the change and helps him cope with his new life.

It turns out that the guy is an angel, sent to give Jack a \\"glimpse\\" of what could have happened thirteen years earlier if he had not left Kate.

Here, Nicolas Cage is an arrogant yuppie businessman in Manhattan, who one day wakes up and finds himself in a paralell world, living a supposedly dreadful life in suburban New Jersey with his wife (her former girlfriend, in his previous life) and his (previously non existent) kids. The beautiful Tea Leoni, as the wife, deserved better than to be in this movie. The movie chastises the main character for not raising a family, yet the film shows family life as dreadful. The idea that Nicolas Cage had to sacrifice a family in order to get ahead in business is also phony. Most male yuppies are married; it's the women that usually have to made those sacrifices. Also, this movie is supposedly critical of heartless capitalism, yet it ends up celebrating it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Stupid","review":"The acting in this is fabulous.The sets are wonderful.The pacing is good, for this kind of fantasy-based thing.However, the values preached are little short of hideous.The \\"family man\\" (Jack Campbell) is given a graphic choice between two lifestyles: the hyper-hedonism of a mega-merger stockbroker, and the frantic dailiness (diaper-changes, picking the kids up, etc.) of a suburban housedad.Remember: when given a choice between (a) or (b), choose (c).These two choices are both soul-destroying, and to force anyone to choose either/or is the depth of sadism.And the end of the movie suggests that he can have BOTH--Hell squared.Why would anyone want either?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie hurt me","review":"I don't get it.

The formula, although it has been done before and better, is still interesting. Rich man chooses career over love, but what if fate gave him another chance or a \\"glimpse\\" at what his life might have been. This movie, while having its moments, is slow moving and just when you get in the groove of his alternate existance they pull the rug out from underneath you by making the characters so far removed from their other life its impossible to cheer for the current couple who are both wealthy and out of touch.

How very wrong I was.There's always something that creeps me out about Nicholas Cage. I don't know whether it's his eyes, or that someone can have such an obsession about a long dead star, that they will marry their daughter, and then get divorced a couple of months later. What is he trying to prove?The film is a mix of other different films, most noticably A Christmas Carol, but much worse. There's basically two realities in this film, much like there was an alternate reality in Back To The Future.It's just not a great film, I don't know why people are making such a fuss about it.

A plot that has been done before (Heaven Can Wait, Made in Heaven) but intelligently, with wit and purpose. So many movies introduce clever plot angles and ideas but never fully develop them. \\"Family Man\\" is an exception.Tea Leoni is just wonderful, and Nicolas Cage gives yet another solid performance. Cage is one of our finest actors, and he doesn't disappoint here.The movie can be viewed by the unperceptive as mere entertainment, but to me it is more about our multidimensional nature. Nicolas Cage gets an opportunity to experience a completely different life choice in an alternate reality. He finds a deeper meaning to his existence, a life path which he would not ever even remotely have considered. The ending isn't \\"and they lived happily ever after\\", but another life path choice for both the main characters.

Anyway, Nicholas plays a successful business man and play boy in his best performance that I've seen. Then an angel disguised as a gangster puts him in a family life that would have been his if he had married his old girlfriend. The Family Man is a pretty funny and touching movie but the humor stops in the middle. However, there are some great performances from Tea Leoni and Nicholas Cage.

Go buy the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good movie","review":"Having seen the previews to this movie, I expected it to be just more Hollywood fluff. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this movie and by the sensitive acting by Nicholas Cage. Cage is the quintissential career guy, caught up in the trappings of success, but sadly lacking human contacts. Because he has no plans for Christmas Eve, he holds staff meetings on the holiday and doesn't seem to mind disrupting other people's lives. Through a bit of fantasy, he is allowed to see how his life would have been if he had married his girlfriend 13 years previously instead of leaving her for a career move. This is a heartwarming and thought provoking movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new approach to the trading places theme","review":"4 of 5 stars for the romance movie The Family Man.

Cage awakens to find a wife and kids where he was single before. The wife turns out to be an old girlfriend; so this is the life-path where he marries her. Hard to know if it was all a dream or not. No real explaination of how he got moved into this alternate life-path nor how he eventually returned to his original path. No explaination of Cheadle's \\"powers\\" or role in all of this.Nice relationship between Cage and his girlfriend/wife (Tea Leoni). Very believeable as a married couple with kids.

Nicolas Cage plays Jack Campbell, an arbitrage specialist in New York--wealthy, powerful, dealing with billion dollar mergers. Then he meets a black street punk, who apparently is actually an angel, and brags to him that he \\"has everything he wants.\\" That does it.Campbell is transported back to a life he might have had, if only he'd married his true love instead of going to London and getting into banking; a family man who has a lovable family, sells tires retail, changes diapers, and has to count pennies.How it turns out is for you to discover. I'll not ruin it for you. Tea Leoni is wonderful as his wife.

I do not even know who is in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but lacked anything memorable.","review":"There is nothing bad about this movie. Unfortunately nothing bad does not mean that the movie is really good. There is nothing memorable about this movie. It's a feel good romance. A good choice to watch once with your wife when there's nothing good on TV. If you watch it a second time you'll notice all the plot holes and loose ends. It loses its luster.What would have really helped this movie along is a little more depth - perhaps additional character development of the little girl Annie who provides the warm humor, but too little of it - or maybe an extra 20 minutes tacked onto the end to resolve (at least partially) some of the dangling plot lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAMILY MAN","review":"I THINK WE ALL HAVE THESE THOUGHTS.

Funny, yet sends a wholesome message that makes you set your priorities in life. Perfect cast for the characters. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully moving film!","review":"I originally saw the film just because of Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni...I thought it was an excellent story. It really helps you to appreciate how much more valueable a history with family and friends are in comparison with money and a career. Nicholas Cage's Baby Blues get you every time, and Tea Leoni's talents make you wish she was in more films. I wish they had shown more of what happened to them in the end, but it still screams \\"Feel Good\\" when you're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background tracks","review":"Although most of the information is correct, the description of the tracks containing background but no vocals is not entirely true.

The effect was almost like finally seeing someone you've known only by sound or text... Maybe by phone or internet. Now I had a chance to see the faces of those whose adventures I'd admired. And that was something special indeed.There's a lot of detail to be seen here (be sure to look for the kitten on the shelf behind F'lar), but you'll also see some interesting invocations of some known faces.

I have enjoyed reading the series for many years and continue to read the new releases authored by Anne and her son Todd, and now look forward to Todd continuing the series.The prints of the present Art book bring visualization of the Characters of Anne's stories to 'life' in my mind even further than my own imagination was able to give them.I have added this book to my library and have it to refer to when I reread the Pern Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Woods & Anne McCaffrey","review":"I think all the comments from other reviewers are valid. As a long time McCaffrey Reader, and fan of all worlds created by her; I'd like to point out that The People of Pern was a BC publication. I have never seen a one with first edition and I have many first editions of McCaffery's.I'd like to grip about the cover art on the American editions...they stink, and I have a tendency to purchase the British editions just for their cover art. Does anyone else feel that our US cover art stinks?I adore the amazing art of Robin Woods in this book. It is obvious that she worked closely with Anne McCaffrey and all I can say is Kudos!Get a copy if you can find one for a reasonable price.

You HAVE to pull the bow ALL the way back every time or the darts will get out of line and not shoot at all. (The darts are on a clip and it moves the next dart into position as you pull back the bow.) It is very hard to pull it all the way back. If you don't pull it all the way back even once, none of the darts will shoot unless you reload the clip. I would say that a child needs to be 7 or 8 to get it to work consistently, but it would not be as fun for that age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A' Brakel a mini-Calvin!","review":"The four volume set so beautifully published by Soli Deo Gloria is a Calvinistic set of theology that is warm, practical and extremely Biblical.

But I'm glad he broke that promise. He has since recorded a few live albums, but this is easily his second best live album, rivaling 'Live' as his best. These are long compositions, filling up the two CDs with quality Schulze. The fact that the compositions aren't titled but numbered speaks to how cohesive the work is. This is not a major work, and it's not the best place to start (like X or Mirage or Blue), but it IS a must-have for any fan of Klaus Schulze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Book","review":"This now out-pf-print CD on Bethlehem/WEA is an early offering from tenor saxophonist Booker Ervin. Recorded in 1960, it features Zoot Sims also on tenor sax, Tommy Turrentine on trumpet, Tommy Flanagan on piano, George Tucker on bass and Dannie Richmond on drums. While Ervin has not fully developed the style he would exhibit later in the decade on Prestige and Blue Note, that signature robust, squawky sound is already apparent. A contrast in tenor sounds, old school and new school if you will, is especially evident when trading fours with Zoot on the title track. For interested parties experiencing sticker shock for the prices this collectable is now fetching in the Marketplace, know that this very same material has been reissued with two other early Ervin efforts asBooker Ervin Sextet, Quintet and Quartet. The Book Cooks / Cookin / Thats It!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"Jeff and Marge do such a wonderful job explaining what Christian marriage is all about. Both give practical suggestions that they have learned through there own relationship. They use the Scripture to interpret Scripture and are dead on right with the relationship that a husband and wife are to have with one another. I am a pastor and I give this book to each couple I counsel with and marry."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the style of G.A and K+D...","review":"... and it has to be said to be a worthy and solid album with a distinct style of it's own. There are cross overs with other bands mentioned but it seems this is largely due to sharing a genre, a genre which explores groovy retro rifts and mixes them with ambient rythyms and hypnotic beats.Unlike the other bands mentioned and their landmark albums (Vertigo and the K+D Sessions), this album doesn't quite get that far. There is the wonderfully mellow and nostalgic \\"Slip into something...\\", but really as far as memorable tunes that become a part of ones history, that is really all there is.The other tracks are clever, worthy and ambient but very forgettable. Still this is a lovely album which expresses a good deal of musical intelligence and is an audible tonic, worth a try and the purchase and worth watching these guys as they hone their skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BBC Mystery - Where's the DVD??","review":"Like other reviewers, I first caught The Ice House on a Sunday night edition of PBS' \\"Mystery\\" and absolutely loved it. Great story, good acting and Daniel Craig definitely establishes his sort of quirky but down-to-earth hunk cred. I'd love to own the film, but I'm trying to hold out for the DVD. Come on, guys, he's James Bond now. Can't you do a tie-in or something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent version of Minette Walter's book","review":"This 3 hour video is a great rendering of the book. The characters are finely drawn and the tension is exellently portrayed. An especially fine performance is made by the young actor who plays Jonathan, Phoebe's son. The final confrontation is interesting and unexpected. Another wonderful BBC production!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Order Again","review":"I bought these to mail scarves and they work very well.

Don't buy","review":"I know it might be bad but never thought it would be this bad. thin as can be, poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh times was too harsh too watch!!!","review":"First off, I am only giving this movie two stars for the way Christian Bale looked in his \\"wife-beater\\"/undershirt. Other than that, the rest of this movie was abysmal. Bale was terribly miscast in this role. The thug routine does not fit him. His talents were wasted. Freddy Rodriguez' performance was forgettable and the dialog between the two was horribly written and executed. We will not even get on the horrible accent since other reviewers already mentioned that. Eva Longoria had minimal screen time and I was wondering what the purpose of her character was. In addition, I looked at the end credits and I noticed that Bale was one of the executive producers for this. He should have rethought about putting his name on this mess. Overall, this movie was a hot\\"100 degree\\" mess. Please avoid this like a beat down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh Watch","review":"Harsh Times, another Christian Bale movie. I love and adore all the acting that Bale does. This movie however fails to deliver in what I would normally consider the quality level that he normally lives up to. The movie is slow and sometimes painful to watch. With Christian Bale I never think twice about purchasing a movie. I should have done my research though on this one. Bale plays essentially a street thug that feels his life has fallen apart when he didn't make it to the LAPD on his last attempt. He lives the drunken life of a street thug and the violence, while may fit the tone of the movie does not quite gel properly. The movie feels disjointed and awkward."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for some decent acting...","review":"No matter how compelling Christian Bale is or how well the other actors support him, this movie stinks. There is no connection to fact or real life in this film. The story has no plot beyond watching an out-of-control poseur (Christian Bale) who is blindly followed by a completely spineless pal (Freddy Rodriguez) into one disaster after another. I don't see how someone can extrapolate from this sad piece of work, as one review does, that ex-military people are not suited for some line of work anymore than women, short people or Latinos are not. Christian Bale's character is completely unbelievable as an Army anything much less a highly trained and disciplined Ranger designated marksman (aka sniper). I have seen Bale in other roles where he was excellent, but in this case his fine work amounts to putting lipstick on a pig. In the end, it is still a pig. You can kiss it if you want to, but I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT THRILLER","review":"Produced by the main actor of the film, Christian Bale, and written and directed by David Ayer who already wrote the screenplay of TRAINING DAY and DARK BLUE. Spectacular road movie in Los Angeles featuring two friends: a psychopath who wants to be hired by the F.B.I. and the weak-willed boy-friend of the lawyer Eva Longoria. Haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harsh Times Indeed !","review":"\\"Harsh Times\\" takes you on a rollercoaster ride into the twisted psyche of a deeply disturbed individual. Who better to do this than Christian Bale, one of the greatest actors working today. He takes you deep into the mind of a self destructive and tormented character. Harsh ? Yes, but Bale makes this movie well worth watching and his performance will certainly give you something to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A study in self-destructive behavior","review":"Christian Bale (Jim Davis) is really psychotic in this movie. And he takes Freddy Rodriguez (Mike Alonzo) on this ride of deception, rip-offs, lies, self-indulgence and violence. Just when you think he's changing his ways, Davis sinks deeper into a morass that leads he and Mike to places and circumstances out of their control. Eva Longoria is the long-suffering Sylvia, Rodiguez's girlfriend who must put up with Mike and Jim's sick antics (mostly unbeknownst to her). The end wasn't shocking, but well expected, seeing the deadly path Bale was taking as the movie progressed. Bleak and pathetic existence of two friends, seemingly going nowhere but down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay attention","review":"I actualy just finished watching this movie on Showtime...I read alot of the reviews on here and I noticed alot of you didnt pay enough attention. for example, Jim was offered a job with Home Land Security not the F.B.I.,....anyhow, I bought this movie over Training Day...That should give you a clue of why I'm rating this a five star movie...Except for nobody really says pisto anymore.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money from America","review":"Who ever invested money in this production needs therapy as they have obviously got more money than sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This is the third time I've written a review for this movie.

I was wrong. The script is horrible. Performances are inconsistent at best. None of the relationships make much sense. I'd heard it was good, and really wanted to like it, but it was all I could do just to finish it. Seriously, don't even bother renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable movie","review":"The reviews of deeper meaning to this movie...there may be some truth but this movie is not the one to see.

If you must see this movie, wait for the next showing on Cable...that is where I was introduced to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Bale movie to date","review":"Let me first start by saying I am a huge fan of Christian Bale but this movie was incredible bad. Now Bale does however play a great psychopath in this film but the plot is nonexistent.

I am a huge fan of Christian Bale and have enjoyed all his other movies. This movie is not very good. Bale does the best he can do with this weak plot and weak script. You may want to pass this by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"Oddly enough, considering the cast and the high quality of acting I was very disappointed in this movie. The story is both boring and exceedingly predicable. Could any two human beings be so monumentally screwed up and succeed in life at any level? The lead character is not only a lowly mess but a complete looser. Not only did I find it hard to relate to the character, it got to the point I didn't even care. I turned the movie off within just minutes from the end not being able to stomach it anymore.Its just a study in the worst of humanity slithering around in alcohol abuse, drug abuse and misery. This movie proves if you give good actors a poor story a shallow script and pathetic dialog you can't expect them to pull off a decent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book One of the Asteroid Bores","review":"This was my first Bova book, and will probably be my last. I finished it only because I had \\"made it this far, so I might as well\\", and also because I was waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen involving some sort of action sequence. But no....there was nothing.Though there are some positives: the science for the most part seems legit and interesting, although the extent of the negative impacts of global warming may be more speculation on Bova's part. (no political affiliation here, just my opinion!) Also, one or two of the characters was likeable at times(although most of them were quite annoying!)For somebody to give this book a 5 is laughable! As some other reviewer noted, seemed more like a \\"soap opera\\" to me. In fact, all you need to do is change the cover, and you could put this one in the romance section! Oh and by the way, this guy has some serious sexual tension built up inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bova used to be good","review":"I used to really enjoy Ben Bova's books. Examples such as \\"Colony\\" and \\"Millennium\\" spring to mind. Unfortunately his more recent works (including this one) tend to read like poorly written soap operas. The science is still good though in this world where hard science fiction seems to be disappearing in favour of fantasy. This will probably keep me buying his novels but I do it with more trepidation than before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the sequels are better","review":"I was disappointed with Ben Bova's The Precipice. Since others here do an excellent job of recounting the novel in detail, I'll just mention a few things:1) Often the most exciting parts of the novel are only ancillary to the main story.2) Bova's climate alarmism is readily apparent and annoying.3) The so-called \\"New Morality\\" makes no sense (i.e. it has no basis in the reality of what people believe today and where those beliefs seem headed). Bova simply comes across as mildly anti-religious.4) Much of the novel seemed downright dull, plodding - as if Bova was terribly bored with his own creation and simply going through the motions.I really wonder if the sequels are any better, or if they're even worth the effort. At this point, I would have to say probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great character development. Good plot line.","review":"My review here is similar to my review of \\"The Silent War: Book III of The Asteroid Wars.\\"Bova does a superb job of keeping all of the stories in the \\"Asteroid Wars\\" series connected. When you begin the next book, you feel as if you have not skipped anything. Bova is at his best regarding story telling and character building.I did not give a rating of 5 stars for the following reasons.--The story does not discover something new. I like Sci-Fi to examine science discoveries human or otherwise.--There are no mysteries. It is a typical story about business vs. government and human greed vs. altruism.--Bova lends credence to the notion of climate change.I recommend this story to Bova fans and Sci-Fi fans.Have a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not there","review":"Sorry Ben, I can't even finish it. You should get a new editor. Lots of great ideas that just don't manage to pan out. I just kept hoping (expecting) it would get better. Then I read the reviews here and realized, its not going to get better. It just as superficial all the way through. I have so little time to read and live in these wonderful Sci-Fi worlds. I need to use my time to enjoy one that truly takes me away from the present day. I honestly don't mean any disrespect but I cannot recommend this book to anyone. This one needed another draft. In fact, I'm wondering if maybe you are letting someone else write your books now, outsourcing, taking advantage of writer mills maybe. I'm sorry. It just wasn't up to the stature of your reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to see here","review":"I'm a huge fan of Ben Bova, but this novel is simply not good. As a continuation of the chararcter Dan Randolf, I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, the book really becomes nothing more than Randolf running around begging for money. I also think the book is missing any kind of real climax, it's really a setup for the next novel in the series (I assume).I thought \\"Colony\\" was an awesome saga. \\"The Precipice\\" is aweful soggy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virgin must be losing it's touch","review":"After listening to this album (over and over), I can't believe that How We Operate was the first time I'd ever heard them on the radio.

It's wonderful how good this sounds with earphones on and no distractions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Magic","review":"It don't get much better than this, my metalheaded friends. Grand Magus is awesome and I think this is their finest achievement, even though it is different from their first two, which were more doomy. This one bristles with metal and is tasty in the songwriting department--which is really important to me. And JB is a superb metal vocalist IMO. A grand, superior achievement. Buy now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a gamble, one hell of a book","review":"The authors because of their access to previously classified files have given us a new look at a frightening time in world history. My first memory of world political events was the assassination of John F. Kennedy. For those somewhat older than me, those days in late October 1962 when events in Cuba placed the United States and the Soviet Union on the brink of nuclear war have as stark a mental imprint as the events of 9/11 do for many of those alive in 2012. This well-researched book should be in every public library and should be read by anyone with an interest in American foreign policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise Leaders on Both Sides","review":"This was an excellent impartial account of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The follow-up to the great \\"Powerful People,\\" Storm is a remarkable set of great pop/jazz fusion, with incredible arrangements, engineering, and vocals. From the dramatic and dynamic \\"Storm at Sunup\\" which segues beautifully into \\"Love Me Now\\" to other fine tunes like \\"Where Am I Going\\" and \\"Keep on Walking\\", this is one of Gino's showcase collections.

Most of the songs on \\"Tin Drum\\" could be described as funky-Asian-art pop with the occasional synth-ballad such as \\"Ghosts\\". The lone instrumental song here is the wonderfully evocative \\"Canton\\". At under forty minutes long, this album is short & sweet and as art rock albums go, very accessible. If you want to hear something fresh and different, go for it, Cantonese boys & girls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this album!","review":"This is such an amazing album. Totally unique, it is impossible to classify. It boasts Steve Jansen's angular percussion, Mick Karn's fluid bass, Richard Barbieri's weird washes of sound and of course Sylvians silvery, haunted vocals. Throw in spashes of oriental sounds and you have an album that stands alone. This sounds like nothing else and is totally beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the Top 100 Albums Of All Time!","review":"just when you thought \\"gentleman take polaroids\\" couldn't be toped.....A Gem of an Album, not 1 flaw is evident on Any Song!. Very Gutsy turn for japan.Japan TRIED to sound ...uhhh?...Uncommercial, but due to the brilliance, this was japans best selling album!Sylvian has always tried to stay out of the public eye, but with \\"Tin Drum\\" he become more famous then any one could have imagined, at the time.although none of the material is \\"radio flavor\\" it steps into: music for Great thinkers/not for dummies.sylvian has done many great albums, only \\"gone to earth\\" comes close.this album is mixed with - world music, Alot more percussion, creative lyrics, top ballads and a nice instrumental \\"canton\\". This is Not New Wave, maybe close to Pop/adult contempory?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"As Japan progressed from their early years, their sound evolved into a rich, beautiful and innovative style that was unique to the period.Many have said that David Sylvian was attempting to imitate the more mature vocal stylings of Bryan Ferry. If you listen to their early albums like Adolescent Sex and Obscure Alternatives, the deliberate change in Sylvian's vocals are dramatic.It's pretty obvious he needed to tone things down to accompany the more textural music they were creating. And, does anyone else wonder why a band called Japan was so obsessed with China? Tin Drum is a wonderful collection of songs but the oriental influence is a little overplayed. Gentlemen Take Polaroids is their true masterpiece. Had that been the only album they ever did, Japan would still be one of my favorite bands of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric and Bass Heavy","review":"What's not to like about Mick Karn's bass playing? More than David Sylvan's vocals, his fretless playing defines the band's sound and you can hear his influence in the bass playing of Duran Duran's John Taylor, Pino Palladino and others. The repetitive nature of Japan's songs is the only reason this album gets four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 of the best in the world","review":"CD is sitting on a shelf collecting dust, now. CD was played so much I could probably sing and play the instruments (NOT!) Just look at David's hair (perfect), listen to the lyrics (perfect), and then listen to the music (great sound). I can't even describe it, but I can say that his voice sounds very Bryan Ferry-like, but the music is in a class by itself--many influences but none of which can be classified. After a few listens, you're hooked and then you sing it and then you crank those speakers and then you just get happy that you listened to one of the finest records of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real \\"Hollow\\" folk were the Authors","review":"The rating I gave this book is for the purpose of recommending it to others and not for accuracy of content.

If I could find them locally at this price ($19.99), I'd grab all I can.

But he's also done quite a few short pieces, especially on albums from \\"Platinum\\" onward. And this collection of those type of works is perhaps the best. Oldfield's multitracked self-played style here is augmented with extra players, including Phil Collins, and he even takes on such things as ABBA (\\"Arrival\\") here to amazing results. Oldfield in places rocks out, works with hymn-like pieces, returns to the glossolalic vocals from \\"Ommadawn\\", hands in some fine Celtic-styled bits, and so on...all in the span of one concise album. For those who don't exactly have the patience to sit through some of Oldfield's long pieces, this is a perfect starting-point, and it's certainly an album that's been a favorite of mine out of Oldfield's body of work since discovering it shortly after it was released.

Other reviews about noise and quills didn't affect me. You can tell its filled with feathers but they're extremely soft.

It was featured in the Karen Carpenter TV movie and was apparently shelved from an old studio session. \\"Remember when Loving took all Night\\" and \\"Slow Dance\\" are also stellar. Just listening to \\"When I fall in Love\\" and \\"Little Girl Blue\\" (although these can be found in \\"Interpretations\\") also makes me wish she has done an entire album of standards.

This book covers some excellent, PRACTICAL techniques and basic coverage of composition: what is and isn't good composition, how to create a good composition, and a review of compositions past masters have used. It covers basic equipment, techniques, of geometric shapes and their application to real world objects, types of drawing tools such as pencil and ink, and their uses and styles.

From the beginning I was plagued with spotty flatware, plates and especially glasses.That's why I decided to call in some back up and give the Jet Dry products a chance.

The dishes come out essentially dry and unstreaked and I have no complaints. I have not been using the heated dry cycle but the dishes still come out mostly dry except for some plastic cups which may have a few damp spots on occasion.

Overall the construction is great except the feet have started to come off on the edges (and yes I DO use an adequately sized mouse pad). There is no sidescrolling on the wheel which is another minus for me. My main problem is that the mouse has recently developed a double-clicking issue where I click only once yet the mouse outputs two clicks. Needless to say this is extremely annoying and intolerable on any mouse. Yes I do play a lot of games where clicking is required but my Logitech G5 has lasted around 2 years now and is still going strong.In my experience Microsoft mice always junk out after a couple months... My advice is to get a Logitech instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great mouse but SO many issues with software","review":"1st 2 weeks it worked great, excellent weight balance, sumer smooth, all you can ask for.

It seems like the issue when you reset and you have to unplug and plug again but this issue is different, and of course if you go to microsoft they direct link you to razer and in razer the only support is the firmware/driver update that i already did and didn't work at all.

THis is not true. THis, in fact, was the last great AC/DC album, even coming after \\"BACK IN BLACK\\". IT has John Mutt Lange production, it has some great rocking tunes, Phil Rudd is still delivering the goods, Johnson could still sing. The album is tight and straight-forwarded. We can see clearly here the decline in the lyrics department ( Brian is no Bon ), the lyrics began to sound so dumb and ridiculous I could not believe. One last thing: if some of you say this album is not good, what about the Simon Wright era albuns ??!! What about \\"BALLBREAKER\\" and the recent \\"STIFF\\", where Johnson can't even sing, the lyrics are worst than ever and Phil seems to be sleeping ?? The plain truth is: after \\"FOR THOSE\\", AC/DC was never the same.

And after all these years, \\"For Those About to Rock\\" continues suffering an unfair comparison to the striking \\"Black\\". But Brian Johnson should have laid to rest forever any questions about his worthiness to succeed the late Bon Scott with this set - he was more than worthy and, in several ways, a superior vocalist. The trademark AC/DC riff-and-roll crunch is still in full heat. Angus Young is still the master of understated metallic guitar grace. The songs themselves aren't exactly killers, but neither are they turkeys. You can do a lot worse than this for following up your unquestioned masterpiece - and most of the metallic meatheads have indeed done worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminally Underrated","review":"Okay, AC/DC with Bon Scott will ALWAYS outrank AC/DC with Brian Johnson, but this album ain't half bad. Apart from Brian's first (the classic Back in Black) and his last (for now...the reinvigorating Stiff Upper Lip), this is his best effort for the band. I can't name a bad song off this album, and I think the only reason it suffers in the eyes of fans is because it came a year after their powerhouse Back in Black. Any AC/DC fan should own this one. Highlights are the title track, \\"Night of the Long Knives,\\" \\"Snowballed,\\" \\"C.O.D.,\\" \\"Inject the Venom,\\" \\"Breaking the Rules,\\" ....actually, the whole album is a highlight. Don't miss out on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Johnson Proves Himself Again","review":"People bought \\"Back in Black\\" with the mindset that it was not going to be anything good because Bon died... everyone thought AC/DC was dead and not coming back. Brian Johnson proved them wrong, giving them the best-selling album of their career. Now, Johnson proved that he could make a fan out of people who had a low opinion of the band. However, with this album, he had to face the pressure of not disappointing his fans. He pulled it off. He did it. This album is the last GREAT album that AC/DC ever did. It kicks off with one of my favorite tunes by them of all time, and continues with the catchy \\"I Put the Finger On You\\". In fact, every song up until \\"Evil Walks\\" is PURE GOLD! After \\"Evil Walks\\", it starts to lose its edge. But it is regained by \\"Spellbound\\". Johnson proves that he is an awesome singer. It is about as good a follow-up as can be expected to an album that sells 19 million copies. Props to Johnson on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)","review":"After going though my AC/DC collection lately I have to say that this album seems slightly lack lustre in comparison to \`Back in Black' or \`Highway to Hell', but saying that it still offers up some decent rock music and gives a rough idea what the band is all about.Again, the title track is probably the strongest on offer and those cannon blasts shake away the cobwebs and show the band mean business. C.O.D. (care of the devil) is one that I particularly enjoy and starts off with strong drumming and ripping vocals from Johnson.This is the second album after Bon Scott died and showed the band were more than able to carry on and create some solid music to please new and old fans alike. It may not be as anthemic as the aforementioned albums, but it still a pleasing rock album to put on in those summer months and crank up loud.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"insperational buy","review":"I bought this album because I listened to the soundtrack of maximum overdrive which was all ACDC soundtrack and I heard the Vynal version back in 2004 so I wanted it"},{"rating":"2","title":"AC/DC again their finest","review":"It's AC/DC with their own brand of head banging music....Not for the easy listening generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is where the downfall began","review":"Well actually this is a pretty good album, the downfall didn't really start until 'Who Made Who' in 1985, but this is still nothing compared to AC\\\\DC's first six albums (High Voltage - Back in Black). This is a pretty decent album however. I really like the guitars and bass, I think the drums are cool too but the vocals of Brian Johnson are sub-par.

Back in black has many good tracks, but i feel ftatrhas a more in your face agressive rock and roll attitude. So many songs hit me as killer tracks. cod, night of the long knives, breaking the rules, the title track, lets get it up, and others.I feel this is certainly the best album for rhythm guitar and brian's voice, and in my opinion the best ac/dc album.And don't you guys make a big fuss just because some guy from england valued something over back in black!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best, But Has a Few Good Songs. . .","review":"I'm an AC/DC fan, I have 7 or 8 of their albums, and out of the ones I have (all Bon era save Powerage, Back In Black, this, Razor's Edge) I think that this is my least favorite. I'm not saying it's all bad, however. It has perhaps 3 or 4 really good songs. For Those About To Rock, C.O.D., Evil Walks and Night Of the Long Knives are all worth a listen. I'm tempted to say, however, that the rest of this album is pretty much crap. I think that they were trying to make the follow up to Back In Black (NOT their best album, btw. Highway to Hell is) and they ended up putting a lot of filler on it so they could get it out to the hungry masses before they got bored.

Starting with this album, the quality of the band's studio work plummeted. However, the title track stands up. For such a powerful song, it's worth the price of the CD. Brian's voice goes out right around this time period, which is kind of sad because on Back in Black he sang like a supercharged John Fogerty."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, there are better","review":"[...]I am a huge AC\\\\DC fan, but if you are looking to get an album of theirs, get High Voltage or Back in Black instead.While the songs on this album are good, there is only one really worthy of recognition.High Voltage is a great album, and made doubly so by the fact it is a Scott album and has real vocals in it. Plus it has T.N.TBack in Black is their best album, but I would recomend High Voltage over it if you are getting into AC\\\\DC because it is cheaper.In short, For those aboout to rock is one of theri best, but there are better.

Much of the wit is summed up in one of the scenes (which is only seen in the deleted scenes) when the lead character's friend mentions his situation is a little like the delicate situation in \\"Back to the Future\\" (a big hit that was just reaching the Eastern bloc at the time the movie is set). The tale revolves around a boy who has to keep the past alive for the sake of his mother's health and it illustrates both the excitement of those who experienced the west for the first time and the betrayal (in this case felt by his mother) of those who upheld the former regime. It's a clever look at social change in general and a bit of history that hasn't yet been seen often in film. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, slightly surreal comedy on the merger of East and West Germany","review":"If you don't mind reading subtitles (or, of course, you understand German) this movie is great. Some of the humor is visual, some verbal, so you have to be good with subtitle reading.The humor is subtle, that is to say it is tongue in cheek, not slapstick. It is not a political film, though it presents itself in a political context.The R rating is not really deserved - there is a little nudity but there is nothing shocking in the movie.It is a nice view into the lives of East Germans during the early chaotic days of integration. I dare say life now in East Germany is more brutal and more cynical.-kg"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual German movie","review":"I had missed this movie while it was in the theaters. It was praised highly in a book about the history of post-WW2 Europe and I decided to buy it to watch it.It is set in East-Germany. A mother, a convinced communist, whose husband has fled to West Germany, has a heart attack and falls into a coma when her son is arrested by the Stasi Eastern police. While she is in the coma, the communist government collapses and the Wall is taken down. As she slowly recovers from the coma, her physician advices her son, that any excitement could kill her. So, her son, together with some friends, decides to fake for her the continuation of the communist government on TV. But the real world interferes, when, for example, a huge Coca-Cola poster appears on a building across the street. The movie is, on occasion, very funny. In German with English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"transcending east and west","review":"I agree, fantastic film--but add this point of emphasis. It makes the interesting suggestion that if there were a race of people, more like the mother, and communism could be administered by as well as for such people--maybe then, but only then, would it be preferable to capitalism. In the end, her faith in what could be matches, unexpectedly, the faith of the socialist critics within the GDR, critics who, once reunification occurred, were swamped by millions desiring a share of the good life from the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fall of the wall and all new lives","review":"In this story a young man's mother has a heart attack, coincidently just before the collapse of the communism in the DDR. When she comes out of her coma East Germany is gone, swept into the dustbin of history, and along with it her status (for what it's worth) as a \\"Hero\\" of state socialism. To preserve her illusions and to prevent her fragile health from collapsing her son convinces friends and former coworkers to act as though the DDR goes on and contrives all sorts of elaborate ploys to make it appear as if the communsit state is still going on.A fun movie, if a little bittersweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous and heartwarming","review":"Good Bye Lenin! is one of the best movies to come out of Germany in the past few years. The film displays brilliantly the many conflicts of interest which gripped the German people during the events of 1989 and 1990. Actors Katrin Saß and Daniel Brühl perform wonderfully as mother and son. Alex's(Daniel Brühl)desperate attempts to keep his ailing mother, who is a staunch communist, from finding out that her beloved GDR is no more border on absurd, but it is this absurdity that makes his actions so poignant, and at times downright comical.The film's seriousness and black humor balance each other out, giving the viewer an intimate look inside the newly dynamic world of the former east Germans.I recommend this film to anyone, regardless of one's cinematographic tastes. Its truly a remarkable film that will be remembered as one of the greats in German cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"This was one of the first foreign films I had seen and kept me laughing at how a brother and sister can keep convincing thier mother that thier country was still divided and was communist, even though a Coca-Cola sign went out outside the mother's bedroom. From the fake news reports to the seriously outdated clothing this film was definitely an enjoyment to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was such a boring film. It may have some interest to people living in the former East Berlin, but for the rest of us.....BORING. So boring in fact that, very soon after watching it, I gave my copy to the local Op.

Normally, as long as the story plays in Italy, I am at least mildly entertained by that fact alone. With this book, however, I finally gave up after 2/3rds of it, which I can't say I've ever done on a book. Nothing happens. There is no action or suspense, the main character has zero personality, and the entire storyline is completely disjointed. The dialogues are as if spoken by people who barely master the language ... I guess, you get the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"bastante malo","review":"No comprendo porqué solo comentan los discos aquellas personas que se \\"tragan\\" todo lo que sea del artista en cuestión.

Este disco en concreto, no es sino una repetición de clichés ya usados y una serie de cancioncillas de las que hay a miles.Lo dicho, un disco bastante malo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moonlight Shadow is the only thing worth it...","review":"Moonlight Shadow is the only song that's good on this CD, just by Elements instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have it","review":"I love Crises! Once again Mike created a very powerful piece and was an impressive attempt at a variation of heavy metal. Like all of his CDs this track was full of harmony and the rock was great. I love Moonlight Shadow... the tune is very strong and powerful... if Maggie's voice was a little more powerful throughout the piece it would have been even better. In High Places is onna the best songs I have heard... it's dreamy and space-like mood as well as its powerful lyrics make this song truly unique and wonderful. Even if you aren't a Mike Oldfield fan, I would recommend this CD anyway. It isn't New Age either..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ol' print used by other companies","review":"No better or no worse than that used by most other studios for release.

BAD!!!","review":"The first night we used this a thunderstorm rolled in. It wasn't extremly sever, but it did last about an hour. Every seam leaked, horribly. By the end of the rain we had standing water in the tent. We ended up cutting our trip short, and returned it the following day. I was very unsatisfied with this tent, which is sad because all previous coleman tents I've used in the past faired nicely in the rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn Rain","review":"Just what I was looking for. After researching many tents I came across this one. It had many cool features and it was backed by Coleman's WeartherTec System(tm) \\"Guaranteed to keep you dry\\". I was impressed by their online claims that all tents were tested in a Rain Room and also in a Wind Room. The special features also included special \\"leak-free\\" seems to protect you from the elements. The tent worked great in dry weather. The first night it rained it leaked at virtually every seem. Even the door leaked at its' seems. With sleeping bags and pillows drenched we had to sleep in the car. We knew for sure the floor of the tent was water proof since we discovered in the morning that a small pool had accumulated inside. I had to drive 45 min. out to buy tarps. I really liked the tent, I just wish it where water proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"I searched for a tent that had a screen attached as I did not want to purchase a separate screen tent. I wanted the convince of an all in one tent. When I saw that Coleman had one, I jumped on it. This tent is fantastic! I love all the features including the tent light and hinge door. The fact that the screen portion did not have a floor was not a problem for me as most screen tents don't. The screen portion was a little small but manageable. It was very easy to set up and very easy to take down. With any tent you must always weather proof it weather it says it is or not. We did not have the time to do it with this one before our first trip and it of course did rain. The tent did leak. We called Coleman and they were very nice to work with.We loved the tent so much we exchanged it for a new one. We will be using it for years to come now that we have weather proofed it ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wet, Wet, Wet.","review":"We bought this tent last summer and used it one beautiful sunny weekend. It was great! Totally loved the tent. We used it a couple of months later on a not so nice weekend. It rained most of the 3 days and nights. We got very, very wet. The seams near the bottom are below the rain fly. water literally poured in along the seam. We woke up the first night to standing water inside the tent. All our clothes were wet, our sleeping bags were wet. It was bad! We had to cover the tent with a tarp and one of our freestanding canopies so we could make it through the trip. Even with this extra covering, it still leaked in at the few points we couldn't get secondary cover over. I packed it up and sent it back to Campmor where I bought it. They refunded the tent and the shipping. I've always liked Coleman. Maybe I just got a bad one. But I'll never rick it again. I'm getting a great Mountain Hardwear ten to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"first time use and it leaked after 20 minutes rain","review":"I bought this tent 3 years ago. In the last three years I set it up twice at our patio for kids to play in it.Last week we took it out camping first time. At midnight, it started raining. The rain was not too heavy and lasted for only 20 minutes. Water started getting in from the seams and our sleeping bag got wet.We were lucky the rain lasted for only 20 minutes, otherwise we would be all wet.I contacted Coleman through chat. They didn't seem to care and only offered to send some sealers.No more Coleman tent for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best!","review":"I've recently been turned onto Hatfield and The North. I had heard of them for years but finally took it upon myself to purchase some of their music. I'm so glad I did. The Rotter's CLub is a wonderful progressive piece that leans towards the \\"Canterbury\\" style of Prog but surprises me at the same time with other influences. I'm not one who likes to compare one band to another - but if you've listened to The Tangent (Roine Stolt, Andy Tiltson etc...) I would say this CD would fit along side them wonderfully. I think the musical ability of the band is great and the tunes come alive with repeated listenings.I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes the 70's style prog and the canterbury scene prog. It covers a lot of territory musically."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard reference for the intelligent light Canterbury","review":"Well it's inferior than the best of Zappa's stuff and that one of Isildur's Bane today as well, but it's the most influential of all the light/experimental Canterburian works...it maintains a great sense of measure, without the excess of certain experimental fusion French prog (in the vein of Art Zoyd or the experimental Magma or Dun for example); besides it has got an high reputation in the jazz canterburian circle of Canterbury (e.g. Matching Mole, Egg and National Health)and it is like \\"In the court of the Crimson king\\" by King Crimson as a prog fan's reference for the settlement of the first prog standard.\\"Mumps\\" and \\"Didn't matter anyway\\" are classic gems by Dave Stewart, with a great keyboard work as well.Highly Recommended to the fan of the intelligent Canterbury (much better than the whole Caravan's stuff!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Singer sounds like Roger Waters on Prozac","review":"Awesome record...Ultra-subtle musicianship...balanced and poetic and quite hip and trippy...definitely FUN to listen to and 'Up' but not trivial...not melancholy and brooding like King Crimson or too flat-out weird like Gabriel/Genesis or Zappa...definite sense of humor in the underlying attitude of these blokes keeps things in check and away from cynicism...melodic yet not in any way predictiable or cliched or derivative of other fusion bands of the era... no ego-tripping, wad-blowing solos a la Brand X or Mahavishnu but just plain impressive in overall imaginative intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"This is a Desert Island Disc for me as well. I've had this album on vinyl, now I have it on CD. Hatfield and the North makes music that is frantic, funny, complex and dazzling - sometimes in turns, sometimes all at once. It Didn't Matter Anyway is a great, sad song that I can always easily call up in my mind. Chaos at the Greasy Spoon sounds just like its title, and both the quiet and loud versions of Your Majesty is Like a Cream Donut are transcendent. Music will never see the like of The Rotters' Club ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced shipping and defective","review":"As a one-click shopper on Amazon I was shocked to see that Triathlete store.com charged me $7.95 for shipping. The belt was $7.95 and arrived in a shipping bag by Firtst-Calss Parcel Mail. Now to top off the outrageous price of $15.90 the belt arrived missing one snap.

The world's greatest genius trying to split Tasmanian beer atoms? Sure, that WOULD be funny if comedy experts like the Monty Python team got hold of this blatantly dumb movie. If you want to go out and rent what I can't even dignify by calling it a \\"film,\\" be warned: around an hour and a half of your life will be wasted as you try to understand why the supposedly witty humor and fine acting is totally nonexistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the dumbest movies in history","review":"Some movies are so bad they are funny inadvertantly. Not this one. Fingernails on a chalk board is preferable to sitting through this horribly unfunny movie. Yahoo (you can't be) Serious is just not a funny guy. I still can't believe I paid admission to watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"This is about the funniest movie ever (it's a very close call between this and Men in Tights - so hard to choose between the two!). Totally different style, which is very much appreciated. Clean humor, which is a rarity, but very well made and hilarious. I never look at chicken pot pie the same now. And most importantly, this movie corrects many common misconceptions people have about science, and instead teaches us the origin of carbonation and electric guitars. Very educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Rock-n-Roll music!!!","review":"This Soundtrack is loaded with pure, great rock songs and sounds from the movie \\"Young Einstein\\". The album features songs like \\"Rock and Roll music\\"(great remix,same one you hear in the movie) \\"Music goes round my head\\"-The Saints, \\"Great Southern Land\\"-Icehouse. Yahoo Serious is hilarious and has some quotes from the movie within the album. Seriously, Yahoo should of been a bigger star after this film,he didn't seem to get much help after makeing \\"Reckless Kelly\\". If you've seen this movie as much as I have and wonder where to get this album-order it here because any retail store selling it new or used won't have it(most stores will say can't order it,probably cause it's an import from Australia and no longer made, yeah it's not a demanding cd to get, BUT GET THIS ONE!, it's hard to come by, I just recently received it from these guys here at amazon and I'm really happy with this cd. \\"That's why I go for that Rock-n-roll music\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My All-In-All thoughts on Young Einstein","review":"This was definitely an entertaining film. It has some strong writing along with a solid acting job cashed in by Yahoo Serious, and some truly hilarious specific scenes.

(but then, I'm an Aussie, so I might just be biased!)

GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Australian for Hilarious","review":"Yahoo Serious (yes, that's his legal name) made this film in 1988, when I was three years old. I've seen it seven times, and I love it!This film is often considered to be terrible, as are Yahoo's other two movies. I believe that is because people don't understand Mr. Serious' sense of humor. His films are witty and satirical, and his comedy involves a fascinating blend of physical humor and intellectual jokes.I think this movie is incredibly funny, and if you like it rent or buy Mr. Accident and Reckless Kelly. No, Yahoo's hair doesn't look like that all the time, and no, Einstein didn't invent 4/4 time. But see this film anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, quirky, and funny","review":"This is a very odd movie. What if Einstein were an Aussie trying to put bubbles into beer? What if he hooked up with (a cute) Madam Curie? Let's have him invent Rock and Roll while he's at it.Definitely a cult classic with constant weirdness and imperfections, but a truly funny and enjoyable watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzie Einstein","review":"An excellent funny movie. There are some fairdinkum science references,some Newton's not Einstein's. The score features some good pub bands of the eithies.You have to take the whole premus of the film with a grain of salt. If you do you'll get a laugh and some relaxation.By the way, it's ajoke about Tasmania being an island off the coast of Australia. Well it is,but it is large and a state of Australia. And the scenes of it are actually the Blue Mountains about 100km west of Sydney, I live there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy, but I love it!","review":"I love this show. My favorite scenes are where he discovers the 4/4 beat on the hopscotch grid, and at the end of the movie where the bird was bobbing up and down to the music. It was crazy, but I just loved it. Being the prude that I am, though, I could have done without the \\"cheeky\\" scene in the mad scientists ward of the insane assylum. Loved the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yahoo Serious...seriously!","review":"This film is so absolutely silly and clever that only the hardest of prudish purists could not love it. Mr. Serious is seriously hysterical and natural, not to mention thoroughly adorable. It's like a controlled Jim Carrey, and the absurdism is not only natural but believable. This is a totally likeable film, with the most likeable of heroes. So glad he put bubbles in my beer, and quite a few in my outlook on life, absurd as it seems sometimes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ???","review":"I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of MIMIC 2. After all, it was the direct-to-video sequel for a science fiction film that didn't do very well at the box office to begin with. However, even with my low expectations I was disappointed. The film started off well enough, having a minor character from the first film become the lead in this one. However, nothing exciting was done with the concept. Instead, the premise of the original was stretched as far as it would go beyond belief. The last remaining Judas bug knows its time is running out. So, it has to mate so the species will continue to survive. However, this bug evolved to the point where it adapted to mimic humans. Therefore, the only creature worthy of it mating with is a human. Get it? Pretty twisted, huh? Good. Now, don't waste your time watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't mimic the success of the original","review":"This dire direct to video sequel lacks the humor and chills which made the original so enjoyable. This time around the roaches (known as the Judas Breed) are able to take on an almost human form. It's up to hypochondriac biology teacher Remy (Alix Koromzay) along with a cop and 2 of her students to destroy them. The only problem is they are unarmed.MIMIC 2 is generally rather tedious and adds nothing new to the genre. The only other interesting twist is that Remy takes a polaroid of herself at the exact moment one of her relationships falls apart; and has these taped on her wall. The movies ending is a real cop-out. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Why do sequels like this keep getting made?"},{"rating":"1","title":"mimic 2","review":"mimic 2 is a fast paced sequel, it does not explain itself well but considering many other sequels it is good enough.

I was not bored like some reviews previously but I definetly EXPECTED MORE from this movie. the extras on the dvd were very interesting. bottom line: rent it and curl up with your boyfriend or girlfriend-------you could have done worse(people who know movies know the what the bad ones are)---taunt little thriller that tried!----many others don't"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Horror = Mimic 2","review":"This movie takes the cool concepts of Mimic, and then abuses, burns and trashes all the scary moments the first movie brought us.This movie is slightly worse than watching an ant hill in the summer. if that is your idea of fun - then enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Style","review":"I recently bought this album on EP, in a 2nd hand sale, but I wish I'd never done it.

I bought this remastered version in part because the increase in quality in the remastered version of \\"Hergest Ridge\\" is remarkable. Well, sad to say, there is much less of an appreciable difference in Incantations. The CD recording was already very clean, and there isn't anymore detail in these new versions. But the worst problem, pure sacrilege, is the missing beat in the vibraphone section at 12:38 in part 4. As of today, 11/23/2011, this error is still in the files offered here on Amazon. It makes me want to get my money back. So, for now - please don't buy this. Don't get me wrong, this is probably my favorite Mike Oldfield piece. But messing up the mastering is inexcusable.

It cools off as you move up the wall but it still hot 24\\" above the heater opening.I emailed the company and they said it's normal and won't harm anything.

They do heat nicely, the only problem with them is most of them have cracked. Sometimes they crack right away, sometimes they will crack after you turn them off in the spring. I have sent many of them back and they do send you a replacement without a problem. I have even been told to use joint filler to fix the cracks. They are like square pieces of clay, with wires running through them. I think the contraction and expansion of them being turned on to heat and then cooling down when off, cracks them. I've thrown a couple of them out. Wish they would come up with a model that does not crack. Other then that they are great, they do heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy These Heaters","review":"I bought seven of these heaters two years ago and everyone has developed severe cracks throughout the whole core. I have contacted friends who have also bought this product and they all have the same problem. I contacted the company by phone and was told the warranty had expired and to use silicone caulking to fill in the cracks.These heaters are poorly made. If you research other reviews (not on the company website) you will see similar complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"From the great reviews I really expected this heater to be wonderful but it fell short for me. It might be good for a room the size of a small closet but it did nothing for my bedroom. We couldn't even tell we had added any heat at all. It was really a waste of money for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Warm As I'd Like.","review":"I bought the electric panel radiator for the express purpose of saving energy but I just wound up cold.Quite hot in the center but the outer edges were cool to touch. I'm wondering if that's a fault found in my heaters since the product seems to have such rave reviews. It didn't have the heating power I expected. I found the small Soleus radiant heater gave of a lot more heat for 400w, which was the same amount the panel heater used.I live in Atlanta GA, which has quite mild winters so I was disappointed with the performance. But since the panels are permanently attached to my walls I may give them another try this winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM - DANGER!!!","review":"We bought this, installed it according to directions. It worked great for about 3 or 4 weeks. (We did have it on constantly during that time).Then, one night, we woke up to a horrible burning stench. It was coming from the heater. The spot where the wire goes from the unit to the plug was beginning to burn. The other side of the heating unit was begining to turn black and smolder. We unplugged and removed the heater immediately. It took about 2 weeks before the burning chemical stench left our room. I just THANK GOD that we woke up before it was too late.I still haven't contacted Amazon or the manufacturer to get my money back - still just too horrified. Please DO NOT buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware-Warranty not as it seems","review":"We had this heater for a year. It stopped working. Unlike we were told the heater is not automatically replaced. You need to ship it back at your cost and then they will decide whether or not to replace it! So, you will need to absorb the shipping cost which is likely not trivial and they will let you know whether or not you get a new one. Seems like a bait switch as far as the warranty goes. Also, as other reviewers have noted you should only use this heater for the smallest of rooms. In general, not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it claimes to be.","review":"The good thing about this heater is that it will heat a 10 by 10 room...eventually. This heater really needs to be on 4-6 hours before you can feel a difference in the room. If left on it will maintain the temperature to about 65 degrees. The web site says the average cost to your electric bill should be about 3 cents an hour and for me it was more about 30 cents an hour. I used the heater maybe 10 times the first month I got it. I left it on for about 10 hours each time and my next electric bill was $35 more than the previous month! Nothing else had change but this heater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Includes the 'official' vocal numbers but is lacking...","review":"Great. Most of these songs can be found on albums available from each artist. Some of the vocals sung in-film are disregarded for the professional versions that do a good job of white-washing credits with tinny soundtrack. But what I find to be greatly disappointing is the sore lack of Danny Elfman's contribution to the film in this 'original soundtrack.'Try again, studio.Look for 'Music for a Darkened Theatre, Vol. 1' if you want to hear Elfman's number and don't mind receiving a whole package of his other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"I've tried other products - Tite-Grip, etc. - and haven't found the perfect solution, so I thought I'd try this product.

You need the skill of a surgeon to use this.

This solo album came out before Peter Gabriel's first solo album. It was recorded in June & July of 1975 just after the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour. Peter Gabriel had just left the band, and Genesis had yet to record Trick of the Tail (November, December 1976). Steve Hackett's first solo voyage shows the depth of creativity which he only continued to expand throughout his post-Genesis solo career which began after his departure following the Wind & Wuthering tour. Steve continues to this day to do things most rock musicians wouldn't, or couldn't, do (like record a CD with the Royal Phil, or play the Vivaldi guitar concerto with the English Chamber Orch). The cover is one of many of the beautiful pieces of art work done by Steve's wife, Brazilian artist Kim Poor (greatly praised by Salvador Dali)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Improved Re-release","review":"This remaster has improved the faulty sound of the original CD release. This is very noticible in \\"The Lovers\\" and \\"Shadow of the Hierophant\\". The original \\"The Lovers\\" sounded like it was lifted from an old vinyl record that was scratched to hell. Now it is crystal clear with an airy sounding mellotron. The orginal \\"Shadow ...\\" was a little fuzzy but not to bad as the previous track. Actually in whole, the album benefitted from the remastering and anyone from a whole hearted fan (such as myself) to a newbie of Steve Hackett's solo work should get this.As for the two extra tracks...there not too bad. The live version of \\"Ace of Wands\\" is like the other live versions. So if you so not own a live Hackett album, this would give you a good idea on how he retools some songs for the concert. The extended playout of \\"Shadow ...\\" is all right, the extended part actually is at the massive end of the song. The other 3/4th are much the same as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly my favourite album ever","review":"Stunning. If ever there was an example of how far rock music could be pushed it was this record. Genesis lost far more than they could ever have realised when they let Hackett go - although it must be said his solo work is the better for not having to be first fed through the Banks/Rutherford/Collins filter. If Shadow of the Hierophant doesn't move you to flights of extasy then frankly you are must be a dead person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good !","review":"Steve Hackett was a bit deceived by \\"The Lamb lies down on Broadway\\"He wanted to prove that you can produce an excellent album without putting too much keyboards and vocals, well, he succeded.Very good cd, I listen to it not very often, but each time I do, it is a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated-hard at first-better each time you hear it","review":"From a purely musical point of view, not lyrics, I think this is on of the best albums of all time. The lyrics are a bit frustrating because they only tell a small part of the story and even with the original album abstracts from the book, you don't get a clue what happens in the story.On the other hand, it's a fantastic mixture of complicated (by rock standards) music theory. It uses unusual chord progressions, changes in meter (3/4 time, 4/4 times), changes from major keys to minor keys, and mixes many different kinds of unusual instruments. He makes the guitar sound like a harp interweaving the melody with the piano, vocals and other instruments. Plus, my favorite Cat Stevens trademark-lots of syncopation, not only achieved in the vocals, but all of the other instruments as well.All and all, I think I could dance to it - I give it a 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat in the 70/s80s","review":"My favorite is Banapple Gas.

Then there was that stupid stunt with the dusting powder.Mrs. Rodgers was just as annoying. As she was chewing Amelia out for her ineptitude, Mr. Rodgers shoves a piece of pie in her mouth to shut her up.

The title comes from a Bill Bradley quote about his hook shot, about how after enough of them his feel for the game was so good that he didn't need to look to see where he was on the court. He just knew. I guess it's probably a bit of the selection bias, but it's fascinating to me to read a biography of someone before they became who they ultimately became. In a way, it gives you a much more honest picture of what made them successful and a lot less opportunities to create that heroic narrative or sense of destiny.

This their debut recording, is really a solid performance by some well respected Canterbury musicians. Richard Sinclair(bass) and Pip Pyle(drums) were two of the founding members of Caravan. Dave Stewart(keyboard) went on to National Health and Bruford. Phil Miller(guitar) rounds out the quartet to present a band with one foot in Caravan influenced prog-rock with the other foot well in the jazz-fusion pool. They pull it off nicely. Where the debut is not quite as strong as Rotter's Club, it is still a strong album. The compositions focus more on instrumental chops than traditional songs (Sinclair does the honor of assuming the occassional vocal). This is not unlike some of Frank Zappa's instrumental work in that they are quirky, humorous and playful but delivered with skill and sophistication.

This is a sometimes brilliant, sometimes spacey, sometimes jazzy, and sometimes silly album. But, it is always great music to these ears. Listening right now to the female space vocals similar to a Gong album, then right into an intense march beat with Hammond organ. Awesome. I give it 4 stars as it can get a little dragged down but not for long. The Rotters Club is a 5 star effort, they perfected it for the second album.Phil Miller the guitar player is different than most I have heard and he is masterful. Richard Sinclair on bass, has jazz licks and a top notch voice, some great exchanges with Miller. Pip Pyle is one of the top 5 drummers in prog rock, damn he is good. Dave Stewart on keyboards and I suspect the musical direction is a master of his craft as well. If you like 70's mellow prog, you will dig this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Fusion","review":"'Hatfield and the North' and its follow-up 'Rotter's Club' are both absolutely essential '70s Fusion music. Fusion is one of the most unjustly criticized and neglected forms of music in the past 30 years mainly because the musicians can actually play their instruments! If you like early Return to Forever (Light as a Feather), early Pink Floyd, mid period King Crimson (Lark's Tongues in Aspic), Bill Bruford's 'One of a Kind,' mid-period Joni Mitchell or Crosby, Stills and Nash, you'll probably enjoy this record, simply because it's a mixture of all of them and unlike any of them.

Perhaps if maybe one of these characters were likable to the point of being able to connect with them, I would have enjoyed this movie at least a little bit.

An undercover cop starts to take the substance D drug, a new dangerous substance. He suffers soon from hallucinations that prevent him to concentrate on his job. If I was more than reluctant and dubious after having seen Robert Zemeckis'sBeowulf (Unrated Director's Cut), I don't have with A SCANNER DARKLY the slightest reservation. Richard Linklater's decision to use the rotoscoping animation device in order to recreate the paranoid world of Philip K. Dick was a very smart idea. Without a doubt, the film is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie","review":"This movie really makes you ponder. It's based off an old book that in my opinion was way ahead of it's time. It makes some interesting points about the society that we live in. I recommend checking out the bonus features and whatnot.

Toward the end of his life, Dick battled drugs and even claimed he was psychic. Yeah... so naturally Hollywood loves adapting his crazy books into movies...The big plot device was the scramble suits that kept changing images - something the book artfully executed, but in the movie it was silly.

Freemasons have no credibility. My only criticism is that Knight doesn't point out the masonic preoccupation of freemasonry with cabala.

Thiswas quite more detailed. Enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me?","review":"I was very disappointed by this movie. Granted that it is difficult to squeeze the entire time span of the book in a two hour film, the editing was way too choppy for a viewer who has never read the book to fully understand the full scope of the characters and the situations. Not only did they eliminated Nelly - the main narrator, they also eliminated critical scenes from the book, which would explain why Heathcliff came to be the tormented soul we know. The 2 adult lead characters enacting events that happen during their childhoods from the book is just comical. The actor who portrayed Heathcliff was intense but much too old to play the part. Orla Brady was good as Catherine, but not good enough to rescue this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters way too old for their parts","review":"The movie is ok. The movie's characters are way too old and not properly cast in the movie. Heathcliff and Cathy are young -- not near 40 ! Nelly is of their age - not an apparant 40-year old as shown in the movie! Joseph is written to be crass and you can imagine him an old, somewhat haggard man of poor speech - not a handsome, erect, well spoken servant. It was not well done at all. For passion and more believable characters, watch Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff and Anna Calder as Catherine. This movie detailed their lives from start to finish - not of the children's as continues in the book, but the passion was definitely there for the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment!","review":"What a horrible disappointment! I've tried to finish this farce since I spent good money on it, but I'm afraid I may find it impossible! The idea of a mid 30's actor and an actress not far from 40 portraying two teenagers is beyond absurd! And the scene where Cathy and Heathcliff are watching the Lintons fighting would seem like childish mischief if the actors had actually been YOUNG people. In two middle-aged adults, they manage to look retarded! And Nelly Dean was supposed to be Hindly's contemporary, not an old woman!

The wife sends the dentist to Chicago to collect a finder's fee for Jimmy. Meanwhile she tries to get Jimmy to kill her husband by telling him where he is and what he is up to. The story unfolds into many other plots and schemes of getting other people murdered, but I think it would be better to watch the show than read a synopsis. Enjoy the show.

He goes over to greet him, and finds out that his name is Jimmy Tudeski (Bruce Willis). He then realizes that Jimmy \\"the tulip\\" is a contract killer. So, obviously, Oz is freaked out now.What's funny about the movie is how scared Oz is of Jimmy. He's always nervous and quite scared and makes really strange remarks. It's a funny movie that will deliver plenty of laughs. Willis, Perry, Duncan, and Kevin Pollak all deliver great laughs.

The interviews lasted less than 5 minutes per person. I didn't see a \`Gag reel'. I must have missed it? The trailer is just about standard now for DVDs.

This is a film you can watch more than once and enjoy every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whole Nine Yards","review":"The Whole Nine Yards is one of the funniest films I have recently seen, and I can't wait for the video release.The film is about an unhappily married, underpaid dentist (Matthew Perry) whose next door neighbor is no other than Jimmy \\"The Tulip\\" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), an infamous contract killer out on parole. During the course of the film, everyone wants to kill someone, and no one can be trusted. There are some interesting twists, which makes the film unpredictable.The acting is great. The comic treat in this film is Matthew Perry; he's very funny and charismatic. Bruce Willis's acting, however, is a little restrained, but his powerful stage presence is more than enough; his portrayal of Tudeski is excellent. Amanda Peet is a scene-stealer in the film; her comic timing is precise. I also enjoyed Michael Clarke Duncan and Kevin Pollack in their supporting roles. The only blemish in the film is Roseanna Arquette -- what's with the phony French accent?Great film. A must-see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You\`ll laugh if you want to.

Go in willing to have a blast watching silly people do silly things, and you\`ll have a good time. I spend the whole movie wishing Oz\`s wife would be shot soon. The comedy is very well timed, making the most out of each scene without getting exhausting. This allows for watching it over again. Leave your logic at the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyline is Good, Script Could've Used Better Jokes","review":"THE WHOLE NINE YARDS * * Story has a lot of good twists and turns, but the so-called comedy is barely there, save for a lot of Matthew Perry slapstick.

The movie would have gotten three stars if they had not made a few bad casting decisions.Perry's character should have been named Chandler. He should just stick to Friends. When the show goes off the air he should too. It's one thing to be type-cast, but it's another to only be able to play one character regardless of what the script calls for. He made this film painful to watch.Arquette's character was also incredibly annoying in this film. Her accent was enough to make you want to mute the scenes that she was in.On a brighter note, the hitmen were all very well cast and were the only thing that saved this movie from a single star rating. Peet's character was great - very sexy and very funny. Pollack's character was wery vonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageously funny","review":"What a refreshing twist: The Bad Guys v. The Bad Guys, with an ordinary shmuck, A Good Guy, ending up as the hero. It's a highly convoluted tale, but the twists and turns are easy to follow, delightful and surprising.The Bad Guys pivot on Jimmy \\"The Tulip\\" Tudeski (Bruce Willis) and the Good Guy role pivots on Nicholas \\"Oz\\" Oseransky (Matthew Perry), a dentist who seems condemned to a life of providing luxuries for Sophie, his greedy wife.I wondered how many retakes were required to produce some of the scenes that require split-second timing, as Oz tries to act cool when he faces each new revelation that he's high man on everybody's hit list...At a couple of points I was laughing so hard, I had to stop the tape for fear of missing what came next.

Picture this: youhave had a terrible day at work or school and need a movie pic-me-up.You pop The Whole Nine Yards into the DVD or VHS and watch it... well,about two hours later you are feeling ... a lot better... chippereven.

The thing is Perry's humor is falling down, crashing and hurting himself. On the other hand Bruce Willis gets to be funny in a few moments but still does the job. The script is very good and the acting is terrific thanks to the comic appeal of everyone, specially Perry. Some jokes are not well intended in this picture like when Amanda Peet and Natasha Henstridge talk in the bank.

I was pleasantly surprised. Although Perry DOES ham it up a bit but not in 'Chandler' mode! There are a couple of genuinely hilairious moments, look out for when he leaves for work on the first day - its a masterpiece! The story is not the strongest, ever, but it has its moments. It is very basic story formula: Matt Perrys' character is hated by his wife Bruce willis' character moves in next door( he is a hitman) Matt Perry gets thrown around. A lot. Thats all you really need to know. This film is quite predictable, but on a whole, a good evenings' entertainment.

Weak story. 4. Lack of humor. 5. Lack entertainment!Bruce Willis had so many successful roles but not in this one... not because his acting was bad but the whole movie is weak. You cannot compare this movie to Robert De Niro's \\"Analyze This\\" at all.The idea of the story is fine but how the story develops and takes place makes the movie weak.If you are looking for a nice commedy, go and buy Robert De Niro's \\"Analyze This\\" instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Life's too short, avoid this trash","review":"I rented this video after reading the many glowing 4 & 5 star ratings given here at Amazon.

Perry is a very tiring actor to watch in the first place and his efforts to go from the small screen to the big screen just shows that the transistion is almost always disasterous. The movie contains absolutely no suprises or genuine laughs, I found myself forcing a smile so I wouldn't feel this DVD was a total waste, but in the long run I couldn't fool my face into smiling. I think Bruce Willis was using this film merely to make a paycheck. \\"Hit Man\\" humor may on the surface look funny but this movie didn't work. I can see why it bombed at the Box Office.

The jokes fall flat and even the presence of the beautiful Ms. Zeta Jones can't save this movie but she does look good in it which is why I have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than its reviews","review":"As a Coen Brothers movie (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), this is a 3-star movie but among all movies, it's a 4.There is a lot that happens beneath the average movie watcher's radar here (not a slam of movie watchers, I wish I were less critical of movies I watch and I wish I could just sit back and enjoy them). The movie is very good and is VERY Coen Brothers.If you're expecting a War of Roses movie, you'll like this better than you expect. If you're expecting a ha-ha funny movie, you'll be disappointed.The best part of the movie is watching the characters par, dance, jab, avoid, and complement each other throughout the scenes.Clooney is fun and he goes from slimeball lawyer to a likeable guy.

The Coen brothers seemed to want to make a funny movie. There are some moments clearly designed to be funny. The movie has a lot of odd and absurd moments. Despite that, it isn't really a comedy. At times, it seems restrained in its humor, at other times the humor seems jarringly out of place. It's almost as if the Coen brothers' absurd style of humor and A-list actors like Clooney and Zeta-Jones just didn't mix. In the end, the film is just lifeless - except for Catherine Zeta-Jones, who looks gorgeous as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coen Brothers: Film # 10","review":"I enjoyed this film as I found it entertaining and fun, but I was surprised. I was surprised because there was nothing much more to the film. Being that this film is a Coen Brother's film, I guess I was just expecting a little more umph to this film and in the end I just never got it. Sure there were fun scenes, which could only be from a Coen Brother's mind. There was also plenty of twists as well, but for me the twists were obvious and practical next steps to the storyline.In the end, and as I really recall the film now, I did like this film a lot, but there was just something missing.

Well one thing is for sure...the title says it all. This movie is not only intolerable but it seems cruel to be so stupid. There are many recognizable actors in this movie which surprised me. Billy Bob Thornton makes an appearance and he is probably is the most fun and likeable character in the whole movie. WARNING: THIS MOVIE HAS NO PLOT, NO CLIMAXES, NO FUNNY MOMENTS, NOTHING, NADA, ZIP! Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do with your time, DO NOT WASTE IT ON THIS MOVIE!

Clooney manages to keep her from getting any of her husband's money and she vows to get revenge. There is a harum-scarum plot with an asthmatic hit man, a Scottish wedding, and various pre-nuptual agreements which usually end up in tatters on the floor. This is a pretty silly movie and the only surprising part is that two stars of this magnitude would let themselves be persuaded to be a part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"witty and funny","review":"this movie combines romantic comedy and screwball comedy and it really works will. so what if the opening scene is the best scene. the whole movie is fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"There were a few laugh out loud moments, especially with Billy Bob Thornton, but this is an ultimately forgettable movie.

And Zeta-Jones is totally wooden.Clooney Miles Massey is so ridiculous as to not be funny.Jones as Marilyn Rexroth is so predictable that there is no drama in the plot. You could see the whole plot 10 minutes into the film.

It started out ok but as it progressed, became more and more INTOLERABLE! The plot didn't go anywhere and didn't succeed to teach the viewers anything except that it is dumb. By the end of the movie i was feeling rather incredulous that anyone would bother to produce such trash! In all, this film is not worth your time or money.

This is a good comedy that I would reccomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad film","review":"When I saw the names of George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones together in the cast I knew from the first moment it was going to be a fail. George Clooney is one of those actors that make you smile, laugh or leave you serious. He can be in a comedy or in a drama. But this is not one of his best performances maybe becaue the female starring isn't a comic actor. In this film Catherine Zeta-Jones shows no sympathy, she's always serious, forcing the smile, cold and manipulative as usual. She can't make you -at least-, provoke a smile in your face. The plot of the film is ridiculous and it has some annoying things like the old boss in his office. I still don't understand the role of Billy Bob Thornton. The only good thing is the trial where we see some hilarious moments. Save your money and your time for a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzz!","review":"Bored me to tears.

The plot is so bad, so boring, so absurd, and the chemistry between Clooney and Zeta-Jones so totally non-existent that my girlfriend and I lost all interest in the film after the first twenty minutes and spent the rest of the time dozing until we simply turned it off after another fifteen minutes or so.

That solitary, poorly recieved act was, in itself, at least 48,000 times more entertaining than half this movie.I love Clooney (the actor, not the activist), and have really enjoyed Catherine Zeta-Jones. This, not to mention my adoration of movies made by the Coen Brothers (like Fargo and Raising Arizona).I don't know what happened with this one, but it's dark, entirely un-funny, and in a world full of D- and better media, I recommend avoiding this one.Hope this was helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"We couldnt stand to watch the whole movie","review":"My wife and I watched the first 45 minutes of the movie and decided that was enough, we couldnt watch anymore of it.

I was really looking forward to seeing Zeta-Jones and Clooney in this movie because the previews made it look like they had great chemistry. Boo, hiss!!!! This could have been condensed into a half hour episode of a below-par sitcom.Instead of more subtle humor, which might have helped this movie, the viewers are hit over the head with the silly slapstick.It was so boring, so absurd, and the only good chemistry between Marilyn and Miles was in the scenes that were shown in the previews.

But if you are in the 30's and up , you will hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Tripe!","review":"I guess along with Mars Attacks this movie rates as one of the worst I've ever seen. This is proof positive that no matter how much star power you have it is still no substitute for good writing. As others before me have pointed out the main characters simply have no chemistry and this is not for a lack of trying. Though they might attempt to exchange smoldering looks the result is flat and utterly uninspiring. How can you feel anything for a money grubbing woman who makes a career out of divorce and an equally shallow but 'savvy' attorney who despite being smitten by his client's wife is still too dumb to see through this transparent plot! The whole time my wife and I watched this disaster we could not help but comment it looked like a movie made by Hollywood insiders for Hollywood insiders. Is this supposed to be some sort of social commentary on Beverly Hills matrimonial life?

Or someone who's able to gauge when a movie is so badly botched, that it should never see the inside of a public theatre.

I expect it's something like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels or Heartbreakers. But this one is awful, stupidly made. The other two are far better. I have no idea what the two characters were fussing about.

In the begining you may think you went in the worng theater but George finally shows up! They are soo funny, George has an odd obsession with teeth, and Rex Rexwroth (One of Marilyns Husbands) has an obsession with trains! The plot has several twists that keep you interested, and hilarious dialouge! Every charecter is wonderful!

Others might like it though, because there are a lot of brain dead people out there who just love seeing the same hollywood plot over and over again.

I noticed the chemistry between George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, but they barely went anywhere with it. They had one 'romantic' scene and that's about it. I was left wondering what in the heck went wrong there. There could have been a lot more done with this movie, too bad they didn't take a different approach and have a great love affair between Clooney and Zeta-Jones.

I was very disappointed.For me, there were hardly any parts throughout the film that made me laugh. Both actors played their roles skillfully, but I thought the script could've been better. This movie, in my opinion, is very bland and unsatisfying. I think it's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, to be honest.The intolerable cruelity of the film is you watching it.This film didn't live up to its potential and I'm not going to add it to my movie collection anytime soon.

Once you get past accepting the premise that the sole reason people, mostly women, marry is to get a good divorce settlement you can appreciate the idea that we should all be giddy that Miles, the foremost in divorce attorneys, has fallen in love and wants to marry Madeline whose original goal of soaking him for the usual good divorce settlement has gone awry because she has fallen in love with him too.

This is a Coen Brothers film, so as you can expect there are plenty of colorful characters, and hilarious dialogue that is such a staple of their work. The good news is that it is a fine comedy with a much more sophisticated screenplay than anything else you could probably fine today, George Clooney gives a slimy (and great) performance as Miley Massey, and the film never gets dull or bogged down in the middle. The bad news is that Zeta-Jones is nothing more than a beautiful statue (definitely not one of the best actresses on the planet), as well as the film having no real sense of structure. It never knows what it really wants to be, which make certain scenes come out of nowhere and fail to connect to the audience. Still, this is a pretty good comedy and I would recommend it if you don't have anything else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable movie!","review":"For any Coen brother's film you know you will expect something different.

No additional minutes of music -- nothing. The Healthy Colours tracks are 4 alternative versions of one track done in the style of the David Byrne/Brian Eno Bush of Ghosts CD (another must-have). But Healthy Colours is weak, particularly since the 4 versions are so similar to one another; and they sound contrived.If you are such an Eno/Fripp enthusiast that you simply must have everything either one has ever sneezed at, such as I used to be, then by all means get this -- ya gottta have it. But if you want a real bang for your buck, buy the other CDs mentioned above and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesser effort","review":"I was excited when this came out, because I'd heard there was \\"new material\\" on it. Being a fan of the Fripp/Eno albums, I expected something interesting. The \\"Healthy Colours\\" material was a total disappointment. It was then, and it is now, just a bunch of noodling. To be more precise, all the \\"Healthy Colours\\" pieces sound (a) too Eno-dominated and (b) incomplete and lackadaisical. The high points here are the tracks reprised from the other two Fripp/Eno collaborations. Which brings up the question, why not just buy \\"No Pussyfooting\\" and \\"Evening Star\\" instead? And the answer to that is...well, you probably should. This can be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"no lo compre","review":"es una porquería de disco, yo lo tengo y al que quiera se lo regalo, no he soportado una audición completa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Teff","review":"I have had Teff before and this particular brand is nearly tasteless except for the after taste of grass.

This CD contains the entire Metro Music LP, a briskly stunning piece of new-wave power-pop, as well as a handful of tracks from Trance and Dance and This is the Ice Age (each available in the US previously only as imports). Anyone who listens to the two \\"Ice Age\\" tracks will hopefully try to seek out the entire album, as well they should - although never released on CD, even the original vinyl is worth seeking out to anyone who enjoys their pop with a brain, with a Roxy Music-esque twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music at it's best","review":"I had bought this cd years ago after watching Vanessa on PBS and could't believe the range she had on the violin.

I utilize them to share my ice cream creations with family members so I wouldn't be heart broken if I didn't get the containers back, but so far they always find a way back to me. I've washed them 4-5 times in the dishwasher (a couple times on the lower level, a typical no-no for plastic tupperware but my boyfriend seems to never remember this) and they're still in good condition. I'm not giving them a 5 star just because I figured the lids would be a little more substantial- not a biggie, they work great, I just am worried they may get morphed over time.

I'm a long time John Duigan fan, so I had to see it. And yes, this is a career low for him. But one of the major problems with this dvd is that it is using the studio cut of the movie, which removes about 20 minutes from the film. Is the movie any better with those 20 extra minutes? I don't know, but it does explain how some characters seem to just float through the movie. Their roles may have been reduced in the editing process. The movie is also just plain weird or goofy in certain sections (Molly's reaction when she sees the bodybuilders or when she wets her pants).Duigan is truly a gifted director: see Flirting, The Year My Voice Broke, or Sirens before judging his work or his capability. I just hope to heaven that he returns to writing his own films, as well as directing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Molly","review":"I found Molly a wonderful and inspiring movie about a woman with autism.

And I was really looking forward to reading this book when I found it at the book store. After the first part, I just could not stand the book. Rogers was so unoriginal with her writing in this book. Half the time I did not understand why or how a character got into something. You wish that it would just end in the next five pages. It annoyed me so much, the monologues and italics all over the place. An obsession with any form of the word \\"hypocrite.\\" I just could not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"italics all over the place!!!!","review":"I have never seen so many italics in one book in my entire life!

Calling this a movie is a far cry from the truth, though. It really is a documentary on MotoGP motorcycle racing, and it embodies everything about it.Watching this gave me new-found respect for the MotoGP riders. (AMA also, although they are a different breed) Every single time I watch this, it gets my adrenaline rushing from the camera angles and the data being thrown at you. You can really lose yourself in this if you're a rider who has experienced that fine line between riding and racing.The human aspect just adds that much more to it, with the rivalries that flare up into fierce competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"This was a real exciting movie about the history and culture of Moto GP. It contained excelent interactive scenes from races of the 2001-2004 Moto GP seasons. It gave a clear insight of what it takes to be and stay a Moto GP racer and that its not all easy as it seems.

To my surprise now it will be released as a box set with extras. Shame on Shout for doing this! Now those like I that have the whole sitcom on dvd are left wanting the pilot episodes and extras on the box set with only option to double dip and buy the set all over again. I would have Shout rather release the remaining 3 season that were left with extras which I would have bought. Let's hope there is a way we (those who have the complete set)can get the pilot episodes plus all the extras on a single or double disk release. Until then this release gets one star. Shame on you Shout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for some","review":"This was a present for my significant other. He loved it. We have watched Season 1 together.

Won't order from this seller EVER AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The story is given away up front...the rest is filler","review":"This movie starts out well, with engaging characters and enough intrigue to pique my interest. So I was really suprised when the whole story was laid bare within the first half hour -- I kept expecting some sort of twist to take things to a different level. Instead, some rather nonsensical plotting occurs in order to stretch things out. Even the characters are just filler, with no believable motivation behind their actions; they're just doing what needs to be done, saying what needs to be said, to get the story from point A to point B. I could've watched the first half hour, then skipped ahead to the last ten minutes, and been just as satisfied as if I'd watched the whole thing (and I wasn't very satisfied). If you're interested in what this movie might have to offer and haven't seen The Omen or The Ring, I suggest watching one of those films instead. Still, Case 39 is a pretty creepy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Was RZ directed to act frightened of the girl? A shame.

She merely appears to be so, and there are dark and deadly forces at work within her. The investigator unwittingly takes her on as a foster child and suffers the consequences, as do her colleagues and friends. Cooper, McShane, Zellweger, and of course Jodelle Ferland do a great job in their roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"scary but stupid","review":"Other reviews have commented on the unoriginality of this movie and I whole heartedly agree. This movie fails in so many departments one has to suspend more than the usual amount of belief in order to enjoy it. And I use the term enjoy loosely because there are many disturbing scenes in this movie involving young children that I contemplated turning it off. That being said the movie was pretty damn scary even though I knew how ridiculous it was. There was just to many cliches for me in this one but if you want to be scared you could do worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schlock","review":"A bad version of The Omen.

Why didn't the guy leave the bathroom when he was being attacked by the hornets he hated? Drove me nuts that the guy didn't just run out of the house when it was happening. As far as I got, the movie was mostly terribly negative and who needs that -- not me. Didn't finish watching this downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a soda with no bubbles...","review":"This is a movie that starts out far better than it ends. It had my attention for the first half of the movie. It does a decent job of setting up the plot, but then it seems to all become exposed in a way that left me thinking, this is missing some real pop. I get that the little girl has a demon in her but it's really just a random demon that has no tie to the star or anyone else for that matter. To me, it would have made more sense to tie the demon and Zellweger's mom or past together in a bit more of a personal twist. It does none of this. So 2 stars from me and I love Zellweger. Just too bad the demon has \\"zero\\" personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"It is definitedly a must watch, great performace from Rene, she couldnt do it better.

If this movie is any indication then she is currently undergoing quality of movie changes as well. This movie was absolutely dreadful and full of nothing but an unneccesary use of my electric utility. I don't know if Zelweigger is strapped for cash and willing to do anything for a buck but if she would stoop this low then watch for her on street sides on the shadier parts of town in an even more despicable method of money making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. Can't give it 3 stars...","review":"The best rating I can conjure for this film is 2 stars. And that's because of Renee Zellweger. The failings of this movie are not her fault.

Alas, the story lines in this series are so contrived and improbable that they completely dispell the illusion of close-to-the-bone realism this show tries to project. I watched 3 installments of this series and each time I was struck by the lack of authenticity in the characters, their motivations, actions (and reactions)-- beneath the \\"gritty\\" veneer, these characters are paper-thin and implausible (particularly the criminals). Creeghan's tendancy to vigilantism is disturbing, yet fails to convince (I mean the guy's a walking liability, a loose cannon obviously in need of psych-leave) The whole production emits a subtle, yet palpable air of manipulation, sensationalism & pretense. Want to see a truly gritty -- and thoroughly human -- British crime series? Watch \\"Prime Suspect\\" and skip these."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark and creepy","review":"Touching evil is dark and creepy genre at its creepiest. Robson Green is a cop who was shot in the head, died clinically and came back to this side. Maybe not so successfully either. Now he's assigned to an elite squad set up to work on tough cases that local police can't crack. Tough cases and lots of burnout take its toll on the team and personal lives. The first case (my favorite by the way) spins off threads that weave throughout the whole video. Nicola Walker does the tough cop beautifully, Robson Green is weak, strong, tough and confused all at the same while trying to put his life back together and Ian McDiarmid is incredibly cold and creepy as the suspect in the first case (told you it was my favorite) which I think is the strongest story too. I love dark, creepy psycho drama and this is right up there. Boy I used the word creepy enough,didn't I? Four cold hands up your back for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and well-written...","review":"This book made me read (or re-read) the Heroides, Clarissa, Jane Eyre, the Portuguese nun's letters and the correspondance between Abelard and Heloise.

If I'm taking a mental trip to wild, exotic, fearsome places; I don't want a cranky guide. Bill Bryson (Walk in the Woods)preaches too much--wants everyone to walk everywhere and eschew all drive-throughs. Tim is absolutely tolerant, apologizes for his wackiness and agrees fervently that taking a nap 250 yards from a grizzly bear takes a lot of explaining. His essay on llamas was worth the price of the book, informative (I didn't know llamas spit at you because you came too close to them. They just look like they'd love to be petted. Not so.) and funny. I found his descriptions lyrical. My curiousity was so aroused, I was looking in atlases and encyclopedias.

I had been a fan of hers for several years but hadn't read this story yet. She brings the people involved in this case to life.What David Brown did to his family is unthinkable. He molested his wife's sister, he manipulated his 14 year old daughter into killing his wife and then sat back and enjoyed his freedom and the insurance money from the death of his wife.While he lounged in a nearly 1/2 a million dollar home, now married to his late wife's sister, his daughter sat in the Ventura School (a youth prison). If not for three men, who went above and beyond the call of duty, David Brown would never have been convicted. Kudos to Jay Newell, Jeoff Robinson and Fred McLean.

We already know they're dysfunctional human beings who play on the emotions of others, so why go on and on about their history, love affairs, failed marriages, etc. Rule's books read more like the National Enquirer rather than true crime.

This should have been a typical romantic suspense in the deep south, complete with serial killer and happy ending. From the back cover, that's what it was...but then you got to the actual writing and it was awful. The heroine was weak, and so stupid both her husband and the killer commented on it. The only Southern stereotype that the author missed was blatant racism, but then again, there were no people of color mentioned. Finally, the storyline for the murders was so disjointed it made little sense. Body of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"This book is so forgettable, I've already forgotten the plot, and pretty much everything about the book.

The back seemed interesting enough.For one the first murder drags on and on and on with not much happening other then sorted silly affairs that don't make much sense at all. If the author intended to build a character background she failed. IF she was trying to make it look like there were possible other murders she failed. The 2nd murder in the book was absolutely pointless.The ending was horrible, it didn't make any sense even one of the characters ask well how did \\"the murder\\" try to drive you insane. The author simply had a lot of thoughts but could or choose not to finish them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental slush","review":"I downloaded this book under the mistaken impression that it was a history of the Scottish clan system, based solely on its title. (My own fault - I should have read the other reviews, rather than just going by the star rating). Instead I found it was a historical romantic novel, loosely based on the life of Sir William Wallace. The book contains little actual historical detail, and what there is does not seem to be very reliable. As a novel I found it tediously slow moving and padded with an excess of sentimental slush. However, I must confess that I gave up after 4 or 5 chapters, so maybe it improves. Written in 1810, the book may be of interest to a student of early 19th century literature, but modern readers seeking historical detail or even just a rip-roaring yarn will be disappointed. However, as the other reviews indicate, the book clearly appeals to devotees of a specific genre. However, it was not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Wallace was NEVER called Braveheart","review":"That was Robert the Bruce who was indeed an intensely religious man. (James Douglas, who carried the Bruce's heart on crusade. is said to have first uttered the words as Douglas was cut down in battle: \\"Lead on, Brave Heart, and Douglas will follow.\\")There is little evidence in the least that William Wallace was an intensely religious man although he did try (with poor results) to save churches in England from being looted. He did a poor job of controlling his men. Wallace was a brave man, a hero and a martyr for Scottish freedom. Unfortunate, this and the horrible movie by Gibson tell more lies than any truth about Scottish history and the gallant men who fought for Scotland.I wish I could recommend a good novel about Wallace. Unfortunately, I can't. I don't know of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"William Wallace and Robert the Bruce","review":"\\"The Scottish Chiefs\\" is a classic adventure tale, told in the style of Sir Walter Scott's \\"Rob Roy.\\" The National Hero of Scotland, William Wallace, gets his story told with a heavy emphasis on romance and drama.Those seeking a book version of \\"Braveheart\\" may be disappointed, as the story is quite different. The William Wallace of \\"The Scottish Chiefs,\\" like the historical William Wallace, is a castle dwelling nobleman who surrenders his fortunes to fight for Scotland. The writing style is thick, and should be familiar to readers of this genre. \\"The Scottish Chiefs\\" is a huge, heavy book with a plot that unfolds at a patient pace.This edition of \\"The Scottish Chiefs\\" contains illustrations by N.C.

My partner asked me what the smell was, and when I said \\"Dirt\\" he yelled out \\"It really does smell like dirt!\\" You might think that would be a bad thing, but it truly is quite amazing. The only con is that it wears VERY close to the skin. After about 30 min or so you don't really smell it unless you put your nose directly to where it was sprayed.

I thought they would be nice because they look so pretty in the picture... but they are NOT! They feel like a slip in slide or something... almost like plastic! Maybe I am not used to these kind of sheets but that is the LEAST of my complaint! I put them through the washer on delicate and after just one wash... the pillowcase have lost ALL shine! They look dull and nasty and the sheet set is all blotchy with dull spots! SAVE YOUR MONEY and don't even look at these! I was lured in with the cheap price... I believe I paid $19.99 for Queen Size.

This will be the first purchase I will attempt to return. When I unpacked the sheets I was disappointed with how thin they were. Then I noticed that the corners of the fitted sheet consisted of a piece of elastic that had the sheet shirred around it. I can't conceive of these holding up under regular use, much less withstanding a washing machine. Sometimes low prices mean a bargain. In this case you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality, you get what you pay for.","review":"I was very disappointed with these sheets. They are anything but \\"Luxurious\\". They are 100% Polyester Satin and they are extremely low quality, rather than being smooth and silky, they are thin, poorly made and only slightly shiny and smooth.

Save your money and wait for a deal on some high quality satin sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polyster sheets... YUCK!","review":"Sleeping in polyester is like sleeping in plastic bags.

They are very poorly sewn and some of the seams were already coming apart right out of the package! I also bought a pair that I had intended to give as a gift, and those sheets are equally poor in quality, so I know that it was not just a fluke that I got a defective pair. I know I should have been more skeptical when the thread count was not advertised, but they seemed like such a great price. I am appalled that these sheets were ever offered at the original price, since I have seen much better quality for much less expensive.

The silky feel is extremely comfortable, wonderful to touch and down right sexy. As for the comments about them feeling and smelling like plastic. They certainly do...Until You Wash Them! After they've been washed (which I hope you would do before you put them on your bed anyway!), they're soft and heavenly. The stitching on the seams are not as close as they could be and they definately will not last forever; but at this price, who cares. Must Buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't as described","review":"While the sheets weren't luxurious as described and did I agree w/the other reviewers that they felt more like \\"plastic\\" than satin; more importantly, these queen sized sheets did not fit my queen sized matress!

I wish I'd stuck w/just the champagne pillow case covers which were silky-feeling and fit my standards like a glove.

(Instead my pug inherited them for his bed)They are poor quality workmanship and the fabric is cheap. I purchased them to match my Croscill Versailles set. They did provide a visual pop, but were a nightmare to sleep in.

You get what you pay for. On the flat sheet, the seams were \\"missed\\" in many places and were fraying! There were also places on the flat sheet that looked \\"picked\\", like someone had pulled the sheet over something sharp.

What I received was 100% polyester.\\"polyester generally refers to the large family of synthetic polyesters (plastics) which includes polycarbonate and above all polyethylene terephthalate (PET).

After about a month of very light use, the pillow sheets were completely useless even without going into the washing machine. Stay away from these things, you'll just end up replacing them in the future... unless u like sleeping on rags."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"First of all the sheets have a satin feel to it, but they are made out of polyester and not 100% cotton. After washing them the first time they did get soft but now there are tear marks all over the sheets. I am guessing the sheets will have holes in different places after I wash them about four more times."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD PRODUCT","review":"I have purchased these sheets twice already. I should have learned the first time not to reorder them again. The first set were for my son and I washed them with the other dark sheets. They came out with little balls all over the sheets. So, when I ordered another set for my daughter, I decided to wash them separately in cold water with woolite. They came out of the machine with small lines all over the sheets where you could see that within another few washings, they were sure to tear.I would not suggest these sheet sets to anyone unless you want to use them just once for a special occasion. They look beautiful when you remove them from the packaging and place them on the bed for the first time, but don't think you can wash them and have them maintain their beauty. I've tried twice and failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, but completely useless. Better for a tablecloth","review":"So I was excited till I opened the bag to feel the sheets..my girlfriend asked if I bought a tablecloth by accident! It almost feels like carbon fiber, or fiberglass insulation..not good. I was going to return them but since I would have to pay for shipping back, and also refund the free shipping I received at purchase I am stuck with them...

But after reading The Watchmen I can honestly say that it earned every bit of the praise that has been heaped upon it.The book features some of the richest characters ever written. Retired crime fighters struggling to live normal lives and one by one being drawn into an ever growing mystery as they investigate the death of one of their own. It delves into their histories and slowly reveals what drove them to become crime fighters. While never personifying them as perfect examples of humanity but instead painting them as normal flawed people who for one reason or another can't just sit back and watch society crumble."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like this see Hicks' Shattering Light","review":"This is one of my favorite novels of all time, and I'm so excited to see the movie version. If you like this graphic novel, you will love Scott Hicks' The Shattering Light of Stars, which delves into similar complex issues such as living in multiple times at once, the problem of evil, and the notion of how the world can be saved from itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE \\"CITIZEN KANE\\" OF THE COMICS MEDIUM","review":"Although not very similar to Kane in plot it has one thing innovative like it:layouts and camera angles. The layouts are complex beyond belief by their simplicity andthe formula they followed. Also I must point out that if [money] sounds high then don't think about the price. I've read my copy to the point were the corners are rounded and the cover is bent horribly. And every reading reveals something new about it. This is the best comics has to offer and blows the competition away. Dark Knight Returns and Kingdom Come don't hold a candle to it despite the overall quality of those books.

Even after a dozen readings, there's always something new to find here, the book is just that dense."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, just wow...","review":"I had no idea what to expect when I first started reading it.

I was not disappointed. This is great introduction to the genre with great storytelling and intricate character development. The book collects the 12-issue mini-series and is a great-value offered in paperback format. I've always preferred this over hardcover alternatives. The story line is extremely captivating. In fact it was so good that I decided to pickup the Blu-ray and am now keeping up with the new Before Watchmen mini-series which deep-dives into the individual characters. Definitely worth picking up even if you're just getting into the comics genre. A great introduction and a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Graphic Novel","review":"I saw the movie for this first, but I loved the graphic novel as well.

I sent it back to a distributor and prayed for my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of it's time.","review":"Watchmen is ahead of it's time in several ways.1. It predicts the death of Ozymandias simply through the subtext, for example his name is based on the poem about thefutility of hubris. It is also foreshadowed by Rorschach's diary lying on the desk of the tabloid editor's assistant.This is the diary that Rorschach mailed before going to confront Ozymandias, showing who was crazier/ smarter.2. Watchmen is full of German imagery, such as when Ozymandias is surveying multiple screens on the wall in front of him,to understand what the Gestalt is, and what is going on in the world at this time. Now this technique is probably verycommon with every intelligence agency on the planet doing the same.POSTSCRIPT ALAN MOORE SHOULD BE PAID FOR HIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WHICH HE HAS INVENTED SOLELY FOR THIS WORK OF ART"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Graphic Novel, Hope you like to read.","review":"Well I bought it so I could find out what the movie would be about. I haven't finished it yet because it is so long. The story seems pretty good so far and the pictures are very expertly drawn. Can't wait for the movie to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morally ambiguous, unambiguously excellent","review":"Intricate and intelligent, Watchmen is an intense book. Replacing typical good vs. evil confrontations with moral ambiguity, Alan Moore writes a story questioning how superheroes can make the world a better place (fight crime? fight its causes? or turn away from fighting and invent things?) and how far they should go to do so. All this is wrapped in multiple plot lines examining different characters struggling to meet the various challenges placed before them while they move - unknowing or not - toward the book's central mystery. These different lines come together in an ending that, while surprising and imaginative, is still overshadowed by the power of the story being told. More dramatic novel than traditional comic book, reading the Watchmen is an amazing and absorbing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"The Watchman has become a classic of the graphic novel genre, and rightfully so. Interesting setting, great plot, great story telling, great story. It's got it all. If you think you might like this book, then you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best comic book ever.","review":"The Watchmen is a tale of fear of technology as the world rapidly changes. It is brilliantly written by Alan Moore, the king of the \\"dark comic.\\" As several \\"heroes\\" investigate the death of one of their own, the world is brought closer to the brink of nuclear holocaust as tensions rise between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This book uses the comic book medium to weave a tale that is both disturbing and breathtaking. The use of \\"excerpts\\" from other sources at the end of each chapter as well as the comic inside of a comic show Moore to be the most innovative mind in Comics. The ending of this tale is perhaps the most disturbing in memory. This book seamlesly blends brilliant art and orginal storytelling to create the best comic story ever told."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watchmen Live On!","review":"After hearing that the book THE WATCHMEN is at last being made into a movie, I thought now was a good time to reread it and see how it would stand up today. I first read this back in the late 80's and it is just as mind catching a story as it was then. Still love it. Hope the movie does the book justice....but why wait for the movie READ THE BOOK FIRST! OUTSTANDING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless.","review":"Watchmen is perfection on paper, as soon as you finish it, you'll read it again.

Watchmen is one of my favorite graphic novels, I hope you enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moore's Genius","review":"The reviews on back cover claim Watchmen legitimized the graphic novel as a form of literature, that couldn't be more accurate. Moore blends naturalism, a dark depiction of the human condition with multiple perspectives and multi-faceted personalities. He breaks down the stereotypical hero and twists the Watchmen into beings who have accomplished a great deal but also have tremendous faults. Not mention, on top of Moore's writing, Gibbons contributes the perfect illustrations to compliment the text in variety of styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, Great Ending","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed the book, can't wait for the movie to come out. It isn't your traditional super hero story which threw me off a bit when I started, but by the end I couldn't put it down.

Definitely check it out if you plan on seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 5 STAR graphic novel.","review":"I will avoid spoiling so this will be short.Action.Mystery.Those two words describe WATCHMEN in so many ways yet its not either.This is a Superhero drama.This is an epic story, this is Alan Moore's best work ever.Yes there will be a movie, will I watch it?

It is a great character sketch with the standard Alan Moore complete disregard for normal time keeping. Really good.But the ending. The ending is unforgivable. I have worked this through I have no idea how many times and I do not think it possible to generate a worse ending.

The packaging, as well as the re-print quality and the extras are all top-notch. The only minor complaint that I have is that it smells a little funny when it's new. Kinda like chemicals. Anyway, a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Standard","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already. This is the \\"Hamlet\\" of the comic book world. The \\"Godfather\\" of comics, if you will. The \\"Moving Pictures\\" of the comic book industry. What Moore and Gibbons have crafted here is a wonder unrivaled in the comics world. The sheer level of detail that they put into their work is astounding. Literally every single panel on every single page contains something important, some detail that if noticed, will make the reading experience that much more magical. I savored over this book for about two weeks before I finished it. It took me about two hours per chapter. This isn't the type of book that you can just breeze through, like many of today's comics. You will find yourself deeply drawn into this world and the lives of its characters. They will become like old friends to you. The mystery, the intrigue, the action...its all fantastic. You are in for a fantastic experience when you read The Watchmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I've never read a book that delves so deeply into the minds and emotions of its characters. It was nice to take a little break at the end of each chapter to read the small passage from a book or an article. Moore really does a great job letting the mystery of the Comedian's death unfold little by little, while getting us to know the characters so deeply at the same time. All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"This book is everything that is great about graphic novels. The story is epic, the artwork is packed with detail, and the symbolism within and the narrative itself is top-notch. My copy was sent to me quickly and without any problems. Very good purchase for any fans of the graphic novel medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant gateway into the world of graphic novels","review":"Alan Moore's WATCHMEN is a brilliant piece of art and literature. For anyone who percieves artwork incorporated with text as merely a \\"comic\\" is unfortunately missing out on a world of incredible insight, meaning, depth, and fascination. If you've stumbled across THE WATCHMEN, and happen to read this review, I implore you to buy it and read it with an open mind. You will be a changed human being. And, once you have warmed to the fire of this art, move on to The Sandman and Preacher. It gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Watches the Watchmen? Everyone should be!!","review":"Probably hands down the greatest novel of all time, Watchmen managed to do what few others, if no others, books have ever accomplished: combined intelligent storytelling with powerful artwork to make this a story truly for all the senses. Both beautifully complement each other, embellishing the story and taking the novel to another level entirely. I've read it about ten times and each time I still find myself moved, shocked, impressed and always coming away satisified. Truly a great novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never going to be anything like it again","review":"After you read this you realize how powerful comics are. I picked this up because of the huge follwing it has, this is the first comic I've read where the heroes have real problems. Alan Moore writes like these events are truly happening and the characters are so fully thought out, the artwork is so detailed that you have to watch everything carefully. The end is amazing. I would tell everyone no matter who they are to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic Books are NOT Just for Kids","review":"This is perhaps the most important comic book mini series in the modern era. Sweeping and epic, the effect of watchmen on the industry was profound, if not too profound for Alan Moore's liking. The History Channel featured this among other \\"graphic novels\\" in the documentary \\"Comic Book Superheroes Unmasked.\\" Read Watchmen because it's remarkable literature, because it deconstructs the idea of superheroes, and because it'll make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only read one graphic novel in your entire lifetime...","review":"It must be this one novel. This masterpiece is proof that comic books can indeed be literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a reason it's a classic...","review":"Watchmen is an immensely dark and philosophical tale that feels like a window into a parallel universe. The writing and visuals jointly convey the characters' complex humanity while exploring them with brutal reality. Watchmen is rich with questions of psychology and existential philosophy, and works as the definitive deconstruction of its genre.I find that the quality of a piece of literature can be judged by its re-readability and what each subsequent experience offers. There exist so many layers of meaning in this novel that it is barely feasible to grasp them all in one pass. Re-reading almost becomes a necessity in this case, presenting a VERY compelling reason to own a copy rather than just borrowing one.Not everything that is considered a classic truly lives up to the hype and hyperbole. Watchmen does. Read it. Now. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Comic ->Book","review":"This classic comic book seamlessly blends the literary within the comic form. I hate it when people say it shows the potential for comics as great literature, because it quite simply is great literature. It discusses themes which are best described with the comic form, highly dramatic moral values and extremes. I think this comic should become a must-read for basic cultural knowledge. That it isn't even more widely read is reprehensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but flawed","review":"Watchmen is a superb piece of work let down by one serious flaw. The main 'bad guy' has a masterplan so monumentally stupid and conrived that I have never been able to swallow it.A pity because EVERYTHING else is perfect - characters, art, structure, writing, setting.Its also not Alan Moore's best work - the first half of V For Vendetta (which trailed off) and the wonderful English take on ET, 'Skizz' are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Comic That Changed Comics.","review":"Most simply stated, WATCHMEN was the graphic novel that totally changed the comic book industry. The book is a deconstruction of comics. The book also forces a person to challenge the way they view life and the events that go on in the news. Besides all that, it's a great story, too. Still, with all that said, WATCHMEN isn't a great piece of literature (though it comes pretty close) there's just too many comic conventions involved in both the art and story. Whatever the case, if you're a fan of comics at all or have an interest in the history of pop culture, this is one of the graphic novels you should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchmen","review":"Excellent storyline. Very intricate and well thought-out. You probably won't be able to grasp all the nuance on the first read. The movie was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Bag","review":"On one hand, this volume is beautifully bound. There aren't tons of extras, but there are enough to keep a devoted Moore fan satisfied (assuming the content contained herein hasn't been previously digested in another form). I can't tell that the presentation has been enhanced in any way, but it's printed on nice thick paper using vibrant inks.On the other hand, this is the Watchmen. Better folk than I have written whole books devoted to critical treatises of the work, so I will offer only this: Watchmen neophytes should be content with one of the cheaper volumes. They have the same story, and if you feel anything less than passionately about it, you will only have spent two week's allowance instead of two month's. Watchmen aficionados looking for bragging rights, the price is steep, but well worth it if your geeklings know the Watchmen name."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Enjoy It if You Like DC Comics","review":"I wanted to buy this before the movie came out to understand it better. I was impressed with the drawings and characters. The characters are all flawed. The Comedian isn't a funny character. He's a lowlife. Hard to feel sympathetic towards him, so it shows the mind frame of Rorschach who sets the ball into motion. It's a great read. I wasn't expecting the ending. It was a nice twist. It was a great read.I didn't like the pirate comic that was within the story. That's the only thing I disliked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent very very Excellent","review":"This is a great story. The characters in this story are amazing. Each is compelling and there is no clear winner or loser. I love this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!","review":"I've never been a comic book reader and just because they have changed the name to graphic novel doesn't impress me much either. But a friend brought in Watchmen and asked me to read it and give my opinion. I finished the \\"book\\" this morning and from first to last I thought it was dreary. The only characters I really liked were the two Nite Owl men and Rorchach. Not one other character showed the least bit of humanity or even a pleasant personality. The story was just depressing and it took all my will to finish the darned thing. The only part I actually enjoyed were the in-between chapters. That is why this review has two stars and not just one. Those I really enjoyed especially Hollis Mason's Under the Hood excerpts. They were excellent and didn't need illustrations to tell a good story. I'm not quite sure why Time Magazine declared Watchmen one of the \\"100 Best Novels since 1923\\" It isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Read Better","review":"Seriously, the storyline is really cliche and nothing special. The glowing blue smurf known as Dr. Manhattan is cool, but invincibility is never as appealing as imperfections. Heroes such as Naruto and Batman are way better because they're humans; they're examples of what the human spirit can accomplish. I doubt most of us would be willing to walk around completely naked, have our humanity basically wiped, and get blasted with toxic chemicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchmen ebook only for kindle fire? Why?","review":"Why is is the Watchmen available only for the Kindle Fire? When are they gonna make it available for those with iPad (via an Amazon app?) That's very greedy on Amazon's and DC's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah...","review":"This is supremely messed up, but it's a must-read. Moore's writing is as twisted as his characters, but it's brilliant and imaginative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for electronic devices.","review":"Awesome novel. Much better on paper, though. Having to rely on a small screen really doesn't do the comic the justice it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to read on a Kindle","review":"Graphic novels are one of the varieties of books that my co-ed book club likes.I was initially happy to find this for the Kindle, but it's tiny to read. I would recommend at least a big iPad or on a big screen monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Always wanted to own watchmen, cheep buy, great quality, good story. Worth it for sure! Definitely a good read. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing the Reviews","review":"I have read a lot of reviews, and I just wanted to put in my 2 cents incase it helps anyone out.the book starts out very interesting. It gets a little boring in the center. It ends strong.All together it is a brilliant piece. Be careful with the bad reviews. Many of them didn't finish the book. They just quit in the middle.The end is worth it. Its an amazing piece.Watchmen"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic 'must read' for Comic Fans","review":"I doubt I'm going to say anything that hasn't been said before about the classic graphic novel. I would recommend this to anyone, and would call is a must read for any fan of comic books. From the first page I found this to be one of those stores where I didn't want to put it down. And when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. It starts of as sort of a murder mystery, and ends up, well, some where else entirely. It's an engrossing read, and very accessible in that this is a stand alone series and it is about characters created for this graphic novel so there is no required back story to know. It examines the mythos of superheroes while not dwelling on it or having it be the main focus of the plot. The art work is very good as well, with some neat details hidden in there. This is the kind of thing that needs to be read multiple times to really get all you can out of it, and I mean that in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"Wow this was worth every penny. Even though I already own a TPB of Watchmen this just sounded too good to pass up, and boy was I right. The larger pages only help the art, the new color seperations make it look even better, but not so glossy as to distract, and all the extras are so in depth. I especially loved reading Alan Moore's sampled script pages. The only thing this is lacking is some current input from the creators, but that can't be helped, due to some decades old arguements not worth getting into here. So barring that one complaint, I would say absolute if definitly how I would describe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well thought out and executed comic","review":"I really enjoyed it. There are a lot of layers here and the art is first rate. Well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Graphic Novel I've Ever Read!!","review":"I started Watchmen having no idea what it was about and I think that is probably the best way to read it: no preconceived notions on what you think it should be. Just sit back and read it and go along for a spectacular ride with extremely in depth character analysis. I'd recomend Watchmen to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchmen: forget that its a comic and just read it!","review":"In my opinion Watchmen is an outstanding read. Unpredictable, imaginative, original and compelling. In fact I read it again as soon as I had finished. I enjoyed it even more the second time because of all the details, links and hints that suddenly make sense. This shows how much time and thought had gone into the writing and construction. There is a lot to this book; just because it is a comic doesn't mean its low-brow and just for kids and geeks who can't get girlfriends!I have had a look at other comics since buying Watchmen but none of them appealed to me at all, in comparison they all seem, well like stupid comics really! In my opinion Watchmen is somthing else - buy it you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating deconstruction of comics","review":"In Watchmen, Moore has not only created an astounding work of art but has also shed light on all the important themes of comics. Watchmen is it's own self contained story chronicling a world much like ours where heroes, super or otherwise, exist. It's also an analysis of where the archetypal figures in all other comics originate. He explores each character's past and how they came to be who they are today. He also explores the common themes of comics: good vs. evil, the end of the world, the contrivance. He's created a story that not only entertains but also teaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary.","review":"I started this book three times before I could penetrate its dense style. Once I got going, I found it to be a work of extraordinary literature. The artwork isn't my style, but the story combined with the unique narrative structure, finely-crafted characters and complex views of good and evil and time make for a remarkable book. You don't have to be a comic book or graphic novel fan to appreciate this book. This is great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I hoped it would be (and more)","review":"After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I decided to go ahead and purchase this product. I will admit that it was not what I expected, but after the first issue I was hooked. Very engaging story that took many dark twists and turns. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Watches The Watchmen?","review":"This is will be my favorite book I have ever read. The story revolves around Rorschach a vigilante superhero as he tries to do 2 things, unravel the mystery behind the murder of Edward Blake also known as The Comedian, and gather the other members of the Watchmen. My 2 favorite Watchmen are Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan. I am reading the book 1st because the DVD comes out this summer and I wanna see if there are alot of references to the book. I recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought this when this frist came out all those years ago.Truly a milestone in comic history.We wouldn't have had either of the X-Men or Dark Knight movies without this.Heroes that are flawed yet still heroes.Yes Edward is a rapist and a murderer, and shockingly the original Silk Spector goes back to him. But life is like that not neat and pretty these were the first costumed heroes who you got to see what when on inside their heads.What sort of person would dress up in a costume and go and fight crime?Each of these heroes has a problem and through the pages you come to discover that it's their costumed alter ego that is the real person and their 'normal' personalty is what they hide behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly remarkable piece of storytelling","review":"I had heard about \\"Watchmen\\" from people and comic magazines as being herald as one the greatest comics ever created. One day, at a comic book convention I happened upon the original Watchmen series and so I bought all twelve issues. All I have to say is that it is one helluva story, after reading the first issue I couldn't stop and ending up reading all twelve issues that same day. I always knew that Alan Moore was an excellent writer having read \\"Batman: The Killing Joke\\" but I never really realized what a great writer he was. This is one storyline that every comic fan should own no matter if you only like a certain writer, artist or character(s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-fanboy fan","review":"This is the first graphic novel I ever read (and I haven't read many since). I thought it was very \\"dense\\" and that's what I admired most about it. Once I finished, I began reading it again immediately. There are parts that are better than others (Rorschach's backstory was great; Dr. Manhattan's not so much). But it was really interesting and I liked all the stories going on simultaneously. It was a bit confusing the first time around, but I've read it three times now and admired it and enjoyed it each time. If you've never read a graphic novel, give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites of all time!","review":"From Loren Keim, author ofHow to Sell Your Home in Any Market: 6 Reasons Why Your Home Isn't Selling... and What You Can Do to Fix Them:I'm anxiously awaiting the release of the movie! When I speak about the Watchmen with friends who read literature, they gasp and look at me with horror. How could anyone read a \\"comic book\\"? It's a graphic novel, I protest. The few I've been able to convince to read the book have been duly impressed.Of all the books I've read in my life, Watchmen stands out in the top few. It is a powerful book on many levels, and something any fiction reader should have in their collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Score!","review":"Book arrived in short order and in excellent condition. The panels are high-quality, four-color separations that pop off the page, and the story is one of the standout pieces of fiction among the hundreds of books in the genre I've read. \\"Watchmen\\" is worth the time it takes to read and enjoy the unfolding tale.And Amazon, as usual, took good care of me. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who watches the Watchmen?","review":"This is a fantastic graphic novel. Do yourself a favor and immerse your mind into this book before the film version comes out next March. I looked around for it and I found it cheapest on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ IT!! Even if you're NOT a comic book fan!","review":"I'll confess something right away: I'm NOT a comic book fan. I've never really read individual comic books or followed characters thru yrs of changes, variations, versions, etc. I've always been more interested in graphic novels & Watchmen was one of the 1st I ever read. This isn't a comic book series in the traditional sense; it's a complete story with characters that seem real, the type of people who could exist even in our world. There's a lot of buzz about the film coming out early next yr but I predict that 10 yrs from now, MORE people will be reading & re-reading this book than will be watching the film on DVD or it's successor formats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely done...","review":"Enjoyed reading this from start to finish. Excellent graphic novel! Very good story that keeps you guessing about where it's heading. As you get move into the second half of the book, the story really begins to pull you along for a very enjoyable ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than i expected","review":"I found that the paper is very good quality, as well as the cover. I've already gone through a few pages and i can say it's a unique experience already (also saw the movie). Definitely worth the money in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superheroes for Adults","review":"There is little to be said about this gem from the mid-80's that isn't already on the back cover or similar reviews...it is astounding, and further proof (if any were needed after V for Vendetta) that Alan Moore is a brilliant writer. This actually transcends any conceived barriers the comic medium has ever faced in the public consciousness, and raises this work to the level of fine literature.I truly hope the movie adaptation coming out does the job of telling this story at least 70% as well as the print version does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchmen: The finest graphic novel you can find","review":"If you have never read a graphic novel because you think they are nothing but comics, then you have never read the Watchmen. This is one of the best stories ever written... period. These are dark heroes with very personal motives. You need to put all your preconceived ideas regarding superheroes and how they operate in the dust bin. The story will completely surprise you with its depth and complexity. The artwork is fantastic and conveys the gritty nature of the story.If you like science fiction, alternate history, fantasy or crime novels, this is an excellent entry into a new reading medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best graphic novel I've read, by far","review":"It's hard to believe that there will ever be a graphic novel better than Watchmen. It's even harder to believe that this book was released back in the 80's. Furthermore, I can't believe I have discovered it only recently, about a year ago. Since then, I have read it twice and loved it more each time.What can I say... Moore's story and Gibbons' art have an incredible synergy. It's almost as if they are one and the same person. The plot itself is very mature and totally goes against the very definition of \\"superheroes\\". And that's because the main characters aren't superheroes and they flawed and troubled, living in a world that's heading for swift collapse.My only regret is that there probably won't be another graphic novel that eclipses Watchmen for as long as I live. On the other hand, I know I'll be reading it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this","review":"The best comic story. Ever. You'll love it, you won't put it down. If this was written in book form, it'd be considered classic literature. If you think comics are childish and silly, BUY THIS, it'll change your view point forever. Alan Moore is a genious and this is his best work ever, I guarantee you'll love it. Dave Gibbons draws the best work of his career, you'll never forget the scenes from his 'post-apocalypse' scenes.

There's no reason not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Fire Edition - Avoid!","review":"I got the Kindle Fire edition (which isn't allowing reviews, as it doesn't think the book has been released yet). The panels are too small to read on the Fire (would be fine on the iPad or even most netbooks or PC's, but you can't download the book there, or to a generic Android tablet). Worst of all, the individual panels repeat a random number of times, anywhere from 3-9 in a row (this may be tied to the number of individual content boxes on a page, but only loosely).Avoid this as an ebook until there is a larger device it can be read and the repeat issue is corrected (if it showed one box/page, that might solve both)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read, Lost Something Over The Years","review":"Watchmen is probably one of the greatest comics ever written. Unfortunately in today's modern time the story has lost a lot of what made it great because the direction that the industry has taken.

I may be a victim of high expectations, but in my judgment, a masterpiece this is not.\\"Watchmen\\" may have a bit more depth than the average comic (or perhaps it's that it brought about an increase in the depth of the average comic, akin to how the fine but no longer outstanding Mona Lisa was revolutionary in its day), but I don't see it as a worthy recipient of the lavish praise it receives.

I won't!","review":"This Watchmen graphic novel is IN MY OPINION a rampantly over-hyped tripe. The finale is lackadaisical and ludicrously horrid (think of the 9/11 conspiracy theory reversed with some large OGM beamed up), the characters unlikable, the political view outdated, the moral homilies absolutely uncalled for, the sexophobic, homophobic rants of one of the charachters harrowing. Plus, the story is a major depressant, worse than Kafka and Sartre.What's so great in this depressing rigmarole? A blue man god with superpowers and his funny dressed burned out psycho crime fighters friends?A fictional counterfactual story of the Eighties? Gore everywhere? Character you'll wissh to forget soon?You know, if you want a story that deals with humanity, super-powers, complex characters and exquisite graphic, read Warren Ellis' Freakangels and Planetary, or Morrison's The Invisibles"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright","review":"Not a masterpiece everyone makes out to be. Although compare to other graphic novels, it's alittle bit better. Bascially a murder mystery that along the way in solving it, goes into each of the character's backstory until mystery is solved in the end. Ending somewhat disappointing and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe historically interesting, but....","review":"I recently read \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I decided to read \\"Watchmen\\" after all the rave comments I had been reading.What a disappointment.My biggest complaint is that the story was just plain boring. There are 12 issues, and I couldn't get into it until issue 10. It made some interesting points at times, but all the material is covered better somewhere else (like Claremont/Byrne X-Men, or Marvels, or any of the Busiek/Perez Avengers).I also had a very hard time getting past the humourlessness and lack of any heroic/inspiring material. And sadly, the moral conclusion is WAAAAY off. Great violence leads to more violence - not universal peace. The whole thing left a very bad taste in mouth since the World Trade Center attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish","review":"Watchmen is bloated and overwritten. Moore drags the story on far too long, and his obsession with literary significance destroys any sense of clarity and power(an all too common thing in comics now). I gave it 2 stars just because of Gibbon's adequate pencils and character designs. One of the few interesting artistic elements is that very juxtaposition between flashy, hollow writing and relatively solid drawing. Unfortunately, if this project were to be done now, it wouldn't even have the relatively solid drawing."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 out of 10,000 people found this review helpful","review":"I recently reread this novel and was sorely disappointed. Props for the complex plot, for sure, but scratch the surface and all you'll find beneath is some Ayn Rand Lite, complete with a raging hatred of women. Given my previous admiration for the novel, I was truly shocked by its revanchist politics. I guess I was too young (or young enough?) last time I read it. Negative and aggressive comments from fans in 5, 4, 3, 2 . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so great about this junk","review":"This is a horrible comic. The dialogue is convoluted, tries to sound smart but comes off idiotic instead, the characters are not very likable, and the whole mood is depressing. I like the idea of the book to make superheroes with human frailties but this comes off instead as everybody being self absorbed, depressed, confused, idiotic, living meaningless lives, and full of itself. The book is terrible and I can only hope the movie is better since the depressing story has nowhere to go but up.The art was also a type that I found uninteresting particularly for the time for there where some awesome comic book artists then.I am a comic book lover that mainly loves the comics of the late 50's till the very early 70's so maybe this explains why I don't get the attraction to most graphic comics and most particularly this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped and self important.","review":"I bought Watchmen based mainly on reviews and the super-hype I read about. It starts off pretty good i must admit, setting the scene nicely for an interseting read. But all to quiclky it becomes self involved, with little interest in entertaining the reader.

This is by far the darkest, yet most appropriate superhero graphic novel I have ever read. The artistry is phenomenal, each detail in the book has a very significant meaning.

The colors are crisp and the text perfectly legible in a user-friendly format.There's not much else I can say about Watchmen that hasn't been said before, or would risk spoiling the many mysteries.

I had heard so many great things about it and was expecting a memorable read. Now that I have read it I'm left with a feeling of \\"What was the big deal?\\". The story was incredibly average. The art was mediocre at best. Alan Moore's writing is eloquent but an eloquently written boring story is still boring. I was expecting a lot more.Three GREAT examples of graphic novels at their best are: Kingdom Come by Alex Ross, the Rising Stars series by J.Michael Straczynski, and The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dated","review":"With the age of television coming out on DVD, have you gone back and watched an episode of the A-Team, MacGyver etc... and found it really really really dated, to the point where it's almost unwatchable?In the 1980's this was edgy stuff. Superheroes that weren't really super. An ending that (spoiler) leaves millions dead.In 2009, I go from Dexter (serial killer) to Grand Theft Auto (killing for fun) to any number of edgy graphic novels/films/video games that, frankly, are far better written than this piece.I doubt very much if the \\"Watchmen\\" was pitched to a comic firm today that it would ever see the light of day. The dialogue is often painful to read, the costumes absurd, the plot ludicrous and characters far exceeded in modern media.If this was 1986, this comic would easily be a \\"buy\\"...in 2009, unless it's a nostalgia trip, save yourself the bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"All this about a comic book?","review":"Do you read comic books, or is it more of a looking thing? This is great if you've never had the chance to read any philosophy. It's philosophy is right there on the surface in a superficial way only a comic book could hope to do. But, as most readers probably have more of a background in dungeons and dragons and magic the gathering, the comic looks pretty intelligent. Wow, that blue guy is pretty detached, huh. I suggest skipping this and getting a real book where you might actually learn something if you read it.Sorry to be derogatory. As someone who reads real books seeing people heap this praise on a comic book is kind of absurd. If someone was that serious about their story I can only assume they would pick a different format. I know college age graphic artists will argue, but comics aren't going to be replacing Hemingway anytime soon. Old man and the sea would probably be better if there were small pictures and word bubbles everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Tedious. Uninteresting.","review":"I bought this when it first came out in the 80's and couldn't make it through. This week I set out to read it, as the film has been made. 20 years hasn't resulted in a change of opinion. The storyline is as hacky as a 30's radio show. The dialogue is lifeless. The pirate story subplot is boring and anticlimactic. All in all, just a complete waste of time.One short story by John Varley is more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Higly Overrated","review":"Okay, first of all, I'm not a huge fan of superhero comics. I do however like comics that have a certain depth to it, so when I read al the praizing i became interested. This one was supposed to be different. It supposed to be more than just a comic, more than just a bunch of superheroes.It starts of okay, but pretty soon I had to admit i wasn't all that impressed. Actually, I found it all a bit tedious. The wrtinig became less and less impressive, the story less and less challanging and by the time I was at the middle of the book, I was totally bored.There are people around who insist on comparing this stuff to great works of literature. I wonder if they ever read any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny, melodramatic writing","review":"Moore's original burst of inspiration was to take a form of children's literature - the super-hero comic book - and fuse it with the Hemingway-derived melodrama of the hard-boiled school of crime and detective fiction. Teenagers, poorly-read and possessing malnourished tastes in prose, were predictably awestruck by the results. They thought it was 'realistic'; they thought this was 'great literature'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I like Alan Moore. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Awesome! Top 10? Great stuf!

I love this book. It kept me intrigued for weeks and is now my favorite book. The art is awesome, the plot is well planned, and the brilliant symbolism such as the smiley face crater on mars and the use of clocks as a countdown to Armageddon amazed me. This book had so many interesting \\"types\\" that it was practically like the bible of comic books. Worth every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, entertaining, but not quite as good as it's touted to be","review":"I read this series when it first came out in the 80's. I didn't get it then, likely because I was too young. I recently reread it, and enjoy it much more than I did when it first came out, but still am not completely on the Watchmen bandwagon. The art is pretty generic, and I think detracts from the story. A grittier, darker artist would have been better than Gibbons, IMHO. Not a big fan of the big octopus as well. Glad the movie took it out.Maybe I'm just a superhero nerd. I recently also rereadCrisis On Infinite Earthsand really enjoyed it.As an aside, I did really enjoy the Watchmen movie, which was panned by so many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but still relevent","review":"The only graphic novel on the list of 1001 books you should read in your lifetime, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen is an interesting deconstruction of the superhero mythos. The story is a little dated, as the original 12 issues were published in the late 80s and deal with more Cold War issues such as the constant immanent threat of nuclear war, but many of the questions raised would still be relevant today. It is also a study into what it takes to be a hero, and the lengths that one hero would go to to ensure world peace.The art is a little sparse, but it fits for the tone and feel of the story. Told in a more cinematic style, you should pay attention to the panel flow and the stories in the story to find hidden correlations in the story.Overall, even with the slightly dated material, it is an amazingly well thought out story, both in dialogue and the visual aspect of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!! If you've never read a graphic read this!","review":"I have to say this was my first graphic novel and I couldn't put it down. After reading this I was immediately hooked on any type of comic, the DC Universe especially!

This is a great hero comic diffferent from the rest that is essential to every comic book reader's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Watches the Watchmen.?.","review":"I have read this story several times and it keeps getting better with every read.

The first copy I received had some markings on it, which appeared to be under the glossy coating of the jacket. It was enough to stick out against the bright yellow cover and ruin the look of it, so I returned it and Amazon promptly shipped me another. This one had some debris stuck to the back of the dust jacket, which I was able to kind of scratch off with my thumbnail and little water (causing very slight damage in the process.) I decided it was not very noticeable and kept this one. Overall it looks like whoever DC has manufacturing these things is not doing very good quality control before shipping. Just a caveat- it's still a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This graphic novel is very well-written, very thoughtful, and has a wonderful story to tell.

I love the approach to so many different characters, all with their mistakes and sins but never without some moments where you have no choice but to sympathize. Every single panel and every single word was clearly thought out and only make the story take you deeper after each read.I was able to find a used one (but still in great condition) for less than 10 dollars. There really isn't much more I could have asked for haha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent form for the impeccable content","review":"I've read Watchmen before and was amazed by it. I always considered comic books as a medium suitable for superheroes and fantasy worlds.Watchmen turned this notion upside down.

When I bought it, it said that the condition would be new. And it kinda was; the book was wrapped but there were small dents on the bottom of it, and the cover had a crease or two on it. Maybe my standards are too high, but if I buy a book that is said to be new, I want it to be 'new' not 'like new.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing plot that delivers.......","review":"this is one of the best stories I have ever read.

I saw the movie when it first came out, and I think that was detrimental to my reading of the original text. As printed material I found Watchmen to be surprisingly unappealing. The film seems to be very close to the original, but far surpasses the comic in terms of visual interest. The women were particularly disturbing, as the movie had lead me to believe they were supposed to be attractive, and not have .. mullets (yes, the original Silk Specter has a mullet in the text).I wish I had read Moore and Gibbons before seeing the film - I think I would have enjoyed it much more. As it stands, it was actually fairly slow-going for very little end reward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente comic","review":"La primera vez que supe de watchmen fue con la película, y me gusto, y realmente me intereso leer la historieta original, y la verdad fue una excelente decisión, este libro es una recopilación de todas las historietas de la serie, y algunas otras sorpresas, definitivamente una compra obligatoria para los fanáticos del cómic, y para las personas que quieran conocerlo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Graphic Novel","review":"this is the very best graphic novel i have ever read. ive read the sin city one and didnt really like as much as i do watchmen Allen Morre really did a great job on the story line. also ive seen the movie and critics didnt really like it but i feel it recited the novel very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great story, great art work, phenominal story. This graphic novel is exceelent. I truely enjoyed the read and i'm glad i read it before the movie came out as this will put the storyline in a much better perspective for me. My only concern is the timeline, the novel is based in the 80's and really calls upon events that would be fairly old to young readers today. With that said, the story line is exciting and fast paced. Pick this book up for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Beautiful and an enjoyable read","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

In a book listing the 300 \\"greatest\\" attack & interceptor jets, why would there be 5 individual pages to the Hawker Sea Hawk and no listings for the early (WW II era) Gloster Meteor. And what on earth are listings for the Lockheed large transport aircraft doing in a book on combat aircraft. The author clearly was simply filling space and given the limited & questionable information provided about each aircraft, one would have to ask if the author had more than a passing interest in the subject to begin with. In depth, knowledgeable information is lacking. This book might make a grade schooler smile but for this price a serious attempt at researching the material might have been offered. My advice would be to stay away from this whole series of books. If this is a sample, the rest can't be much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"Of all Herb Alperts work, this is my favorite.

It's unforgettable stuff. Herb dedicated the album to his late friend, Karen Carpenter. She had a beautiful voice.

We decided on this option vs. sending it back because the bag is sturdy and we did not want to go through the return process.

I was very disappointed, obviously, because it was useless if it didn't maintain its high density shape. The product details never stated that there were different degrees of density of the foam (as I have found out now). I went to Dick's Sporting Goods and bought a GoFit red foam roller and it has maintained its shape now after dozens of workouts. I highly recommend that one but don't buy the products shown here.P.S.

I have back problems and decided to purchase a half-round one from seller \\"herternursery\\" to sleep on. When it came, I was disappointed, immediately noticing that it was not completely straight. It was curved from storage or shipping. This indicates that the foam is of lower density or quality. Size-wise, it is also noticeably thinner than a full-round roller cut in half. I compared the sizes by stacking the end of the half-roll against a full roll. The half-roll is not exactly half of the round roller. Measuring with a ruler, I found out that the width is only about 5.5\\", making the height (radius) of this half-roller less than 2.5\\" when it should be 3\\".I am not sure if the product from other sellers is the same as mine, but I am not satisfied with the quality of the half roll I received.

I have read books on physics for the lay person involving quantum mechanics that did not require the proficiency in math that this book does.

I had always hoped to get these albums on cd, but until recently they were high priced imports even when used. I love every Y and T cd for the same reasons, they have hard rocking power balancing heavy muscular and commercial leanings, grace of ballads with an masculine edge, and lyrics that range between playful innuendo, outright bravado, and thoughtful phiosophical insight, depending on the song.I also have Ten, Contagious, and will probably buy the rest of their catalog on cd. Far from only taking me back to a time and place, their music is timeless in spite of the years gone by. Hearing these on cd makes them brand new again and will enjoy them for years to come.

A fantastic flick for the family to watch together. These kids are going to be stars, and John Laroquette is hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all","review":"This movie is on the level of a badly written sit-com. There is not one original idea in it. Every gag is telegraphed from a mile away. Every character is a cartoon cut-out and there is nothing even approaching a real performance. It's pretty clear that the actors involved knew they were turning out schlock and were only in it for a paycheck. I have liked John Larroquette in many other things, but even he doesn't seem at all invested in this. I sat through about 30-40 minutes of this nonsense before I decided it wasn't worth any more of my time.

For now, avoid this pile of crap at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well so far","review":"I installed the new battery in my preterminal ipod mini yesterday and it works great so far. It's probably slightly more difficult than the accompanying video makes it seem, but not dramatically so.

A boring slow paced book that is sure to put you to sleep. After a well written first couple of chapters the book stalls. You think that you have another page turner on your hands and instead you feel like the pages are moving about as fast as molasses in January.

The story is basic: a chance encounter with a homeless man turns a hard-nosed 100 hour a week lawyer into an individual who ends up doing pro bono work for the poor. The writing is trite and old, the story unrealistic more so than usual, and the further I got along through this book, the more I felt the arm of the publisher telling Grisham to get ANYTHING on the shelves as soon as possible.I recommend this book only for the biggest of Grisham fans who have to read EVERYTHING that he puts out.** NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"I disagree...it's Grisham's WORST book!","review":"As a Grisham fan, I was disappointed.

I find it hard to believe that the same person who wrote \\"Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Partner\\" wrote this unbelievable liberal, wrong-headed mess. This is the first of Mr. Grisham's offerings that I did not buy in hardcover. Thank God I waited for the paperback. Needless to say, I need to calm down before I read his latest, \\"The Testiment\\". If it isn't 100% better than \\"Street Lawyer\\", then it's goodbye Mr. Grisham. Unbelievable......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even up to par for Grisham.","review":"This book was not up to a Grisham standard. The plot was farfetched and the legal/courtroom action was predictable and boring. His jabs at the Republicans were uncalled for and won't make sense to future readers. This was an obvious \\"beat the deadline\\" book. This would have been a better op-ed piece in the Washington Post."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Disappoints","review":"\\"The Street Lawyer\\" is the worst writing by Grisham that has come out to date. The idea is noble and admirable but never comes to fruition. It almost seems like Grisham lost steam halfway through the novel and just used frivolous words to take up pages. This book was a great disappointment, and nothing like a Grisham fan would expect judging by his other works like \\"The Chamber\\" or \\"The Client\\". Let's just all hope this one doesn't get made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful look into the problem of homelessness","review":"This book is not typical of Grisham's usual writings in that he is discussing a more down to earth problem in America. The fact also that the setting for THE STREET LAWYER is our nation's capital makes the problem of homelessness all that much more serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Grandstands for Increased Social Programs","review":"While still a page-turner that only Grisham could create, the author has used \\"The Street Lawyer\\" as a platform for communicating his political views on the social plight of inner-city degenerates. While the plots of his books have always been far-fetched, this book transcends any inkling of reality when the reader is encouraged to believe that an attorney from a powerful Washington, D.C., law firm would abruptly give up a cushy, high-paying job to fight for the rights of inner-city poor -- for a nominal wage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not Grisham","review":"As an avid Grisham reader i can't begin to describe my disappointment of this book. Grisham's unique ability as a story teller in his previous works is undetectable here. A poor try to go for another type of writing, one Grisham should avoid in the future. The Street lawyer, is unbelievable, makes no sence, and by no means has the ability to capture you.... Too bad for Grisham and his reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I've always purchased the newest Grisham offering without knowing the plot line, but no more. The fast pace and gripping story of \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Runaway Jury\\" have been replaced with the talkiness of social relevancy. If he can get his political conscience off his sleeve and return to being a storyteller, he may once again become one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham finds a conscience.","review":"What little plot there is, impossible, self serving and just plain ridiculous. The hero (?) could have been at the start of a career,still in law school anything but an overachiever working 90 hours a week.

The plot was extremely predicable, the characters were not well developed and the ending was trite and unconvincing. The homeless depicted in the book were so unsympathetic that I found myself thinking like the Congressman in the book. This was definitely Grisham-lite."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jolly hobo isn't jolly any more.","review":"Exploitation of the homeless is at an all time high in Grisham's \\"Street Lawyer\\".Filled with bourgeois myths about the innocent homeless being beaten up on by whoever our current political enemies are, the book misses no opportunity to slip in inexpensive political commentary.Soup kitchen noble savages and straw man victims of those dastardly Republicans, are paraded out in service of the plot, and then tucked away again.Grisham's homeless are not exactly \\"Freddy the Freeloader\\", but they come no where near rising to the level of human being.They are a cute cause -- little more.Albeit unrealistic, the story is well-told, as are the stories in all of Grisham's novels; but Grisham's noble but naive attempt to help the homeless falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst!!!!!!","review":"I'm such a big big Grisham fan. I have all of his books, and I looked forward to his latest with such anticipation, but what a letdown. It's his worst ever.

I want my money back, John."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call that an ending?","review":"\\"The Street Lawyer\\" is carefully disguised as a fictional thriller when in reality it turns out to be Grisham's third in a line of overdramatized editorials.Sounding more like a politician than a writer, Grisham bemoans the plight of the homeless in page after page of his latest attempt.Readers of his previous works will long for the excitement of \\"The Firm\\" and even wind up craving the inanity of \\"The Client.\\"Grisham is at his best when he's writing about the incatracies of the legal system, and inventing characters with depth. He's at his worst when he's injecting politics into a novel.The only thing more annoying than his preaching throughout is when you come to the end and realize you could have enjoyed your time more by viewing \\"Ishtar\\" twice.

One of those books you can take anywhere, pick up anywhere without a lot of backtracking to remember what is going on. Although, in my opinion, not one of his best books, it read more like a long newspaper article and covered some interesting topics of which I previously knew little about. The ending was a bit of a neat little package, \\"nice\\" is the best word to describe it. I will continue to read Grisham and encourage my students to also. He, at least, should be commended for staying away from vulgarity and sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anybody wanna buy a book?","review":"I remember when Grisham books were hard to put down. We have now hit the other end of the spectrum. This was hard to pick up. It seems like we are seeing books written for movies by Grisham.

This was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have made a better Reader's Digest article","review":"I've read all of Grisham's book and this one was, by far, the worst. All of the homeless characters were not to be believed....all sweet, wholesome and law abiding, except for illegally renting a squatter's room in an old warehouse. And, what an unbelievably nice neighborhood for the legal clinic where our hero can park his Lexus with impunity! GEt real! As for excitement and suspense, the only danger here for our hero was the possible loss of his license and a jail term, none of the terror in previous books where his life was at stake. Time to take a break, John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another soapbox lecture from Grisham","review":"Just as he did in \\"The Chamber\\", Grisham gives us a lecture rather than an entertaining novel. Come on John, you've made more money than God with entertaining books. Get on a talk show if you feel the need for some moralizing. I've read all of his books and they all rate a 9 or 10 with the exceptions of his two diatribes - \\"The Chamber\\" and \\"The Street Lawyer\\". Grisham's publisher should take a clue from the computer industry - they advertise \\"Intel Inside'. These Grisham novels should say \\"Lecture Inside\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either like it or you don't.","review":"I realy liked this book.

This time I would have none of it, so I had a relative import it to me in time to take with me on holiday. To cut my long story short I wish I hadn't bothered. This book is so predictable I wondered what John was thinking. I have come to expect a lot more from him. And why was it so short ??? I will not be recomending this book at all. And I hope and pray that John is happy that he has now cleared his own conscience and gets back to giving us a good read next time out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham has lost his ability to keep the reader hooked","review":"I am starting to believe that John Grisham is running into deadlines for his publisher. The endings for the past few books have been terrible. The Street Lawyer is the same way. The Street Lawyer suffers from many things, namely, 1.Lack of a plot, the plot in this book is almost non-existent. I enjoyed the first two chapters, but then my interest was lost. 2.Lack of character depth, Michael did an honorable thing, but I think the majority of us cannot identify with him. In Michael's own words \\"You'd have to be a fool to jump off of the gravy train I was riding.\\" 3.Bad ending, even though I thought Michael's case was weak, a trial would have been interesting. Instead, Grisham goes the easy and predictable route. After the first two chapters, I could predict the whole book. In conclusion, The Street Lawyer is a major disappointment from a man that is capable of \\"The Firm\\" and \\"The Client\\". I don't think this one is worth $25.00 Try again, John"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celebrity author publishes tripe","review":"In other Grisham novels one can atleast expect a story that may be of interest or a theme that is fresh. There is non such here, the characters are flaccid and predictable and the subject is nothing new to thinking, caring people. Happily I don't buy the books but borrow them so feel I'm not adding to Grisham's cult of greed he so busily puts down...how much pro bono or help does Grisham do? How much more could we all do for our community? It doesn't take a job change. As a novel it shouldn't have been published, but because he's a celebrity author it has been. Let's ask the publishing houses to go on a sabbatical and publish a greater variety of voices that are out on our streets. Let's forget how many times we had to read \\"I'm a street lawyer\\" and get some real insights and talent into the publishing circles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Departure","review":"I found Street Lawyer to be a fresh departure from the \\"cookie cutter\\" Firm, Pelican Brief, Client, etc. Yes, it was different, but it shows that Grisham is more than a one-dimensional author. It was strange, because I kept waiting for Brock to run for his life against the evil firm, but it didn't happen, yet I was compelled to keep reading. It certainly kept me up at night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth reading, but not worth $30.00","review":"While I found the book interesting enough to want to finish, I was seriously disappointed in the contents.To me, the book accomplished two things:1- Planted the seed (or perhaps sprouted the existing seed) of social conscience; and2- I found myself about 1/4 through realizing this was a script to a movie, not a novel, and wondering who would be playing various parts. However, even as a movie script, this needs some jazzing up.As with many other reviews here, I certainly hope that VERY SOON I will read somewhere that all proceeds from the book and movie are donated to the homeless shelters. It would be Grisham's only saving grace to his fans. He's not the first author to let us down after a string of best sellers, but he tackled a subject that HE personally can do something about. Let's see it happen, Mr. Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've come undone.","review":"Mr. Grisham appears to have had a need to write, but not to put time into development as he has in his past novels. I read this sorry latest out of loyalty to the genre of Grisham past. The loyalty remains, but questions abound.

I usually finish a book in an hour and if its good I feel dissapointed that I did not take longer - but \\"The Street Lawyer\\", I finished in about 45 minutes and all I could think later was why I did not finish it faster - it was one of the worst books I have ever read and I was \\"thoroughly dissapointed\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are all these people out of their minds?","review":"I can't believe I'm seeing perfect ratings being awarded to this book.

It is about a man named Michael Brock who works for one of the largest law firms in the US. He has it all. In a few years, he is expected to be a partner. But, in a days time, it ends with a street man who takes 8 or 9 lawyers hostage. This makes Michael re-evaluate his life and decides he wants to become a \\"street lawyer\\" and defend such people, basically out of sympathy. Sounds good so far, 'eh? Well, the story and \\"goings on\\" are not bad, but the ending is so dissapointing. Makes this a horrible book. I felt like the man stole hours out of my life. Of course, I am still a fan and do plan on reading the rest, but The Street Laywer was an upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Money!","review":"This book is definitely NOT worth buying. This is not up to par with the previous books Grisham has written. The beginning was good, but the story dragged on from there. By the time I got halfway, I wanted to stop reading right there. However, I forced myself to continue and I found the ending to be very mediocre. This book lacked in plot and was more of a morality book on how you should treat those who are less fortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Attempt at Political Correctness","review":"Probably one of the worst books I have ever read, considering the experience of the author. Although I have come to expect the same screenplay-esque and \\"root for the underdog\\" style and theme from Grisham, I found this book to be quite sub-par. This is a far cry from \\"The Firm\\" or \\"A Time To Kill,\\" what I consider to be the author's best works. Even \\"The Chamber\\" is a much more effective and moving story in its attempt to address the controversey surrounding capital punishment.\\"The Street Lawyer,\\" on the other hand, is entirely too predictable after the first 75-100 pages.Moreover, the author leans far too much on the crutch of the first-person narration to convey the main character's thoughts to the reader, when it doesn't seem necessary. Grisham should stick to third-person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book stunk. I would have assigned it \\"0\\" stars if that option was available.

I was surprised that the writing itself was so uninspired. It seemed as though Grisham thought his attempt to arouse sympathy for the homeless would be more important than his actual words. Then he avoided many important issues relevant to homelessness and instead relied on portraying a few unrealistic characters. I did finish the book, so maybe I should give it a 2 instead of a 1, but I was very disappointed. I doubt I will read any more Grisham novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much of a plot","review":"it seems to me that Grisham is runniong out of lawyer plots if this effort is an example of his genre. he makes a statement about society and the homeless but an op-ed article in the NYT would have saved me a few bucks.

Ok, so its a great pitch for the homeless people. So it belongs in the sociology section. Certainly not the thrilling pageturner that you've come to expect from John Grisham - it doesnt even have a story.

So when I do read one it better be good. This one, my first Grisham novel, started out strong and gave me the impression that my $7 would be well spent. Like this book or not, the guy weaves a decent tale. But after the first 100 pages or so I got to humming that Peggy Lee tune mentioned above. Was the existing plotline all there was to this book? I kept reading on with suspense thinking there would be some surprise awaiting me around some dark corner, not unlike Michael in the seedy DC neighborhoods, but it never materialized. What started out so promising ended up as a potential script for an upcoming episode of The Practice. At least that would have only wasted an hour of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy, oh boy!","review":"A typical example of middle class angst posing as a crime novel. Worthy topic given a simplistic agit-prop treatment fit for the intellectually challenged. Cardboard, two-dimensional characters. Flimsy and utterly predictable plot which drags us slowly but surely towards a painfully obvious denouement. Not an original idea in sight. On this form Mr. Grisham could do us all a real favour and go back to his legal practice, contractual obligations towards the publisher notwithstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Street Lawyer is one big snooze","review":"I was so disappointed in this latest Grisham book. I kept expecting things to get interesting and mysterious but all I got was hundreds of pages of social commentary. I read Grisham for escapism, not morality harangues. The plight of the poor and homeless in this country is an abomination, but, I don't think that a novel is the best place for advocacy. Mr. Grisham needs to put his show on the road and raise money for the homeless and get back to writing the books where the pages practically turn themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the only book I have read by John Grisham that has been disappointing. There was not much story and lots of crusading for the homeless. I felt that I was being lectured to about the homeless, constantly given statistics, information, etc. about their plight. I found myself skipping pages to find the story and keep up with the \\"plot\\". I found a little bit of crusading for the rain forest, etc. when I read The Testament, but The Street Lawyer was really heavy with crusading. Come on John, just give us your usual good, intrigueing stories, that I can't put down until I finish the book. Forget the promotion of causes...we can get that anywhere. We don't want to pay good money for your books, expecting a good story, then get beat over the head with a \\"cause\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing effort from an otherwise excellent author","review":"John Grisham is concerned about homelessness and poverty in America. He is disgusted by lawyers and others with wealth who do little to help them. This point is made abundantly clear in the first 50 pages. Yet, the entire book serves as a platform for Grisham to wax on endlessly about these, admittedly, serious problems. The book has no fluid motion. He weaves together several flat story lines, all of which end in a climax both dull and too neat. The story isn't well developed, and neither are most of the characters (save Mordeci Green). If he spent a little less time trying to prove how bad homelessness is and devoted it to story and character development, this might be a worthwhile effort. Save your money...and if you are new to Grisham, try \\"The Runaway Jury\\" or \\"A Time To Kill\\" for some of his better stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble-gum book -- the flavor's gone in 10 minutes!","review":"This was my first Grisham book (though I've seen a few of the movies), and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The protagonist is disappointingly flat as a character, although supporting cast like poverty lawyer Mordecai Green are both realistic and admirable. Not much of a build-up, and the climax was disappointing as well -- everything came too easy. Brock's declaration at the very end about how his life did a 180 in 30 days sums it up -- upon finishing the book, the reader has merely lost the few hours it took to read it. If word processors could write a book on their own, the Street Lawyer would be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmmmmmmmm.......","review":"This book was well written but boring.

My advice is if you want to keep on reading grisham don't read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's Best","review":"I found the book quite boring and repeditive. Grisham writes books containing secretive backrooms where mysteries are revealed, a crook that's brought to justice by a nothing lawyer, and of course, a beautiful, long-legged woman in distress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought-provoking but too much details","review":"This is the second novel I've read by Grisham and this one was not a page-turner at all. Pages and pages of details that could've been omitted . . . the only thing that did was to make you think about the plight of homeless people. The Partner, on the contrary, was a much better novel. . . better storyline and better plot at a much faster pace. You won't wanna sleep until you're at the last page. I recommend that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit too \\"politcally correct\\" for me but worth the read.","review":"This is not Grisham's best work but is a good read. I thought it was a bit too \\"politically correct\\" and in that same light not very realistic (a bit too idealistic). I can't give it 5 stars but it still outclasses most of the competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"GRABS you tight, then lets you go...","review":"This book started out incredibly intriguing and was full of potential but ended very \\"blah.\\" It could have had the excitement of The Firm but Grisham chose a different route. I found the story very interesting, but am so disappointed knowing what it could have been... Am looking forward to The Partner as I've heard its quite a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner by Grisham.","review":"I live in the DC area and the details of the area are good. The story line is intriguing. Overall another Grisham hit in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quasi fictional mess","review":"The problem with this book is that it reaches it's peak interest too soon in the very first chapter and from then on it's all downhill. One just keeps hoping that there will be glimpses of the usual Grisham brilliance in the latter parts of the book but only to be let down again and again without any pity. This book really reads like a political commentary on the plight of the homeless with some characters created just to further torture the reader. My personal opinion is that Grisham would have been much better off writing a non-fictional book on this topic intead of creating this quasi-fictional mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Grisham books STAY AWAY - What a waste of time","review":"This is a morality play under the guise of a novel. Hey John, stop the preaching and get back to writing gripping, lawyer stories.The premise is ludicrous. The thought of someone walking away from a million dollar a year job to work as a \\"street lawyer\\" is admirable but not one founded in reality. Don't you think this guy could have done a whole lot more by keeping his job and giving say, half a million a year to the legal clinic which could fund TEN lawyers?The only redeeming part of the book was the end where they finally reach a settlement. It's well written and clever. I wish the rest of the book was like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with his past publications","review":"Personally I was disappointed with this book. It seems that Mr. Grisham was at a low point or his editors were really pushing for a new novel. It's a decent quick read, but not the edge of your seat read like his past novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWEFUL","review":"I've read all of Grisham's books an loved each and every one of them. The Street Lawyer is awful. It does not contain any of the drama, humor or catchy diologue that all of his others have. John, stick to what you do best: writing exiting books. If I want to read about morality and concience, I'll read my Bible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"About a lawyer helping the homeless","review":"A lawyer name Michael who goes out and actually helps people that are less fortunate, (e.g. homeless). In the beginning, a homeless held him and some co-workers hostage. The S.W.A.T team had no choice but to take him out. Michael looked at the dead body and said to himself, \\"Why?\\" After that incident, he started to feel compassionate to homelesses on the street. He aslo works like 200 hrs/month, which averages to 50hrs/week. He is mainly devoted to his job and he totally neglects his wife. She is afraid that they might get into a divorce."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great novel","review":"I am a Highschool Sophomore and a fan of Grisham. I thouroughly enjoyed this book and think it is a wake up call to all who are more fortunate than others. This novel just points out the fact that too many people who can give to the less fortunate dont for whatever reason and this needs to change. I think that The Street Lawyer is an excellent novel about real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as exciting as the vomit bag","review":"I got this from the library (thankfully) for a flight. The delightful stick figures on the flight safety brochure had much more personality than the characters in this terrible book. I like most of Grisham's books, but this was awfully written, and the main character was a pompous idiot (probably not a good idea to write in the first person, so we can see how shallow and misguided he is). Anyway, avoid this at all costs, but if you happen to read it on a plane, insist on as many free drinks as possible; it could either make the book tolerable, or maybe help you forget this schlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot seemed to be conjured up as he went along writing it","review":"I believe John Grisham's main goal was to increase awareness in readers about homelesness in this novel so he just made a lame plot as the basis for this goal. First of all the level of the plot about Micheal stealing the file seemed to be just added for more action. If he didn't get in a car wreck his whole legal situation would not have existed. PLus the file was not really that necessary to the lawsuit to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Grisham's best.","review":"I enjoyed this book almost as much as The Pelican Brief and The Firm. Grisham managed to explore a troubling issue within the context of an attention holding story. I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME","review":"AUTHOR SHOULD WRITE AN ARTICLE ON THE HOMELESS AND NOT MASQUERADE THIS AS A THRILLER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham is finally back on track!","review":"A Time to Kill was his best, and they have gotten progessively worse since. He seems to be turning the corner with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham can do better!","review":"I just finished the book and I think Grisham can do better! What is happening, low on ideas? I am a huge fan of his books, but this one was a little disapointing. I will give him another chance and continue reading his works. Hopefully the next will get better. Check out the Rainmaker and A Time to Kill if you are a first time Grisham reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is too steeped in social conciousness","review":"John Grisham has written several great stories. The Street Lawyer attempts to educate its readers on the plight of the homeless. Yes this is a major issue in our country, but the story does not hold the readers interest. If you really want a great thriller that has homelessness as a theme I would recommend, The Intruder by Peter Blauner. Mr. Grisham you could take a lesson from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham must have written this over a weekend","review":"John Grisham's latest novel (and I say that tounge in cheek) is a sloppily written borefest that preaches that the liberal way is best and the conservative way leads to homelessness and demoralization. It is unrealistic that the lead character would chuck his great career and dedicate his life to the homeless. I think Grisham writes his novels too fast and I think it leads to unentertaining stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting, intellectual, read.","review":"John Grisham does it again with his premier release of 'The Street Lawyer'. I have to admit, it was the first novel I've ever finished in one day (Actually, I'm a pretty slow reader). One good thing about the novel was the ending wasn't like 'The Partner' (I guess Grisham realise it after reading all the reviews here about his crappy ending ^_^ ).The story of a lawyer on the road of fame and fortune, and then became a defender of the homeless is quite touching. I have to admit though, I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that the ending was a bit predictable (on the other hand, all novels' endings are predictable ^_-+ ). Nevertheless, it's good for those who wants to read about life on the streets of America and the injustice that was done upon them.Keep up the good work, Grisham. Please try to write something more 'gripping' and upbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst yet.","review":"A not particularly interesting novel which preaches for the homeless but portrays them as the most unappealing group of people imaginable. Why would anyone give up his career to help people who won't help themselves and make life dificult for those who try to help them? The scene at the beginning in which a man with a gun holds a roomful of lawyers hostage was appealing, however. It would have been vastly improved if he had shot them all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic disguise of Grisham's liberal slant on bums","review":"I guess all of his money has made John Grisham soft! This book is a poor attempt at turning his liberal philosophizing on the \\"plight\\" of bums in Washington DC into a novel. If you can choke down the thinly disguised tirades, there are three or four interesting paragraphs in the books about real estate deals. As a John Grisham fan, especially of the Rainmaker, I'm severely disappointed in this book, and will treat future works with healthy skepticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next to Worst of Grisham novels","review":"I was dispointed by the political agenda that Grisham is beginning to object in his novels, and the intellectual intensity combined with some action is no longer in his plots. I felt like I should read an advertisement for the homeless and while notable I can do that without the help of a book. Still it was better than the Partner because I must have that at least somewhat optimistic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"I've read every Grisham book to date and this is by far the most disappointing. I kept waiting for the Grisham magic to kick in, but the story just limped from one chapter to the next. The basic story was ok, but the Author would have done well to keep this at novella length. I'll read the next, but Grisham's on probation in my book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not up to Grisham's hard hitting past thrillers.","review":"John Grishman is my favorite author and this is the first one of his books that I have not thoroughly enjoyed. It lacks suspense that Grisham's past books have all contained. He chose to have a young woman with children to carry forth his story line probably knowing that he would find little sympathy for any other characters. John Grisham's past books have all been filled with suspense and difficult situations for his leading characters, yet this book contains very little story line to hold the readers attention. I have not recommended this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham is getting lazy...","review":"Boy, am I disappointed. Grisham proved he could write well with \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Pelican Brief.\\" Now he's fallen into some sort of plot trap that he can't seem to get rid of. Brilliant young lawyer becomes disillusioned with legal profession, gets in trouble, and shacks up with someone at the end. If you've read \\"The Client,\\" then you know exactly how this book is going to play out by page 40. And he even managed to abridge the plot from \\"The Client.\\" I guess I'm going to have to look for another source for legal thrillers because this one bored me to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much sociology andtoo little mystery","review":"This book is by no means up to the usual Grisham standard.After a good start it rapidly goes down hill as we hear the usual blather about the downtrodden and the story gets lost in a cloud of selfrecrimmination. The ending is contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was thoroughly disappointed","review":"I have read every book that John Grisham has ever written and this one will be my last if the rest are like the Street Lawyer. When I finished the book I wondered why I even took the time to read it. The story had no depth to it whatsoever. I hope John got the \\"bad one\\" out of his system and gets back to writing what he is good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Grisham's better books","review":"Read the synopsis by Amazon.com and you've essentially read the book. This is a book written in a straight narrative form with no sense of characterization, no suspense, no plot to speak of. However, it is a good tract to make the reader who is unaware of the plight of the homeless more aware. That is the book's only real worth. The editing in regard to usage and punctuation is slipshod at best. It is an easy read, and if the reader is waiting for a plane or bus it's a fast easy read while waiting. It will tax no one's brainpower but it will kill time if time needs killing."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"There was no suspense, no build up to the plot. I didnt care one bit about the hero. Grisham needs to stop trying to put out a bk every 8 months and take the time to write a well thought out bk. He could have done great things with this plot. At 27.95 the bk is terribly overpriced unless proceeds are going to help the homeless he writes about."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO CARES??","review":"I've read most of Mr. Grisham's book, and in my opinion, only A TIME to KIll stands by itself as a decent piece of literature. I wouldn't waste my precious reading time with an author who writes banal, predictable screenplays only to sell out to the highest bidder. Mr. Grisham should either become a movie producer or simply spend more time on his precious baseball diamond which he built for his son anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Airplane Reading","review":"Grisham is entertaining, and so is the book. When you have a layover or a long car trip where you are not driving, pick up this book to read. While this book is not going to set the world on fire, or make you live in a van down by the river, it is good.The main character is a highly paid lawyer who finds his \\"soul\\" and starts practicing public policy / advocacy law. He then gets involved in some crazy plot twists, loses his wife, loses his career, and then becomes a thief.Through all of this he ends up doing good in the end and helping the homeless and taking down the corporate interests who oppose him. A good spin for Grisham off of his other books, and much better than, the Painted House.Joseph Dworak"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sanctimonious and shallow","review":"The characters in this novel are undeveloped, there is no plot, the denouement consists of a settlement conference where a totally predictable negotiation takes place. Grisham seems to have gone \\"slumming\\" and discovered that some people are homeless through no fault of their own. He may even have talked to someone who actually talked to them. The only parts of this novel which sound like he knows what he's talking about are the repeated worries about being in a bad neighborhood with a good car. I wonder how much of the money he earns from this preachy, obnoxious book Grisham will donate to the people whose situations he exploits?If this were a first novel, it would be laughed out of any self-respecting agent's office."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo","review":"this is one of his worst. along with his non fiction book innocent man this was nothing more than a political statement. a time to kill is by far his best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Something Suck More, Please?","review":"This book feels like the author had 300 pages to fill, but only 30 pages of material. And an axe to grind...because he just discovered there were homeless people in the world.

I put \\"one star\\" because they don't have a negative star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Street Lawyer","review":"I only read this book because I knew that it would be a quick read, and it didn't disappoint there. The book is preachy, and just down right silly in some parts. It ends with a very mellow dramatic and anti climatic ending. Unless you need something to read and the air sickness bag just won't cut it, sure, go for it...otherwise, buy a magazine, or just move on -- don't read this...it seemed as though he had a great idea for a novel, but then ran into a deadline."},{"rating":"1","title":"good as a screenplay","review":"It seems to me that Grisham writes for a movie. Although he writes a lot about the homeless, I find it lack of depth. And the young ,white,successful Michael Brock turns from big firm to the streets--unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Grocery List Is More Interesting Read","review":"I just can't believe that John Grisham is a major player in current fiction scene and is considered to be in the same league with Tom Clancy and Stephen King (though I don't like horror stories at all but at least SK knows how to form a sentence).I have read all JG's books and the only ones I enjoyed were \\"The Chamber \\" and \\"The Rainmaker\\". His worst book ever, to me, was \\"The Partner\\" and the \\"Street Lawyer\\" could be a hot contender for that position had it not been for the subject which I found thought provoking (that's why 2 stars). It seems that JG has run out of ideas (which were never abundant to him in the first place) but his books are at least serving one purpose i.e. we have one less lawyer to worry about.Sorry Mr. Grisham, but from now-onwards, you are on my \\"borrow only\\" authors list.Rafi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story line with different setting","review":"I regret that I could not finish this documentary-novel. I simply gave up half way into the book. While I empathize with those who are homeless, and I think our society does have a problem, Grisham has taken the cause too far in novel form. To make a long story short, it is boring. His writing is flat and the character developent falls short. Within 50 pages the protagonist tells all, almost dies, and makes a major life change. None of these events makes one identify with him because of the verbage. I don't think Grisham is a good writer but he sells books. He definitely needs a new start or a good writing course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Thin","review":"Opening crisis: engaging. Development: zero. Plot: paper thin. Characters: thinner. Premise: more ludicrous than usual -- a greedy big-firm lawyer completely reverses his personality after his involvement in a short hostage crisis.John Grisham's long suit is telling us how morally bankrupt lawyers are, suggesting that he ought to know because he was one and now he's superior to the rest of them. Of course he is: he's quit that degrading trade and turned to selling junk in hardcover.Grisham's method is pure stereotype. He purveys the improbable to the credulous. I wish he could take the energy of the opening scene and make it into a novel with a little depth. Just a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible Stinkaroo!!!","review":"To affirm many of the reviews, this one is a stinkeroo! Totally implausible (K street lawyer gets epiphamy? Ha!)

I read the credits at the end thanking several people - he should have donated all profits to the homeless - instead of using them to finance his own greed. I kept thinking through the entire book - no way would this lawyer do this - this story is a joke! I live in the city and see homeless on a daily basis - he should quit writing and use his $$ for something useful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A compassionate author for the poor","review":"This novel talks about a rich lawyer in a big firm, becoming a street lawyer for the homeless, having held a hostage by a homeless man. I would say that this title is not as good as the Rainmaker, though the research is just as good. This is one thing I like about Grisham. His novels are practical at least. Of the 290+ reviews, many criticize a hell out of this book, but I think that it is not so bad, that's why I gave it a 4 star. However, I must say the settlement of the eviction case in the story is not very arousing and exciting, moreover, the ending is not very appropriate (rather abrupt). Personally, I feel that the end could be brushed on upon more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I Have Ever Finished","review":"I must admit I did finish this book (I have a bad habit of finishing what I start---including incredibly bad novels). Please someone tell Mr. Grisham that if he has nothing to say that he shouldn't feel obliged to put out a new book ever year. Or--someone tell his agent. I could care less about the homeless, but if the author had something to say, I could still enjoy a piece of fiction about the subject.

It was very interesting, entertaining and a pleasurable read. While it did not get into real depth, it raised some issues and concerns that the overall public refuse to bring to light.After everything that happened in the beginning of the book, you would think that Claire and his family would be a little more concerned about his well being and his incident. I think those characters were shallow. But, as background characters, their purpose was served. This book is about Michael's revelations and Michael's personal growth.Easy read, interesting and I would recommend it to anyone as a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his Best!!","review":"I read this book over a weekend and have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it! I even liked it as much as The Client, which is my favorite Grisham book. It also has a lesson on ethics within it. We live in a very materialistic society and after reading this book, you really think the next time you buy a shirt at Macy's or go out for dinner and drinks with friends. Not everyone can have these luxuries in life and many of us spend more on a smoothie or coffee from Starbucks than some spend on a meal. It would be a perfect book to tie in with The Lifestyle Makeovers you see on Oprah.That wasn't the only part of the book, though. I did have plenty of law related things as all of his books do.

He has become a left wing liberal who utilizes his books as an instrument to shove his politcal books down our throat.

Why would a great author ruin his books to further a political viewpoint?"},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic","review":"This book grabs you with suspense in the beginning but thats about all it does. It becomes to repetitive with the meeting soul searching as to why he wants to devote his life to helping the homeless. The homeless as described in this book are portrayed as if they were victims of the stock market crash. I am a law enforcement officer in New York City for over twenty seven years and the homeless I have come to met are not how Mr.Grisham portrays his homeless.

Unfortunately, they do not become page-turning books. This book is bad on sooooo many levels, I don't know where to begin.

And while we're on the subject of self-indulgent and preachy -- if I hear one more millionaire rail against the evils of money, I may upchuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"irrelevant points","review":"I was rather surprised to see how boring this book can get. It has a great plot and the beginning is quite good. But after you get through the middle it's hard to keep reading. The author seems to have such a great obsession with telling the reader about what's legal and what's not that it got to a point it was hard to stick with getting through the book. The only reason I read it till the end was to see how the law suit would end up. Which was, rather predictible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring and long-winded sermon.","review":"Grisham has gotten tired. This book has none of the well-crafted plot twists and turns that made his early books exciting. After the opening \\"drama\\" which takes up the first few chapters, nothing much happens. And the book is preachy. Grisham has a sermon for us, namely that we should help the homeless. It is clear that the only reason he wrote the book is to give this sermon. And he hammers us over the head with it for several hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Grisham I'll ever read","review":"Somewhere along the line, Mr. Grisham toppled off his storytelling ladder deciding that the social statement was a more compelling exercise than the entertainment of his readers. I suppose we should have been forewarned with his recent engagements with the tobacco and insurance industries, but our continued purchases in hopes of another 'Firm' or 'Client' seems to have stimulated him to continue in this (moralizing) direction. Surely, the pharmaceutical industry is next, followed by professional sports then Bill Gates and company. If you revel in moralizing lecture/statements on (name the subject), you'll want to read this and all subsequent Grisham books. Me, I prefer stories and entertainment. I'm sticking with P.D. James, Louise Erdrich, Larry Bond and Patrick OBrian.

I waited six weeks on the library's waiting list to read a tale that was somehow supposed to make me feel more compassion for the homeless. Every character in the book was exactly that -- a character. Not anyone in real life, just the stereotypical bleeding heart lawyer working to save the homeless, the man who suddenly gets an epiphany and chucks it all to do the same, the homeless loser mother and her four kids who die in the streets. Blah blah blah.If Grisham was hoping to cleanse his own soul by bringing his message/guilt about the homeless to his readers, then sorry, this reader didn't take the bait.

The Street Lawyer had one disturbing problem - I had to force myself to pick it up with the hopes that it would improve which as we all know , it didn't. I don't know who wrote this book, but it wasn't Grisham (at least I hope not). I'll be waiting for the next one. I hope it's better because unlike in baseball where it's three strikes and out, for Grisham it will be two strikes and you're out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tyler Comans","review":"Street Lawyer is an excellent book that has a beginning that really grasps your interest and holds that interest all the way through the novel. Any ways its a legal story about a big-shot lawyer from Washington DC that involves love, lust, betrayal, murder, mystery, deceit, suspense, romance and sex galore. This is a fast read just like all of John Grisham's novel, which makes them great novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading Ms.b","review":"I love books about law!! This book was really great but it wasn't exactly a great court room drama which is what I expected. It was more like a chance for John Grisham to express his political views,thoughts, and Ideas. I strongly disagree with Giving everything to the Homeless, which is what was suggested at certain times throughout the book.I suppose that if you agree with Grishams political views this would be a great book to read. But as for me.... I'll be sticking to his better novels!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooof!","review":"i cant believe i actually paid money for this book. the only thing that would make this story worse is if some bonehead made it into a movie. no plot, no development of characters, one of his worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for killing time on a 5-hr flight, but mostly boring...","review":"Grisham's \\"The Street Lawyer\\" won't keep you turning the pages with excitement like his earlier novels (\\"The Firm\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\"). There's not a whole lot of suspense, fear, or emotion in this novel -- the main character has an epiphany that leads him to leave his high-paying, power law firm for a street clinic, helping out the homeless with their legal problems -- not the stuff of a thriller. To be sure, there's some contrived tension arising from some shady characters threatening physical violence and the hope that you're still reading The Firm. But the story mostly just unfolds and then gets resolved. At least the main character doesn't end up living in Aruba at the end of this story :-)For true Grisham fans (and I'm one of them), it's a quick and easy read that you might as well add to your collection, but it won't leave you talking about it the next day like many of his other novels..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Worse than The Partner","review":"I really liked John Grisham books, until i read the boring \\"The Partner\\".

Much of it is spent preaching the plight of the homeless and indicting anyone who does not see his own point of view. Forsaking plot, character development and writing skills to allow himself a soapbox to slap the hand of those he disagrees with, Grisham has reached the height of ego gratification. Next time, he should just pay for a half hour of prime time television and yell at those of us who he blames for the street people. This novel is boring, charmless and beneath the type of skills he has proven in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best grisham book ever","review":"grisham strikes again with a thriller that starts right from the beginning. again like in the partner, grisham made the ending just a tad bit CHEESY!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham at his worst!","review":"As a huge fan of author John Grisham, I must be honest in my attempt to sway those interested in spending some time with The Street Lawyer.

I really apprechiate reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't bought it!","review":"This is the first John Grisham book that I have regretted buying before learning more about it. This book was more of a political agenda than a novel. Next time, John, if I want to have your political views shoved down my throat I'll ask for it. Give us The Firm & A Time To Kill not The Street Lawyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't pay for it","review":"While I am a true lover of Grisham book, this one was terrible. It was slow, anticlimatic, and just flat out dragged on. The story lacked in excitement and was overburdened with sentimental details about the homeless. I want the courtroom excitement of a Time to Kill, the suspense and legal strategies of the Partner, the Firm, and the Pelican Brief. I am just glad I borrowed this book rather than paying for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham at his worst","review":"I would have given this book 1/2 star if I could. I loved all of Grisham's others, so reading this one was VERY disapointing.The story line was slow and the characters were not as well developed as some of his other books. If you want this book, I recommed you buy it used for maybe $0.50"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"What a disappointment. I never finished this book and wish that I'd stopped long before I did. It doesn't get any better.I usually love Grisham's books, but this one is weak. Try The Testament or The Pelican Brief or The Firm if you want to read a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly predictable, not worth the money","review":"Another example of people blaming others for their state in life. Fine, the plight of poor, homeless people is deplorable but don't go blaming rich folks (whoever those are) for that. The book spends so much time blaming the rich (and the govt) for the homeless situation in DC while ignoring the fact that these homeless people, in most cases, brought it upon themselves. For example, a character in the book called Ruby consistently kept relapsing into drug abuse despite all Michael Brock's efforts. However, instead of blaming her, Grisham does not. Besides, if I bust my butt working (no one can deny the fact that even lawyers at Drake & Sweeny work as hard, maybe harder, as every other person), why should I be made to feel guilty about someone who spends every dollar he/she gets on drugs and alcohol? Finally, I think Grisham will do us all a favor if he returns to his law practice instead of turning out books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST WHAT I EXPECTED-QUICK AND VERY LIGHT.","review":"EVEN with the attempt of a heavy story, this book fails to envoke emotion on a subject that deserves a harder look. typical Grisham, the writing flows, is easy to follow and can be finished during dinner. The book builds up and but doesn't have a major conclusion, not a lot of excitement and no empathy for the main character. In The Firm, my heart was racing, in the The Street Lawyer-nothing. It is not a bad book and I will probably continue to read his novels, but this is one of his weaker stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"After The Firm and A Time To Kill, its been all down hill.","review":"Its funny what a writer can do when he's is a struggling writer/artist.Many of Grishams stories have aspects which are a bit farfetched, but the notion that a 120,000$ lawyer would leave his practice so suddenly to work with the poor is ludicrous. This book ,although readable, is Grisham's worst. I guess he had to pump a novel out in record time. We may have seen the best of Grisham 5-6 books ago!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Grisham I've read","review":"This wasn't about courtrooms and leagalese to the point of choking, but it was the best Grisham since \\"A Time to Kill\\".

I purchased \\"The Street Lawyer\\" the week it was released with anticipation of an interesting yarn. I think I made it to page 100 or so...I could not stomach it any further. This book was the whiniest, liberal, elitest, republican bashing trash I had ever come across. PLEASE, if we want to hear someone's liberal social commentary, we can watch CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, or read the New York Times. I read books to get away from this crap, not receive more of it.Just to be fair, I should mention I gave \\"The Street Lawyer\\" a second chance.

He's not a particularly gifted writer, but he knows his genre. However, it was good to read a novel about a lawyer who grows a conscience.I think for anyone who has dealt directly with the homeless, this book will strike a chord. For those who ignore or deny the existence of social problems, it will merely be another thorn in the side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving back to society........","review":"The book street lawyer to me was very interesting. I liked the way john grisham took the world of corporate lawyers and turned it into something else. He shoes how in need of protection the needy people of the world are by showing us the world of street law. The street lawyer tells a good tale of a man who goes beyond the money and fame, and look into his heart to find his tru mission in the world of law."},{"rating":"1","title":"John's Gone Hollywood!","review":"The Street Lawyer is a disappointing LITTLE book that reads, to me, more like a 90-minute, cookie-cutter movie script and not the full-length, page-turning novel I'd expect from someone capable of A Time to Kill or The Partner. The opinions expressed by the author appeared long ago in The Communist Manifesto, there's no character development, and the loose ends left in end are too numerous to mention.If you can't wait for a copy at the library, at least wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham is becoming a better and more thoughtful writer","review":"I am a lawyer who quit a 6-figure partnership at a large corporate firm to represent injured consumers, so this book did resonate with me.

Give it a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Grisham's Action and amazing plot???","review":"Grisham's latest is not Grisham at his best. Thinking of previous books whith amazing twists and turns in the story, I found The Street Lawyer BORING. The story about the young ambitious lawyer that sees the light was not much more to me than a long story to get the space between front and back cover filled. No plot, no emotion, no action.Grisham can and should do better. Looking forward to another classic like The Partner, The Chamber or The Firm."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good!","review":"This book was very well written.

Over all I really recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I've come to expect from the master","review":"I bought The Street Lawyer with high hopes that it would be better than its predecessor, The Partner. I was disappointed. I was enthralled by the first two chapters; reminded that every author is entitled to a \\"dud\\". However after that, there was nothing. This was fundamentally the story of a guy that quit his job, got a divorce, and moved out. There was no visible antagonist, no conflict to speak of, and NO drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly preachy with lousy character development","review":"This is a book of \\"one-ness.\\" Single dimension characters, one tedious and labored theme, and a singularly misplaced responsiblity. Washington DC's homeless problem is blamed on 1) the Republicans (and specifically, Newt), 2) the rich (specifically, the educated rich), and the fact that \\"Washington, DC just doesn't work.\\" Not once in his heavy-handed preaching did Grisham mention the word, \\"Barry.\\" I didn't give this a \\"1\\" out of loyalty for his real books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Shlock.","review":"I got about halfway through the book waiting for something interesting to happen. I started getting annoyed because not only was it a bad read, but also because it was preachy and maudlin.

I'm glad I only borrowed this book and didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"another one","review":"Dear John! The plot is known, the result is predictable, don't write another one.

His writing has gradually deteriorated since \\"the Firm.\\" Even the concept of this book is lame: big city lawyer chucks in all away to help the homeless. Did Grisham write this because he feels guilty making big bucks from movie deals?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A half-hour sitcom vs mini-series","review":"Unfortunately, John Grisham has undoubtedly been led down the path to commercialism. His first few books were very good. This one lacked character development, it was like he had a predetermined page count to fill while his agent and publisher were in the next room with a stop watch. This book was like watching a half hour sitcom vs the mini series I was hoping for. Thumbs down"},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP...","review":"Another \\"compelling social drama of our time\\".

I do not understand why someone with so much talent for good stories and real plots have to try for a social stand. THAT IS NOT WHY WE BUY YOUR BOOKS JOHN.I have enjoyed and bought every book written by Grisham but think that in the future I may wait for the paperback and read a few reviews first.I was very disappointed and quit reading the book (first time ever!) after about 2/3rds of the way through it. It did not even interest me enough to finish the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very pleasant read.","review":"The Street Lawyer. Which I had to by, because I had to know whether this book was different from the other. A very thrilling and exiting novel, I declined lunch on my plane just to continue my reading of the book. I was looking forward to the ending of the book, to see how the storry ended. Is had a nice ending, in line with how the storry progressed. I like John Grisham again.

I somtimes feel sorry for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham Takes on Homelessness","review":"John Grisham basically writes two types of novels: legal thrillers where a young lawyer takes on the mob, or courtroom dramas where a young lawyer takes on large corporations. I prefer the courtroom dramas. True, Grisham can get heavy-handed at times with the morals of his novels, but in THE STREET LAWYER, he combines his moralizing with believable and likable characters, something that was missing in THE PARTNER. The last chapter can be taken two ways: either as pure fantasy, or as Grisham's reminder of the good effects huge law firms could create if they would unleash their associates as advocates for the homeless and other disenfranchised members of American society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome leftist propoganda","review":"The Street Lawyer is Grisham's worst book. It appears he wrote it as a way of relieving his 'guilt' for being a successful wealthy writer. As usual, the Republicans (Reagan and 'Newt') are blamed for all of the ills of society and anyone with money obtained it by taking advantage of the poor and downtrodden. Don't waste your time with this tiresome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"John Grisham covers an issue that few people want to admit exists! This was a verythought provoking story. I could not put this one down until I finished....and then when I did, the reality of it can not be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Society, $5 trillion-- but it's Reagan's fault","review":"Sadly, Grisham has gone the way of Patricia Cornwell with me. Instead of anxiously awaiting the release of their next novel-- I'll be looking somewhere else. (Try The Unlikely Spy or Los Alamos) The Street Lawyer was horrible for several reasons. First-- the political undertow became too much. Maybe Mr. Grisham should reconsider his premise-- forty years of Democratic rule, $5 trillion dollars spent on LBJ's Great Society-- but its all the Republican's fault. Pure Hog Wash! Secondly, Grisham let his obvious political prejudice sidetrack what was admittedly a good premise. This is not a thriller. If I wanted to read an expose on the homeless, then I would pick up the Washington Post or The New York Times. Goodbye Mr. Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me kinda empty","review":"Just when I thought there was reason to cheer--a new John Grisham book--I read it. Although it did keep me enthralled as I was reading it, I can't honestly say that I liked it too much. It's a page turner, but it leaves you feeling kind of hollow. But I may just be biased. I read an interview somewhere in which Grisham said that he didn't like writing, but he liked being a published author. Speaking as a writer who loves to write and has yet to be published, may I suggest to Mr. Grisham that he seriously rethink his career if he really doesn't like the work--and let someone who has a more original idea step forward for a little glory?"},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY wanted to like the book!","review":"As much as I wanted to I just couldn't. This is terrible. As MANY others have said, this is a soap box. Mr. Grisham does an okay job of making you aware of the homeless problem in D.C. but come on, did it need 350 pages. Add a helping of plot and a couple of sprinkles of good character and another hundred pages to get the mix just right and you might have had a story worth reading. I venture a guess that with one more like this one and we won't be hearing the name John Grisham anymore. That would be a shame considering how he started out with A Time To Kill and The Firm. Put a little more than a month into the next one Mr. Grisham. Most of us really enjoyed them when you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money!!","review":"I feel absolutely ripped off by having bought this book. I first noticed that the margins were wider and the type seemed larger and so there just isn't much there, either in volume or content. It was preachy, shallow and uninteresting. It must have been a walk in the park for Grisham to write this one and he should feel ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be any slower?","review":"I am a fan of John Grishams books but this one? The first 50 pages were excellent then it just stops. I started reading it in November and still have 150 more pages to go - I took it with me to the ER to read where I spent 5 hours, I knew I had no other choice but to read this book and that's why I am on page 300 now.I don't see the purpose of describing each and every client in detail that walks into the main characters office.Honestly - it's a waste of time, but it will not stop me from reading and buying more of Grishams books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaw droppingly bad","review":"The literally equivalent of elevator muzak or the dreaded Kenny G. Pious concern for the homeless can't disguise the fact that this is not worth the effort required to lift it from the library shelf, let alone part with money for the thing. Appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely had higher expectations for a Grisham novel","review":"This is my least favorite Grisham to date. It is hard to believe that we're reading the same man who wrote those blockbuster legal thrillers. This work is just thrown together and the plot is extremely lame. It hinges on a major life change for main character Michael which is presented on shaky footing and never fully backed up to the reader. We just have to accept that he does a 180-degree change in character, since that is the basis for the entire novel.Grisham presents a fantasy world in which the citizens of DC rally around a homeless woman and our street lawyer changes the world for the better. What?! Since when does the plight of any homeless person ever make a blip on the news media's radar? The end of this book is pure \\"happily ever after\\" drivel that has no basis in reality. I didn't know Grisham was trying out the fantasy genre these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring and more boring. Did I mention it's boring?","review":"Booooooooorrrring!!!

His characters and stories are believable. Does anyone out there think a lawyer making a lucrative salary is going to throw it all away just to become poor, homeless, helpless, downtrodden, blah, blah, blah, like his clients? And one other thing- -the wife should either have been murdered by someone, anyone, early in the novel, or just not included at all. Mr. Grisham has tremendous writing skills but he fell into the abyss with this one. I find that in the used bookstores I frequent there are numerous hardbacks of this novel that have been traded in. Not so with his others. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bleeding heart story of all the saintly homeless people.","review":"I have enjoyed all of Grisham's books (and have read them all) except this one.

It moved slowly, and kept rehashing the same theme about the plight of the homeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great story","review":"I thought The Street Lawyer was an excellent book I loved the fact the one incident brought a very well-off lawyer to reality. Due to the incident that started the book, Micheal realized that money wasn't everything and that there were some very needy people around him. I found it inspiring that the very respected lawyer gave up everything to become a public interest lawyer, working for almost nothing compared to his previous salary. I also recommend this book because it is easy reading even though it is long. I am thirteen years old and read this book in less than a week, reading for about a hour each day. All in all, I highly recommend John Grisham's The Street Lawyer. Because I found this story so great I will now read other books by John Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I couldn't wait to turn the pages.

Keep up the current pace or change your life and learn to live at the same time. However, he doesn't let Brock ponder a meadow of flowers or a babbling brook, he puts Brock in a hostage situation and helps him make his decision by scaring the... out of him.Of course, THE STREET LAWYER wouldn't be a Grisham book if there wasn't deception and secrecy. That all gets thrown in as well. But, I think, deep down, this book takes a step away from typical Grisham by giving the readers a look at a part of life most ignore -- the homeless.Read for the Grisham factor, but enjoy for the life lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm.......","review":"After reading the previous books.... I was a little let down by this one. It was a good story, just not exciting... And way too long for this subject.However, out of respect for Grisham, I finished it.

There are no plot twists and no interesting characters. The writing style is amateurish at best. Grisham can definitely write page turners, \\"The Pelican Brief\\" and \\"The Firm\\" come to mind, but this is not one of them. Skip the book. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resting on your laurels, John?","review":"I'm an avid John Grisham fan, and was thus appalled by this exceedingly unrealistic story. There could not be better evidence that time hasn't been kind to Grisham's literary talents.The main character could not possibly exist for real. No one gives up a marriage and career with earning potential in the millions to live in squalor and despair. I don't care how altruistically bankrupt you are.The plot is also beyond redemption, based on a trifling little detail hardly worth one's interest or time. Let me sum it up for you: Michael Brock gives up his entire life, millions of dollars, and his marriage just so a shockingly small amount of homeless people can reap half-hearted, measly compensation.Clearly not in the class of the Firm, the Client, and the Pelican Brief."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book he has written and with a ludicrous premise.","review":"I have read all of Grishams books. Each one is weaker than the last. This one falls in quality and credibility as if it ran off a cliff.His premise is that all street people are wonderful citizens who would live in mansions and contribute greatly to the world if only the rest of us hard working people would stop exploiting them. On the other hand, those of us who take a responsible part in society are money grubbing evil robber barons and exploiters of these poor folk. He further contends that all druggies and alcoholics on the street want to reform, but again, you guessed it, we exploiters won't let them.If you believe this crap, you have your head in the sand. John Grisham has never met a street person in his life while a lot of us have.I will never buy or read another Grisham novel again. I am sure that bothers Mr. Moneybags a lot. Why doesn't he give all his millions to the homeless? You know the answer to that as well as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - save your time and money","review":"Grisham's worst book by far (and I've enjoyed most of his stuff to date). A mediocre apology for the self-inflicted losers in society (drug abusers and prostitutes fare better than guy working 90 hours a week). Apparently, Grisham, having made plenty of money to date (which he earned), now feels sufficiently guilty about it that he wants the rest of us to help bring social \\"justice\\" about, so long as he gets to define the term. I could have lived through the social whining if there had been a story there, btu there wasn't much of one. An embarassment for Grisham and a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic, Preachy and Maudlin","review":"I used to love Grisham novels, but have since lost interest but I bought the Street Lawyer expecting little disappointment, since I only paid a buck for it at a book sale, but the disappointment was more than expetation. It gives a good view of life on the streets in urban DC, but most of us are aware of it from the news, or by walking down the average DC street.I want something more than pedantic preaching and maudlin guilt pumped out at a new level from the Presbyterian rich. I have kind of given up on Grisham since he seems to take strictly one side to every issue as if only Liberals have a heart for anything. I guess I got my noney's worth and if another Grisham book for a buck comes out, I may give it a go. I'd be even more enclined to buy them if a his novels cost less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring !!!","review":"I kept waiting for something exciting to happen in this book, but it never came. As I approached the end, I was expecting a twist in the story - or a surprise ending - but it never came. Do not waste your time with this book, as it was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"The premise of this book is so interesting - a homeless man holds up a law office. But the premise is the only interesting part of this book. Even the hold-up scene itself is weak. Then suddenly the narrator spends all his time thinking over the fact that he is rich but other people are poor and trying to reconcile his lifestyle with the ideology he developed in 14 seconds, which is instantly his only characteristic. Sure, people have life-changing experiences, but this guy would never exist in real life. He's just tacky and unrealistic - had he never seen a homeless person before?Grisham clearly wrote this to prove a point (or to make some bucks) and neglected to make the story interesting and the characters worth caring about. Seriously, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing, please save the politics.","review":"If you are a big John Grisham fan, as I am, get ready to be disappointed. This book never really gets exciting. People who may like this book: Strong liberals who enjoy a famous writer using his book as a platform for more spending on social welfare programs; and second, People who live in DC may enjoy his details of the various areas of the city.If you're a Conservative Republican...STAY AWAY! You will be thoroughly annoyed by this book. Unfortunately I fall into this category and I give it a THUMBS DOWN! Read \\"Time to Kill\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about this one","review":"This one has to be, by far, the worst book by Grisham, or should I say the only one which is not excellent.

The novel plods along (after a rather exciting beginning) and never really picks up speed. The ending is too predictable and it's easier to feel sorrow for the main character than admiration! Unfortunately, both The Partner and this novel make me wonder if JG should consider going back to his \\"roots\\" and return to courtroom drama. I wouldn't recom mending spending your hard-earned dollars for this lemon... check it out from the library (and ask for 4 weeks... it may take you that long to wade through it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Legal Thriller (NOT!!!!)","review":"This book is an embarrassing effort by John Grisham. His characters are so plastic and phony that I couldn't identify with any of them. Mr. Ambition, Michael Brock, looks death in the face. He survives, but has to ditch his job, wife, possessions and family. He cares so much for the homeless that he always feeds them cookies and donuts. Oh, what a message. What is the moral of the story? John Grisham can't write. Please, save yourself some agony. Do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeless","review":"When was the last time you set aside some money for the homeless, maybe its time? A well known lawyer of the drake and Sweeney law firm, Michael Brock, became a new man with a blink of an eye. Being held hostage by a homeless guy with eight other lawyers, he moved to a cheaper life, law firm, and town. He rounded up a triangle of trouble, stealing, and lying. Find out what happens next with this twisted life.I liked this book because of all the drama. It was never just one thing but three all happening at the same time, with the homeless, wife, and, job your eyes will be glued. I also liked the fact that the book was based on real life places like the Legal Clinic.I have found that this book doesn't have one title, mystery, drama, or suspense. So I feel that if you read this book you will like it no matter what you always read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring and predictable","review":"As an avid Grisham reader, I couldn't wait for The Streetlawyer to become available. I read it in less than a day. That's how boring this book was. Other times I want to savour the story as long as possible and force myself to read only when I'm on the train. Extremely predictable, no substance, no debth of character and I truly regret spending so much money on the book (living in Europe makes it almost double the original cost). The story is almost a documentary dedicated to the homeless (which I commend), with no logic, the homeless people involved not really having a chance to tell their story or why Grisham decided to dedicate his next multi-million dollar book to them. My question is: what is Mr. Grishman's annual income and is he feeding the hungry, like \\"Mister\\" so adequately asked in the first chapter. If he is, more power to him. If he's not; now he knows where to turn to. Just leave us out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas but it's definitely a future Hollywood movie.","review":"This is really not a bad book. I realize that he is manipulating his name and writing with intent to eventually make money off of a Hollywood box office hit but this story makes you think. His past books didn't really do that. Homelessness is running rampant all of our country and the majority of the U.S population (270 million) don't think twice about it, only that they don't wish this terrible misfortune to fall upon them. But many of these people didn't take to life on the streets because they wanted to. The reasons are diverse. Grisham is a good writer overall and I think for the first time he has attempted to make his large fanfare think about deeper issues than just about courtroom procedure, etc. I hope he continues on this track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham's best book since \\"The Rainmaker\\"!","review":"This book is one of the best Grisham has come out with in years! \\"Street Lawyer\\" has the same feel to it that \\"The Rainmaker\\" did. The ending is great, and the plot carries through brilliantly. The soapbox for the homeless is obvious, but the story isn't affected too bad by it. A VERY satisfying read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuel for Ego","review":"Everytime I buy A Grisham book, I swear I won't buy the next one and this time I MEAN IT. I wish I knew how to send this book to Grisham so he could use it to heighten his soap box or use it to fuel the fires of his ego!If readers want a good thriller, try Michael Connelly (Concrete Blonde, Trunk Music) and I suggest Grisham read Connelly to find how it is suppose to be done! Not another dime from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you want SOMETHING quick to read!!!","review":"The characters in this book didn't have depth. He didn't make you really care about them and theirsituations. There didn't seem to be any real deepdown dialogue between anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movie.","review":"John Grisham's novels have steadily gone downhill. Instead of writing literature, he is writing screenplays. For this book, the characters have no depth, the plot is very predictable and unfocused. I borrowed it from my best friend to read on a cross country flight. She doesn't want it back, and I got more entertainment and mental stimulation from watching cloud formations.If you are a reader, don't waste your time. If you prefer movies, wait until it comes on TV at 3am and watch it when you are drunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"An execptional disappointment from a first rate author.","review":"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed most of Grisham's books. It was for this reason that I started this book with great anticipation. About half way through, however, I found myself laboring not to put the book down. With more than 13 years in Santa Monica, CA, I have had more than a little exposure to the homeless. Grisham conveniently omits homeless behavior which commonly occurs in our area: aggressive and threatening panhandling, urination in public places, assaults, etc. I have no doubt that my personal experiences with the homeless have influenced my reaction to the book. Having said that, I must add that the book lacks realism and, with the exception of the \\"real\\" street lawyer (Mr. Green), lacks character development. It could have been a far better book with a little more realistic portrayal of homeless behavior and a little more believable principal character."},{"rating":"1","title":"please return to your legal/mystery roots","review":"I have read all JG's books. First one in line when a new one comes out. Although I live in metro. Washington, D.C. and can relate to many of the places discussed in the book, I found it rather dull.

We need your talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Life...","review":"outside of Tennessee or Kentucky or wherever the heck you are from, Mr. Grisham!!!

I began reading his books long before he became a mega star. I've really enjoyed his work and looked forward to this one.What a major disappoinment. There was absolutely no suspence.....until the last 15 pages of this short book. The ending was predictable right from page 1. If he wanted to make this book into a movie, it would have to be shown on Nick at Night on Nickelodeom.I felt ripped off. It seemed to me that Grisham just through something together to make a buck. I've found short essays more interesting and exciting.I really hope that he puts more effort and passion into his next book.....and not just turn out something for the publishers to pitch to his fans for $25.I hated to write this, but I needed to say it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Street Lawyer","review":"The Street Lawyer was an excellent book! It was interesting and easy to follow. Michael Brock's life as a powerful lawyer in a big firm, a loyal friend to his co-workers, and a husband does a complete one-eighty. Brock does something legally and ethically wrong that he didn't intend on doing. Getting into trouble causes Brock to become a street lawyer and changes his life forever. John Grisham did a superb job giving this book suspense. I couldn't put The Street Lawyer down and strongly recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham has done better","review":"Despite being an avid reader and an immense John Grisham fan, I found \\"The Pelican Brief\\" slow and stale.

Really horrible. Trust me.","review":"I had never read a John Grisham book. But I am generally a believer in the notion that \\"if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so.\\" So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing. A week ago I picked up \\"The Street Lawyer,\\" and I was prepared to be entertained.Boy, was I wrong.This book stinks to high heavens. This man cannot write. \\"The Street Lawyer\\" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches. I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy. Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly breathtaking","review":"In this book, a homeless man takes hostage nine people including Michael(the main charecter). They somehow find their way out. I will not go any further because that would give it away. Overall this is a great book to read. I would recomend this book for the older generation of readers because there are a lot of big words. If you are reading this review right now then I encourage you to put down the book you are currently reading and start reading the Street Lawyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Street Lawyer could be retitled 'The Sedative Lawyer'","review":"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of Grisham's previous novels so I was very disappointed with this one---it was predictable, the characters lacked depth, and tedious to complete.Perhaps Grisham should choose between either writing an 'issue' book or writing an entertaining story---clearly he wasn't successful attempting to do both.This book has made me wary of future Grisham novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do As I Say...Not As I Do","review":"After Grisham's gratituitous digs at and lack of tolerance for politicians of a different persuasion, I was anxious to read the last page of the book where John was donating the proceeds from the sale of this book to the homeless. Unfortunately, I didn't find such a page. I guess the profits go into this rich writer's pocket and the homeless can keep sleeping in cars. The writer's hypocrisy certainly detracts from the effect and believability of the book. True Grisham fans will be able to read the book, but if this Grisham book is your first -- don't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down.....","review":"Finally the \\"new\\" Grisham came to Holland, I was really looking forward to a few nights of lost sleep anxiously reading what would happen next.

I can write better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correctness + Boredom= The Street Lawyer","review":"Dissapointment. The Street Lawyer began as a wild fire that grabbbed you in the beginnig chapters. After the suspense and action concluded by about page 25,the fire was all but extinguished. The Street Lawyer could have been told in only a few sentences. Money isnt everything. Respect the homeless. Yada,Yada, yada. This novel fooled me with its initial excitement, and resulted in a dull,slow waste of time. Dont get me wrong. Grisham is my favorite author. I find most of his novels intriguing. But this book was a departure from his usual courtroom suspense. And an unsuccessful one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money is important but its NOT everything","review":"After a slight dissapointment with the Runaway Jury, I found the Street Lawyer full of emotions. This is so especially when an incident hit Mike and changed his entire life and its not impossible to happen to us. In life money is important but its not everything, there's more to it in life than just $$$$$. I am also touched by the author's comments that he had not worried too much about the homeless before writing this book but with his effort this book was published and I believe it has touched him emotionally one way or the other. Thumbs up to Grisham for delivering such an entertaining story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This book opens itself up, with every moment like a climax. Although the ending leaves much to be told, it is thrilling and the sideshow of Michael helping the homeless only makes it better. This book, kept me up late last night. The language is even halfway decent. I don't see why this book has three stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment, same old same old.","review":"This book is not worth the paper its written on. Grisham is falling into the same trap as Robin Cook once did. He writes the same story over and over in different settings. This worked for a while, but is getting old rapidly. The theme of this book leaves a lot to be desired, a bleeding heart liberal wants to save the homeless, who are too lazy to get a job and provide for themselves. The only new element in this book was that the lawyer did not quit in the end. he might as well have...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's called character . . .","review":"It'd be nice if John Grisham got in touch with what a lot of us like to call \\"character development.\\" I'm impressed and pleased that Grisham decided to use some of his clout to shine a light on a serious and often-ignored problem, but the writing is weak, the characters are generic, and the tome - though I agree with the intent of its message - is far too preachy to be persuasive."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST Grisham to Date !!!","review":"Having read all of John Grisham's novels, I have to say this was by far the worst of his books to date.I can take a little \\"preaching\\" as long as it is woven into an interesting story.I'll be checking my next Grisham book out of the local library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU'VE READ ONE GRISHAM, YOU'VE READ THEM ALL","review":"This is the latest in Grisham's growing list of formula novels. The plots are predictable, the characters stereotypical, the lessons preachy. He has clearly lost the magic of his earlier books. The real cliffhanger for me is what Grisham will do with all those millions of dollars he earns from all the readers who were subjected to his personal \\"give it all away and follow me\\" manifesto. If he wants to provide a realistic view of lawyers, I suggest he visit some who are actually in the trenches and who actually know where the courthouse is.

I have read all the Grisham books, and when I finished, and yes, I finished, I slammed the book closed and thought...a ghost writer wrote this for Grisham.

I find it plausible, at best to digest such work from a great author like yourself.

I wished that it was 100 or so pages longer. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"For some unknown reason Mr. Grisham paints a lawyer who helps the homeless as a saint. There are so many real saints in this country who give of themselves over and over again to help the homeless, the hungry, etc. and they make far less than $30,000 a year. And they aren't ashamed, nor do they think they are \\"holier than thou\\", like the \\"Street Lawyer\\".This book angered me and as several other readers have noted, I certainly hope Mr. Grisham gives all of the proceeds of this book to homeless organizations throughout the country. If he doesn't, he is a hypocrite.This book was very unrealistic in parts and overall it felt like Mr. Grisham dictated the entire book in one sitting to his overworked secretary. One last comment, my fiance is a lawyer and was not surprised that Mr. Grisham is focusing on his career as a writer because the references to legal issues were often inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT UP TO GRISHAM'S STANDARD","review":"This is a very shallow story that plays on a major real tragic problem.

This one, however, lacks suspense and is full of predictable, tired, and cliche verbage. Although his crusade to illustrate the plight of the homeless is respectable, his analysis of the problem is overly simplistic and pretentious. I had trouble finishing the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!! kept me reading all the way through!!","review":"I thought was an excellent book, with a lot of suspense on it.

This one not beeing so much about law it self, but also about the people in the streets, the homeless. The book gives you a good picture of the american sociaty, where people just think about them self, and not of other. It gives you an inside into how the communaty is not thinking about the poor, but only at the rich - the tipical, stupid, duble-standard US sociaty is under attac - and it is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and plotless","review":"When I first started the Street Lawyer, I was extremely delighted to see that it resembled \\"The Rainmaker\\", one of my favorites of Grisham. The perspective was the same, it had good elements in the beginning, and it seemed like it was going to be a real page-turner. Instead, what I found was a boring mess with no plot. The conclusion seemed to be rushed, as it is resolved in the final 3 pages or so...this is truly the most boring book I have ever read...I almost had to force myself to finish it. It seemed to be a book telling you about the homeless, with the characters as an afterthought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already with a lawyer saving the little people","review":"Okay, this is Grisham's ninth novel about an inexperienced lawyer going to bat for the poor and unfortunate. As with his others, it is well written (thus the second star), but this one was simply formula, nothing more, nothing less. Yes, I have sympathy for those living on the streets, but only to a certain extent. Many panhandlers make up to $500.00 a day, begging. I agree that this country has a long way to go to helping the homeless, but to portray all homeless as victims is stretching things much too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess good authors can write TRASH too","review":"Only buy the paperback edition of this book.

What John Grisham needs to do is read his first four novels. Ever since The Chamber, Grisham has seen fit to make a social comment rather than tell a gripping, suspenseful story. This book is typical of everything since The Client. The story takes almost 300 pages to get moving and then it ends too quickly. There is nothing suspenseful about the book. It is predictable and trite. If he would just re-read The Firm and go from there I am sure that he would once again recapture many of his disappointed fans. Drop the social commentary, quit demonising insurance companies, the death penalty, tabacco companies, et al."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy and boring","review":"I found this book to be extremely boring. By the 300th page I was still telling myself \\"Maybe NOW the actual story will start.\\" But nothing really happens in this book.

Get on with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not judge John Grisham by this book!","review":"It was with anticipation that I bought The Street Lawyer. I also read the book with anticipation. Every page I anticipated that something would happen. I am considering writing to John Grisham and demanding my money back. The book was so slow and painfully pointless.

For example, the narrator is 32, but doesn't speak like anyone that age. 32 year olds don't describe people using words like \\"youngster,\\" \\"coed,\\" \\"queers,\\" and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a page-turner","review":"A great story. This was my first Grisham novel, and I really enjoyed this story. It was definitely a page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what I expected, quick and very light.","review":"EVEN with the attempt of a heavy story, this book fails to envoke emotion on a subject that deserves a harder look. typical Grisham, the writing flows, is easy to follow and can be finished during dinner. The book builds up and but doesn't have a major conclusion, not a lot of excitement and no empathy for the main character. In The Firm, my heart was racing, in the The Street Lawyer-nothing. It is not a bad book and I will probably continue to read his novels, but this is one of his weaker stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real nail-grower!!!!","review":"Save your money - the weakest of all Grisham works to date. Hardly worth the trees cut down to print it on. Don't even bother reading it in paperback. Highly recommended for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the story?","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books and have always considered them great stories. Street Lawyer was an exception. This was a difficult book to read to completion. After the initial incident in the law office in the beginning of the book, the rest was dull. Hoping for some interesting events, I continued to read, however the story never takes off and remains boring until the end. Hope Grisham starts writing interesting stories as he once did. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed.","review":"Usually when you get real tired of work or whatever that's happening in your life, you may just want to sit down and read an interesting book to unwind a little. There are too many writers out there who just don't seem to be able to keep the attention span of their readers. So I thought, buy a Grisham book! That will keep me occupied for a few hours. Well, it didn't. I was bored. I was not interested in the character. The drama was not dramatic. Everything was just kind of BLAHHHHH. I was disappointed. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Street Lawyer made me THINK!","review":"I read the Street Lawyer by John Grisham the first week it was in the Book Stores. I loved it! I have read most of the John Grisham books, and one thing is constant - I never want the story to end. After I finished the Street Lawyer, I thought about it for days. This time like all of the others, it was difficult for me to finish this book and go on to read another author. In my opinion, The Street Lawyer was one of his best. It really made me think about my life and made me wonder, am I doing enough?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Grisham book I've read but certainly not the last","review":"First off, let me just say that I'm a horrible reader. It takes me days, weeks, months to read the first chapters of some books. But this guy Grisham, he's got something going. I read this book in one day. Repeat, one day. That is not a typo (though I'm prone to those as well). He writes very simply, this guy Grisham... there isn't much description to make my eyes heavy. This is odd for me. Normally I hate writing that's not descriptive. But who knows... this guy Grisham (I like the ring to that) is a damn good writer. I liked the left leanings of this book. I liked its angelic sort of message. I liked how I read it in one mere day. Very recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes it's very good, however isn't it obvious?","review":"I have to admit that once I started to read The Street Lawyer, I could not put it down. I was compelled to finish the book and so I did within couple of hours. However, I ve felt that John Grisham's books are rather too easy to read and none of the plots boast any surprises. The fantastical \\"happy\\" ending is just too obvious for us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book immensely.","review":"This book was easy reading.It gave me an idea of how Lawyers gather their information in preparation for presenting their case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movie","review":"Just another regular Grisham novel: easy to read, full of clichès (especially regarding lawyers) and perfectly suited to be taken to the big screen. If you want my advice, wait for the movie...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great author. Bad Book.","review":"Even though I am a great fan of John Grisham books, this is surely not his best work. An intensifying beginning, the most unreal ending. Among all of the books he has wrote, The Street Layer is bad. If anyone knows John Grisham, please tell him to write a real courtroom brawl. Not a stupid settlement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad attempt at social commentary","review":"In The Street Lawyer, Grisham attempts to point out how much we are wrapped up in our own lives to worry about our fellow man.A supposedly crazy homeless man takes some lawyers hostage, and then gets killed for his efforts. Michael Brock, one of the hostages, discovers a conspiracy, by his own law firm, that is responsible for the homeless man's actions as well as the death of a family forced to sleep in a car.This book is filled with help the Homeless propaganda (not that I dislike the homeless) and it ruins what could have been a great plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real","review":"This book is not so good as other Grishnam novels. It is too non - realistic: rich lawyer leaves his company to woork almost for free in the street? I dont think so. Main character is auwfull developed: from rich nobel guy to street lawyer in 20 pages?? Grishman wanted to present homeless topic on his way, and he got stucked betwenn two chairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star, but only because zero stars isnt an option","review":"There is no way that Street Lawyer is Grisham's best work. The Firm, The Partner, and The Runaway Jury all put this piece of rubbish to shame. The story is unbelieveable to the point that it made me nauseous. Also, there wasnt any real climax. I kept getting towards the last few pages, and wondering when something was going to happen. Nothing ever did. Unfulfilling, undramatic, unreadable. John Grisham is a great writer, but this one was not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Sermonizing - Go preach in the Pulpit!","review":"I was an avid Grishom fan. I read Runaway Jury and came away disgusted with the constant, heavy anti-smoking sermons. I got The Street Lawyer from the libary...more preaching, but now about how we should all reach out to help the homeless, with the implicit message that no one who earns a good salary would willingly part from any of it except for technical toys. Grishom has demoted himself from the role of a good storyteller to a bad evangelist in order to hammer his philosophies down the reader's throat. Even when you AGREE with his ideology, it wearies...This book was TEDIOUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"About two hundred pages too long","review":"This book had an amazing beginning but that was pretty much it. The rest of the book just drags on with Grisham's didactic language about how we should help the homeless. Pretty much the whole book could be summed up in one line Help the homeless. If I wanted a lecture about helping others I could just go to church."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a best seller?","review":"Reading this book has become a chore and it amazes me how many people have given it such good reviews. It's too bad that the only vehicle for expressing the plight of the homeless is through poorly written formula novels. From start to finish it has been boring, predictible and has only made me think less of Grisham. Having never read any of his other books I will say right now that I never will. It's a loss that the public buys into this kind of writing...the grown up version of Nancy Drew."},{"rating":"1","title":"For my first John Grisham book.... what a disappointment","review":"As an avid reader, I enjoy all types of books. This was the first book by John Grisham I have ever read. I was so disappointed that such a renowned author could have written such a terrible book. It will be very easy for me to never read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book lacked the usual plot readers are used to seeing.","review":"The book had an interesting premise, but, as I read on, I said so what. I could not develop sympathy for the lawyer, or the homeless. What was the point of the wife? I didn't believe that the premise of a stolen file could embarrass a major law firm to its knees, especially over the homeless. What was the point of the 3rd lawyer in the street clinic? How come at convienient points, the social worker for the law clinic simply came up with adresses, names, etc? He did not develop the story well. There was no suspense. I am glad I checked it out of the library"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old thing....","review":"I was very disappointed with John Grisham's latest effort. I am an attorney and a liberal democrat, but I am getting sick of the \\"disguntled young attorney\\" plot Mr. Grisham has been rehashing in all of his books lately, and I resent being lectured about how awful greedy lawyers are by a man who makes $60 million a year.I admire Mr. Grisham's efforts to use his popularity and immense readership as a forum for discussing the plights of the poor and homeless. Too bad the message he was trying to convey gets lost due to the book's overly preachy, \\"holier-than-thou\\" attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham continues downhill slide.","review":"In a continued attempt to preach from his now (once more) popular pulpit, Grisham has decided to, once again, preach how evil we, and especially all Republicans, are. Since \\"The Firm\\", Grisham's writing has slowly deteriorated because of his overuse of the now common theme of the disenfranchised fighting against, and beating, the establishment. It's worked when the establishment is someone we all hate (i.e. the Mob, the Tobacco industry, Insurance Firms), but in this book, he goes too far. The establishment is all of us who, according to Grisham, should feel guilty because we work hard. I had trouble finishing it, and the only reason I did, was because I hate not finishing books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BOOK THAT HAD A GREAT START, BUT JUST FAILED AT THE END","review":"I feel that I must reward this novel a two or three for the great begining it brought forth to the reader, but once the last one-hundred pages came, I felt very sorry for paying a mere $$30.00 for it. Myself, being, a young published writer, feels he may offer an open perspective to those in which wish to read this so: The book is worth buying if you want your mind to twist into a ball and fear of it making a recovery. Really, this book made me feel as if I were messed up. If you do want to read this, I would wait untill the mass-market edition came onto the market, so you feel you have not wasted merely $$30.00 of your money in which could have been spent else-where. Sorry John--take some time to bring it back up and don't rush to get your work out on the market, your fans will acknowledge you more if you would TRY this path. Best of luck towards the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has the Mystique gone?","review":"By nature I have always been a Grisham fan. I have read all the books the has written. THE STREET LAWYER Was actually the book that I felt the most disapointed with. It was shallow, slow, and predicable. I know I have a biased perception of the Grisham works because I love the way he writes, but thiws one made me feel Disapointed. PEOPLE BETTER READ THE RAINMAKER OR THE PARTNER BEFORE PICKING UP THIS \\"BRICK\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Preach It Johnny!","review":"Mr. Grisham has become a wealthy man. For some reason (perhaps an incident involving a homeless man in New York referenced in Newsweek) John feels guilty about the fruits of his talent. The liberal heart bleeds without clotting, \\"If we could all just give the homeless money, then they'd be fine.\\" If an author wants to preach to his readers, fine. But try to have a good story, building tension, and developed characters worth feeling for. This book was amazing, it had none of that. John needs to keep two quotes in mind when he feels his heart seep: \\"The poor will always be among us.\\" and \\"Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime.\\" Well, Mr. Grisham knows how to \\"fish\\" and he needs to fish another good thriller from his mind before he alienates his audience with whiney diatribes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Grisham alter ego battles evil","review":"Michael Brock, the Street Lawyer, changes his life to do battle with the evil law firm he resigned from, solving a \\"mystery\\" the reader sees coming a mile away. Grisham sets up a strawman to pontificate on society at large's indifference to the homeless, while praising the select few who care. The plot takes place in the District of Columbia, the farthest north Grisham has ventured yet; can New York be his next target for evil law firms?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Typical Grisham","review":"I have read a few of Grisham's works, if you can call them 'works', but this one is by far the worst. The entire story line is so unbelievable and the plot is very weak. I really reccomend this book to people looking for a good laugh rather than a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"His worst book. I am an extremely avid reader and belong to a book club. I actually skipped to the end. Not at all believable. He is actually going against himself in this book and attacking big law firms and making the homeless the heros...like they are the best people on earth. Get real! I won't buy another one of his books. A Time To Kill was the best...like so many authors he is just cranking them out. I could have written this book in a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"He just writes for getting his next check","review":"If you thought Mr. Grisham reached the top of boring books with \\"The Chamber\\" he definitely proved otherwise with his latest book \\"The Streetlawyer\\". If you are looking for something as exciting and breathtaking as \\"The Firm\\" or even \\"The Pelican Brief\\" or \\"The Client\\", you will be incredibly disappointed. I thought this book has no story, no thrill, no romance, no unexpected happenings, no sideplots, no nothing. Facit: BORING. I appreciate the fact that Mr. Grisham addresses also social issues like the homeless, however he does it in a rather \\"fairy-tale\\" style which is kind of out-of-place for his style ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still a Grisham fan, though!","review":"I read \\"The Firm\\" and found myself hooked on John Grishams lawyer world, filled with intrigues and complex plots. Although the setting almost always was the same i.e. \\"young ambitious, idealistic lawyer\\" vs. \\"big law firm and/or some other big cynical corporation\\", the plot and the captivating story telling always made me keep turning those pages. \\"The Street Lawyer\\" has the same (tired) setting but the plot is almost non-existant! Only the first couple of chapters carried some resemblance with Grishams previous work, the rest could, for all I know, have been written by somebody else. I really hope that \\"The Street Lawyer\\" is just the unfortunate result of a deadline with the publisher, and that Grishams next novel will make us forget and forgive this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, slow; politically charged","review":"Grisham's distinterest in writing suspense/thrillers is showing. This story is very predictable; characters are uninteresting. Yes, homelessness is a serious problem--a problem that we all are concerned about.The story would be more impactful if Grisham had stated that he was going to donate the proceeds from book sales to homeless shelters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fabulous John Grisham book...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, just as I have enjoyed all of John Grisham's previous titles. He is a wonderful author, and I will continue to read all of his works in the future. \\"Street Lawyer\\" had such an excellent plot, and I could picture all the characters in my mind as I read (especially Mordecai). I don't understand how some other people on this summary list have given this book such low reviews - I thought it was a great book because it deals with one of the least talked-about social problems in our country. So few people are willing to help the homeless; therefore, if this book \\"tugs at the heartstring\\" of more people to help the homeless, then Mr. Grisham has written a very worthwhile book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the movie...","review":"Grisham's first still stands as his best, even though I believe my love for that book stems from its similarity to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". With the exception of \\"The Partner\\" I find little of Grisham to recommend to others. His latest makes great vacation reading - where you might be looking for something \\"lite\\" to read. I'd wait for the movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring propaganda","review":"John Grisham took $27 dollars from me under false pretense. This book is nothing more than page after page of meaningless stastistics and propaganda. The characters are tissue paper thin and the plot development almost nonexistent. Also, if there are so many homeless in Washington D.C. how plausable is it that Grishman's main character stumbles across that one tragic family on his first night in a shelter? Save your time and money - give this one a pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too \\"preachy\\", and downright boring","review":"My wife and I listed to this (Unabridged cassette version) on a trip to take my son to college on the other side of the state. While the first half of the book was interesting, when we got home and tried to listen to it separately, I became bored and asked my wife if she wanted to listen to the rest of it. She had no interest. This is very unusual as she has previously loved everything that Grisham has written. I agree with several readers who stated that if Grisham is so concerned with his \\"street\\" buddies that he puts some of the millions where his mouth is. Don't waste your time on this one!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham has done better...","review":"There were only two things I liked about this book: 1. Michael Brock is one whom we can all admire; he is someone who is frustrated with his job as a lawyer, someone who has decided that more money at his firm, Drake and Sweeney, was not as important as helping other people (but is this really believable?) 2. Grisham's okay-but-not-so-good descriptions of the homeless. Why doesn't Grisham use his potential talent and turn it into something enjoyable, instead of a slow, difficult-to-finish, bad read? It's not that Grisham is a bad writer, but the same theme in a different setting, with different characters has become almost like Danielle Steele...THE STREET LAWYER was definitely a waste of my money and time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fine but not very gripping","review":"(Legal \\"thriller\\") A lawyer is taken hostage by a homeless guy and is inspired to start working with the homeless. He discovers dirt behind the hostage situation. Not the most thrilling thriller. Fine but pretty straightforward. Seems to be trying to teach people about homelessness.Potentially offensive material: Some language, some violence"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like John Grisham's books but this was really bad","review":"Okay, its been a while but all i know was that the begining wasn't so bad. He and some of his co-workers are kept hostage by some homeless guy and they're all scared about what this guy is about to do with that gun. Then when the Homeless person comes to open the door for the food, the police blows his brains out. Now that part was really exciting so I kept on reading hoping like that would show up again. But it didn't. The rest of the story is how he does pro bono work and goes after his old company and in the end wins by having his old law firm due pro bono work. All in all, a pretty dumb book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst Grisham book yet.","review":"This is by far the slowest, least interesting Grisham published to date. I kept waiting for it to get better, but that just never happened. He was obviously trying to just crank out another piece of work to satisfy a publishing contract. I was a huge Grisham fan in the beginning but am waning quickly. He needs to quit while he's still somewhat ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic!","review":"This is one of the most realistic stories that I have ever read. It has been a long time since I have read a story that could be this close to non-fiction. of course It's not, but every lawyer has a compasionate side, and this book clearly expresses the true possibility that this may happen in real life. This may not be as interesting as most grisham fans expect but my personal experiences with the homless, from seattle to DC, and the legal profession...This could be real!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for a Grisham novel.","review":"Overall, it is ok for a normal book, but is not something I expected from Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham-Page-turner","review":"Grisham is a master at writing books that you cannot put down. Nothing really happens, but still, he keeps you reading and reading! This bookis not as good as f.i \\"The Firm\\" or \\"The Client\\" wich is my favourite"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feel Good Read at Best","review":"Grisham's novel has an important theme but it is too slow to develop. It's starts off great, but as you progress thorough the book, the plot slows down. It seem like the first chapter was the climax of the novel. I wouldn't call it riveting or engrossing, but if your a lawyer with a guilty conscience or you are just wanting to be informed (a little) about the poor and how terribly wronged they are in society well this may be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Grisham books are not great books but good books that make a long trip seem shorter -- with the exception of The Street Lawyer. It's a simplistic book that, to a certain degree, insults the intelligence of the reader. Homelessness is not a simple issue and while the story premise is quite good, Grisham fails to deliver a credible story or give new insight to the problems of homelessness. Finally, you can predict ending just by reading the jacket cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen one, you've seen 'em all.","review":"I liked this book the first time I read it...When it was called _A Time to Kill_."},{"rating":"1","title":"old fan comes back but not for good","review":"I used to be a big Grisham fan in the early 90's.

I wonder how much of the profits from this book were given to the poor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham. He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph. Very preachy about the plight of the homeless. I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than a slight dissapointment","review":"I was disapointed in this book by John Grisham. The story was slightly predicitable, contrite and had an easily determined plot. It didn't seem to have the suspense that normally is such an integral part of John Grisham's novels. Hopefully his next attempt at socail conscience will be more enjoyable for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for one's conscience!","review":"I've read the other reviews and was pretty surprised. I consider myself a fairly discerning reader and grabbed this reluctantly out of desparation for a quick airplane read. But I really enjoyed it!

I also recommmended it to my husband and sister (a street lawyer.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second worst book I have ever read","review":"The beginning was great, but after that, I was terrible.

One of the reviewers said he read it on a two hour flight. Grisham probably spent less than two hours writing this book. Having read his past books, I kept waiting for characters, plot, and drama to materialize. They never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"I have read most of John Grishams books except the Testament. I felt the street lawyer was not at his regular pace of his previous books. The theme was quite good but there was nothing to look for, no suprises anywhere in the book. Once he mentioned the plot in the beginning, nothing new happened"},{"rating":"1","title":"We get the message already","review":"It started out to be an interesting story but he just kept hammering home the message about good and righteous homeless people vs evil corporations. It got old very quickly. If you don't like being preached to, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another tedious Grisham formula","review":"My favourite Grisham books are \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Chamber\\" and \\"The Rainmaker\\"--in other words, the first three I read. Even they weren't anything spectacular. After that, one Grisham book was almost exactly the same as the other. \\"The Street Lawyer\\" I didn't particularly enjoy at all, I mean it was a nice well-meaning idea and all that, but it was a BIG idea and frankly Grisham just doesn't have the skill to cut it. I think I can safely say I'll be avoiding any future Grishams--such as \\"The Testament\\"--without fear of missing anything.Anybody who gets anything other than boredom out of this book please contact me. I'd be interested to know what medication you're regularly prescribed."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOMELESS ACTIVISM","review":"John Grisham is in his element writing books about lawyers. He starts STREET LAWYER with a puzzling, violent scene that is deeply imprinted on the mind of the reader. This is the story of how one incident changed the perceptive core of one man who just happens to be an attorney. Michael is on the fast track, about to make partner in a prestigious firm when he witnesses a homeless man getting shot to death for want of a place to live. Michael investigates and is amazed by the sheer number of the homeless and by the means with which they survive. His conscience and a quest for justice lead him on a fantistic journey as he dedicates himself to helping the homeless and battling his firm at the same time. It's a good read, great beginning, but the ending ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Heart-Felt and Warm","review":"This book by Grisham is a wonderful book that makes you realize how blessed you really are. The hero of the story, Michael and Green, well there needs to be more of them in this cruel world. Totally entertaining with a realistic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"Please Mr. Grisham, get back on track and write more books like The Firm. I could not finish reading The Street Lawyer and for me thats bad. It gives a lot of details on homeless people and how they live, which the all of society needs to know, but the story is very boring and drags on.It has an interesting main man that goes nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointing","review":"This started off with a lot of potential but then it really faltered and got boring. Really all the whole thing is about is the main character going to homeless shelter and helping the homeless. This book was painfully slow. It did have a fairly good plot but the book didn't follow the plot enough. This is the reason I gave the book only 2 stars. So if you don't like long dragging books don't read The Street Lawyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, boring book","review":"poorly written, repetitive and long. Too bad - seemed to start out in an interesting way. You end up not caring about the homeless because of how preachy it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TYPICAL GRISHAM FORMULA","review":"With the interesting twist of championing the rights of the homeless, this is the standard Grisham novel. Young lawyer suddenly becomes disenchanted with the law and decides to trade in his riches and fame for moralistic reasons. I used to think Grisham was capable of much more than that. Maybe he should write a book about a talented author with a commercially successful formula who decides to write something original, and not cash in on a 'paint by numbers' writing formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me asking \\"is that all\\"","review":"Worst book He has written. Fast read. Maybe because it contains very little. No action and no suspense. If you are looking for something to do for a couple of hours, read this. Will take no longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham is getting back on track.","review":"I'd be lying if I didn't say I was hesitant to even pick this book up. I've been losing faith in John Grisham, since being disappointed by his last couple of books. When I read the synopsis of The Street Lawyer, I couldn't help thinking that this was going to be a slow-paced dissertation on homeless people and their problems. I was wrong! This book is about so much more. It's about standing up for what you believe in -- no matter what the costs. It will make you think about what is really important in life, other than money. The main character, Michael Brock, is faced with life altering decisions that most people would be hard pressed to even think about, let alone deal with. I thought Michael Brock's relationship with his wife was an especially nice touch to the story line. The characters are likeable and the narrative flows. There is even a little humor thrown in. I would recommend this book to any fan of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Street Lawyer Review","review":"I have just finished reading The Street Lawyer by John Grisham. It was a very interesting book that made me feel as if I was right there in the book. The Street Lawyer had a lot of suspense in the beginning yet the ending was weak. Also, the plot was a little skim. The Runaway Jury is another book by John Grisham that I have also recently read. I preferred it to The Street Lawyer. It had much more suspense & had a surprise ending that I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plup Fiction","review":"Another one in the Grisham burn and churn machine of legal thrillers. All of his stories are about the same so I will not add to the other reviews full of the story details. I just could not believe the main story line, and for me that spelled the death of the book. I kept saying to my self - \\"yea right\\". Overall, the author continues in his long chain of McBooks and gives us something that holds your interest over TV commercials, but really does not offer a sink your teeth into story. This book is a light, easy to read and complete legal novel that will be forgotten in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lawyer with a conscience?","review":"That is exactly what happens in this saga, yet another fantastic deliverance from bestseller John Grisham. This particular young lawyer, our protagonist, works for an extremely prestigious firm, living his life by hours billed, working nights, weekends, clawing desperately for an offer of partner in his firm and struggling mightily up that career ladder. Possessions, he dreams, a Lexus, a million dollar home, it will all make him happy - he is certain of it. But something rather tragic and magical happens one day that turns this money hungrey lawyer into someone who truly learns how to care. This one is yet another of Grisham's page turners. If you have enjoyed his other books, you'll put this one right next to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read several Grisham books and I think he is a wonderful writer. This one, however, went into the recycle bin after page 100. It seemed contrived and the political comments kept pulling me out of the story. It also made me wonder how, in view of his preaching, Mr. Grisham can justify owning two homes when there are people out there with none?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anticlimactic and predictable...don't waste your time","review":"I have read several Grisham books, and each one less exciting than the last. I loved The Partner, but this one is simply uneventful. I kept reading awaiting some sort of climax which never materialized. The book seemed like more of an avenue for Grisham to convey his newly found liberal views about how the whole world should pay more attention to and support the homeless. While that's all good in reality, it didn't serve to entertain readers looking forward to a Grisham thriller.If John wants to advocate social issues, he should do it at a venue where people are interested. Not in a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is laughable","review":"My wife and I laughed out loud listening to this book. When we weren't laughing, we were cringing at the preachy Kumbaya liberal politics of the author, who is now rich enough to afford the liberal policies he supports. Apparently, Grisham is salving his guilty conscience by having his alter-ego help fictional homeless people. If Grisham feels so strongly about the homeless, why doesn't he become a \\"Street Author\\" and donate his millions to charity? Oh I forgot -- liberals are only compassionate with other people's (tax) money. Two stars for the unintended humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Street Lawyer","review":"I loved this book! It was fast-paced and interesting--LOVE how John Grisham spins a tale. There are enough reviews on here, so I'm not going to go into minute detail about the plot, storyline, etc. I'll just say I thoroughly enjoyed this read like I enjoy most of Grisham's books. I believe a great book is one which \\"stays with you\\" and I can see myself remembering Mordicai Green (sp?) all the days of my life. Well worth every minute I spent enjoying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"as a Grisham fan I was disappointed in this book. I also recently read his newest Playing For Pizza and I found that 10 times more fulfilling.If you're a devot Grisham lover, this may be worth your time. But then again, you'd probably be better off reading pizza.Playing For Pizza: A Novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham fan is disappointed","review":"I have loved every one of Grisham's books and admire him as a person. However, I am afraid he has gotten too rich and now feels guilty. The \\"poor\\" people in our country are better off than 90% of the world population. Grisham needs to run for office (as a democrate, of course) and right every wrong. If he does hang onto your billfold. I sincerely hope he can get back on track and deliver as he has in the past. Or has he lost that fire in his gut?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A PBS Special Not a Novel!","review":"This novel could be a social primer for people planning to volunteer in aiding the homeless. A novel? As _Donnie Brasco_ said, \\"Forgetaboutit!\\" I kept waiting for something to happen. Could the villians perhaps be Bill and Hillary in another land deal called \\"squatgate\\" or perhaps a Bondesque type villian wanting to take over the world? \\"Forgetaboutit\\"! The firm \\"rolls\\" over faster than a dog with a itch. It's no wonder Grisham has said he won't sell the rights for a movie. This story is so lame they'd have to rewrite the book to make it even romotely interesting. Sorry, John, it's a real stinker but a great social lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope he is giving his $10 million advance to the poor.","review":"Since he lives in Virginia and is so close to D.C. I'm sure he is up there passing out money cause he sure forgot how to write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A documentary rather than a novel!","review":"This work would be perfect for a special on PBS on the plight of the homeless. But as a novel, as said in Donnie Brasco, \\"forgetaboutit\\"! I kept reading the book waiting for something really suspenseful to jump out at me. Maybe the real culprits were Bill and Hillary in another Whitewater deal! Maybe it would be a Bondesque type ruler trying to take over the world! No such luck. I don't believe I've read a Grisham novel before where the lawyers \\"roll over\\" more quickly. I can understand why Grisham has said he will not sell the novel for a movie. Since he doesn't want the screenplay writer to tinker with his plots, this one the screenplay writer would have to totally rework to make it exciting enough for a movie. Sorry, John, this one is a stinker. But, thanks for the social lesson on the homeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money unless you have nothing else to read.","review":"This book consists of about 100 pages of plot and about 250 pages describing the plight of the homeless. After a while, I tuned out the homeless preaching, but then realized that the plot was thin and uninteresting. In short, it was a major disappointment. It saddens me, too, because I thought that \\"The Partner\\" was a very entertaining read and that perhaps he was back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker!!","review":"I can't believe I wasted money on this book! This is, without a doubt, the worst book Grisham has written. No plot twists, no character development - I actually fell asleep reading the last few pages because it was SO predictable. As a Republican, I was quite offended by the continuing insinuations that we were responsible for the entire problem of homelessness! Does Mr. Grisham put his money where his mouth is? Let's see his tax return!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not John Grisham's best","review":"I don't expect John Grisham's books to be great literature, but I do expect better than this. The first chapter grabbed my attention, but as I kept reading, all I could think was, \\"Is this all there is to this plot\\"? The narrative has a very preachy tone. Yes, we all need to be more concerned about all people, but this book is like a hammer about homelessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think about the homeless without preaching","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book which is fast-paced and absorbing. It is easy reading and not multi-layered, but gets you to focus on the homeless problem and start considering how fortunate you are and how you yourself can begin to make a difference. We may not all quit our jobs to help the homeless, but someone reading this might consider helping out in a food bank, shelter or contributing in other ways. Not many novels can entertain while making you reconsider your own role in society, but that is just what happens here."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham's worst hitherto.","review":"Reading John Grisham's books is usually enjoyable. He explains again and again what sleazy low-lifes lawyers are. I like that. ;)Now, The Street Lawyer is unbelievably corny. A hard-working rookie lawyer with a great future has an encounter with a homeless psychopath and decides to go pro bono and work for the homeless. Cliche! This is NOT realistic.The book lacks any coherent or interesting plot. The criminals in this book are criminals on a really small scale.Then there's so much ado about some homeless mother that dies in her care because she was so cold and miserable etc. etc. (yawn!)Spare me, Crichton! The lonely housewives may love this, but it bores the rest of us. Go write a good thriller with lots of greasy, disgusting lawyers, dangerous criminals and some cool court action.That's what we want, isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've got (too much) Time to Kill -- Read this book","review":"Grisham has gotten into the Western Union business again -- he's delivering us a message. The book starts with a bang. A homeless man holds a group of rich white lawyers hostage for a few hours in the firm's plush DC offices. It's downhill from there as our protagonist gets the guilts, leaves the firm, chucks his marraige to an up-and-coming surgeon and starts helping the homeless. The characters are one-dimensional especially Mordecai Green the head of the law clinic. He's a walking cliche. In fact, almost all scenes set at the clinic lacked snap, crackle and pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elsie(elsieg@hotmail.com) from Panama, 07/19/98","review":"Reading this book let me see the writer on the other side, not the firm, the one that really need help and justice. Also, give us a detail how is people leaving on the streets and the reason why they are on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Library","review":"This is the first Grisham I've borrowed from the library and not purchased, and the second one I've hated ('The Chamber' being the other). If Grisham keeps it up he is going to lose a large part of his loyal following. I could care less about a person's politics as long as he write's a good story, but when he attempts to preach and convert he loses all appeal to me. Grisham's caveat in the afterword in which he states \\"before writing this book, I had not cared too much about the homeless...\\" is facile coming from a multimillionaire. The tone of the entire book was so condescending. If Grisham phones the next one in too , I'll be content to re-read 'The Firm' and 'The Pelican Brief' again instead of wasting a trip to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but it ended abruptly.","review":"Grisham's latest novel was a lot different from his others. He develops great characters, and really makes you care about them. But the novel lacks the final drama of other Grisham novels and it seemed to end in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on suspense and spark, I'm glad I borrowed it.","review":"Mr. Grisham seems to be falling into the \\"I'm rich now and feeling guilty, let me do something to make me feel better\\" path taken by many other celebrities. I want another Firm or Pelican Brief, which I consider his best books, not a commentary on our social problems. That's what the news media is for. The Street Lawyer lacked the sissle, suspense, and spark Mr. Grisham's earlier works had. John, please give us more work like the Firm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out on Grisham","review":"John... John find a new editor. Princeton does not have a Law School! I liked the attempt to get away from the lawyer trying to get rich image, the story was somewhat interesting, but this glairing mistake really bothered me. I have the feeling that Grisham has found a get rich formual of his own and keeps trying to find a slightly new twist to sucker the public into thinking its new. Nice try but this will only work with those who believe that Princeton does have a law school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I stopped reading John Grisham because I thought the books got formulaic, but I recently picked up The Street Lawyer and was pleasantly surprised. It was admittedly predictable, but I related to the main character and the plot is engaging. I also thought it portrayed big law firms accurately (although cynically :) ) This isn't classic literature, but it's a quick and interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typically presented, but enough with the preaching.","review":"Grisham reaffirms his ability to spin a good yarn here, but once again you are left to sift through his developing habit of proselytizing to find the story. I read this kind of book for escapist entertainment, and I don't need John Grisham to lecture me about the plight of the homeless any more than I needed him to lecture me on the horrors of the gas chamber.This guy was a lot more fun to read when he stuck to basic issues and didn't have a morality lesson interwoven into the narrative; if I wanted to read books that embraced a political agenda, I wouldn't be buying a Grisham novel in the first place. This author is much better when he just tells a story than he is when he uses the novel for political activism."},{"rating":"1","title":"So rich now he hs time to pontificate on such issues","review":"All I can say is one has to be rich enough to afford the time to sit back an come up with this plot line. Maybe Grisham should give away all the cash he makes off of this book to build some homeless shelters of his own. Hey John! Do not preach to me, just stick to writing legal thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book become a best seller?","review":"Who said liberals like this book? Ugh. If you want to read an affecting book about the poor and the dispossessed, try the \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" If you want to read a good crime novel, try Elmore Leonard, Kenneth Abel, or Janet Evanovich."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word -- BORING!","review":"Basically, Grisham had two ideas. One was to have a lawyer steal a file, and the other was to bring attention to the homeless. While one of the ideas is noble, he has done a poor job with the plot. It basically is a guy changing his lifestyle, talking to some homeless people and suing the latest big company, all the while trying to stay out of jail. The character cleverly avoids going to jail by going to work and bluffing the big company. Not much ever really happens in the book. I would definitely read some of his earlier works -- the earlier, the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"the amazing story","review":"I thought that this book was amazing. The story line was great. I couldn't put the book down. I wanted to keep reading and reading until I got it done. I recommend it for everybody"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book in no way resembles grisham's past work","review":"I consider myself a fan of John Grisham. I have read all of his other books, including the Testament, and I am ashamed of this book. The story is weak and unbelievable. The whole book seems to be a vessel for Grisham to clear his conscience in some liberal sense. The adventure, mystery, intrigue and imagery I have become accustomed to in Grisham's books is nowhere to be found. The whole book seems to be a Democratic Party fund raiser. It may explain things if a certain percentage of the proceeds from this book went to the Clinton Defense Fund, but that would be no excuse. This is a poorly written tale, obviously meant to give the reader a feeling of guilt, and I am sorry to say I spent the money to read it. Grisham should get back to being a storyteller and an author, leave the campaigning to the politicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"Compared with his other books, which I have all read, this one was a real letdown. I never got excited about it. In fact, the only new thing in this book was that it was written in the first person. Did John Grisham do this to give it a \\"new\\" twist? Other than that, it was just same old, same old. The idea that a lawyer would leave a high-paying job for a legal clinic is absurd. There are other ways, in which one can help more efficiently. I also found the part amusing, where Michael asks \\"what would you do if you had to work for $30,000?\\" and the other character replies \\"I'd kill myself\\" (or something in that meaning). There are plenty of people out there who work for less than $30K and I didn't like the insinuation. All in all, it left me with too much \\"time to kill\\" and I wish Grisham would \\"partner\\" up with his publisher to do a real quality novel next."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Grisham yet","review":"I have been reading Grisham since the beginning and genuinely like his books. The last couple of books before \\"The Partner\\" had been rather bland, but \\"The Partner\\" displayed a Grisham ready to be daring and different, and not play connect-the-dots with his plots. I feel cheated with \\"The Street Lawyer.\\" This one shows that - for all intents and purposes - he's forgotten how to let the characters be themselves. I was unconvinced in 90% of the scenes. Also, I think Grisham - like many of this country's highest paid celebrities (i.e., movie stars and recording artists) - is hypocritical in his constant slander of the rich. When he is one and shows no signs of intending to become otherwise. I admire his social consciousness; I despise his over-simplifying of the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has brought me back to Grisham","review":"After a disappointing experience with \\"The Chamber,\\" I have not gone back to another Grisham novel until now. I found this book to be suspenseful, interesting and entertaining. I was hooked after only reading the first few pages. Predictable? Perhaps. However, Grisham explores a subject that often goes ignored by our society and for that he is to be commended. I can't wait to read \\"The Testament!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer!","review":"Started of pretty interesting and went down hill from there after. The plot lacked punch and was far to predictable. Grisham spends the whole book trying to point out how white people should take the full blame for the homeless problem. This is the first book from him I have read, but due to his reputation I will give him another chance. Hopefully I will enjoy other Grisham works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham needs to find new formula","review":"I have been a fan of John Grisham's for years, but this book disappointed me. It seems that since he has moved from Oxford out to Charlottesville that he has gotten burned out writing. He seems too tired to develop. This plot follows just about every plot he has ever done: Young white male lawyer from the South, usually Memphis, gets himself into an impossible situation and struggles to find a way out. That was essentially true in all his books except for the Client when the protagonist only changed to a small boy. Come on John, I know you have it in you!!!!!!!!!Turn the page and give us something fresh for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Grocery List Is More Interesting Read","review":"I just can't believe that John Grisham is a major player in current fiction scene and is considered to be in the same league with Tom Clancy and Stephen King (though I don't like horror stories at all but at least SK knows how to form a sentence). I have read all JG's books and the only ones I enjoyed were \\"The Chamber \\" and \\"The Rainmaker\\". His worst book ever, to me, was \\"The Partner\\" and the \\"Street Lawyer\\" could be a hot contender for that position had it not been for the subject which I found thought provoking (that's why 2 stars). It seems that JG has run out of ideas (which were never abundant to him in the first place) but his books are at least serving one purpose i.e. we have one less lawyer to worry about.Sorry Mr. Grisham, but from now-onwards, you are on my \\"borrow only\\" authors list."},{"rating":"1","title":"john grisham at his best","review":"i have read almost all of john grishams books and this was by far the best i did like the others a great deal but they in no way compared to the street lawyer it was magnificently written and mesmerizing. i did not take my eyes of it until i got from the front cover to the back cover. it was the best book i have read in a while"},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst novel, although it did have some good parts in it.","review":"Well, I am a big fan of John Grisham, and I have read all of his novels. I enjoyed all of his previous novels, but the Street Lawyer was not as amusing. First of all, I would like to know what kind of lawyer would want to leave his high-paying job and work for homeless people instead. And I was annoyed by how Grisham kept on saying that it's not the homeless people's fault that they are homeless. But it is their fault! They are too lazy and depend on the gov't too much. But our gov't already spends too much money on these lazy people and wastes our tax dollars! I would recommend the Chamber instead. It is a much deeper book, and the bad person actually dies in the end. Sorry Mr. Grisham, but this book was too liberal for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad azz","review":"i have to start by saying that i totally agree with reviewer rebecca lyle, the 2 that gave this album such a low rating are not familiar with real hip hop. this album rocked, the beats were eerie and eclectic and most importantly original. i guarentee these beats aren't recycled or re-done. great production and hardcore battle rap lyrics. if thats not what you're into than don't bother listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting boring now...","review":"I used to, no i still do, love necro and non-phixion. but this is just rubbish. each track sounds the same as the last 100 or so that have been produced in the last 2 years. yes, i agree with a few others reviewing this, ill bill is awesome and he does sound good on this album. but he is drowned out by this mr. hyde fellow. maybe its beyond my comprehension, but i can't quite understand what this guys tallent is. is he actually a rapper or is he actually a joke on the tracks? either way, he is certainly not good and if he is a joke then its only funny the first time and just painful as it goes on. it was suggested to me that it has become to hardcore for my tender old ears, but im not sure. its become to soft and is no longer shocking enough, a poor album."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS THING SUCKS!!!","review":"NOBODY SHOULD BUY THIS DVD......EVER!!!!

It doesn't jerk around or switch scenes suddenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HD Fireplace!","review":"I always like to have a fireplace at Christmas but have never actually had a fireplace so I used to use my laptop and a fireplace screensaver that I would then plug into the TV so that it gave me a larger \\"fireplace\\" for Christmas morning. Well I ran across this and snatched it up and I am very happy with the HD quality and fireplace selections available. I might end up using this for more than just the one day a year as originally planned. My only complaint is the music. All of it is just cheesy. I have a media center PC so I put it in that to play on my 42\\" screen and then use my own music as a background and it works perfect. Kids loved it on Christmas morning and so did the Wife. For the price you can't beat it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video and sound quality","review":"This is just what I wanted - no cheesy music, just a simple, clean, recording of a fireplace.

Diana Rigg was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid British Mystery Fare","review":"The Mrs. Bradley series appears to be loosely based on the series written by Gladys Mitchell. Gladys Mitchell began writing the series in 1929 with Speedy Death and continued until shortly before her death in 1983. They are not easy to find in the US, but well worth the search.However, back to the DVD. Diana Rigg, who thrilled me in the Avengers in the 60's, continues to appeal in the first decade of a new millenium. While the black leather is now relegated to shoes and gloves, her smooth and sophisticated style adapts well to a 1929 setting. Neil Dudgeon, her chauffeur and crime solving sidekick, manages to inject just a frisson of possible romance (held back by class difference maybe?).Fun to watch and it's worth adding to your DVD library for future reruns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs. Bradly Reviews","review":"I enjoy this type of mystery.

The second was the parts where the main character spoke directly to the audience. I really thought the series could have done without the breaking of the fourth wall. It made it seem slightly cheesier, and really distracted from the otherwise very well-done mysteries.The main character (Adela Bradley) is utterly likable, as is her stalwart chauffeur. Together they form an unlikely, but very effective team. And the series really is all about they mysteries - there's not a lot of background or personal information needed to enjoy them. Everything you need to know is laid out for you in the series.Mystery fans tired of the increasing gore and adult situations in their mysteries will love this series - it hearkens back to an old-fashioned time of relatively clean and upstanding murder and mayhem..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs. Bradley Mysteries","review":"We enjoyed the series very much.

I first saw them on TV in my late teens and appreciate having them on DVD. This is a complete collection of the Mrs. Bradley Mysteries.Mrs. Bradley Mysteries are set in the 1920s. If one is looking for a Miss Marple or Inspector Morse mystery, shop around because these have their own flair. In the background behind the mysteries, they touch on period architecture, fashion, social culture, feminism in that time period, and the still huge difference between the classes and the genders.Definitely a \\"cozy\\" with its own style and atmosphere, each mystery wrapped up neatly in an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty cheap, does not hold my camera!","review":"I bought this elsewhere because it was on sale but like the previous reviewer said, unless you have a very light camera don't get this. And it has to be a very light very compact camera. Even then I seriously have reservations about whether you can angle the camera at any angle except horizontal. I wanted to use it with my high zoom canon sx30is point-and-shoot but the whole camera just droops down because the locking mechanism for the angle is too weak to handle it.

Unfortunately, he didn't put much effort into it. Kind of like the 2 prior albums. Cat Stevens sort of lost his way after Buddha & the Chocolate Box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drek","review":"A parcel of tuneless, dreary songs sinks this mediocre album. You know that Cat Stevens's muse has flown, when one song on the album is a throwaway instrumental. The cheesy horn and string arrangements merely serve to emphasize the hollowness of the music. Not quite muzak, but close. Head straight for Stevens's earlier, inspired work (\\"Mona Bone Jakon,\\" \\"Tea for Tillerman,\\" and \\"Teaser and the Firecat\\") and give this one a wide berth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book -- enticing as well as useful","review":"I came across this book at work and fell in love with it. It was the photography that first attracted my attention. I then tried out a couple of recipes and they worked beautifully.The book has a variety of hors d'oeuvres from all over the world -- anything from tapas to dim sum. I really enjoy the diversity of recipes featured in terms of taste and complexity of preparation.When I don't have to cook or entertain, I simply leave this book on my coffee table which I flip through from time to time to get inspired.I highly recommend this book.

The subject is very interesting, but I dislike intensely this mix of facts and fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant !","review":"This fictional work is as fine a book as any non fiction book covering the period leading up to Churchill's ascension to Prime Minister. The reader witnesses the chicanery and dangerous self serving and selfishness of Chamberlain and his cronies. It leaves the reader wondering what the world would look like today if the forces of appeasement had been victorious over Churchill. A great read that gives wonderful insight into the mess inherited by Churchill from Chamberlain and his ilk. The author has done a fine job in remaining historically accurate as he spins his enjoyable tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts Out Slowly","review":"Winston's War: A Novel of Conspiracy starts out very slowly sounding like a history textbook with reflections not only about the First World War and the Napoleonic War but the Romans, too! The author's bursting with facts because he's obviously an expert about history and politics, being an actual member of the British House of Lords. Reading chapter one makes you think that the writer must be a fascinating conversationalist, making wry reflections about all sorts of battles and conflicts in England's past. But the reader wants to start out a \\"novel of conspiracy\\" set in 1938 with a bang instead of a long flashback about the main character's past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the front page","review":"Winston's war has real history woven into a story about the Brits that lived and died during the events leading up to WW-2.

He does a good job, in this whole series, of bringing Churchill to life as a very real and human character. It is a novel and not historical text book but he really takes you into the time and place. I've enjoyed this whole series, would recommend them to anyone who is interested in this era but remind them that they are fiction, good fiction never the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend this one","review":"I have read and enjoyed two other books in the Churchill series by Mr. Dobbs, but I can not recommend this one. I stopped reading after roughly 300 pages. Mr. Churchill is barely present in the first half of the book which is taken up by minor characters and minor sub plots. Perhaps I missed out by not finishing the book but I could not see plodding through another 300 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on nuance short on story.","review":"I'm glad I got this book for free. I'd hate to think I wasted money on it.The writer spends and exorbitant amount of time describing the characters feelings and thoughts to the point that it is boring to the extreme. I didn't even make it to the end of the first section before deciding that life was too short to keep trying to read this book. Maybe if the author had Chamberlain and Churchill go after each other with broadswords and dueling pistols in the London Underground it would have at least have had a little action and been more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Beautiful Blondes","review":"I like this DVD because it shows just about everthing in details and plus I thought the camera shots of each girl was done very well.

It is filled with insights and details fromMadonna's life that the other books missed or simply left out because they onlywant to praise the Material Girl. The information from Madonna's family is worth the price of the book alone. Victor also draws amazing parallels betweenMadonna's life and Evita's, but she adds many more helpfulcomparisons and critiques that make this book the one to read. It's the best of both worlds--dishy and smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read!Barbara Victor seems to hate Madonna, she constantly insults her in this book.

I DO NOT recommend this book at all. The way the author jumps back and forth in time is slightly irritating and the emphasis on the comparison to Evita throughout the entire book is, in my opinion, exaggerated, annoying and at times a far reach. What most disgusted me though is how the her life up until stardom is written in much more detail than her life afterwards. Important events such as the birth of her children are hardly mentioned. Not to mention the book focuses on her \\"acting\\" career more than on her music. If you're looking for a good bio then keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant muck raking.","review":"I think it is absolutely pointless purchasing this book, I am not interested in knowing the ins and outs of someone's private life...would anybody want to inquire and go through a regular persons dirty laundry? no of course not..So why should anyone do it with Madonna? it seems like a futile attempt to muck rake if you ask me, same with other books like it. What's more, muck raking to make $$$$ from dragging Madonna's name through the mud. I bet this lady probably didn't even speak to anyone connected with Madonna but instead trawled through all the old tabloid papers relying on those soley to fill up her stupid book. She should find another way of making money, the woman is clearly clutching at straws and is desperate to make any buck through Madonna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recent Review...Still find it confusing.","review":"I saw the PBS Masterpiece Theatre version last year and thought it was AWFUL!!! I then bought the Americanized VHS version and still found it confusing as it was nothing different than whatPBS showed us. I thought PBS was just cutting it to death to provide for their time slot. Now I've read the reason why: The whole first episode was eliminated. No wonder I felt like I interrupted a group of people in the middle of a conversation and could not figure out the topic they were discussing. Anyone else feel that way? The same holds true for Thaw's \\"The Waiting Time.\\" There, in the middle of a spy vs spy thriller, you get whole scenes (minutes at a time) on screen in German or Russian and no translation as to what is going on between thecharacters. I wish Thaw would know about these bastardized productions people are putting out under his name. He would not be too happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"It is unlikely that the author of this script even knew a good Catholic, much less knew how to write a movie about a heroic, French priest. I've only watched half-way through the series (I can't muster the forebearance to watch any more), but I wholeheartedly disagree with the reviewers who say that the Nazis are not drawn with a heavy hand. They are all portrayed as evil and nasty without the slightest hint of complexity of character. The German military chaplain is given the greatest amount of sympathy, but it's only because he's a slobbering drunk who hates the Nazis for whom he has been drafted into service. Catholicism is about a whole lot more than social justice, but this movie producer has no grasp of what that is. If you want to watch a good film about holy, Catholic priests of World War II, I recommend the Assisi Underground and The Scarlet and the Black."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soma for the hard times ;-)","review":"Quite apart from the dire, apocalyptic tone of Brave New World, Mr. and Mrs. Crow live in an idyllic world on the Mojave Desert of Southern California.

When I was 8 or 9, a copy of the book was given to me by a close relative of Olivia's who still lived in Pearblossom. I will always thank Rose de Haulleville for giving me my first exposure to Huxley's writing.

So Mrs. Crow bands together with other animals and tortures the snake to death, using its corpse in a \\"funny\\" way at the end. Ha Ha. Complete with Barbara Cooney's graphic illustrations. Maybe this kind of heavy-handed stuff was \\"amusing\\" during the war, but it seems just grusome to the point of obscene today. This book scared the hell out of me as an 11 year old in 1973.

Of all people, I think James Belushi was the highlight of \\"Return To Me.\\" If you're looking for a romantic comedy in which the leads actually seem attracted to each other, try \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" with Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock.

For the others, I'd stick with the classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duchovny is the worst actor on the screen today...","review":"The movie was a fairly well made movie. The story was very creative and sweet. HOWEVER: I am now convinced that David Duchovny is the WORST actor on the screen today (Please understand that I am a HUGE fan of his X-Files work). He will never shake the \\"Agent Mulder\\" vibe (I now realize he is a one dimensional actor). The rest of the acting was very good, but is almost neutralized by Duchovny.

In this unfunny dud of a romantic comedy however there is nothing to keep the lovers apart, so they invent a totally silly hang-up for her and have him respond out of character when the 'big' secret of Minnie Driver is revealed.

Minnie Driver, in particular, as the virginal Grace (this is a very catholic movie) has never been better as the object of Duchovny's chaste affection. The main question of the movie is how Duchovny will react when he learns about Grace's history - and how that will affect their relationship. The film is also a paean to a particular milieu - working class ethnic America, particularly the Italian, Polish and Irish groups that intersect in Chicago - that is fast disappearing as a result of assimilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites","review":"This movie is truly great.

Duchovny is suprisingly convincing in this sentimental role. Driver also makes us understand her character's conflict, even though I couldn't relate to it. Jim Belushi, Carrol O'Connor and Wayans and a good supporting cast keep it rolling, with a lot of comic relief. Keep your eye out for the blind date scene.\\"Return to Me\\" would never win an Oscar, but it is a well done story that celebrates love.

A light romantic comedy with the always appealing Minnie Driver.But as DVD audio commentaries go, this is one of the worst commentaries I have listened to. For the first 15 minutes, the director and co-writer hardly say anything. And when they do speak, it's usually to make some sort of stupid joke (\\"That crowd is computer generated!\\").After awhile they warm up and start to actually provide interesting info about the making of the movie, but it's too little, too late.

The concept of the plot was interesting, but the writers didn't serve it justice. The so-called romantic portion of the movie didn't even take place until the last half hour of the film. The grandfather and his three cronies who spent their lives sitting around a table should have been cut from the film; that would have helped significantly.Grace was ridiculous keeping her heart transplant information from Bob. And in the scene when she slapped him in the face, any guy with any brains at all would have realized he was dealing with a dysfunction nutcase and would have exited stage left.Duchovny was better in The X Files, his acting was lame in this movie.However, the worst thing about the entire movie was Jim Belushi and his constant irritating yelling and acting like a complete moron."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Little Movie","review":"For me, this is nearly cinematic perfection. It's a \\"magical\\" love story set in my favorite city, Chicago. The leads, Duchovny and Driver, are excellent. However, the supporting cast is the key to the movie. Hunt and Belushi are great as a married couple with a bunch of kids. What makes the movie both humorous and tender are the \\"four old guys\\" - led by Carrol O'Conner and Robert Loggia. To be blunt - I want to be just like those \\"four old guys\\" in a decade of so. They obviously enjoyed each other, and making the movie. I have a very small collection of films. I only pick those that are enjoyable, with humor and a positive twist. When I am ill, or depressed, I pick out one from my collection for diversion and a little inspiration. This superb little movie fits the bill. I've watched it 6-8 times, and I still thoroughly enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"I loved this story.

Bob comes to terms with what's happened, follows Grace and HEA.I enjoyed the acting. Jim Belushi nailed the Irish-Catholic dad character.This is a well-written and well-produced romance. I loved Carroll O'Connor as the overprotective Grandfather. And his three friends, as additional family for Minnie Driver's Grace. It had a believable story, believable characters. I cried with Grace when she tells Bob about her heart transplant, and who's heart it was originally. I love how O'Conner's Marty tells Bob how maybe Elizabeth's heart was always meant to be with him.**Sigh** It's a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe i just love David Duchovny!","review":"I can watch this movie daily. Love the story, love the soundtrack, the way \\"Archie bunker\\" explains things makes me cry. \\"For a heart to be truly at home in Grace would take a very special heart and it was meant to be with him forever\\" gives me goose bumps every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly WONDERFUL","review":"Some movies can be purchased VHS or DVD without a whole lot of difference... this one is a DVD ALL THE WAY! I expected a good movie but found the surprise of a lifetime in this robust comedy with a sensitive, heartfelt storyline. THEN when you watch it again with the writers/producers comments... WELL, that's the icing on the cake! Bonnie Hunt, being a standup comedian anyhow, shares incredible details behind the movie and during the production in such a hilarious manner! Her explanations as to WHY they fought to spend time on certain scenes to develop the characters that would pay off ten-fold later on in the movie were priceless! Great sensitivity, compassion, humor, character, attention to detail, and more... One of the BEST movies I've seen in a long time. 5 stars is not high enough of a rating for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sensitive Side","review":"This is probably the most bizarre review I've written considering the reviews I tend to write. But, why not, right? I'm not too full of macheesmo to admit watching and liking a good ol' romance film from time to time. I usually drive my wife to the brink of madness by making her watch films like Death Wish 3 and Zombie Holocaust, but there are times when the soft side of me takes over and I surprise her by bringing home something like this. I was very happy with my selection this time. Return To Me doesn't have an awful lot new to offer in terms of a love story plot outside it's \\"twist\\", but it's well done. Practically every character is very likeable, it's romantic, it's interesting, and..........well, you just can't help but like it. So, if you're a guy and you have a night alone with your girlfriend, wife or mistress, forget your copy of Tango & Cash and give this a whirl. Neither of you will be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Charming","review":"If you liked Moonstruck, you'll be pleased with Return to Me. It has the same feel, with gentle humor, romance, and quirky characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"escapism at its best","review":"Here now my friends...Here there be a movie. Here's a flick to write home about. Here is a romance the way romance should be done. Never mind the weird uniting premise. Pay attention instead to the luminescence of Minnie Driver, David Duchovny, Carol O'Connor and the always masterful Robert Loggia. This is pure, wonderful escapism. It even ends in Italy. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie unviewable","review":"I choose Return to Me because I love the movie, and have always wanted a copy for myself. I ordered it hoping I would get a good quality movie. The quality is horrible and unviewable. This is the third time I've received orders of a VHS that was unviewable. The first was a VHS of \\"Rebecca\\" and it was broken and shattered when I received it. The second VHS was \\"Seven Brides for Seven brothers\\" it was unviewable. The last VHS was \\"Return to Me\\" and it's unviewable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"This is a wonderful story of loss and dealing with the grief of a lost loved one. Fun to watch and filled with great characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return To Me","review":"The movie was totally enjoyable. I wish that more movies like this were made. It was funny, sentimental and you could just relax and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun romantic comedy","review":"I really don't care for movies in this genre but I watched it because David Duchovny was in it. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.The story is not \\"saccharinely\\" sweet as so many of this type are. The humor is very real life and not contrived just to make the audience laugh because something funny happened but laugh because life is so like that.The characters are developed well, even the supporting cast. The film makes you care for each of them and feel as if you know them.Yes, the story line...man loses wife to tragedy, woman gets wife's heart as a transplant, man and woman meet and fall in love...is not very plausible, but most things out of Hollywood hardly are. At least this time it comes off as believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to a Good 'ol Fashion Love Story","review":"RETURN TO ME is a \\"not too over the top\\" romantic comedy with some pathos (Okay! It could be a tearjerker at times!) and a very likeable cast. Good to see Carroll O'Conner in one of his last film roles and a good supporting cast with Robert Loggia (INDEPENDENCE DAY, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS), Bonnie Hunt (who also directed), James Belushi, and David Alan Grier (tv's IN LIVING COLOR). David Duchovny and Minnie Driver pull off the lead roles in a story of a \\"will they or will they not get together\\" plot and have very good on screen chemistry. In fact the whole cast has pretty good chemistry. The Chicago setting and the Irish/Italian restaurant bar is very atmospheric. All around very entertaining film with a top notch cast and very good performances all around. Worth a second look because there are some pretty good plot intricacies, humor, characters to care about and a great soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not play.","review":"It is not for the US format, but for Europa or for the Mars.This is the first time that I encountered such an outlandish error with you.

It's one to watch again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this....(SPOILER ALERT)","review":"because of the cast perhaps. However, I found the premise to be far fetched and the conclusion too predictable. The story is tedious and frustrating because I could not appreciate the conflict. If the wife was an organ donor who died an accidental death and her heart had to be given to someone to save a life, then what is the problem? It may be kind of eery to know the person who has your deceased loved one's organ, but other than that I did not see an issue substantial enough to carry a movie for two hours (or what seemed like longer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was suprised","review":"As you have probably deduced I'm not a fan of this genere. But this film suprised me. It was sweet, but it never wandered into being syrupy. It's humor was just a little off and it had a real ring of truth in what it said and what it didn't say about humans and their relations (romantic and nonromantic) with one another. I liked it. As a husband and father of two I especially liked the married couple and their domestic life - on the mark and not too idealized. Cynics can scoff, but this is a nice little movie. Yes thats right - nice. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She'll love it...and so will he! :-)","review":"My wife and I just watched this movie for the second time last night - and we both loved it again!I like both romance films and action flicks (Go Seagal!), but I find that much of the romance films that Hollywood has produced in recent years are...less than stellar, let's say. And most of the leading ladies are quite dreary, IMHO. (Don't EVEN get me started on Meg Ryan! Does that woman ever play a different character, or do all the screenwriters just write \\"Meg Ryan acts like herself....again\\"?!?)Not this film. David and Minnie are wonderful as a couple falling in love. David's ache for his lost wife and new love are almost palpable. Minnie's extended family are HILARIOUS. And Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi absolutely steal many of the scenes that they are in!Kudos to Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake for writing such a wonderful movie. More! More!If you haven't seen this film, check it out. You'll laugh, you'll cry....and so will she."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to \\"rave\\" this disc-not happenin'","review":"Well, After reading a stellar review at a popular audio magazine's website I thought this would be amazing, but, honestly despite the excellent quality of the video and audio on the blue ray disc...and the talent of the singer (she's a great singer-seriously). This disc comes off as a caricature of a Japanese singer trying to do the great American Songbook, complete with mispronounced words (not a letter 'L' in her repitoire). I'm sure she can knock just about anything 'outta the park' in her native language...but not in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"An fine emotion driven, psychologically focused mystery.","review":"An Unsuitable Job For A Woman is a dark, subtly erotic duo of mysteries on three video tapes. The private detective, Cordelia Gray, attempts to solve murder cases through the use of typical clues and through the use of the emotional states of the other characters. Cordelia is an imperfect person with a traumatic past. This makes her a very interesting detective. This mystery is a thinking person's adventure. It is for those of you who do not want to have to check your brains in at the box office. I highly recommend AN UNSUITABLE JOB FOR A WOMAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the tapes were complete, the rating would be higher","review":"I've enjoyed most of PD James' books so I was pleased to buy the PBS video. However, I was very disappointed to watch these tapes. As the previous reviewer wrote, the tapes are incomplete. Do not buy this version. You will only be frustrated. Stick with the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these tapes - they are incomplete","review":"The box advertises this set as two tales - a three part and a two part. The total run time is 330 minutes and is comprised of two tapes. However, each tape is only 55 min long - so there should be six tapes. The first two tapes are parts I and II of the first tale, then tape III is part I of the second. Obviously something is missing. And yes, we fast forwarded to the end after committing two hours to watch 2 of 3 episodes and then not to be able to finish is disappointing as best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"This second series of C. Gray stories are worthless. They do not have any real suspense, character development, or plot. Even the sound and cinematography stink. What a let down! First set of C. Gray mysteries are absolutely wonderful however. See the review for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great research and explanations","review":"One in Thirteen is a great mix between solid (and often scary) statistics and the voices of troubled teens, who often give their own opinions on what could be done to help them. I highly recommend it for anyone trying to find some of the root causes of the third highest killer in the nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT BOOK BY TERRY PLUTO","review":"IF YOU ARE A TRIBE FAN THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. IT BREAKS DOWN ALL THE VERY BAD THINGS THAT HAPPENDED TO THE INDIANS SINCE THE TRADE OF COLAVITO BACK IN 1960. I KNOW ALL TEAMS HAVE BAD LUCK AND BAD SEASONS BUT THE INDIANS WENT OVER 40 YEARS UNTIL THEY MADE THE PLAYOFFS AND HAVE LAST WON THE WORLD SERIES IN 1948. MANY MANY PLAYERS, OWNERS AND MANAGERS ARE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS EXCELLENT BOOK. I HAVE READ JUST ABOUT ALL OF TERRY'S BOOKS AND I HAVE LIKED EVERYONE. HE IS ALSO A SPORTS WRITER FOR THE CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER AND HIS WRITING HAS WON SEVERAL AWARDS. THIS BOOK BROUGHT BACK SEVERAL MEMORIES OF PAIN AND FRUSTRATION FOR TRIBE FANS. SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS ARE THE MANNING ECKERSLEY LOVE TRIANGLE AND THE ALCOHOL ADDICTION OF SAM MCDOWELL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. TERRY PLUTO DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB AND I ALSO RECOMMEND THE SECOND BOOK ON THIS SUBJECT CALLED BREAKING THE CURSE. BOTH ARE WONDERFUL AND VERY WELL WRITTEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Indians fans should read this book!","review":"Cleveland Indians fans of today don't know how good they have it (or maybe they do, and that's why they're such big fans!) Regardless of how long you've been an Indian fan (25 years, myself) you'll love this book. It was the first time I'd ever heard of many of the stories in the book -- the section on Rick Manning and Dennis Eckersley was particularly eye-opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"the curse of rocky colavito","review":"This book brought back some fond and also bittersweet memories. It is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who suffered along with the author and anyone else who dared to root for this group of hapless,yet lovable \\"has beens\\" and \\"never weres\\".I thouroughly loved every page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual a smash hit.","review":"This is a great movie. As usual P. D. James' characters (all of them) are well crafted. The actors are well cast (as usual in almost anything from England). The story grabs you and holds you until the end. The people who make decisions for American TV should be required to do at least 10 years with the BBC learning the craft they haven't a clue about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taught Tether","review":"Nice idea in theory but the retractable wire is far too taught making it difficult to use in the field especially if game is nearby. Too pricey also. Not particularly pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirren commands the screen!","review":"Helen Mirren routinely devastates her audience with her amazing screen presence, glamour and talent. In this elaborate mystery she goes undercover and penetrates the world of international art thievery. Mirren more than once is filmed in reference to a renowned painting--something you would not expect on Masterpiece theatre but rather in an art film.The story is suspenseful and the twists are very well done. If I have any critique, I would suggest trimming about 20 minutes out and thereby not drawing out the suspense quite so far. This two part series is 208 minutes and would have had a little more edge if it had been slighly briefer. But this is just quibbling. This is a quality television movie and certainly worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mirren Vehicle","review":"I love Helen Mirren in almost anything, with the caveat that she wears me out. With the exception of \\"The Queen\\" she is so uptight in ALL roles that I must watch her in small doses. This is a good movie, the camera never leaves Mirren's face (shades of Prime Suspect), sets and scenes are lush, but Helen PLEASE, simmer down. I feel your pain, angst, anger, surprise, lust, but ask the cameraman to give other actors a chance to react with the camera on them. Other than my complaints, this is a good evening with Helen (and others)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painted Lady","review":"This was a movie that I couldn't wait to end. It was long and rather depressing and certainly not up to our expectations of a Helen Mirren movie. Prime Suspect series were great but this one can't even be in the same category of her talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mer De Noms","review":"This is simply an import, not any sort of real boxed set. It comes in different packaging, which makes it a boxed set. There are no additional tracks, just the CD that can be purchased here in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"(This only pertains to the album and not the box-set.)","review":"Mer de Noms is definately the best CD I've ever owned. It mixes metal, instrumentals, and lyrical genius, with an overall philosiphy of the world. I'm most impressed with the diversity in song topics: 'Judith' for example, is essentially a sarcastic mockery of Christianity; 'The Hollow' concerns the human libido; and my personal favorite, '3 Libras' is a lyrical mastery of being overlooked. The entire CD has ups, downs, and a completely different sound. Any fan of Alternative music, nonconformist, or otherwise freethinking invidual MUST HAVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion","review":"Desi has an extremely strong passion for teaching guitar. His videos are very easy to understand, but are excellent for the intermediate to advanced guitar player. He doesn't waste time with boring concepts and follows up consistently to make sure you understand what he is teaching. It is like having your own personal instructor. Especially in a very impersonal internet age, Desi reaches out and goes above and beyond. Check him out at http://Guitar-Music-Theory.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think twice...","review":"If your considering purchasing this set ..just do it, you won't regret it. I have only been playing eighteen months but by using this course I have already advanced past friends that have been playing for years. I couldn't afford private instruction, and instead of memorizing songs off you tube I wanted to learn the fundamentals that would allow me to play with other musicians. Its truly amazing, I can pick up the guitar and play to almost any song on the radio. Granted I have put in a lot of work practicing every day with out fail, but this course unlike others I purchased guided me in the correct direction. Thanks Desi, Cleve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desi Serna caged","review":"again, Desi simplifies a complex subject... even when going into deep detail he brings you along, tying everything together.I have fretboard logic, and other caged system courses, but this one \\"turned the light on\\" for meHe gives easy to follow instruction, with good advice...\\"play songs!\\"a great dvd, part of a great guitar learning course"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful video supplement","review":"I really liked the video supplement for the book. At first when I read the CAGED system from his book, I could not understand the concepts well. But, as I kept watching the video again and again, I realized the beauty of CAGED system and how useful it is when you practice it with the pentatonic scales/major scales. Desi Serna is an excellent teacher and I would love to subscribe and watch more videos and podcasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAGED sytem is A+","review":"I have purchased at least three books on the CAGED system. One was fairly good and the others were just plain frustrating. Desi teaches this sytem in a user friendly manner, but more impressively, explains why you're learning it, how it is implemented in the contemporary music you hear regularly, and for the first time, it now makes perfect sense to me. I am thrilled to see how easily this new knowledge has expanded my overall understanding of the logic of the fretboard. I've been playing a long time and Desi's lessons have generated a new enthusiasm in all things guitar. He's agreat teacher.I taught for 30 years and I know a good teacher when I see one. Thanks Desi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"This has made understanding the guitar much easier, especially for someone like me who has been playing for over 40 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, Poignant, and Downright Hilarious","review":"Let's Do is hands-down one of the best collections of short stories I've come across. The characters were described as people \\"we don't want to be\\" and yet, each of them evoked a measure of empathy as I read. The way they spoke and the things they thought were incredibly honest--a testimony to Meacham's talent. There is a frankness to her prose that is endearing. She isn't afraid to probe the raw spots of people's characters, however uncomfortable it may be. At the same time, the collection has its share of hilarious moments: thoughts and actions and mis-guided intentions that made me laugh out loud. This was a great holiday read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucky boots!","review":"would not buy these again. Very uncomfortable & they have a wierd fit... Really tight in some places, really large in others."},{"rating":"1","title":"too large and cheaply constructed","review":"You definitely get what you pay for here. This is much bigger than it needs to be for a standard sized badge. And it doesn't curve to follow the contour of your arm. Kind of annoying.

I would never buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Not the most action packed of the Nick Stone books, but I think it's the best. We finally get to see Nick Stone become human and have human reactions. In the other Nick Stone books, he is a bit of a super solider but in Last Light we get a glimpse of the real man. It's well written and the plot twists aren't predictable. I definitely enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Light","review":"This is the first Andy McNab book that I have read. I doubt I will read another. His writing is not very gripping and the ending is simply a set up for the next book. His repetitive use of some descriptive phrases actually detracted from his writing style. For example, I lost count of the number of times he used the phrase \\"threw it down my neck\\" to describe eating. The first time was clever. After ten or so, it became irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"These chinese are wacky!!!","review":"A fascinating look inside the chinese mindset. A must read for anyone who wants to know about the crazy history of the Red Guard, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.

Fan Shen tells a story that will stick with you as you purchase your next \\"made in China\\" item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Young Man Survives Dangerous China Cultural Revolution","review":"The 1966-76 Cultural Revolution is a blot on Chinese history, a time when youth ran amok humiliating or killing the remaining middle class businessmen, doctors, lowyers and academics. to grip the country in chaos and fear. As a Chinese emigre, I was initially reluctant to recall this disastrous period. But, as I read Dr. Shen's harrowing experiences, I was thrilled by the triumph of his spirit and intellect. His fast moving narrative shows us the inner dynamics of the painful emergence of the nation that will dominate Asia, and seriously effect us all. I highly recommend his book to every throughtful reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid Reader","review":"I enjoyed the personal account of the cultural revolution. The authors first hand description of the trials endured in his quest to freedom was very interesting. A well written book and an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Chande is a respected technical analyst, but his book is lacking. The trading concepts he brings out are interesting, but the systems themselves are weak. Someone might be able to take his concepts and improve upon them by writing better systems based on his ideas. For example the \\"channel-break pullback\\" pattern is a very valid concept. The code does not capture, in my opinion, a real life breakout and pullback. To place an arbitrary number of days to buy on a pullback, instead of using conditions to verify the completion of the pullback is like saying the market will always top or bottom after \\"n\\" number of days.I was very disappointed especially with the high price of the book. These systems will not improve your bottom line. Pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat, Thinking Man's Pop","review":"This is a band that went through a lot of line-up changes, but always put out playful, catchy songs that you find yourself humming along with. The writing team of Chris Difford and Glen Tilbrook was pure magic.This CD represents the cream from the first five years. Several of the songs have that vaguely Lennon-McCartney vocal quality, although Cool For Cats and my favorite, Tempted, feature other vocalists. The melodies are bouncy, (Pulling Mussels and Goodbye Girl), reminding me a little of the Beatles and somewhat of Marshall Crenshaw.If you've never heard Squeeze, you're in for a treat. One warning: this music is toe tapping, infectious good fun and definitely habit forming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squeeze is awesome","review":"This is a great hits collection by the band. \\"Black Coffee In Bed\\" and \\"Tempted\\" are hits that should have went higher on the charts but it's too late.

I recommend this to all hb fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent; the only book you need.","review":"I bought this book, along with every other PCAT book I could find. I studied and studied all of them up until test day. When I took the exam (10/99), the only book whose questions were similar to the actual test was this one. The other books are WAY too in-depth. Overkill might be a good thing on other exam preps, but here, over-studying could lead to burn-out, and failure to miss the big picture. Granted, I'm a graduate student in Pharmacology, but this book is the best prep I read. Pick up this book and the HighYield series in Biology and General Chemistry. Forget the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why This book..!!","review":"Was this book helpful to me..? Indeed it was in the fact that it gave me a great idea about what the real PCAT looks like. The reading and biology section were the most helpful and closest to the real thing. However, the chemistry was way off and was not even close. Some of the math problems were the same and the math section is a must for any one wanting to take the PCAT. A helpful book but do not but all your weight on this book and the Chemistry section is misleading big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if only option","review":"This book provided the minimal amount of information for the PCAT. In particular, the math review section and practice test sections had very simple math compared to the actual PCAT. Also, a few questions in the practice tests were repeated later in the same test. There is no all inclusive review either, only an outline of what is needed. I found this book helpful, but only to the point to get a general idea of the test layout, not of the actual test material. If there is another option, I would use it next time. If Kaplan makes a book, use theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Hardly anything that I studied in this book was even asked on the PCAT. The Biology in this book covered mostly General Bio, but the PCAT was mostly on Physiology. The math was a billion times harder on the PCAT. Beware...the PCAT has calculus and geometry problems that this book did not cover. The chemistry was also a lot more difficult and was more understanding than quantitative. I definitely do not recommend this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"from a recent PCAT test taker","review":"I studied this book backwards and forwards and found that the questions on here are way too easy. The real PCAT are much harder. Don't buy this book and expect to breeze through the PCAT because it is definitely not a good representation of the real exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I think the publishers of this \\"book\\" logged on and gave it a high rating.

If there is an \\"all of the above\\" or \\"none of the above\\" option listed on the multiple choice questions, chances are, that is the answer. The main theme of this books seems to be; when in doubt, choose answer \\"D.\\" I did find that some of the questions were poorly written, especially in the biology section. In terms of the other sections, they are written better. Choose this book if you need a quick refresher."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you wanna get a bad score","review":"I took the PCAT on 10/23/04 and this book completely screwed me over. Nothing in this book was even on the test. This book is wayy to easy. The PCAT was MUCH harder, comparable at a graduate level. You need to know, calculus, physiology, and organic chemistry, there's not enough time even to think because you need to answer 58 questions in 30 minutes. Use the Kaplan one. This one will give you a bad score GUARANTEED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book I wish I could return.","review":"This is a thin little book that did not help me with the PCAT. I scored in the 99th percentile overall only because my undergraduate education was comprehensive and rigorous. The topics outlined for the various PCAT sections are inaccurate at best. To prepare well, get a good undergraduate education, review old college texts and notes, and do as many practice questions from as many sources as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your expectations low.","review":"Seriously. Don't expect too much from this book or you will begreatly disappointed. As per other reviews, it's just good forpracticing more problems to prepare for the exam; that's why it deserves only 1 star -- it serves just that purpose but doesn't go beyond that. But keep on your toes -- I'ved noticed several errors in the answer sections. This should not be considered a review book be/c it does not contain any review of all the subjects you should know. It's just a slew of questions (not even definitively PCAT questions) and that's what I bought it for -- to adapt myself to a greater range of test questions.

I bought this book based on previous reviews, thinking that it should be good in prepareing me for the PCAT. Overall, the verbal, chem, and bio sections were pretty good. Reading and Quantitative were TERRIBLE. The questions on the actual test were significantly harder than ones here. The Reading questions on the actual tests were more \\"thinking\\" questions than matters of finding answers word for word in the beginning of every paragraph (as this book misleads you to think). I would recommend you using your old SAT books or MCAT books to study for this Reading section. Or just read a lot of good magazines, ie. New Yorker, Times...etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy..period!","review":"While studying for the PCAT I thought this book was a great review and possibly indicative of the type of questions on the test. After recently taking the test, I realize how wrong I was. The questions on the test were significantly tougher than the ones posed in this book. In fact I would say this book misleads you with regard to the types of questions asked. I wouldn't even recommend this book as a review guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me a ton","review":"One complaint, the verbal section is different on the real test. The analogies are the same, but the instead of antonyms, the actual test uses fill in the blank sentence completion. The other sections are pretty good though. Combined with one offical PCAT practice test I scored in the 93rd percentile (got my scores today)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty worthless","review":"I just took the pcat, and this book was not helpful. The biology questions didn't help at all, maybe on one or two questions. Trust me, all of the dopes saying that they got a 99 are either just lying or trying to sell books. Just read your Biology book and chemistry notes, and you will be way better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This book didn't help me much. It has a 3 tests for you to keep trying, but it doesn't have any lessons like Kaplan book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Way to Review","review":"I just took the October PCAT and I this was the only outside book I bought to study with. Between all the review questions and the 2 practice tests this was an excellent way for me to review concepts I had learned a couple years ago. The questions are pretty accurate with the real test, however the Reading section on the PCAT was more difficult. I would reccommend this book as a great study companion to all you old science books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard rewrote articles from the web","review":"I looked forward to this book, as I'm a huge fan of Woo's films. When I received my copy, and thumbed through it, I felt let down. Almost every quote Heard used (99% of them) were taken from articles I-- and diehard Woo fans-- have already seen on the web. Heard really didn't offer any new information whatsoever. He didn't even include any photos, and his \\"coverage\\" of Woo's life prior to 1986's A Better Tomorrow film is almost non-existent. Heard slapped together newspaper articles and called it a \\"book.\\" A better book on John Woo needs to be written, by a credible source who actually spoke with the individuals they write about."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Woo Biography","review":"This book, though very informative, is taken from so many other already available sources that it reads more like some student's book report. The most inaccurate passage being that Jeff in \\"The Killer\\" wears white gloves like Jeff in \\"Le Samourai\\". I own \\"The Killer\\" and do not remember seeing him wearing gloves. Also, Christopher Heard claims that some scenes from \\"The Killer\\" match \\"Le Samourai\\" shot for shot. That is completely untrue. Obviously Mr. Heard has not done his homework and thoroughly researched his subject matter. All in all, it is an interesting read if you are unfamiliar from where some of the material is plagerized."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD IS MASTERED FROM A VINYL RECORD!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!","review":"This rating is not in regards to the album itself, but the quality of it. Do not buy this CD or anything from Ptg Records PERIOD!!! All of their released CDs are mastered from vinyl records and not from the original master tapes. They fade the songs out early to hide the rumbling sound from the vinyl. The sound is inferior compared to if the real master tapes were used. I was fooled into buying Atlantic Starr's \\"Radiant\\", thinking it was the real CD, but was gravely mistaken. Wait until whomever has the rights to the real masters to reissue this great album. Ptg records needs to shut their operation down completely and bring this deception to an end!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What school?","review":"This dvd over-promises and under-delivers. For an entire 1 1/2 DVDs, all you get is a compilation of great shots at goal that repeat over and over again. If that is what you're after, then this will do. The 2nd half of the 2nd dvd gets into some drills that anyone can come up on their own. Nothing new, nothing different and a whole lot of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"This album isn't really that great. There are three versions of \\"Death of a Party\\", and the only one I really like is the Billy Whiskers version. All the rest drag on for far too long. The Moby remix of Beetlebum, John McIntyre's Theme From Retro, and the broadway On Your Own actually sound like different songs, and are well thought out. In the end, however, you're sitting around for an hour listening to some half-hearted remixes that drag on for far too long. The remixes of Bugman off of Coffee and TV were much better on the whole, all different styles and under six minutes apiece. On this album we get a 12 minute opus of all the many tracks in Essex Dogs played separately. Not too exciting, but interesting.The second disc is pretty great, Graham blisteringly leading them through some singles. Amazing, but only twenty minutes long. If only they cut out three of the remixes and added some more John Peel tracks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"I have a high opinion of the Friends of Ed series.

Clive Owen's character suffers from a vision impairment. So why, oh why, do we also get subjected to auditory hallucinations as well? Are the filmmakers just trying to use every trick in their bag to heighten suspense? This happened so frequently, I got a bit annoyed.2.) Why must every mystery end with the villain toying with the hero and explaining in full every last detail of any plot developments that are still murky? This was a tired ploy in every Scoobie Doo episode I ever watched, and I was saddened to see it employed here as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive Owen is Hot","review":"It's a predictable mystery but it's well packaged and, as I said, Clive Owen is hot! There's some intensely erotic moments in this series that make it worth watching even though the average mystery fan will have the plot all figured out way before the climax.Yes, I've admitted elsewhere that I am incredibly shallow at times, and this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Sight 1, Clive Owen 5","review":"There is something about this guy I cannot put my finger on. He is not as pretty as Ewan McGregor or Jude Law but definitely more versatile than both combined. From Croupier to I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, he looks different in each role. Some of his characters are more repulsive than attractive, but still he never lost my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting Mystery, Very Similiar to Prime Suspect","review":"I found \\"Second Sight\\" to be very interesting and enjoyable. For someone who misses the \\"Prime Suspect\\" series I found \\"Second Sight\\" to be an excellant substitute. I also found the two stars to be excellant actors and the mystery a true mystery. If you like \\"Prime Suspect\\" or just British mysteries period I would recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! I loved it.","review":"I highly recommend Second Sight and its sequel.I think I have a new favorite actor... Clive. I hope I can find him in other features. He was just superb.

The book begins with a History of Capitalism which is extremely interesting -- even to those who fell asleep in history class. The history of our country's economy puts investing into context. The book is conversational and easy to read. Very fluid. Buy one for every high school or college senior for graduation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners like me","review":"This book is apparently written for students, but the only way you feel that is the author's occasional attempt to be hip to what brand names his younger readers would recognize.It is a solid introduction to how companies and the stock market works, with lots of interesting tidbits from history.I wish he had written more about Index Funds, because further studies have shown me that many experts regard these as the closest thing to a safe bet you can make in stocks. But of course a book consisting of the one sentence \\"buy index funds\\" might not sell well. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic","review":"The book's cover reads \\"accessible to anyone who is high-school age or older.\\" Rather, this book should not be read by anyone who is high-school age or older. Its style is childish and it lacks a thorough treatment of investment principles. For example, they dodge any discussion of portfolio theory simply advocating 100% investment in stocks; \\"diversification\\" does not even appear in the index. The duo also neglects the failure of nearly all professional fund managers. Of course Lynch was a dramatic success but statistical analysis shows that skill is almost unseen among the pros. There are better sources for the basics. Look to William Bernstein, Ben Graham, Burton Malkiel, John Bogle, and their peers for a more rigorous investigation of investment strategy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of little value as an investment tutorial","review":"Of the book's 272 pages, only 20 pages in two appendices actually contain any useful information about stock picking and investment. The first approximately 200 pages are devoted to a variety of topics, none of which are of any particular relevance to someone who has already decided to begin investing in individual stocks. This book may be valuable to encourage your teenager to become involved in saving and investment, but if you're looking for investment instruction, this book will be of little (if any) help."},{"rating":"2","title":"An good book for young people like myself","review":"This book is easy to read,even for a reader who's mother tongue is not English like myself. Although it is not a in depth study of investment skill, it is worth to spend the time to read it because what this book told me is very important- save and invest as soon as possible and time is your friend if you want to retire young. But if you're looking for tips to get rich over night, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRIMER","review":"In my opinion this is the best of the 3 Peter Lynch books because it gives the most fundamental explanation; starts with a good history of free enterprise in the US, and some technical explanation, and recomends some information sources, while the other 2 books are a tale of his experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read for Junior High level kids","review":"The information in this book is way too basic and poorly organized. It could be a useful book for kids ages 12-16. Half the book is a summary of US history and the other half could be summarized on one page. Overall it was a poor investment of time and money. \\"One Up On Wallstreet\\" was in a whole different league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a little bit boring","review":"This was a nice book on investing. It is for real beginners. I'm not really sure an established investor would get anything much out of this book. But if you're a beginner it's a very good place to start. The information is easy to understand for the layman. It has a good into to the beginning stock market and economic history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for any beginning investor","review":"I really liked this book because it started where it should have--at the beginning. It takes the reader through a good , if somewhat lengthy, history of how capitalism began. It then takes the reader through Wall Street and gives them some basic advice on what to do with their money. This is a great book for high school kids who are starting their first job and need advice on how to manage it (I should know, since I fit that description). Anyone who is interested in investing or even making money should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but...","review":"I really enjoyed the historical review and even the partial diatribes on the importance of our business leaders and their importance to society. I read this book in one sitting and would buy it again but \\"Learn to Earn\\" seems misleading.I found little useful information for investing. I consider myself a novice at investing but this book offered nothing to really make me a better invester that I did not already know. One reviewer said that the useful investing information could be summed up in 3 or 4 pages. I agree if you want to reduce this book to a text book of investing but don't discard the other information presented. I found it very interesting at the least but more likely useful historical perspective that can affect the way I invest.If you want a more pure book on investing there are books like The Warren Buffet Way and even more text-book-like ones out there. This is a good soft core book of investing that is an enjoyable read. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the book - use the money to invest instead","review":"Unless you are in 5th grade, or don't know the first thing about investing, this book will be totally useless. Much better beginner information can be found for free online, or in such books as Tobias's \\"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need.\\" The useful information in this book could have been cut down to about 5 pages. Instead, Rothchild fills the book up with meaningless, albeit somewhat interesting, tidbits of economic trivia. It seems as though Lynch's only contribution to this book is his name and face on the cover. The man is a genius at investing, and an even better conman for getting me to waste $14, which I could have more wisely put in the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to understand, excellent for beginners","review":"This book is almost like a \\"history of US economics\\" but it is presented in an extremely light-hearted and easy to read manner. It traces the ups and downs of economic cycle and explain how the economy had evolved to its current state. The author presents many familiar successes(Coke,Nike, etc...), in many different and interesting perspectives. It sets you thinking that all these success stories did not happen too long ago and many are still happening.For beginners, it is important to understand and research the companies.

This is a film to watch again and again. My only criticisms are that Boldwood is simply too old and unattractive for us to fully believe in his appeal to young women, and that Nathaniel Parker is simply too handsome to be the homely, rejected but kindhearted Gabriel Oak of this very excellent novel.

This movie is not the case: you will only find poor acting, little nudity, one decent murder scene, poor effects, lousy art direction, poor screenplay and awful direction.

They blame it on 'communist aggression', but this was a civil revolution; these were people who had been denied their right of self-determination as peoples through democratic elections. If Salvadorans wanted communism, so be it: it's their right and duty as peoples to determine their own political, social, and economic future.

I bought the tape in 1984 and ever since have been a fan. In CDB's entire catalogue I have to say that The Getaway and Man on the Line are his two most rocking albums. They are concise, brief pop excursions. The Getaway is slightly better than Man on the Line though. The 12 tracks on The Getaway show how diverse CDB can be. From rockers to ballads, the storytelling is interesting, never dull. His later works are bogged down with trite adult contemporary pop and less adroite storytelling. The Getaway is a nice change of pace and doesn't sound like it was released in 1982. It still holds up after 18 years. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getaway","review":"I don't know why I could not get this C.D.in stores here in the U.S. I Think Chris DeBurg is a great artis."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Getaway","review":"\`The Getaway' is one of De Burghs eighties synthesizer heavy albums and one with many well known tracks on it. From the evocative story on the album opener \`Don't Pay The Ferryman', via \`Ship To Shore' and \`Borderline' this album leads you from ballads to rock until you reach the superb trilogy of \`The Revolution', \`Light A Fire' and \`Liberty', one of his better extended story trilogies and an atmospheric way to end an album.

When I contacted the company to see if these were sproutable, they assured me that these oats were completely untreated- of course they would sprout! Well, the company seems to be ignorant of the whole stabilized/unstabilized oat dilemma, even after I explained it to them. I bought 5# of these and, unfortunately, like so many other \\"raw\\" oat groats on the market, these will not sprout- they have been stabilized!So if you are looking for sproutability, and I would encourage you to do so since soaking/sprouting creates a dynamic boost in nutrients and flavor, in addition to neutralizing the anti-nutrients which are in *all* seeds, nuts and grains.

The manufacturers of wooden sudoku boards seem to provide too few little thinking number squares that go in the number places before a final number is determined for that square. This set provided 9 of each number from 1 through 9. Unless the player is gifted, as I am not, a set of 11 or 12 of each would be more helpful. The trays that hold the numbers in this set swing out when used. That is a nice feature, but means that the tray is not rectangular. That means that compulsive folk cannot arrange the larger square numbers in the angular tray to fill the space in a regular fashion. They fit, but not as neatly as an obsessive compulsive player might like. And who else plays this game?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and disappointing","review":"We love playing Sudoku and ordered this board to play together.

The night side has that early 80s New York nightlife to it with the streetlights and dampness from the rain. The day side reminds me of the Sunday morning after on a hot and muggy day. That Joe Jackson sure knows how to jam doesn't he. I love this jazzy style and lyrical content. You can tell that this is an early 80s album, but like Sade, it's not as loud and brash as a lot of the artists from the 80s. \\"Real Men\\" is a classic to me. To bad it wasn't a big hit.

It almost buzzed, the sound quality was horrible no matter what function it was on. The radio also got poor recption. In addtion the remote didn't allow menu changes and only worked short distances.

Even with all it's features and the low price, invest in something with better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reception is awful","review":"I did not purchase this from Amazon, but felt I needed to put my review out here since this is where I look at reviews for products. I purchased this item to use at work so I could listen to my IPod and/or radio. The CD player was just an added bonus. However once I plugged it up, it took me forever to get a radio station in clear. And since it is digital there is no way to tweak the radio station in like you can with a turn dial. There is also a constant faint static noise. Again, it is constant! Whether you're playing the radio or IPod, you could hear this noise in the background. Now if I turned the volume up the music would over power it. However, since I'm using this in my office, I don't want the volume that loud. I have since returned this product and am looking for a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Generation iPod Nano does not fit","review":"2nd generation iPod Nano does not fit with the adapter they give you.

The power button was inconsistant - sometimes needing to push it repeatedly to work. The remote seemed a little inconsistant on registering clicks. Within 2 weeks - all of the volume levels were loud & hissy/static and rendered the system unusable. The cd player was ok - the radio was always hissy a little. When outputting the tv signal - you had an odd system of steps to get it to work right (make sure the boombox is off, turn on ipod, select video, put ipod in boombox, turn on boombox, select ipod button on boombox, hit play on boombox.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"This boombox is really good for the money. I don't understand why it gets bad reviews. This boombox plays songs from the ipod, charges the ipod, has a radio, plays CD's, has a remote, and has input connections for other MP3 players. All this for under $100. An ipod charger alone can cost over $30.We got this boombox for our teenage daughter a couple months ago and she really likes it. It sounds good and everything works well. She no longer has to connect the ipod to a PC to charge it. Now she can listen to it while it charges. The radio reception is good and the CD works well.This probably deserves 5 stars because of how little it costs for the features you get. But I docked it one because it does not have as much bass as I expected seeing as it is advertised as 2.1, and it would be nice if it could play MP3's on CD's. It still sounds very good and clear and I'm very satisfied with our purchase.

Clearly the fault lies in the main composer as he is totally oblivious of the south Indian classical music structure. Indian classical music has certain norms and standards that are to be followed. When Srinivas restricts himself to a particular raga, Brooks with his so called infinite guitar touches \\"unmelodic scales\\" and finds himself aimlessly playing his instrument.

If you're into ambient, spacy, computer filled, production-heavy rambling, then I suppose this is the thing for you, but if you want TRUE karnatak music, this is NOT even close. Granted, I didn't expect pure karnatak music when I picked this disc up, but it is still weak. Michael Brook has the ability to find great artists, but he needs to stop collaborating with them. Pick up one of the above listed albums to hear the amazing mandolin wonder of India!

Nothing world shattering inside, but as it\`s assigned the status of most popular book in Japan, it\`s a must for anyone with the slightest interest in things Japanese. Although short, the characters are well-developed. The protagonist is neither hero, nor anti-hero, rather human, and very likeable because of this. Herein probably lies the key to its popularity. The only shame is the ending, which I liken to a 1980\`s Honda City. That was car that had a really abrupt rear hatch and looked as if the company had run out of money after designing a perfectly acceptable front and middle part. Same goes for this book. It just ends, and the final threads are tied in one-line sentences. Not the greatest analogy in the world, but it gives you the general idea. Botchan, the hatchback of the literary world.

But what won me over was the speical features and learning how they made the movie and the effort they put in. Jason Yee seemed like a really cool guy and very talented. With more production time and cheorgraphy, it could of been amazing. I give it 4/5, I would like to give it 5/5 based on work effort and budget alone, but I think 4/5 will reflect my full opinion more.Warning.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The original Slowdive rendition of \\"Dagger\\" was already quite melancholic, but on this CD, the song is turned into a funeral dirge which drags on for nearly six minutes.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Their Captain","review":"Probably more like a 2 1/2 if that was an option. I pretty much agree with the last reviewer, although I am into a lot of countryish stuff too (but not so much the way these guys do it though). The best moments are the instrumentals from the first record; they are definitely the most Beefheartish thing these guys have in them. The vocal stuff is on the order of The Band and Little Feat, only the songwriting is no where near as strong as those groups.The second album was even sort of overproduced. All in all this is pretty much a confused mishmosh of progressive musicians that are unsure of what they want to do and in desperate need of some guidance. Not much that is memorable here. If you're expecting Beefheart-esque art rock you'll be thoroughly disappointed. At least I didn't have to buy this to find out what it was like;a friend lent me his vinyl copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"MALLARD = THE \\"COUNTRY & WESTERN\\" MAGIC BAND","review":"Sorry to disagree with those reviewers who proceeded me, but I was partly guided by their reviews to buy this major disappointment. So much talent gone to waste. I am so surprised that these technically perfect musicians couldn't come up with anything better than these totally unimpressive, routine Country and Western sounding tunes.The Captain Beefheart \\"sound-alike\\" further detracts from the finished product in that his voice leaves you wanting for the genuine article. If you're going to start new band, find a vocalist that sounds new.From time to time there's something clever, but without someone who can really write music (like Captain Beefheart), even the most talented musicians sound ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a different climate","review":"The captain's vocals are amazing. There are some truly haunting cuts on this cd. The guitar work is as good as it gets. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The sum of the parts is much less than the whole","review":"This was an incredible disappointment after many years of searching for it. Whatever you may think of Beefheart and his often 4sshole behaviour, he did spur the Magic Band to heights they simply couldn't reach on their own. This CD is proof. Not that its necessarily bad, just not my cup of tea and very definitely not the Magic Band we love. Its mellow-to-the-point of dull country blues, Harry Manx is a comparison that springs to mind. If you want Magic Band chaos, try <a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BD9NUE/qid=1146727684\\">this </a> instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ten for the screen","review":"!0x10 this screen gets a 10 in my book!

Music marketing departments that would rather push poppy blather computer generated music(?) on the musically uninclined public-that is how. This is solid skiffle,traditional, bluegrass, folk music led by a great one of skiffle (Donegan) and one of the greatest musicians/songwriters (VAn the Man). You have to search for hours online to find and listen to sound snippets to unearth great treasures like this. Fans of Van, don't pass this up. Folkies, buy it.

No pretensions,no unnecessary sound effects - plain and very good music. The performers are absolutely professionals, who play with ease and no effort.

Overall though I think the quality of the pick isn't that great either so I will be looking for an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"these. are. horrible","review":"I don't even know what these other people got. They can't be talking about the picks I received. these are inconsistent, all heavy and the colors are from a 50's circus, but each is a different thickness, stiffness, and tonal character....they fit like low level torture devices, except for the one that just spins around and flies off every time you touch a string. The others nearly draw blood, leaves cut impression in your skin, the pick angle is just plain off, and the material sounds very marginal hitting strings. I can't say I like them as well as any other brand I've used; in fact much much worse. Get a dozen decent picks for the price of this garbage bag of 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"they got the moves they got the stuff","review":"Not very well known outside of California this hard rocking band is just that....hard rocking. Originating from Alemeda in the Bay Area where they became popular. Popular enough to open up for acts like AC|DC and others around the world, this band never got its true dues. The music they put out is great and I have all of they're cd's, they're that good. Y&T is shortened from what they began calling themselves which was (Yesterday and Today). Earthshaker is the first with the Y&T label. If you're looking to bolster your rock collection, check out this band. Earthshaker is a good start but they have other great releases such as Black Tiger ( which you might want to try out first ) Mean Streak, Down for the Count, In Rock we Trust and others. You might have heard on the radio the cut Summertime Girls which also aired on MTV. You may find some of they're cd's high in price, but you won't be disappointed with your purchase. As I said before, great Rock & Roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"rockin!!!","review":"this is a very good effort from y&t strong vocals, just good rock n roll dirty girl is the best song on there ,if you like in rock we trust you will like this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock 'n Roll Masterpiece","review":"Earthshaker is a perfect record. This remastered version has great sound quality and history from each band member on the recording, a very well done remaster. That early 80's- '80, 81, time period when not all the hard rock rules were written has a lot of great records and this ranks with any of 'em (Back in Black, High 'n Dry, Ace of Spades ect.). Rockin' songs all the way through. Great playing from the amazing Dave Meniketti and the now deceased incredible Phil Kennemore, \\"Squeeze\\" is his maniac moment and my favorite song by Y&T. This is a tight record with no bad songs on it. One of my favorites by any band and for me ranks with any bands best. Y&T Still Today Really Rock Live!

Interesting, heartbreaking, and well-researched","review":"I never really cared about the Kennedys before I read this book. I cried on certain stories, especially David Kennedy's. What makes the Kennedy \\"dramas\\" so heartbreaking is the fact they're real.A lot of Kennedys and their friends were interviewed for this book, so it's all the more interesting. Chris Lawford, Bobby Jr., David Kennedy, etc., and their old girlfriends and friends tell tales of misadventures and personal heartaches. Go buy it. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never encountered so many printing errors!","review":"This book is pretty boring in the scheme of things. Never giving up on a book before it's ending, I was managing to drag myself through it, despite the numerous printing errors, spelling mistakes and omitted words or pages only to get to the end and find it not complete! Very disappointing. I've never come across a book with so many errors! I have recently read quite a few books on the Kennedy's and in my opinion\\"The Kennedy's - America's Emerald Kings\\" by Thomas Maier is much better and a good in-depth read and without the mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishing number of typos and errors!","review":"The book is good, read what the others have said.

I have read a lot on individual Kennedys, and was looking for something to tie them all together. This book is very surface level, and practically ignores the women in the family. I know it is more interesting to cover the successful politicians (all male at the time of first publishing in 1984) and the drug abusers (apparently also all male, but still not sure), but a word or two about some of the other Kennedys would have been nice. For example, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who founded the special olympics, gets only passing mention. All in all an interesting read, but mostly because the family (faults and successes) is so compelling, not because of the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first book ... you should buy it!","review":"I wrote the book, so I can't really review it.

While it's impossible to write a book on this topic that won't feel somewhat outdated almost as soon as it's finished, I tried to balance timely, specific information with a historical and philosophical perspective on how digital technologies are shaping our world.Check it out ... pass it on to a friend or colleague who might be interested.

One of the only things about it that bugs me is that some of the weapons are different calibur, yet still do the *exact* same damage (like the .38 & .32, I think a few others). Also, as another reviewer pointed out, gun enthusiasts like myself may be disappointed with the generic descriptions. I was. However, these shortcomings in now way detract from the value of this book, I recommend that anyone gamemastering a Dark*Matter game pick up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lenthy descriptions that never get to the point!","review":"I liked the previous 2 books in the Sybex MCSE series (and passed the exams with them). But this one by Paul Robichaux is just rubbish! Note that the first 3 chapters do not cover ANY Microsoft exam objectives - while it could have been an admirable intention to cover the foundations before the \\"how-to's\\", here it was very poorly done. The author gets carried away with lenthy analogies (sports cars, sedans, etc..., to the point of naming several makes and models of different types of CARS - are we still learning about networking computers???) When it comes to configuring the finer details, the discussion often ends with \\"(do such and such)... unless circumstances dictate otherwise\\". What are the circumstances that may rise? Believe me, it was not clear at all in the context (and these situation-based decisions are what we really need to know to pass the exam). In short, I find this book confusing and seldom to-the-point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and incorrect writing","review":"I will be avoiding this author in the future (though other Sybex books have been very good) because 1.)He doesn't explain things very well in general and in particular doesn't cover what is on the MCSE tests (I just failed this one after passing the others using only the Sybex book) and 2.) The answers in the question and answer sections are wrong and in some instances the answers would be a copy/paste of the previous question. A terrible author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent throughout","review":"I read this book cover to cover and pass the exam. BUT not because of this terrible book. I had a TestOut CD-Rom...The wording of the author is strange and inconsistent. The CD-ROM were terrible horrendous.

This is most evident in her inappropriate pause of her speech. My advice to you the shopper DO NOT buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par, a real disappointment","review":"I would recommend this book, but only with grave reservations -- don't use it as your only study material. I have been using Sybex's excellent study guides for years (all the way through my NT MCSE certification and now on Windows 2000), and this 70-216 study guide is definitely inferior. The material presented is handled well, but numerous omissions make it unreliable. The chapter tests are particularly atrocious. Questions are badly worded; several tests contain duplicate questions; there are numerous questions on material that is not covered at all in the book (e.g., WINS proxy, DNS round robin, DHCP database migration). I've come to expect far better from Sybex; this has been a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst in a good series.","review":"This book is so poorly layed out that I had a hard time following it. The first half of the book seems to be an introduction to DHCP, DNS,and WINS. Basic fluff that a reader most likely knows. There is not even an exercise to fill the void.The second half of the book starts over with DHCP, DNS, and yes...WINS. You would think the exercises would be a relief, but they are very poorly written. The amount of useless detail and fluff, combined with the authors constant attempt at humor made the book very difficult to use.The pertinent material is so far off what the exam calls for, I find it difficult to tell my students what to look for.As an MCSE, MCDBA and MCT that has taken and passed this exam, I would not recomend this material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Used in conjunction with Exam Cram & Transcenders. Between those 3 sources I got enough ground covered to pass the exam.I think this would be an extremely difficult test to write a book for as it covers so much ground. I did find a few typos (in practice exam) and inconsistencies in the DNS chapter that were quite troubling though.I think the author did a good job taking an exceedingly dry topic and making it kind of fun to read. I have been happy with Sybex shtuff overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sybex dropped the ball","review":"Please don't think you can pass this exam with this book alone. I used Sybex for my CCNA and passed with a 967, but they dropped the ball on this one. I knew every word of this book, cover to cover, and was shocked by the exam. You need situational knowledge to pass this test and Sybex doesn't deliver. The book is oddly arranged, going over broad details of services in the 1st 4 chapters and then re-visiting each one of them in the later chapters. This book also fails to cover subjects like IIS and SMNP. Finally, the exam practice tests are horrible and nothing like the actual test, (this is what was mainly revised in the 2nd addition). It might be a good reference book, but certainly not what your looking for to pass the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient","review":"The introduction declares this book isn't for you if you just want to pass the exam. This book is for people wishing to acquire a solid foundation in Windows 2000 network infrastructure. I thought to myself, great, just what I'm looking for! Unfortunately, I found it failed on both accounts. This book is not on the technical level readers will need to have a comprehensive understanding of this material.

It was a great premise and the characters likable but I was distracted from the story line whenever the bible verses and the christian messages were inserted. There was no reason for it.

It is seriously depressing and makes being a sectarian seem like something dreadful...all your friends are dead, spouse dead, no one noticing you because your old. Combine this with the fact it takes five chapters before you get into the remotest sense of a story line I do not recommend this book.

The problem with the series is that there is too much Christian proselytizing. It interferes with the story and becomes overwhelming.

By the way, I am an old lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"The events in this story were fairly ridiculous. In addition, the book should have been listed as religious fiction. I have no problem with books that have strong, constant messages about God, but they are not what I would choose to read.

A hep old lady with spunk and sass, I thought I'd enjoy this read. Sadly, I did not. I waited (what seemed) a ridiculous amount of time for the real mystery to kick in. But, in the mean time, the author made sure I was thoroughly indoctrinated with Ivy's staunch Christian beliefs. Sloughing through the remainder of the book, I was saddened to find a watered down mystery that revolved around a sweet and fiery old lady. While I've always enjoyed a story with strong characterization, for me it was not enough to make me want to continue this series. However, the book is well-written, witty, and Ivy is often a hoot. While this may not have been my cup of tea, I encourage others to read for themselves - Ivy might be your particular favorite type of swingin' ol' lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, and more fun!

Many of the classic English cozy mystery have older females as the amateur detective: Miss Marple, Miss Silver, Mrs. Pollifax,and a half a dozen more.

But you absolutely must take it at face value for cheap entertainment. The numerous and sometimes forcibly placed religious references has been mentioned in some people's reviews, but no one has mentioned a complaint about the police force in this book.The entire 'plot' is based off the fact the police did ZERO comprehensive investigative work into this case and so it was left to the nosy old lady. Really? I can find at least 3 good spots where Ivy came up with evidence that really should've been looked in to, even if the detective in charge was rather dismissive. If they'd done any work whatsoever, this plot would've been nonexistent.I love free stuff, so this book got 2 stars, but I won't read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun mystery!","review":"Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series # 1)Lorena McCourtneyThis was a great find on Amazon.com.

I enjoyed the book and the main character reminded me of my 78 year old mother. The book addressed the struggles some elderly people have with a changing world and trying to fit in. The mystery was fun and kept me guessing. I will read the next one in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, light reading","review":"I'm not usually a fan of cozy mysteries, but downloaded this out of curiosity.

The price was right at $0."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL takes on a new meaning","review":"Ivy Malone describes herself as a LOL - little old lady. :0 She's quite cute and spunky kind of a busy body, but that's what makes the books so cute.

I will definitely be looking for more of this author and series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and kept me wanting to turn the pages","review":"I definitely enjoyed this mystery. I found myself staying up later than I should've, just so I could get to the next chapter of this bold little old lady's escapades. Humorous at times and downright dangerously stubborn at others, Ivy Malone is a lovable character with many unique facets to explore. Her thirst for solving crime is rivaled only by her steady faith in God, which is dabbled delicately throughout the story rather than hurdled at you in every chapter. Well done, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romping good mystery.","review":"Ivy Malone, a spunky, grey-haired widow, realizes the world is passing her by, leaving her unnoticed and invisible. She, however, has no intention of silently growing old and passing away.Deciding to put this newfound inconspicuousness to good use, she determines to snare some local vandals, who have been violating the cemetery. Little does she know that there are more forces at work than mere vandalism. Throw in the murder of a neighbor and soon danger is knocking at Ivy's door as well. Will Ivy's snooping land her in trouble too deep for her to handle? Or will the resourceful Ivy Malone be clever and \\"invisible\\" enough to not only save herself, but apprehend the bad guys, as well?There's nothing invisible about McCourtney's irresistible humor, clever story-crafting, or delightful characters. After having read Invisible, one can't help but hope that this new series will be a long one. A romping good mystery.Craig Hart - CraigHart.net/ChristianLit Magazine"},{"rating":"1","title":"genre / mystery or christian","review":"I have nothing against christian books but they should identify themselves as having a religous slant and not be sold as your regular mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past all the \\"Aren't-I-Fab-I'm-a-CHRISTIAN\\"","review":"Ivy is (or could be) a great character -- if a bit dim. (A big fat clue is dropped right on the floor in front of her at the beginning of the book that she doesn't see.) Of course, the sleuths can't be too swift or mystery books would end after 20 pages.Alas, this book did not end at 20 pages. I thought I could get past the preachiness but the woman does not let up. You know EVERY detail of her religious life before you know very much about her.I had to give up. (And yes, it's a BIG cheat that the description doesn't mention the most important thing about Ivy: she's more religious than anyone I've met in decades!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Of A Mystery - Very Predictable","review":"The only reason I gave it one star because there are no zero stars.While I do believe in God I do not want to read a mystery where the main character constantly is trying to take people to church and is always quoting bible verses. I found the plot very predictable, no mystery here and I too could not finish the book. I read the last couple of pages so I could confirm that I knew all along who the bad guys were. I made the mistake of buying the first 3 books (mostly due to the 4 star revues it got) of the series thinking it would be as good as Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum's series. There is no way I'll be reading any more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Ol' Lady Does Good","review":"This is a book I'd feel comfortable recommending to just about anyone. A simple, sequential plot that's easy to follow--but with lots of excitement along the way. A heroine with self-deprecating wit that is charming, Ivy Malone calls herself what she is, an LOL (a Little Old Lady). What she goes through shows an intuitive understanding of what that means, on the part of the author.This is an exciting page-turner, with a very realistic and thoroughly likeable central character. Mrs. Malone (a widow) is an evangelical Christian. But I was pleased to see that references to her faith seemed natural, not forced or intrusive. No simplistic answers to life's problems here. Read it, and I know you'll soon be hunting for more of Lorena McCourtney's many books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible: Delightful heroine and hometown adventure","review":"Ivy Malone is a delightful cross between Miss Marple and Mrs Pollafax.

I have already downloaded the rest of the books in the series and expect to be done with them in no time!!!

And, I appreciate the lack of graphic details, explicit sex, and foul language which is so common in many novels today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting mystery, but...","review":"The book started out well, and the mystery itself was good, but the book had way too many references to God, church, religion, etc. I didn't feel like a mystery novel was the place for this. In addition, the book ended so abruptly that I couldn't believe it was over. I looked on the subsequent pages to see if perhaps I missed something. It was obviously a ploy to get you to read the next book, which is not something I'm planning to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style...","review":"I bought this book whilst searching for mystery series with funny, sexy female lead characters, with love interests thrown in here and there. Unfortunately there aren't too many of them around that are well written. This book wasn't what I was looking for. The action was a bit boring (what action there was...) and the main character just didn't click with me. Perhaps it's because I'm a younger audience, and someone in the Heroine's position might be able to relate easier, as she is an elderly woman. I didn't read to the end of this book, only the first few chapters, hoping the action and storyline would pick up, but after a while I gave up. I'm sure it's a great read for some people (obviously, reading the other reviews), but just not my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just way too simple","review":"I read the other reviews & thought I would give this book a go, but wish I didn't. The story was way too basic and the plot very weak. I also have to say the religious side of this story is more than an aside to the plot, it is the most consistent topic throughout. Unless this is what you want in your reading entertainment there are much better offerings available. I finished the book, but would not bother with this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"Light cozy mystery featuring a senior lady with a definite sense of humor and faith.

Am looking forward to reading more of her books. She has the most delicious humor in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mildly amusing but way too lordy","review":"I downloaded this book because it was free and seemed interesting. It started out to be a light mystery with an appealing main character but it got itself all tangled up and messy in later chapters, as though the plot details had become a bit too much for the author.Also, I really didn't appreciate the heavy-handed religiousness of it all. It really seemed to me that the author wrote a nice enough book, but then decided to go back and slather the whole thing with gobs of god-sauce to appeal to a certain demographic.I don't particularly feel like rewarding that kind of disingenuousness in an author, so this is one of those mystery series whose further volumes will just remain a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theme didn't play out","review":"this would have been an ok book if the invisiblity thing had played out. But it didn't. So it was just a below average read."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For!","review":"I couldn't even manage to finish this lame book. Totally unbelievable plot and main character. Got really tired of having religion crammed down my throat. Not much else to say, but don't waste your time on this snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"From the reviews that I read and the publisher's blurb, I expected a quirky, amusing elderly lady who suddenly finds herself embroiled in a possibly paranormal-ish mytery. Just what I love. However, once I got into the book, I found an uncomfortable mixture of mystery, Christian morality tale, and paranormal. I have nothing against any of these three things, but the combination in this book just didn't work for me. I was actually bored (which is NOT normal for me in either a straight mystery or a paranormal mystery). The writing seemed sluggish and plodding, but I forced myself to read the entire book, hoping it would pique my interest. Alas, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, don't I feel bad about myself now...","review":"I enjoy mysteries, and pulled this one down to my kindle because I thought it was a great opportunity to read a new writer without a huge investment. I didn't get past the fourth chapter because I felt I was drowning in the Christianity-is-the-only-way message. If the characters were more realistic, I could have delt with a subtle Christan theme, but geeze, I'd have to be pretty self-righteous to feel good about myself after reading what I did of this book. So ultimately I couldn't take it seriously. No one is that good, which makes the characters were VERY two-dimensional. To the author: you don't have to hit people over the head with a bible to get their attention. You've hurt your message by being so heavy handed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"Very quirky character makes for a fun, light hearted mystery.

I bought this after reading other reviews and am glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery with a Sense of Humor","review":"LOVED this book and I am buying the next in the series. It is a light murder mystery, nothing lewd, no offensive language, or graphic descriptions of bodies. I liked the main character, Ivy Malone, and her wry sense of self and apprehension of becoming senile. Her offbeat neighbors are people we've all met in our neighborhood. I laughed out loud at some of the character descriptions and enjoyed the 'chase' to track down the guilty parties. I read some of the reviews that categorized this as a 'Christian' novel. This is not a 'preachy' story. Ivy does share her faith as she establishes new friends and she relies on the Lord when she gets in a tight spot. This is a book I know my own daughters would enjoy and also one I am going to buy for my mother and mother-in-law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got tired of it quickly","review":"I put this down after slugging through about a third of the book. Just wasn't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why gruesome violence?","review":"My wife and I were charmed at first with \\"invisible\\" and based on the excellent witty and compelling writing of Lorena McCourtney, I purchased all four books. I regret it. The second book had some graphic violence that made us uneasy but by the third book we were so repulsed, we had to drop the series. Did Lorena put that nauseating violence in there on her own--or did an editor advise her to make the murders more realistic? I don't know. But an alleged \\"Christian\\" writer should know better. I hope she made better decisions in her later writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible","review":"A bit slow to start but brilliant once it got going. Can't wait to start the follow up book now!

It was too dragged out and preachy. I just wanted to finish it as I do not like to leave a book unfinished. I agree with another reader be honest about the genre.

It was not bad at first as the references were just peppered in. But, then Ivy had her \\"sermons\\" in several places - that was too much. For me toward the end I found Ivy to be a judgmental person who I really did not like at all. About of the way through I put it down for a while as Ivy really was getting very annoying. And yes the book should be in the Christian section. She does not like dogs, she does not like genealogy, does not like quilting, etc... What does she like? Will not be getting any of the other books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Much Religion","review":"Well written and a good read BUT a hugely distracting amount of born-again Christian preaching.

The story was boring and predictable and many places just stupid. The main character was so busy praying she was missing the obvious. I didn't finish it; I didn't even bother to skip to the end to see who the killer was and why they did it. I just wished he turned his attention on the main character, I might have liked it more...not much more, but more.Cost nothing because it is worth nothing. Please Amazon label your books correctly so the reader has a choice in whether they want to have religion shoved upon them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't Expecting A Faith-Based Mystery, But","review":"I'm a Christian, but in general faith-based books are not what I seek out to read, and this book was no exception. However, I've been given (and have read) many faith-based books that I've thoroughly enjoyed. Like many others, I found the book to be a bit on the \\"preachy\\" side and it became pretty tiresome towards the end. On the other hand, it was balanced by what I found to be a well-written story with both a well developed plot and main character. I enjoyed 'Invisible', even if I did skim over the preaching the same I skim over steamy sex-scenes in romance novels. I have to admit, I'll probably be buying the second book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"I read the book and was put off by the ending and the endless prosyletizing. Even though the story had its moments, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - loved the descriptions and analogies the author used. As a senior citizen, I appreciate Ivy's sense of curiosity and adventure, but am a little skeptical about her physical prowess. She's definitely in better shape than I am! I thought the end wound down a little too quickly; I'd have liked more detail as in the earlier parts of the book. But perhaps the next one will pick up where this one leaves off - I'll definitely read it to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavily Christian, light mystery","review":"While the mystery was interesting, the frequent proselytizing was really jarring. The Christianity was loaded on and didn't seem to have much to do with the story. The secondary sub-plot could be figured out by the reader many chapters before the solution is laid out for Ivy. While it was a harmless book, I wouldn't bother downloading another one, even if it was free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible","review":"This book is filled with a lot of humor .

'Invisible' is light reading, but compelling - I had to know who was at the bottom of this crime. Ivy's Christianity colors everything about her life, and her curiosity pushes the story along.

It took way too long to get the facts on what was really to be the focus of the book..Solving a murder. Instead the author give us a run-around on Ivy's everyday life as a senior. In short, we have to sift through all the baking and running errands before we even get to the meat of the story. I also didn't appreciate how Ivy was overly judgmental, it was annoying. I also found it strange how the \\"Christianity\\" was inserted. I was random and didn't add to the story or tie in as an import lesson or emphasis on life. It was like a bad hair piece.The ending isn't very satisfying either, like you have to read on in another book to really solidify the answers. I hate this book and I forced myself to read to the very end. 2-stars because it is a mysteryEven though it's free...don't \\"purchase\\" it will be worth every cent you didn't pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible","review":"This straight mystery touches a core for all of us. Who hasn't at times felt invisible in their daily lives and as we age the risk of being overlooked is increased.

Ivy digs and winds her way into the past to uncover a back story that points to murder and a murderous family. Loved Ivy, liked the other characters and enjoyed the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I was surprised at how good this book was. This little old lady made me laugh out loud.

Romantic interests even hinge on one of the couple going to church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good mystery, but too much talk of God.","review":"I enjoy reading all types of mystery novels. I rate them based on how easily I can put it down and if I can tell how it will end. This one was very engaging and thrilling to the end. My problem came with the amount of time spent talking about \\"Jesus Christ our Savior\\", God and going to church. Don't get me wrong, I believe, but I do not care to have God pushed at me while I am reading a book for pleasure. And that is what I felt the author was doing.

The Ivy Malone Mysteries have a mature woman as the reluctant detective. If you liked Murder She Wrote on TV, you will love Ivy. Ivy is different from Jessica Fletcher in that she is an ordinary women of a certain age, and of an everyday background as the detective who solves a mystery she was not looking for but became involved in through no fault of her own. I enjoy the mix of humor, values, with romance also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible (Ivy Malone Mystery Series #1)","review":"I enjoyed the novel. There was a lot of background info about the characters and the story leads into the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Spare Me","review":"I love all types of reading material, including Christian-centered novels. However, I don't enjoy being beat over the head with a character's faith repeatedly without cause. It was jarring, did not further the plot, and seemed like self-serving piety (as in, Christians are inherently better than other people because they honor God and their faith so much). As the writing itself was only mediocre, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book. P.S. In the interest of full disclosure, I couldn't finish this book. I try to be tolerant and open-minded, but I have limits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminded me of the church I USED to attend","review":"I read this book all the way to the end, but that was because it was so ridiculous and badly written. It was like watching a train wreck. I am a Christian and downloaded this book (a freebie) knowing that it had a \\"Christian Theme\\". The author's notion of a \\"Christian\\" book seems to be one where the good guys go to church and the bad guys don't. I can assure you that there are many people who attend church (see title of this review) who are not close to being Christians. It's this sort of tone, in writing and real life, that gives Christians a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started well, ended...just meh.","review":"I really enjoyed the first 3 chapters of this book, and felt empathy with the sweet, \\"invisible\\" protagonist Ivy. However, the strong start quickly faded as the storyline seemed to overwhelm the author a bit. The story really began to wander, wavering between overwrought detail in some areas and the skimming only of the surface of others. I found myself feeling very little for the rest of the characters in the story and, by the end, nothing at all even for the main character herself who had become a bit of a cartoon. I didn't notice the religious references all that much in the beginning, but by the end various comments seemed to be thrown in just to hit a 'God comment quota' regardless if they moved the story forward or not and it became disjointed. I'm not sure if all of those loose storyline ends were meant to leave the door open for the sequel, but it really felt unfinished to me. With a really good editor and a rewrite, this could be a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must love the bible to like this book","review":"You might like this book if you are a retired, church-going female of a certain age, otherwise, just skip it.

But, after establishing that the heroine is a Christian, the references to God and church have no bearing to the story at all. The story line is good and the character is entertaining but the constant religious references are distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Mystery","review":"It was a bit difficult to get into this book but I'm glad I hung in there. I enjoyed the story and I felt the religious ora throughout the book added to the story line. Just as I enjoy books with all religions, this did not offend me in the least. I felt it gave Ivy another facet in her life and made her like so many Christians who live what they teach. By the end of the book, I felt I knew her well. I also think there are lots of people out there who do feel invisible. That part of this entertaining mystery will stay with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort \\"Food\\"","review":"Sometimes there is nothing more satisfying than a nice \\"snack\\" book. A book that doesn't strain for a deep meaning but offers pleasant company. Ms. McCourtney's Invisible does just that. Ivy Malone is one terrific, self-effacing, gutsy and funny LOL. Some may find the (okay, deeper meaning) Christian subtext disconcerting, but it fits Mrs. Malone and creates as full a character as any of the hardboiled PI's we detective afficiando's love so well. Invisible is a great way to fill a day (or two if you can put it down that long). Mrs. Malone is someone you will want to get to know as well as Kinsey or V.I. Who knows, maybe you'll even find a deeper meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible","review":"I downloaded the book because it was free but once I got started I could not put it down. I have followed the series and finished all of them to my great delight. The characters are rich and fun and very down to earth. This series got me started looking for more books with faith based characters rich in their senses of humor and resolve, not religious mind you but ones where the charcters had moral fiber and although did not always have answers knew where to turn for them. Thank you Lorena McCourtney for starting me off on my new direction in reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"This book was really good. I didn't have high expectations but it was a good read. Made me think how we treat older folks. I bet they do feel invisible most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun, very enjoyable!","review":"I chose this because it was being offered free through Kindle, and figured I'd take a chance. I was not disappointed! In fact, I loved it so much that I bought the rest of the series! Ivy Malone is a extremely fun, quirky, clever, and loving character! McCourtney's book is well-written, fast paced yet somewhat believable, and enjoyable throughout. I highly recommend these books, as they not only provide clever mystery, relatable characters, and exciting thrills but they do so with a faithfulness and Godly reverence that is comforting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripping Good Read","review":"This is not your usual detective novel. I love that Ivy thought that as she grew older, she grew more invisible. Ivy has simple faith and she IS curious. I found myself reading more and more. Some previous reviewers didn't like the religious content, but I found it to integral to the character and didn't find that it was too \\"preachy\\". I enjoyed reading it on my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"At times it was a little predictable, but overall entertaining. I liked the fact that the narrator is a spunky and humorous elderly woman playing detective, something you don't see very often. I thought it was interesting to see a story from the eyes of a person so much older than myself. To be completely truthful, I think this is the first time I read a book where the narrator is in her 60's.And yes, there are plenty of Christianity and God references throughout the book, but that didn't bother me at all. I'm not an atheist, but I'm far from being a devout believer. It could also be expected, after all, the narrator is an elderly woman in the Midwest.Also, I got it for free for the Kindle ;)."},{"rating":"2","title":"invisible","review":"A cute series that is light but entertaining.

Basically the idea is that in our society older people are basically invisible, overlooked and nondescript. Since no one pays them any attention, the elderly Ivy Malone decides to take advantage of that and become a detective to solve the mysterious disappearance of a friend. In reality Ivy actually does have a ton of spunk, a social life, and even a love interest - as we find out in the book. Although this isn't my style of mystery story (I basically pick it up at random when I had nothing to read), I found the book well written and a fun light mystery. The price was zero when I got it but I would have been happy even if it was a buck or two. It is a good story, just not my style - I would say to give it a try and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"Well I tried but I couldn't get past page 53.

I enjoyed all of this book and looked forward to my reading time like I haven't looked forward to reading for a long time. The religious aspect of it was also refreshing. I would 10000 times rather read that than vulgar language and too graphic sex scenes. Most people can figure out what happens behind the bedroom door. With this book it wasn't even necessary to do that. I enjoyed the characters and especially Ivy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A passable mystery with more Jesus than substance","review":"This was a cute, easy to read mystery. Nothing challenging, but I didn't expect that considering it was a freebee. Unfortunately it was ruined by not only the amount of religion in it, but the fact that the heavy handed proselytizing had nothing to do with the plot line what so ever. A little over half way through it got tough to put up with and I only finished because I'd already invested my time in the beginning. Won't be reading this author again.Very disappointed and I feel like the author deliberately misleads the reader in the books description. Wish Amazon had a requirement to disclose this type of religious tract hidden in a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Christian Old Lady","review":"The mystery was alright, a bit boring though and was probably only 30-35% of the book.The rest was about being christian, being an old lady..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivy hooked me!","review":"The first chapter was a bit slow, and I didn't think I'd finish it. But a friend had read further along, and encourage me to continue. One more chapter later, and I was hooked.I enjoy this spunky, God-fearing woman, and her decisiveness when she's in between the \\"rock and a hard place\\" (and she finds herself there quite regularly!) I enjoyed the religious aspects of the book and her self-deprecating humor, as she stumbles across clues and suspects. I'll make Lorena McCourtney a regular on my kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Addictive!","review":"Like others, I thought I would read a few chapters and eventually finish the book whenever boredom crept in. I was shocked and pleased to discover that I couldn't stop reading. I was glued to the pages and ended up reading the entire book in one day.Ivy is such a likeable character. Her story took me on an emmotional rollercoaster. I cried even when she said she'd be okay. I feared that she'd be injured, I felt her sorrow when she felt invisible and I supported her during her adventures.Overall, great book. Some situations, relationships, etc were predictable but the author does such a great job giving the characters dimension that I didn't mind. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivy Is Enjoyable","review":"For an old gal, Ivy sure gets around well. This funny mystery was a wonderful read.

It was a nice escape from the daily grindstone. The author brings up a cute twist in pointing out that our society does not see older people, but the main character uses that to her advantage. Some of the dialogue was a bit forced and stilted. There are portions of the book where Ivy is inviting others to come to church and it was a bit contrived. For me, that didn't really detract from the plot or characters though. Overall, I like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really really good","review":"downloaded this because it was free. I liked it so much I bought the other books in the series. Ivy Malone is a likeable character that keeps finding herself in a situation with a murder that needs to be solved. She doesn't just sit back and let others handle it she keeps getting involved. Very funny stories. I would highly recommend them. I wish she would write some more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I would recommend this if your looking for a quick read. It was an enjoyable book, I'll try the next one in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Cozy Mystery","review":"I prefer to read mysteries with younger heroines, BUT I really enjoyed Ivy Malone. This is not a serious mystery, it's more of a light, fun, who-done-it with a lot of humor thrown in. Ivy is like a combination of Jessica Fletcher and Stephanie Plum. There are some suspenseful scenes that offset the humor and make for a great read. As others have mentioned, the story has an underlying Christian theme. I did not find this distracting at all. I would expect a character like Ivy to attend Sunday school and to think and act exactly as she does. I don't think I would pay $10 for the next book, but if it happened to be priced around $6 or so, I would buy it for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked this","review":"a good christian story. we need more clean honest mysteries. the author is aware of the local area and i like the settings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story!","review":"I am presently enjoying the book but have not yet finished it.

Now that I'm less young and less arrogant, I'm not so disposed to do that. Plus since I have a Kindle, I can't really toss the thing out the window. Deleting the book has no drama, but there it is.A lot of people have bemoaned the positive religious flavor of this book, but that doesn't bother me so much. My problem was the tedious writing style. It could be that it was an accurate voice for the protagonist. Since I've never had it in for Miss Marple, I threw my finger on the delete key.

At first I thought it was going to be slow and a bit boring, but the storyline did pick up, the humor made me laugh out loud and I read several paragraphs to my husband to share the parts that made me laugh. At the time, I was looking for something light and humorous, so it fit the bill. I work with elderly people, so I kind of understand some of the LOL things Ivy encountered, like being \\"invisible\\". I enjoyed the fact that she decided to see this as a benefit, rather than moping about it. The Christianity part might have been handled differently; it wasn't so bad that you couldn't see it and move on. I've read a lot worse!

She's a true Christian and although at times I felt the story didn't need quite so much piety, the mystery is so good you have to keep reading and Ivy is such a feisty lady you can overlook her sudden lapses into prayer on a regular basis. I couldn't put this book down once I started it and I can't wait to read the next book in the series as the last page leaves you hanging. Anyone who likes a good murder mystery with a lot of action will enjoy this book; and I'm sure Ivy Malone will gain a lot of new fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL - Little Old Lady","review":"You just might find yourself laughing out loud at \\"Invisible\\" Ivy's antics as she finds herself in embarrassing situations.

There are many Christian references that get in the way of a good story, bringing down the reading enjoyment.

I will not be reading any sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable Read!","review":"Received a free ebook edition on my kindle. I wasn't really expecting much with this story, but I was pleasantly surprised. The main character, Ivy Malone, is a spunky sleuth. Age wasn't going to bring her down. She reminded me a lot of my own grandmother.The book was funny and very entertaining. There are many religious references in this book which I found strange because it didn't say anything in the product description, but it really wasn't enough to make me put the book down. I will definitely buy the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery w/fun main character","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book - predominantly because the main character is so endearing. She really hit the mark for me as someone who was elderly, but active. And I've seen first-hand how \\"Little Old Ladies\\" can end up invisible to the world around them. I like Ivy's response to that dilemma.There is definitely a lot of \\"if only everyone went to church\\" verbage tossed in, but I accepted it the same way I would accept it from a 70-year old kindly neighbor. She was raised in a different era, and her attitude feels consistent. Characters in the book reacted the same way. Some were open to her message while some tolerated it because Ivy is a nice old lady. I do hope it doesn't become more of a focus in the sequels, though, because the writer ought to be able to demonstrate Christian values through Ivy without proselitizing.Anne"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, god-bothering rubbish","review":"Barely managed to make it past the first chapter.

While the author had some interesting turns of phrase that I appreciated greatly, I felt that the \\"mystery\\" was plodding, with too many sections that had an irrelevant religious message that did not move the story forward in the least. The character development felt contrived, having information, and I kept thinking, \\"so what?\\" I bought this book on Kindle to take on vacation, primarily because it was very inexpensive, but wished I'd saved my money for a mystery with more \\"mystery\\" and less \\"religion.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start of a great series","review":"If you like the humor of Janet Evanovich, but don't like the swearing and explicit sexual scenes, you may love Ivy Malone.

I don't mind Christian books at all, but this one felt more proselytizing than any of the others I've read - and I'm a Christian. The plot was believable up to a point, but then it just got ridiculous. I could put all of that aside if the ending was more than a lead in to the next book. I've read plenty of mystery series, and most of them allow each volume to stand alone. This series is nothing like that. Sure, one of the main mysteries is resolved, but it leaves off with a big cliffhanger. Not fun. I won't be looking any further for Ivy Malone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This seemed okay from the preview, but the plot wandered, the characters didn't develop into anything interesting, and I started to wish for the minor characters to kick this obnoxious busybody out of their lives.

The heroine Ivy is not believable. The other characters are generally two dimensional, no depth or complexity. The Christian undertheme which keeps cropping up in random places fits the story like a bad hairpiece, and is basically an annoyance. Please don't take this as hostility to Christians, I am one.

I can produce an anamorphic 16x9 DVD right here in my home from my laptop. It's disappointing that a product manufactured by a large company can't be the same.

It's about how having a clear vision, putting great people in place, fostering innovation, developing a strong brand, and listening to the customer DO come together to create success! It's how big companies DO stifle creativity and how you have to stand up to overcome it. It's about cool technology. Most importantly it's about people.

Every song on this album is a classic, from Last Caress, to Attitude, to Angelfuck, this CD has nothing but the best to offer. And, the songs She and Spinal Remains are presented in their original form (much better than Glenn's remix on Legacy of Brutality, I might add), as well as In the Doorway, an old tune that was unreleased until now.

The grunginess of the recordings only serves to heighten the enjoyment. This is music free of pretension, manipulation, and pomp and circumstance. It still feels honest today some 20+ years later. That's really a testament to the talent of Glenn Danzig, Jerry Only and co.. How else can you explain the fact that such a simple song as \\"We Are 138\\" is such an enduring classic that continues to rock? It's pure genius! This album belongs in the collection of any self-respecting fan of punk rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"I concur with adios_lune","review":"This album was definitely too short. A mere 8 tracks is not enough to even listen to while vaccuming. The lady's pitch was all over the map. This is a real solid album if you are into the Backstreet, N'Sync, Aaron Carter or 'P. diddy'. But this really doesn't hold a candle to Blink 182 or Good Charlotte. I also think this album could benefit from more songs about hate and pain. Wrapping things up, this album roks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Isn't Very Good","review":"i listen to a lot of punk, like Blink 182 and stuff, and someone told me about the Misfits, so i bought static age and a shirt of them. lemme tell u, this is crap. i dunno why it sounds so bad. For one, there'e too many love songs on here.. wha wha, who wants to hear u cry about your car crashing?? Geez dood. Another bad thing about this cd is that it only has 8 songs, 4 of which are nothing but silence. Whats with that?* Point is : this cd will not fit in your tape deck, but then again, u prolly won't want it to because it's so bad *if u are into bands like Sum 41, the Backstreet Boys, or Disturbed, chances are you MIGHT like this. BUT, you also may NOT. it's like a mix of reggae-pop and heavy metal. i dunno, i don't like reggae too much, so maybe you won't like this. I don't think the lady can sing very well on this album. Hey, i bet I can sing better, right?? man, what a crappy tape. u gotta but this album!!cya guyz l8er!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTUAL punk music....","review":"This album is what so many bands today try to be... an actual punk band.

As the booklet in the CD says, Static Age was recorded very quickly and comes off sounding really raw and dirty as a result - but that's not a bad thing! The band obviously know what they're doing, and storm through the songs with real energy. Static Age is full of great tracks, some highlights being 'Last Caress', 'Attitude', 'Bullet' and the simple yet brilliant 'We Are 138'. Top notch punk, a lot of fun to listen to.This version of the CD comes with two hidden tracks, the first of which is a 8 minute collection 'Outtakes' from the recording sessions - it's just a lot of snippets of the starts of songs, or band members commenting on tracks... nothing spetacular, but cool none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE GREATEST PUNK CDs EVER!","review":"The Misfits earth-shattering debut must be owned by every person who likes punk music. I hold it right up there with the Sex Pistol's NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS... From begining to end, STATIC AGE is a great cd with no bad songs. Highlights are \\"Last Caress\\", \\"We Are 138\\", \\"She\\", \\"Teenagers From Mars\\", \\"Return To Fly\\", \\"Attitude\\" (which Guns N' Roses did a cover of), \\"TV Casualty\\", and \\"Some Kind Of Hate\\". Although they are one of the best punk bands around, Misfits never got the recognition they deserve. IT ISN'T FAIR! If you like this cd, I would also recommend getting EARTH A.D. which is another of the greats. If you like this cd, but are more into modern punk, get AMERICAN PSYCHO and FAMOUS MONSTERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"My mother always told me...","review":"If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.

I've already had some success with eBay auctions, and am seriously looking for some ideas to get an eBay business off the ground. While I found Marsha Collier's book to have a great deal of useful information, this book is more or less 550 pages of pretty useless information to someone already mildly savvy with the eBay process.If you are new or just beginning with eBay, you might find this book useful, if you want to sit down and read about eBay at length. But the best way a new person will learn about eBay is to get out on the site and play around. Once you have bid and/or sold, I think you'll find that this book doesn't have a lot to offer you.The only useful section of this book was the area that addressed buying/selling strategies. Not enough info for me to keep the book - it's currently on half.com... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the eBay buyer or casual seller","review":"If you are an eBay buyer or casual seller, this book isn't for you. This book is more appropriate for someone whose goal is to setup an entire business around eBay rather than those of us who use eBay casually.I was hoping to learn expert bidding and selling tips and tactics. Instead, the book focused more on tools and how to improve sales processes.I was also amazed that in the section about credit card payments, services like Paypal were not even mentioned. I could over look this if it weren't for the fact that the book was published in December of 1999.If you are primarily an eBay buyer or only sell a handful of items a month or year, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i was hoping for......","review":"this book was a disapointment. though very easy to read, it provided only a superficial definition of the many aspects of online buying and selling. there is no reference value to this book. i would recommend this book only for the individual that has no auction or online experience and is wondering \\"what is ebay\\"? for the more literate or experienced user, try the official ebay guide written by laura and michael kaiser. again ....... this book was a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"Very basic information.

Most fans will be aware that Darren sang lead on the Harem Scarem song \\"Sentimental Boulevard\\" from the Mood Swings album. This solo album is really fun and full of great rock tunes played in a similar style to Harem Scarem's brand of melodic rock. It is even produced by Harry Hess who is Harem Scarem's lead vocalist.

If you like books that get better and better, read \\"There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough guys... have your tissues ready...","review":"A truly unforgettable read for anyone who's in the midst of surviving childhood, and for those of us who've made it.Centered around the life of self-proclaimed misfit, Bradley Chalkers, and the new kid, Jeff Fishkin, this well crafted story highlights the metamorphosis of Bradley and Jeff through their experiences in school, with classmates, each other, and the new school counselor, Carla.As a teacher, this is a must read aloud every year. My students love to read along with me, always laughing, always hanging on Louis Sachar's every well-chosen word, even waiting for me to cry at the end - and I never can manage to disappoint them.Kids will remember 'There's a Boy in the Girls' Bathroom' the rest of their lives. I read it because I love it and my students love it, but most of all because of the few kids that live in such parallel to Bradley Chalkers that, I believe, they 'need' this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This Book!","review":"I checked this book out from the libray and after reading it I went to the bookstore to buy my own copy.

A new counselor has also come to the school. She is very glad to see Bradley. Bradley says he hates her, but is that true?This book has fantastic writing but I don't like the topic.

However, it gets no additional stars because of its many flaws: multiple typos; sometimes amateurish illustrations (see the TBY Sea Wolf on p. 93, apparently drawn by an 8 year-old); some very odd, unrepresentative choices of aircraft markings (for example, a Luftwaffe B-17F and a Soviet Air Force P-51!); and some glaring, flat-out errors (the entry on the Merlin-powered Spitfire Mk.

A lot of people would argue that such a book isn't necessary when you can type man \\"command\\" or use the --help switch, but the man pages are often semi-cryptic, and a little extra explanation goes a long way.

She is an intelligent writer, and she knows how to develop characters. I certainly want to read more of her books. The Cambridge touch here is a good one as is the artistic information that comes out during the course of the book. There are enough twists in the plot to keep most people guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotate in your grave, Dorothy L. Sayers!","review":"This book gives a new dimension to the term \\"bad\\". The characters are either totally improbable or equally totally unpalatable (some are both), their self-conscious soul-searching is fatuous and lacks any credibility or basis in real life. One can't help feeling that the \\"heroine\\" was an utter bitch who fully got what she derserved, although I doubt that this was the author's intention, and in the end it was, of course, all the men's fault.The author knows zilch about the English upper classes. A gentleman with a monogrammed handkerchief, children of an upper class mother calling their aunt \\"auntie\\", to name just two of countless whince-making gaffes... It is incredible.Pity one can't award \\"minus\\" stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good back stories","review":"George's descriptions are vivid and fascinating. A university setting in Cambridge, England is where we find Elena Weaver, a runner in the Hare and Hounds club. While running on a foggy morning, Elena witnesses the murder of a young woman, but the murderer escapes into the foggy mist before Elena sees his face.Taking place on a college campus and being considered more complicated than what the local cops or campus security can handle, Scotland Yard officers, Lynley and Havers are called in.

Only a devoted Harlequin fan would find the interminable Tommy-Helen, Simon-Deborah, Barbara-parents soap opera to be tolerable, much less engaging. What on earth does all of this sturm und drang have to do with the murder mystery genre? And the motive in this particular installment is so idiotic that one resents having had to tough it out in order to finish the book.I like feeling entertained when I read a murder mystery. These books make me feel as though I need to take a bath."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bonds that people make and break","review":"Elizabeth George is a serious writer with serious ambitions. This book, centering around a mystery located in a college town and tackles no fewer than 5 complex issues involving interpersonal relationships. Ms. George spends time exploring the bonds between aging men and both their spouses and mistresses. George examines the bond between an artist and her finished product. She also tackles the bond between a mother and daughter. All this is accomplished while she centers the action of the book around a thorough exploration into the dynamic between daughters and fathers and step mothers.There is passion and sex and murder and guilt.I advise readers to start from the beginning of this series and read the books sequentially. This is a well written series and while she may fall a bit short of P D James she is well worth reading and enjoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting this series","review":"Just starting the Inspector Lynley series and am looking forward to catching up with all the books.

The reamers measure exactly a -0.001 or +0.001 but apparently the Chinese can't produce a reamer without visible run-out. If you need to precision machine a part, don't buy your tooling from Grizzly and expect good results because you'll just end up wasting your time, money, and re-buying it from a USA manufacturer to produce the part!

The rest of the album is pretty good too, with atmospheric, entrancing songs like \\"Rangoon Moon\\" and \\"Woman Of The World.\\" Even though the duo is generally regarded as belonging to the rock/pop genre, \\"The Captain Of Her Heart\\" is a song that works equally well in a smooth jazz setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid sound","review":"\`Captain of Her Heart' was THE SONG of my pre-pubescence, and it still moves me as much as it did nearly 20 (yikes) years ago. I had the misfortune of seeing the video, which was an 80's-entrenched disservice to such a great song.Anyway, this album is 85% great. The only song I detest is \`your prayer takes me off'. The lyrics are silly, the music dated. Did the producer's son sneak a track on this otherwise fine record? \`Urban Nomads' is cheesy too, but it's guilty pleasure-so out it's in. It amazes me that the team who wrote 'rangoon moon' and 'captain' are the same who wrote 'prayer' and 'nomads'. oh well--can't be brilliant all the time.I love the lead singer's voice! Not a lot of range, but just right for the jazzy/pop sound of the music. He could read the phone book and I'd hang on every word.

The main tent is huge for what I was thinking it would be. Lots of little toy balls included, and a golf club. After a few practices and a little more than a glance at the instructions, we figured out how to close the tents back up for storage.

The finger case part is sturdy, so your finger won't get hurt too bad when your kids bite on it. And its brush part works well too.The toothbrush's bristle is too hard. When I gave it to my son the first time, he immediately put it into his mouth since he had been very interested in a toothbrush for a while (I used to only use one finger brush on him). He of course did not know how to use it to brush his teeth but just biting on it. A few minutes later I could see some pinkish saliva dripped from his mouth, so I pulled it out. I saw the brush was tilted and 2 or 3 bristles sticking out from the brush. I tried the brush myself, and I felt it was not soft enough, and that 2 or 3 bristles really hurt my gum. I guess it hurt my son's gum badly and the pinkish saliva was from his blood. I never gave him this toothbrush again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Options Elsewhere","review":"The idea of this set is nice, but the toothbrush bristles are not quite soft enough for baby's teeth/gums and a little large for baby's mouth, and the gum stimulator (which is the main reason I got this set for my teething baby) is a bit too big for my baby's mouth too, and he gags on it pretty easily. The finger brush is good - the same as any other. However, none of the products are BPA-Free, and they're all made in China, which is always a red flag for me these days; especially for something that I'm putting in my baby's mouth. If you're looking for a good gum stimulator/massager, I suggest the other one we got which fits my baby's mouth much nicer, is BPA-Free and is offered with free shipping by Giggle: [...] (Called Gum Massager Brush (BPA-Free).)

I am not such a person, and really disliked this film.I rented this film to watch with my kids because I thought it would represent a good life lesson about what it would be like to be a child with a serious illness. I was a bit worried that the film would be overly religious, but based on a review I read at Amazon which said that it was a good movie even if you were not religious, I rented it anyway.

The simple innocence of youth cuts through the otherwise complex adult confusion regarding life's objectives, purpose and prayer. It underscores the nature of our closest human relationships without forming an allegiance to any particular faith even though the word GOD is in the title.

This is Fein's personal story as he tries to cope with his loss, honor his daughter's memory, and move foward with his life forever altered. The book is filled with a personal wisdom that is both deeply philosophical and searingly personal. To read this book is to vacillate between crying one's own tears for the loss of Nomi and being inpired by her own unique and powerful spark.

But there are all the elements later to become hallmarks of the Daly genre: the mixing of high-life and low-life; the laconic detective himself; the endlessly twisty plot; and of course, a hard-boiled, middle-aged woman at the centre of the mystery.A final, jocular note: I liked the fine period touches; a weak-lunged invalid smokes \\"special medicated cigarettes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I seldom give up on a book before finishing, but this one was so disappointing I could not complete it.

You don't get a sense of who the characters are as people, or really even care who they are. They're just sort of...blah and bland, as if they mix in with the story somehow, but don't really have a purpose. Especially with the main character, Mary Jemison, even after she's witnessed her family killed before her eyes, she's just portrayed as so BLAND throughout the entire book, it's like, \\"How am I still reading this?\\" And while reading, it's like there's no real structure for how much time has passed from certain periods in Mary's life, it's all \\"boom, boom, boom, here's what's going on.

The images are so poorly compressed that it is hard to read hand-written monologues in the graphic. Artificial fonts on pop up screen are fine, but as for graphic, you can see digital noise from compression in any edges on characters.

It sets up Gordon as a man instead of someone Batman can get info from. What Miller did for Batman in The Dark Knight, he does here for Jim Gordon. The Gotham Police Department is truely shown as the cesspool af graft and corruption it was always reputed to be. It works great as a kind of for runner to Miller's SinCity tales in later years. It is also a great lead in to Jeph Loeb and Tim Sales excellent \\"The Long Halloween\\" and \\"Dark Victory\\" stories. Mazzucchelli's art is simple and powerful. Batman looks like a guy in a funny costume with a cape, yet it somhow works. I just wish Miller had a little more room to tell his story. There is only one real action scene, when Bats is cornered by the police. still, it is very good and well worth a read for all Miller and Batman fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite as good as dkr, but close","review":"the only real problem i had with this book is that it didn't fully explain why bruce wayne became batman, but it rather showed how. i think the movie batman begins does a better job of showing the beginning of batman. it was till a very good book with great artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive","review":"I like Year One better than Miller's the Dark Knight Returns. The reason being is that Miller keeps the character of Batman more in tuned to what is, in my opinion, the true Batman. In the Dark Knight Returns, Batman comes across as too much of an anti-hero who is rebelling against the \\"system\\". I felt Miller may have injected too many of his political views into that story. However, in Year One I do not feel this is the case. Overall, this is a very interesting take on Batman's origin. Also, the story focuses quite a bit on Gordon as well. Anyone who liked the movie Batman Begins should read Batman: Year One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Origin stories aren't always bad","review":"Another excellent origin story for the Batman universe. Now we know how Batman came to be, as well as Gordon and his family and even Catwoman. Frank Miller does an excellent job at weaving everything together and making connections between the characters even before they knew each other in their respective ways. Very immersive and influential to other Batman arcs, this is a must have for all Batman fans, new and old, to really understand why Batman is who he is and why he does what he does, as well as to get in the minds of Gordon and Batman, with further support from Selina Kyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This collection was great. It revamped my love for Batman. The team up for this was amazing as well, the story line and the illustrations had me wanting more after I finished. If you are a batman fan I would definitely recommend this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring for a non-comic book reader","review":"I like Batman, I like Sin City, so I should like this. But I was just bored. Now, I'm not much of a comic book reader, so maybe that may have something to do with it. I think the main problem is that this felt like it should have been called Gordon, Year One, Batman almost takes a back seat. At least it's a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Overrated","review":"Really was disappointed in this novel especially considering all the hype it gets. The story is very short and is mostly about Gordon's rise through the ranks than it is about Batman. In fact, there is very little about Batman in the novel to begin with so do not expect to get the details about Batman like you did with Batman Begins. Also, as someone has mentioned, the novel seems to go nowhere and just when you think it is about to begin its over. The other major flaw is the artwork which is probably the worst you will ever see from a professional. The only positive I saw in this novel was the move towards realism. Other than that, there really isn't anything of value in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Batman Fanatic","review":"Frank Miller returned to the Batman franchise in 2007 in what I feel to be one of the most disappointing Comic Book titles within the Batman franchise. Batman: Year One although is good in concept of covering Batman's first year as a crime fighter this novel had high aspirations but fell flat on a story that fails to grab the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Intro To A Classic Character","review":"Only after seeing the phenomenal Batman Begins did I seek out this fabulous graphic novel. I was absolutely floored to learn that it predates Tim Burton's take on the Bat. Miller really delves into the psyche of the traumatized Bruce Wayne It offers a dark, harsh picture of Gotham City and the one officer who was willing to fight the corruption present. Anyone who reads this novel will totally forget that there was ever a '60s TV calamity called Batman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hard Cover Release.","review":"My original rating for the story is actually 4 stars. But with all the awsome extras thrown into this stylish hard cover graphic novel it's hard to give it 4. The writing in this batman book is exceptional, Frank Miller realy does it again in the batman series. As for the art, the style is a little retro, but still impressive.This one is certainly worth buying, but if you want absolutely brilliant batman books, go for The dark knight returns, arkham asylum, and the long halloween. I reccomend this one in anyone's graphic novel collection, especialy if you like or LOVE batman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Hyped","review":"Only four issues long, this is meant to tell the story of Batman's formative year. I went into this riding high on the wave of adulation for this work and came away feeling cheated and like I'd gotten screwed with my pants still on. There are some inspired moments but mostly I was asking the question, \\"Yeah, okay, interesting - but when's the freaking story gonna start??!\\" Its not enough to say \\"It's Millar, shut up\\" or \\"Its untouchably masterfully brilliant!!\\" cos it really isn't. Compared to other Batman stories - basically anything Denny O'Neill wrote, Venom, Long Halloween, Hush etc - Year One falls down. Over-hyped with some good ideas but no real payoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"THis sory is ver well told. I liked the art in this book, very dark , very gothic,very Batman. The story does have some flaws, like the addition of the catwoman, she wasn't needed in this story. I would also had liked it if it would have been a bit longer. BUt other than that this story is preety cool. I also liked the fact that it also told the story from Jim Gordon point of view, there is very few Batman stories which include his point of view. This is the 2nd best Batman story after the Dark Knight Returns. But is is definetely better than the awful the Dark Knight strikes again, and it's story is also better than the Joel Schumacher Batman movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect beginning for Batman","review":"Here, you can see Batman like never before, a rookie making mistakes. I think this is the best Batman story, a great plot, a great art and GREAT caracthers, the relantionship between Gordon and Batman is excellent. My favorite comic book and I read a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Frank Miller doing Batman's origin.","review":"Therefore you shouldn't really need convincing. If you're at all interested in Batman, or comics, or Frank Miller, chances are you already own this wonderful look into Bruce Wayne's first year as the Caped Crusader. Good story, good art, and at a reasonable price. Serves as a wonderful introduction to \\"adult\\" comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Marvelous","review":"This comic book ranked #3 in Wizard Magazine's top 40 comic books of all time, and if you read it you'll understand why. A rookie Batman making mistakes and learning from them, and a \\"young\\" James Gordon stealing the show in his own way, this is a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Year one","review":"This comic was pretty good. It focuses on Batmans methods as he first becomes a crime fighter also introduces catwoman(this time she is black and she is a dominatrix hooker hmmmm) The art is maybe and acquired taste. A good read especially if you are truly a comic book fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"For all batman fans!","review":"If you enjoyed Batman begins, and have not yet read this, what are you waiting for???? It is a great, great read ( i could not put it down once i started reading it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Begining...","review":"Dark, gritty, and striking. This is a crime story pure and simple, even if it does involve a man in a costume. Two things are suprising: that it focuses more on James Gordon, then on Batman and that it works. If there is anything that I don't like about the book is the portrayal of Catwoman. I don't know why she is even in here to begin with. What I like most is that Miller shows Batman fighting real evils like organized crime and police corruption."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book For Diehard Batman Fans","review":"This book is pretty good. It has a greta intirpritation of how bataman came to be and about a young police cop named Gordan. This is great because it shows batman bleeding and not always succeding like in many other books and movies. it shows him learning as he goes along. The thing that dissappointed me was that I felt like this book could of gone on for a couple more pages. it has a great plot but i thought the ending happended to quickly. It's still a great book though and hopefully the next batman movie they make will be based of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is the compelling story set in the time of a young Bruce Wayne and an old Gotham. One of the things I love about it is the fact that it isn't really the story of Batman coming to Gotham. Given this element is covered thoroughly, but this is the story of the young Jimmy Gordon coming to Gotham. The enemies aren't products of government testing, toxic waste, or birth defects, but policemen. Incredible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up there with Dark Knight Returns","review":"One of the best comic stories of all time, with excellent artwork, Batman: Year One really stands out as a milestone. This realistic, definitive origin is how Batman began his career, and the only Batman story that rivals this one in quality is Dark Knight Returns, which is how Batman's career should end. Both the story and the artwork are dripping with mood, and are well paced and well delivered. Keep an eye out for the Edward Hopper allusion. Batman is portrayed very realistically, and James Gordon is no longer a one dimensional character. He actually steals the spotlight and is both a very sympathetic and cool character. If you've never read a comic, start here, and then get Batman: Dark Knight Returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Origin of Batman","review":"If you ever want to know how Bruce Wayne became Batman, you come to the right book. This book chronicles Batman's origin as well as the origin of his relationship with Gordon. They are basically the main characters in this book and although there are no real villains in this book, it is a great character piece on the lives of these characters, their trials and tribulations, and their struggles and how they are able to overcome or succumb to them. Although not as epic as The Dark Knight Returns, it is a close second. But artwork is just horrendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but...","review":"This is great story from Frank Miller and company. I bought it mainly because I was impressed by The Dark Knight Returns, and have to say that I was a little disappointed. This is really more the story of how Batman and Gordon became friends than it is the story of Batman's early adventures. It is a good read, but doesn't live up to Dark Knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"the book got to me sooner than I expected and was in great condition, really happy with it and will keep this in mind next time I want a graphic novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"That's It?\\"","review":"Those were the exact words running through my mind upon finishing this underwhelming and meandering story.Jim Gordon is a self-righteous putz, Bruce Wayne is aloof and unremarkable, and Batman is made out to be such an inept klutz in his beginnings that any subsequent heroic feats seem disingenuous, absurd and aided heavily by luck. How one can go from nearly getting his ass kicked by three teenagers to decimating a police death squad after a few months training is beyond me.I know, I know, it is just a comic. Suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite. But if that is the case, then I expect to be entertained and rewarded for my investment. Instead, I read a rather ordinary story framed by cheesy, expository dialogue lifted from a Raymond Chandler novel, sans the wit and social criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miller Knows Batman","review":"In the world of Comic-Book Heros I have two favorites Batman and Swampthing. Moore Knows Swampthing and Miller Knows Batman. But not only does Miller know batman He knows the characters surrounding batman. This is Not just a batman origin but the origin of James Gordon (Soon to be commissioner) and even shows how catwoman came to be. this is a great year one for batman. I only have one beef. Batman's model kinda reminded me of campy old BAM POW KABOOOM Batman. its not really worth any real notice and really only occurs in a a few segregated places but I think Mazzucchelli could have tryed a little bit harder.In his defense though I think the artwork is amazing Im glad Miller decided not to illustrate this one. The story itself is flawless The ending is brilliant though its more of a beginning then an ending of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my FAVORITE Batman story....","review":"Ever since I picked up the first issue of this miniseries back in the 80's it's been my favorite. The minimalist artwork, the coloring and the story itself blend together in a masterpiece. This version of the birth of the crimefighter has been the inspiration for Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and for Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins as well.This extended edition has lots of interesting \\"goodies\\" that flesh out how the story evolved from concept to reality.You may not be a comic book fan, but I'm pretty sure you'll like this. If you liked \\"Batman Begins\\", then I know you won't be disappointed here."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply, a masterpiece!","review":"Although I didn't appreciate Mazzuchelli's art as a youngster, I now acknowledge his work on Batman:Year One as probably the best and most complete comic art that i've seen. Mazzuchelli's perfectly understated art accentuates the brooding tension that lies just below the surface of Miller's hard-boiled plot. This book is really, really great cinema, and I'd compare the impressionistic tone of mazzuchelli's voice in this work to filmaker Terrence Malick's, although the book itself resembles the film noir style on a superficial level. Of course, Frank Miller deserves a lot of credit as I'm sure that he had a lot of input towards the construction of the art. Lynn Varley, too, for the beautifully warm application of color."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Satisfied...Almost","review":"It was with great delight that I purchased this CD. As a long-time John Hammond fanatic, I waited a long time for this release. Normally, by virtue of Hammonds singing and guitar/harp playing, I would give this release a 5-star review. That being said, The Source Point portion of this release is classic John Hammond. The all-around performance is brilliant. It's the I'm Satisfied portion that I have a little trouble with. While John's performance is fine to very good, Delaney Bramletts production seems a little cluttered. While Bramlett has been a fine producer for other artists (i.e.Eric Clapton), he seems to have taken a mis-step with Hammond. Hammond band recordings sound better in a more traditional setting, not the tambourine-shaking,R'n'B Gospel mode that Delaney favored in those days. Still, if you're a big John Hammond fan, you're going to like this CD. How about 4 and 1/2 Stars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BOB DYLAN's Guitar player for years!","review":"Seriosly, This guy played on Dylan's '60's albums. John Can play it like no other!

After three days in the house, we knew they had to go. Too many floaters and multiple flush situations. It doesn't save any water if you have to flush it three times just to clear the bowl of No. 1!I knew Toto was a great brand and I bought their least expensive model, the Carusoe. It arrived in two boxes and went together very easily. It does not include a seat. I recommend the Toto soft close seat. You will also need a new wax ring and probably a supply hose.This toilet flushes everything I have thrown at it in one flush. I am very happy.When ordering be sure to order the flush handle on the correct side. The other side of the tank has a tasteful Toto logo towards the bottom of the tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dumb","review":"The book is set in 1936 and paints a great picture of life on board the Queen Mary. Everything was fine until the last few pages when the ship arrives in NY and sails under the Verrazano Bridge. Say what? The bridge opened in 1965.

The musicians were annoying and off-setting. But before that there were the Misfits. This charm from the early '70s punk era was a combination of classic punk music and sometimes-campy humor. In many ways it satirized Halloween horror and introduced people to comedy by absurdity.Songs like WE ARE 138 and LAST CARESS are pop-style gems. You won't be able to resist their smooth chord styles and soulful voice of Glenn on these songs. The first half of the collection is mostly poppy and/or songs like CHILDREN IN HEAT, humor by explicity. The second half gets more serious I think and isn't as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"I don't like collection 2 much at all, except for halloween and we are 138.

The conscientious Habsburg naval officer has served as a U-Boat commander, secret agent and almost savior of the Archduke Ferdinand in pervious installments. In this one, he takes to the air as a combat pilot. All of this would seem ludicrous to many serving officers but, Biggins makes it believable.Part of the charm of these books is that the protagonist is a basically good guy. He is employed by a decaying empire teetering on the brink of collapse but still tries to serve as best he can. All too often, his efforts are thwarted by the agents of the bureaucracy.Like the others, this is a fascinating book. It is not only enjoyable, it gives a glimpse of the reasons for the internal decay of the Austro-Hungarian Empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWO HEADED EAGLE","review":"I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS GUY'S WORK.

All the other dog clickers on Amazon are better since they have a button instead of a thumb hole to click and they're all rounded to fit in your pants better.2. The other reason you shouldn't get this is because Petco is not eco-friendly in their packaging. The only thing in my Petco order was this dog clicker.

However, it has taught my wife to say please and thank you when she's sitting down and standing up...A great buy, keeps the little 'uns quiet for ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hokey Pokey Elmo a great gift for any VT Hokie fan","review":"We purchased this for our 11-month old for Christmas. It is great - of course Elmo does not sing the entire song however he does shake and move around. It is quite entertaining. It is not plush but it is not supposed to be with all the mechanics. But then again I am very partial to this Elmo because we are Virginia Tech Hokies and anything with the Hokey Pokey is a lot of fun. We play this for our son when we change his diaper. It keeps him entertained.

My daughter loves this Elmo and dances along with him. I'm surprised at how well it's held up. The toy gets taken everywhere and gets dropped A LOT! This is a toy even I can tolerate singing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute and Entertaining","review":"Elmo does the Hokey Pokey and the whole family joins in! Our 14 month old enjoys watching as Elmo puts his right arm in and out, shakes it all about and even spins around. Then he does it again with his left leg. He even asks to be picked up if baby knocks him down in the middle of his routine. My husband and I join Elmo in his dance, and baby loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good times for kids","review":"My 2 year old has this and loves it. He's already a huge fan of Elmo, so I'm sure that helps. The toy itself is rather neat since it pretty much does the hokey pokey. Elmo puts in his hand in, his leg in and he shakes all about, then he turns around in a circle. Doesn't work so good on carpet, better on smooth surfaces. The sound it good and lucky for us parents, the song doesn't last too long. If you tip him upside down he says \\"whoopsie!\\", and something about needing to be turned back upright. Cute toy. My son thinks Elmo is dancing with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmo should do more?","review":"I bought this toy for my 11 month old son. On the box it says Elmo sings the whole song but he doesn't. He only holds out 1 hand and a foot however, he falls over when he lifts his foot. My son LOVES HIM he dances and claps whenever you press the hand and he trying to imitate his moves. This toy is very durable because my son tackles him to the floor and he is still in one piece. This toy is great for introducing imitation skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Big Problem","review":"I was ecstatic when I bought Hokey Pokey Elmo, until I remembered that I live in a town where dancing is illegal (much like in \\"Footloose\\") I'm afraid that if I turn this little fuzzy red fellow loose, the coppers are going to come by and haul him off to the big house. What should I do? I really want to see the lil' guy shake it all about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey Pokey Elmo is certainly Hokey","review":"I was very dissappointed in what I thought was going to be a really great toy. The tag on Elmo says that if you remove the tag under his foot (that couldn't be removed before you opened it) then he would play the entire hokey pokey song. Unfortunatly all of Elmo's song includes one arm and one leg then he is done. I probably expected too much but my version of the hokey pokey would have included both arms and legs and maybe some head and tail too. This toy was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a great toy for 10 minutes","review":"My one and a half year old daughter gift this for Christmas and loved it. I think a little too much because it only worked for 10 minutes. The moment she picked it up and tried to play with it broke. It still shakes and sings but will not turn around or move its legs or arm any longer. We were going to take it back but she loves hearing Elmo's voice. We figured it would be silly to replace it for only 10 more minutes of fun. So we kept it. If you want an Elmo that actually does the hokey poke your going to have to buy a puppet and sing it yourself lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken and open box!","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present.

Its sad really, for a $40 toy to just get pooped after one fall.And oh yes.. it does say 'Elmo is pooped'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for the first 10 minutes until it broke.","review":"I bought this toy at Walmart for $29.99 for a 18 month old girl. The toy was fun at first until she dropped Elmo only one time. His hand stop moving and his foot. I was very disappointed in the quality of this toy. For 18 months- 4 years this toy should of been much more durable. Kids of course are going to drop it/ pull his arm. I am returning Elmo for a different toy. For the few minutes he lasted he was really fun and she enjoyed the toy. Overall I would not buy this toy nor any kind again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging. Would make a great gift.","review":"My 3 year old has had this for 3 years and it has provided endless entertainment. I have had no problems with anything breaking, and I have 3 girls who fling him all around. My daughter brings him to school and her entire class is in love with him. I would highly recommend this to anyone before I would recommend the Tickle Me Elmo - which I sell!!

This effort has been unsuccessful, at that.My children were immediately very enchanted by this toy...as to whether their enchantment level continues remains to be seen. Truthfully, as much as my kids love Elmo, you could probably have an Elmo doll sitting on the toilet reading a newspaper and pooping, and they'd still be enchanted. Hey, perhaps this is an idea Fisher-Price will borrow from me?Update: Kids long ago lost interest... Hokey Pokey Elmo was dispatched via yard sale. Truly a one-trick wonder. The kids still love Elmo, so we have since acquired a much more cuddly & plush, non-mechanical version of Elmo, who receives far more attention from the kids than his mechanical predecessor ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I have received this TWICE and there is no string at the bottom to make him work, Be sure to go to the store where you can check to see if the importmant component i there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Authoratative Reference","review":"Quite simply, this book is all you will ever need to trade equity options.The fundamentals are clearly explained and each trading strategy is amply illustrated with the help of many examples and associated graphs.If you buy this book and don't understand its contents, then you must infer that options trading is not for you. On the other hand you will learn quickly why options trading puts you at the top of the food chain (75% of option expire worthless, so why buy them when you can sell them?)

Very misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Start","review":"This book, while rather lenghty, starts with the basics and eventually works up to the more complex strategies. Some of the reviews stated they wanted more mathmatics. While there are more complex books on options, this book should be in any option trader's library. Yes,the mathmatics are limited, but the book focuses on the concepts rather than the models. I recommend this book to any newly licienced securities trader or options principal. If more of my clients read this book, my job would be much easier. I hope that all the readers appreciate the risks of trading options and understand them before embarking on some of these option strategies. As a quick background, I currently have seven different security licenses and this was one of my favorite books. Definitely not light reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big fluffy book","review":"Lots of pages to give basic and mostly uninteresting information.

The audience actually fell asleep. As I admit did I when Larry droned on. The book does the same it drones on about options with no application.I have to wonder can Larry actually trade or does he make his money from his high priced seminar series. Either the Schaeffer or Fontanills books are easier to follow. I bought both from Amazon at great prices"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good academic discussion of Option theory","review":"Actually, this book deserves 3.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous today...Understanding theory is not as important for MAKING MONEY in options trading as it is for analyzing results. However, this is a good reference book for investors, since a successful investor needs to be able to do dispassionate analysis.This book's major flaws are:1) Poor Editing. Some of the terminology is incorrect (e.g. \\"striking price\\") and the organization of the presentation could be improved a great deal.2) Dry academic prose. No wonder successful business people love to bash academic types.Personally, I'm more inclined to recommend reading books by William Eng, William O'Neill, and James P.

The listing of the Clinton's associates and their demises in the credits really put the whole story in perspective. Clinton haters will love it, Clinton fans will hate it, all others will have a new perspective on our political process.

He was a real nasty human being, he was every woman's nightmare for a husband. I kept telling myself as i read that Doug will get his. Well needless to say, he didn't get anything real deserving of what he put Emily through.I enjoyed Emily's relationship with her daughter Jill and of course the tenant, Brian! I also enjoyed her relationship with her best friends, Kay and Celeste and their issues throughout the book. And of course, the story about Daniel and the thriller of figuring out what exactly happened to that poor little boy. That part of the story will not dissappoint!

The characters were very flat and steriotypical. The simpering Emily, the sex-starved Celete, the self-absorbed men. Yuk.

The book is interesting and reveals the history, meanings, and variations of practice of the various customs it covers. I enjoyed the book and would gladly purchase it again.However, the buyer should be aware that so many of our traditions are sectarian that the portions of the book most likely to be used are already being used. This could limit the usefulness of the book, unless the church is very open to new ideas.For instance, the typical Baptist Church will not look favorably upon a youth minister who teaches the youth to make the sign of the cross each morning. I am NOT trying to suggest these signs are all Catholic. They come from various backgrounds, but most churches are hesitant to borrow from other traditions. Still, I liked the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the title track alone","review":"The title track is wonderful -- an absolutely great recording.

We have also tried different bubble solutions. No worries to my 22 month old she thinks its great to carry around & likes putting the wands in & out.

She has learned to blow bubbles and loves to blow it herself. This product is good for children aged 5 to 8 or higher. Not meant for toddlers. The no spill function is also not really true.

He marries one and breaks the other girl's heart.This book doesn't test any boundaries but rates well as a good escapist read where the fairytale ends with everyone eventually living happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The outside of the Buxton wallet is nice leather,like others I have owned.

When her wallet became more and more disreputable she set out to find another, similar wallet in Houston. What one finds is that the large retailers are each carrying their own brands now and it seems that every ladies wallet is designed to carry checks. After we burned about 20 gallons of gasoline on searching for a new wallet I clicked on Amazon. I found the exact same wallet as she previously had and the whole process was completed in a matter of minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have","review":"As so many others have already pointed out, this album is a very unique masterpiece. Nothing else sounds like it. It combines brutally intense drums with sweeping keyboards, pounding bass lines and Burchill's unique guitar style.'Kick inside of me' is a very special gem of its time, supplying raw power in measures that make Metallica sound like a preschool band:)I also recommend to listen to the extended version of 'Speed your love to me', which goes way beyond what the album version of the song delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Simple Minds CD","review":"Simple Minds were never better than on this CD.

Sparkle in the Rain is one of their finest, most confident works. I'd forgotten about my new wave habit for about 10 years and recently rediscovered it. Hearing this album (and also New Gold Dream) was like finding your favorite toy from childhood. Every single track was a gem. I listened to this album five times when I found it again.

I emailed the seller that I never got my package and they apologized for not being able to help me because according to their records, it was received. A few days later, I found the package, delivered to the wrong place- the sender told me they couldn't mail it to me again if it was sent back to them because it \\"wasn't covered\\" in the money I spent buying the candies.

This soundtrack is slightly dated now, but I still enjoy listening to the tunes, evokes definite memories of the 80's. My only complaint with the soundtrack is the missing saxophone interlude that accompanies the film version of 'Arrested by You;' it makes the soundtrack version seem very vanilla. Also, I would have loved it if they had included Howard Jones' 'Like to Get to Know You Well' (from the car repair scene), but it is what it is. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Art","review":"There are guitars here that sound like U2 in Joshua Tree four years before U2 started sounding like that. There are songs here that rival Tears for Fears before that band became a band. I contend that in a deep undergroud somewhere and sometime in the early '80s, blokes from other bands got together, heard some songs off Walk Across the Rooftops, figured out which ones they could copy to make a career; then executed their plan. Almost every song on this CD is different and begins with a random modern art type song that seems fragmented, but integrates beautifully and keeps your interest. The second song is the one that sounds like Tears for Fears. It is so well done you'll want to play it over and over. This is not experimental music; it is art uniquely conveyed, each song its own entity ranging from pure pop modern art to blues, jazz and rock. If you are student of music, this will surely satisfy your thirst for the unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet, passionate masterpiece","review":"Supremely original and uncategorizable pop music from this artistic Glasgow, Scotland trio. At first impression this beautifully produced 20-year-old but ageless debut's sound is more ambient, atmospheric, textured and stark than their excellent followup \\"Hats.\\" Repeated listenings brings to the fore the passion of Paul Buchanan's soulful and unforgettable singing and the tactile,poetic, consistently moving and urban-detailed lyrics. (Glasgow, its buildings, streets and people, seems to be an almost spiritual influence.) A residing sense of authenticity and yearning and loneliness throughout the record and on songs like \\"Easter Parade,\\" \\"Tinstletown in the Rain,\\" \\"Stay\\" are unforgettable. Wonderful, timeless music."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant 1983 blue nile debut.","review":"this is extraordinary elegant, sophisticated pop music. with its synthesized sounds, strings, electronics, and other exotica, much of this music would fit easily on early brian eno albums. highly creative, this recording also sports much in the way of big bass and drum sounds; however, it is the singer that really gives this its classic feel. the vocals are stunning, emotionally charged and full of yearning. just a great, great cd. don't miss this or any of the other 3 blue nile recordings; they are all outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was I the only one?","review":"OK, hands up if you have sung the first line to this album and then tried to 'sing' the bass line that immediately follows it? This is the kind of album that does that to you. Strange noises, carefully structured songs and built with such skill that this album will always stand the test of time.

Because of this, the style depicted isn't terribly Egyptian, but sort of a quasi-orientalist fantasy. Virtually all of the interiors in this book could be from Morocco, or Los Angeles for that matter.

I am not a native Texan, but I know the history of this time period and this area well, and know that this movie takes quite a few liberties with how things actually happened. I have not read the book and do not know if the inaccuracies were the film maker's attempt to make things more dramatic, or if the flawed portrayal of this time period is reflected in the novel as well (I hope not). Historically inaccurate movies are always a disappointment because they misrepresent the events of their given day and time, and make people believe that this is how things actually took place. Considering the stellar cast that was involved in this film, it is a shame that the story told was not the \\"real thing\\".

Being a true Southern Woman, I am very critical and defensive about what is published, as it is usually \\" Hollywood Hype\\" and degrades my Southern Culture and Heritage with their hatered and racisim. This is the real deal ladies and gentleman. Get It if you want a glimpse into the past that tells the real truth about what it was like. This is a glimps into an American Culture to be Proud of !

I had hoped for a good western showing women victorious in their efforts. Instead the women are portrayed as heroines simpy because they were victims. If you get burned, slaughtered, widowed, raped or hung, you are a true woman, as if suffering defines a woman...what drivel. And racial issues are reduced to tired old cliches in the hands of the feuding friends. Surely this chapter of American history, and the role of women of the era could have been treated with a bit more intelligence.

The book True Women was written by a distant cousin of mine. Georgia Lawshe Woods, played by Angelina Jolie in the film, was my mother's grandmother. Mama was secretive about her family's past; she specifically didn't want me having high falutin' ideas about who we were or to harbor prejudices against the Yankees.Having made full disclosure, I still say this is an outstanding film that all young people need to see--and the young at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR !

I set the unit up without installing software, just using the web page configuration. I was worried that this link would block access to the router side of the linked access point, but it translates all IP addresses as it was directly connected to it. Unlike a wireless bridge, it is cheaper and easier to set up. I connected one of the ethernet ports to an extra Linksys wireless access point, on a different channel. Had to connect via the switch ports, rather than the WAN port, and it works great. Now my wife and mom can use the computers on the far side of the house.

From meeting someone, to challenges, loss of a loved one and the preservation of relationsips over time. Not your typical self-help book, it presents a lot of intresting cases (short ones) to support the different beliefs. The author does not impose his point of view, he displays the array of beliefs found out there and leaves it up to the reader to take what is valuable. Each chapter is introduced by a quote relevant to it's content, most of these quotes have a strong impact, as my favorite: \\"People change, and forget to tell each other\\". This is the type of book that you don't have to read in order. The type of \\"bible-book\\" you can go back to time after time to consult. It also provides a lot of interesting bibliographical references that are worth checking out.

This CD is what Roc-a-Fella is all about. If you are a big fan of Jigga, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, and the rest of the Roc-a-Fella family, than this CD can not be missed. Bleek is back with rhymes tighter and beats doper than his first, Coming of Age. While that was a great CD, The Understanding shows how Memphis Bleek has matured in his career, with songs that seem to have more meaning, but still holding true to the ROC ways of making money and getting those guns. If you enjoyed the first Memph CD, or even Jay-Z's Dynasty, as well as the summer single of Hey Papi, than this is what you need. And speaking of Jay-Z, if you get your jollies off of him rapping in on tracks, he's all over this one.

The tenor she holds from page 1 to the end is clear, distinct, and objective to a fault. I first became aware of Tuchman from \\"The Guns of August\\"; this is only the second of her works that I've read thus far. This book is so rich it almost floods your thoughts with images of the terrain, the various duchies, estates, and the primitive cities. The machinations and intrigues executed by the nobles of the time, the arrogance and hubris of the so-called knights, and the struggles of the bourgeois class to thrive in spite of all the mishaps of the 14th century, are often so complex as to become bewildering. When I finally finished the book, I felt as though I'd been through a wringer. A classic story, told well, by a true master."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mirror of the twentith century","review":"Mrs. Tuchman's book shows the 14th century one of the most pivotal in European history. Through her narrative she tells the life of Enugerrand the Sire de Coucy one of the pivotal but least studied figures of the era. In this book readers will see not only the beginings of the nihilistic tones of our own century but the stirrings of the comman man against repression that sparked our own revolution. She weaves an impressive tapestry of war, peace, double dealing, death, and misery that would do the weavers of Ghent proud. Of all her books this one is the most far reaching and the best written. I'd recomend this for anyone who wants to see the big picture of history, from rise of the middle class, to the nihilistic fantasies spurred on by the free companies and the black death. As an added bonus she tells the sinister origin of our Santa Claus"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Serendipitous 14th Century","review":"Well done, Barbara Tuchman.

A good editor would have culled this book down significantly to let a great story shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overstuffed and Overwritten","review":"This book is a slog. Tuchman is non-selective in her use of detail and unsparing in unnecessary description. The result is that for long stretches the book has no focus or organizing principle. The style tends to upstage the content. This reader was caught in a blizzard of facts, names, and words.Worse yet, the title is misleading if it seeks to promote an analogy between the Fourteenth and Twentieth Centuries. No matter how similarly bloody the two periods, the Medieval and Modern world views and social structures are so disparate that motives for behavior cannot be compared. Behavior may be similar on the surface -- owing to the constancy of human nature -- but it is manifest according to its environment, and these manifestations differ in fundamental ways between the two eras.There are many better histories of the period written by better writers and analysts who have the ability to meld selected details into patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Distant Mirror","review":"An incredibly, rich and educational historical drama.

If you're interested in medieval Europe this is a great introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precise research and scholarly writing","review":"\\"A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century\\" arrived swiftly from the efficient Amazon bookhouse.Barbara Tuchman's characters are deftly portrayed as who they were. The subtleties of avarice and greed were made transparent. The author's insight into the panoramic 14th century provides a vivid expose of a tumultuous era.Very worthwhile for novice history majors and especially for those studying church history. Yes, church history, especially if it was a required course in the 1950-1960s. This book presents factual and thematic material which reveals the seamy side of church history, not as censure or criticism, but just the facts as they were, and their ensuing consequences.A very worthwhile and insightful read.Thanks to Barbara Tuchman,the foibles and frailities of the 14th century could serve as enlghtened guides for our own troubled era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact-filled, but disorderly, uninteresting, and down right","review":"Barbara Tuchman's attempt at this is unbelievable. Thebook is essentially a rambling of medival history whichoften refers back to a certain dynasty. It is filled withhundreds of obscure French names which have nothing to dowith anything. Tuchman jumps from one topic to another,creating a loose (even non-existant) organization whichleaves the reader lost and confused. Tuchman seems tothink that her reader already knows the information sheis trying to convey. It is almost as if Tuchman sat downat a typewriter and asked herself, \\"what do I know aboutmedival European history?\\" and then wrote whatever came toher mind, when ever it came to her mind. With the exceptionof the 5th chapter, which details the death and sufferingof millions during the various plagues, the novel is as dryas sand. The book's only merit is its informational value,which if the reader can follow, or for that matter evenstay awake, he may gain something from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disorganised and hard to follow.","review":"I was really looking forward to this book having read such good reviews, but was totally disappointed.

Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big bore!","review":"Although I really liked her 'March of Folly' I found this book hard to follow in that she allows too many names and places to flow together. If you read this book be ready to labor at it; it is not an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A history written in verisimilitude","review":"Once again, Barbara Tuchman has walked the thin line of factual reporting and making the facts personal to the reader. Yet, she has done so without bending the truth, but enhancing history by illustration of thoughts. Dr. Tuchman has done this by including noted paintings of the periods to explain various views of the time. She also links facts from one facet of history at the time and how it contributed to the change or stasis of the historical point. Such an approach makes history a joy to study and the dates (if you are into such numbers!) easy to remember.The 14th Century is a particular favorite! Tuchman shows the rise and fall of chivalry, feudalism, various schisms, and such a plethora of events. Though they seem unlinked, she has drawn them together under one cover. History shall never see another writer as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"saving paper","review":"this is an excellent writer - her \\"Guns of August\\" was my first read.

Tuchman's broad perspectives, clear communication skills, and framing of her subject matter are invaluable. Her nuanced use of appropriate detail give richness to her subject matter. She often clarifies matters that in other works go unexplained and that remain sources of obscure mystery.Of course, she is simply pleasant to read; she tells a good yarn. Her ability to do so is necessarily somewhat limited in this instance, because of the flaws, gaps, and contradictions in her source material. Given the reality of the piecemeal documents of the age, she has done future generations a great service by applying her very clever mind to a most compelling subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic work for already 15 years","review":"I read this book more then 10 years ago.

Seems he and his issue were everywhere at once, to quote an old AbFab episode: \\"...beside the rich and famous, behind the rich and famous, under the rich and famous...\\" When Barbara Tuchman could get off her favorite subject of his lordship, she would get back to the 14th century and was quite entertaining and informative about how you would live your life in that time. Yes, she used him as her north star to keep the book anchored, but you pretty much got tired of him halfway through the book and wished Edward had cut off his head or the Black Death had got him. Had the book been advertised as a history of the de Coucy family instead of a history of the 14th century I would have been more forgiving. She really needs to retitle this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally Good Research and Writing","review":"A Distant Mirror uses as its focus the story of a French soldier warring in the Holy Land against the forces of the sultan. It describes his captivity and eventual release. But while the French nobleman's life is described in great detail, he is more importantly a focal point to this extraordinarily researched book about an era in which Europe and the Middle East clashed, with consequences that have impacted future centuries. Altogether an excellent historical work. Required reading for all history students young or old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comes in Swinging","review":"Barbara Tuchman certainly can write a gripping account. It's a worthwhile read if you want an insight into one of the crazier centuries of our history.What makes it almost novel-like at times is that the book follows (mostly) the path of one man: Enguerrand de Coucy, who came across to me as the only double agent to be loved by both sides of a conflict. A Frenchman with deep connections to England, he is the perfect character to focus on for a book concerned largely with the Hundred Years War between France and England.The problem is, Tuchman doesn't handle the Hundred Years War as deftly as she does the Black Death. While her narration of the War devolves into a list of kinglets and mayors, her narration of the Black Death earlier in the book is gripping, scary, even shocking.If only the whole book had been written like that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You'd Hope For","review":"I have my Photoshop 5.5 and sad to say, the Help functions of the softwares proved a lot more helpful than this book.

I have a Sony 3.3MP camera, and I print those pictures directly from the memory stick using a dye-sublimation printer from Sony... absolutely stunning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, Clogs...you get what you pay for I suppose.","review":"I got this for printing from my Olympus 2040Z as I saw good photo reviews but after living with it I'll never buy another Epson. When all the planets alignand you use good paper you get good pics BUT...the clogging drove me crazy.*In my experience* the Epson needed to be used everyday to prevent clogs and/or lackluster colors.I have an HP 855C that was down the basement not used for over a year and it gave me great color as soon as I fired it up.For me.. it just took too much hoping and I wasted too much ink and paper. I want a printer that is reliable and the Epson just fell far short. It is now down the basement packed away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star of frustration","review":"I will never buy epson again. The biggest problem is the nozzles keep getting clogged, missing lines on the black print. This needs repeated head cleaning and I can promise you, your inks runs out just doing this.

THEY STILL CONTINUED TO SELL THE PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I will never recommend this product.I bought one on Jan.21.2002. Up to now,I just print no more than 100 sheets,but I print something often. Recently, I found lines missing from the words, images.Tell the truth, I just can't believe it, only two month time, and the ink is just used about one third.I think I don't want to use any products of EPSON again in the future,especial this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Photos at a Bargain Price!","review":"The Epson 780 is a fine photo and text printer. Photos being it's strong qualities. I recommend using Epson paper, as this product works best using it's own products especially for photo printing. The printer is no speed demon especially when doing photo quality prints with the highest resolution settings, however the results are excellent. Most will not be able to tell the difference between what the Epson puts out, and that of a photo lab. The average time for a 8 1/2\\" X 11\\" photo using premium photo glossy paper with printer set at 2880 dpi is about 14 - 16 minutes... using 5\\" X 7\\" took around 8 minutes. If quality is what you want, and speed isn't a factor, The Epson 780 is a very good choice. Not recommened for office use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uses too much ink!","review":"The unit worked good for a month but used up the color very fast as others have claimed. I changed the color ink ... and it was gone in two weeks even though I printed only 3 full size photos.. After 3 months, the photos being printed were much too dark plus the fact that I kept on seeing bands in the photos which meant that I had to clean the print heads often which also uses more ink. I was satisfied with the Epson 740, but I am very dissatisfied with the 780 and will buy a different color printer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a loud piece of junk","review":"This printer was loud and a real disappointment!!!

It is extremely good value for money & works like a dream ... up to a point. Within 2 weeks of purchase it failed to feed paper. On contacting Epson everything went wrong. Epson probably have some of the WORST customer service available. I waited 3 weeks for a technician to call & repair the machine. Despite repeated appointments having been made to visit my premises under the terms of the guarantee, there were no visits nor phone calls made to apologise or reschedule. I ended up buying another printer - sadly the same model. This too broke down in the same way after 2 months use & Epson failed yet again to keep their appointment to repair it. There is no way I will ever buy an Epson printer again. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the world's first disposable printer","review":"I bought this printer around a year ago and have not been able to print one picture correctly because the nozzles are ALWAYS CLOGGED. I have yet to receive a response to my email to the Epson site for help about this problem. I guess there is no solution so they do not bother to respond. I have also gone thru LOTS of ink compared to my last printer, an hp; so much that I took it in to get it fixed because I thought there had to be something wrong because of the way it eats ink. I usually do research before making a purchase of this type but this time I was in a hurry and took the salesclerk's advice. BIG mistake. Now I will throw this printer away and purchase a different one. (I would feel to guilty even to donate it and thrust its problems on someone else.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good, The Bad, The Epson Photo 780","review":"I can say that I have had two of these printers. Not because I liked them so much, but because they can be very difficult to use. Original purchase was sent back to factory and it's replacement still has the same problems.Worse yet, Print Heads constantly get clogged up and multiple cleanings are necessary to get a descent print.Good photo output when you aren't fighting with the head cleaning feature or changing ink carts. Sorry Epson, I'm going to Hewlett Packard...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink guzzler","review":"This printer really gobbles up ink. Since this is my first photo printer, I can't say how the ink mileage compares with other printers. The first thing you need to do when after installing the printer is to calibrate your printer to match the colors of pictures on your screen (Adobe PhotoDeluxe that came with my digital camera had a function to do this). Unfortunately after I printed only 10 4x6 pages, I have already used up 25% of my color ink which comes out to about $0.50 per pix just for the ink! If you plan to print out a lot of photos it may be more cost effective to go through Ofoto.com rather than purchasing this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clog Monster!","review":"I've had my Epson Photo 780 for 90 days now and am learning to hate it more and more with each passing day. The only saving grace of this printer, is it's color photo output, which is fantastic. Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the constant clogging of the black ink and the way Epson keeps ignoring my requests for relief. I have used nearly as much ink running cleaning cycles as I have printing photos of the kids. Nearly every time I attempt to print a text document I end up having to run cleaning cycles and not just one mind you but as many as 6 or 7. Spare yourself the pain and expense of owning this printer and buy something else like I now wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"big waste of time","review":"I would not recommend this printer at all. The printing quality is great when it works. Guaranteed, the majority of the time something will go wrong with your print, whether it is a feeding problem, or annoying ink splotches on your printout, or faint or faded colors printed. Trust me, i've gone through several Epsons and they've all performed this way. My last Epson died after less than a year. Plus you'll spend a fortune on paper and print cartridges. Frankly, if i worked for Epson i would be ashamed of the lack of durability and the excessive maintenance required for this and their other machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Handbook","review":"The other day I came across \\"Enhancing XSL\\" article on MSDN written by the same author. The author did a great job. The article had good content and flow, and was easy to read. That encouraged me to buy his book.I am equally impressed with his book. It covers quite a bit of XML technology. It has good flow and is easy to read. It has plenty of examples. Thank God, it does not give any coverage to DTDs, like quite a few other XML books in the market. It is pretty much up to date with the XML specs when it comes to XPath, XSL, and Microsoft's XML Parsers. It gives good comparison of the differences in some recent versions of the MSXML. Now the reason I gave four stars is due to the lack of coverage for (a) SAX, and (b) W3C XML Schema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colors slightly different / belt straps don't fit through the holes","review":"The quality of the changing pad is fine, but the colors are SLIGHTLY off from the rest of the set which I didn't understand. If you are ordering this to match other items from the nursery, you'll notice that the colors look a little different eg. olive green polka dots instead of lime green, etc. I purchased another one from another vendor (since I needed a backup anyway) thinking that the colors would match, however, there was no difference. In addition, if you are looking to use it on a standard changing pad cushion, the belt straps do not easily fit through the holes so you may have to rip into the fabric a little to get it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting written account of air travel disaster history.","review":"Mr. Job has created an eye popping accounting of the risks we all assume when boarding a modern jet aircraft. The inclusion of photographs and sketched graphics along with crew conversation transcribed from cockpit recorders drew me into the unfolding disaster as if I was one of the doomed passengers. This work does an effective job of describing the technical analysis of the failed components or the human error induced by the flight crew. I recommend this to the interested laymen and professionals involved in this kind of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Blame","review":"The point of these books is MaCarthurs view that to pin point the cause of a disaster it is counter productive to blame an individual. It takes a number of steps for a disaster to happen. If any of these steps are interrupted the disaster may be averted. He also shows the case for cockpit resource management (CRM) that is, how to use the skills of all to best advantage. CRM is starting to flow into fields such as medicine (So the surgeon pays attention to the nurse telling him his about to cut of the wrong leg)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vol II: Concise, accurate, absolutely the best!","review":"This book whittles away at the NTSB reports to give the reader a concise overview of the major crashes since about 1979. Being not only \\"reader-friendly\\" but also cripping, I was unable to put it down. It explains the details the media ignores, and the results most people never hear since by then the crash is no longer \\"news\\". It reveals the short-comings of all involved, to include aircraft designers, airlines, maintenance crews and the air crew, without being biased. I am anxiously awaiting volume I to arrive in my mail box and am hoping volume III is in the works.

The resolution, contrast, brightness are abysmal in most all of the photographs and look like they were taken with a Brownie camera.

He needs to re-evaluate and re-write this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for ACRC","review":"This book is pretty good for ACRC, but provides only a portion of what you need for BCSN, which is what I passed. In addition to this book, I had to supplement it with papers on routing protocols from Cisco's site.If you haven't purchased an advanced routing book yet, buy a book geared for BCSN. This one is good for ACRC, but ACRC retires July 31, 2000. This book will not adequately prepare for the newer exam. It does not go into near enough depth on BGP, OSPF, or EIGRP to pass BCSN.I believe Todd is working on a newer edition for BCSN, so look for it when it comes out. He knows his Cisco routing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough","review":"This book is not enough for the exam. It does not cover OSPF and EIGRP enough.

It does not contain information on all ACRC topics and skips over huge amounts of material with only brief comments. His writing style is fine but the content is weak. Compare this to Laura Chappels ACRC book and the difference is significant. I bought both, and I would buy this book again---only as a supplement.

Just because they are CCIE's, it seems like they don't care if they write for understanding. I think the writers and publishers want you to buy the book because they have CCIE's writing for them now.

I wouldn't recommend using this book alone to pass the exam and you should get the Cisco Press book as it makes up for shortcomings in this book. Remember, this is one of the real tough exams and hence you shouldn't take chances. The good thing about this book is its simplicity in explaining the concepts.

The positive reviews below are correct in one respect: if you learn the entire book, you'll pass the test.

It's quarter cut so it doesn't just fold in half but again quarter ways which wouldn't have been so bad, except, that it's just cut like someone took scissors to it half way down to make it fit in the box. Really, you pull it out and you have this game board that just flops around everywhere and doesn't lay nice and flat so it's a horrible experience to play on. Had it for one hour and it went right into the dumpster - too ashamed of it's shoddiness to give it to the poor. Don't be taken in and don't waste your money.

For one it's the Misfits with Glenn Danzig, one of the best vocalists in punk, not to mention most of rock as well. His voice is very similair to Jim Morrison in my opinion. If you want to see why I compare the two, listen to \\"Devil's Plaything\\" by Danzig. Amazing. Secondly, the packaging on this box set is to die for. Like the person before has said, it comes in a laminated black coffin with a red interior, plus a Fiend Club pin. Not only that, but it comes with a rather large in-depth book of lyrics, which have pictures as the backdrop. Most of these pictures you will NOT see online either, so it's almost worth it to spend all the money on the box set for that. Third, there are SOO many Misfits classics on here you'll be busy for quite a while. I myself listen to tons of music, and I set aside a FULL YEAR just listening to the 4 discs of this box set.If you don't have it now, you should.

Don't waste time or money buying all the individual cd's. just buy the box set and \\"walk among us\\" that should keep most people pretty happy. All the \\"earth AD\\" fans will finally get a taste of the lounge side of the Misfits with the original 7\\" versions of \\"cough cool\\" and \\"she\\". Both are great! One more small gripe, \\"where eagles dare\\" is one of my favorites, but there are no less than 5 versions in this set, they could have used the space to include the tracks that were omitted.

The defense is smartly designed and the baserunning is much smoother, both in execution and in response, than the EA model. About the only part of this game that is still \\"in review\\" for me is the hitting. It's hard to hit, period. Scoring is at a real premium. I've found more power capability in this game than in MVP, but the basic art of making contact is more difficult in MLB 2005.

If they combined this feature with MVP baseball it would be the best game ever invented. My advice do not rent this game.

The Canon is lightning fast. Even at it's highest resolution settings. The Epson is painstakingly slow at any setting other than draft mode. I was really hoping the Epson would work out for me, but no such luck. I'm returning the Epson and re-purchasing the Canon i9100.

I have found no difference between the 2800dpi and 1400dpi settings, even when I magnify the prints. If you are serious about color I would suggest getting an ICC profile program to keep the color consistent with your monitor, it will save you countless hours of color balancing the printer.I have used this printer for about 6 months now and there are currently other better Epson printers on then market, although if you are on a budget this one will do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"After several months of research I decided to purchase Epson's Sytlus Photo 1280 printer.

It seems that Mr. Anthony is trying to delve into serious writing and moving away from the fun, fast paced writing he is used to. This book is dull, I kept turning pages hoping to get to the good part of the story. Personally I think this book is better left on the shelf, or better yet, never been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't it strange ?","review":"Even though I didn't read the book yet, but from the review that I saw it is kind of like the series spellsong cycle of Modesitt L.

That's no world for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The book *looked* interesting. Unfortunately the plot, what there was of it, dragged and the characters were uninteresting.

I expected the \\"tackle box\\" to be flimsy, but I did not expect it to arrive already cracked. The top of the box had four large cracks in it upon arrival, including one over its entire width. The box was packaged for shipment just fine, and there was no obvious damage or other signs of rough handling on the shipping carton, so this led me to wonder if the box was cracked BEFORE it was shipped. I never expected the box to be durable enough to actually carry the tackle on fishing trips, but I was at least expecting that it could serve as a storage / organizer box. No such luck.

The low used-book price reflect its value.","review":"Despite the several negative reviews, I bought this book, hoping that the one five-star review might actually be right. However, after carefully reading through 6 chapters and browsing through the entire book, I had to agree with the negative reviews. There were no code examples on the website before Chapter 5 (the author claimed to have). The sample code for Chapter 9 Shell APIs - Launching Applications was a mess. It simply didn't realize most of the functions it claimed to be able to realize, and it had many errors (e.g., missing class modules). It seemed like the three examples in Chapter 9 were badly bundled together.There are a lot of unnecessary underscores (_ for continuation of code) in the code examples - seems to be an effort to make the book longer and sell for more money.In conclusion, this book is just an MSDN dump.

It is then hoped the listener will go out and find the original material, and then you would see that this is a pallid imitation. When you realize this band's best cover is a Neil Diamond tune on a CD with Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff songs, you see how authentic UB40 really is. To their credit, just due is given to the original artists in the liner notes. If you like this CD do yourself a favor, and listen to the original recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE LISTENING PLEASURE","review":"I grew up listening to reggae, and love any form out on the market, so its not difficult to Class UB40 as one of my all time favourite bands.No they are not original, but the cover versions they play have there very own unique flavour, one I wholeheartedly enjoy. My favourite song would have to be Version Girl, its so pleasing on the ear that you cant help but love it, Ali Campbells smooth vocals seem to slide around you closing your eyes to enjoy it further.If you want to listening to something thats not going to destroy your eardrums or make you puke with sentiment then this easy listening CD is definately for you, sit back relax and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back many memories","review":"I received this album on CD as a gift way, way back in 1992.

I'd have to say that both are equally brilliant. Whether cruising down the road on a sunny day or frustrated with the same-old, same-old on the radio, this disc hits the spot! I was told that I wouldn't like this volume because it was more reggae than Labour of Love II, but that turned out to be incredibly wrong. There's tracks every bit as enjoyable as \\"The way you do the things you do\\". \\"She caught the train\\" and \\"Version girl\\" are a couple of my favorites. Ali Campbell is a talented singer and the group has wonderful chemistry. I'm a little disappointed with Labour of Love III, though. It's no where near the same level as the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"UB lovin' this album.","review":"Some may be tempted to get the \\"best of\\" because of its length, but this first \\"Labour Of Love\\" is hard to beat. This disc runs a perfect 40 minutes, and every song brings good vibrations. Of course their biggest hit is on here, the cover of \\"Red Red Wine\\", and it is the full version with the rap. But I also love \\"Cherry Oh Baby\\", \\"She Caught The Train\\", and the excellent and moving \\"Please Don't Make Me Cry\\". Every other track is a pleasure as well. The other two \\"Labour Of Love\\" discs are good also, but this is easily the best.

This album is an excellent representation of Morgan Heritage's range, versatility, and talent. If you love roots reggae with a hint of R&B; and a dash of Hip & Hop then this album is for you.As Reggae fans know, reggae is for all ears (if you just listen). This album is no exception. For example, my brother in-law from Bolivia visited me here in the states and he doesn't speak English nor has he ever heard reggae however, when he heard this CD in my car he absolutely fell in love and begged me for a copy of this CD.The grooves are great, the vocals are beautiful and the message is strong. I highly recommend this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and boring","review":"In this latest offering, Morgan Heritage reasserts their formula of \\"safe\\" pop-reggae designed to be commercially viable in markets outside the Caribbean.As evidenced by the R&B; tracks, the electric guitar riffs, and the appearance of Bounty Killer on the final cut, it seems as though the producers are trying hard to reach the broadest audience possible. My mistake, I thought I was listening to a reggae album.On the bright side, highlights include the catchy, uptempo \\"Hail Up the Lion\\" and the dancehall remix of \\"U've Got Me\\".For a band whose 1994 debut LP was glaringly mediocre, coming \\"full circle\\" is nothing to celebrate.

I have always thought that the 5th star should be reserved for the bands earlier offerings, but aside from Simmonds doing his own vocals, if you didn't know better, you may well think this one came from that era. Kim really gets to the point and shows off his guitar work in a way that may have been missing from some of his more recent releases. This is a high energy blues/rock showcase. I would love to supply you with a list of the best songs from this release, but I would have to list each one. They are all fantastic! New fan, old fan, buy this c.d. You will not regret it.

Closys uses only stabilized chlorine dioxide which is, in fact, not chlorine dioxide at all--it is buffered sodium chlorite. Buffered sodium chlorite is activated by the addition of an acid and that forms chlorine dioxide. But the problem is that this only remains stable for about 48 hours.I proved this by adding vinegar to the Closys solution and it turned a yellowish color, THAT is chlorine dioxide and that is what you get in Profresh. I don't recommend anyone do this because if you add too much acid you can cause decomposition to a hazardous gas. I just wanted to prove the point to myself.If you want to kill bacteria it is activated chlorine dioxide that you want and Profresh is probably a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work Too Well","review":"After reading all the previous positive reviews, it influenced me to purchase the Closys Oral Rinse.

I can't believe other reviewers rate the product so high??? Luckily, I found a much better product called ProFresh.

A memorable event.The book built around the exhibit takes an understanding of Impressionism much deeper, involving not only personalities and landscapes, but also the international political dynamics as well. Who would have thought of Impressionism as a French nationalistic statement?There is far too much in the book to go into, even if I was an art expert (which I am not).

The only downside to it is the short battery life, but nonetheless, even if I didn't get it for Christmas, I can envision myself buying this. I found ourselves recharging it twice just for a little flight time. I probably didn't even need to be charged that much to fly the same amount. It's fun though when chases you.

It flew way higher than box said it would. It was awesome, and surprisingly easy to land. I love this toy.

I don't however, have 8 D batteries just laying around for the charger, so i've had to scavenge and have never charged it with all new batteries. so now i'm not sure if the batteries in the charger are the problem or if the onboard battery is the problem. because i havent been able to get it off the ground for a while. if you can get it cheap, thats good, but if you don't live to fly then full price is not your cup of tea. i hope someone reads this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable & informative","review":"I found this book not only very informative & funny.

Rather than considering this a work about \\"whining,\\" I took seriously the idea that housework is something that is expected of women (when a house dirty, most often the woman of the house is seen as responsible). Housework is also something that never ends--the same tasks are done day after day, week after week. Yet housework also makes people feel they can bring a sense of order and pride into their lives, so it can be therapeutic as well. Perhaps there are no male-authored poems because men don't have the omnipresent cultural connection to (seen any commercials for cleaning products lately?)and responsibility for housework. Regardless, the book is a great exploration of the many connections women have to the home and their families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh","review":"Although many women do identify with housework, and obviously some women have written poems about it, the very juxtaposition of women and housework is a dangerous one, in my opinion.

Danzig shouts and growls more than he croons. It is undoubtedly a change of pace from their other releases, but this does not mean it is not worth the listen. While I would not really recommend this album to new fans or skeptics of the punk genre, for fans of metal and hardcore, completists, and true fiends, Earth A.D. is a highlight of their record collections. In the scope of hardcore punk, this album is one of the toughest and most timeless. For myself and many others, \\"Die, Die My Darling\\" is the climax of the album, but every track is a dark, fast, cutthroat, and fun all at once. They are bursts of hell-raising energy; they explode like atomic bombs. Though the Misfits' sound may have gone through a transformation for this final masterpiece, their spirit was steadfast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album but not the best for the misfits.","review":"First of all I have to say I haven't listened to the CD.

Buy those 2 CDs and you will have all of the 'Earth AD' EP (and a WHOLE lot more).Secondly, IMHO, this is the worst of the Danzig-era Misfits. Sure, the songs are fast and furious, but it's pretty much just straight forward hardcore. On this release, the band chose speed over substance. Gone are the memorable lyrics and catchy melodies; Danzig opts to unintelligibly scream rather than sing on this release. In many ways it just doesn't feel like the Misfits to me; what I love most about them seems absent here. With the exception of 'Green Hell', 'Die, Die My Darling' and 'Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight', I find myself quite bored listening to this.In any event, this CD should be for 'completeists' only."},{"rating":"1","title":"YECCHHH!","review":"This Misfits album is a far cry from the excellence of Walk Among Us and Static Age.

I enjoyed the novel immensely as it comprised of ups and downs, and looking back at it, I can't really point out one part which might have been better than the other.

In other words, your getting hi-fi sound at an incredible price. One great feature it has is auto shut off. The only thing that is annoying is the remote control.

I also like the 5.5\\" x 8.25\\" size and the ring binder format. Ideally someone will come up with a book that will cover every question on section 7 GMDSS Operator and section 9 GMDSS Maintainer of the FCC exams with an explaination of the answer. Until then this book will about as good as any out there! I've been studying for a couple of weeks now and currently at about a 80-85% level on the practice tests. This book has definitely helped explain quite a few of the questions and I fully expect to get up to the 90+% level next week and take both tests.

It is neither insightful, nor entertaining. This book has absolutely nothing to do with ettiquette and everything to do with the pet peeves of the authors. It is shallow, condescending and vapid. There are far superior books on the market. The Fabulous Girl's guide to Decorum is just one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome snobbery","review":"It's difficult to like this book. Its high-handed, faux-breezy tone is irritating, and the knowledge contained within is highly idiosyncratic. The Etiquette Grrls, a dubious concept in itself, are reminiscent of a gaggle of snide teens snickering at those they consider socially inferior. I found it hard to imagine that anyone would need to know anything in this book. The rationale behind the writing of it seems to be the authors' wish to celebrate publicly the most mundane details of their own lives. Intensely self-indulgent, the book contains little or no useful information. Activites like randomly punctuating words and posing with one's Kate Spade bag seem less related to etiquette than to a supremely adolescent process of self-discovery reliant on the illusion of nonconformity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifestyle book, not etiquette","review":"Make no mistake, this is a lifestyle book, not an etiquette book. Although extremely humorous and fun to read, it is 90% attitude and only 10% etiquette. How can you learn good manners from people who tell you \\"grits is NOT a food\\" -- indeed, good manners would suggest that you keep your food preferences to yourself. One should never make fun of other people's food, musical tastes, or clothing. Their self-congratulatory snot-princess style is grating. I'm at a loss for how mean-spirited, snobby spewings can be passed off as etiquette. If only \\"Miss Manner's Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior\\" was still in print!

The grrls are the type of people who give etiquette a bad name. An etiquette expert should be someone you'd be delighted to have at your next party, not someone so vicious that you wouldn't want even to speak to her. The grrls focus on style and personal opinions and manage to break some very fundamental etiquette rules. Don't buy this book.

Their take on smokers and how they usually are the wittiest of the party obviously means that these young women are smokers too.This book is full of generalizations making their opinions seem ridiculous. Although they state the proper place-setting and the appropriate dress, a person can get those lessons without the pretentiousness and discourteous behavior. I just find it interesting that the inappropriate behavior admonished by these young women is oozed out of almost every paragraph in this book.Don't waste your time or your money buying this book.

In the time that it took me to go in the house to get the sunblock, the ball was torn. As for the smell, there was nothing whatsoever reminiscient of peanut butter. There was a very strong chemical smell, VERY strong, but not even a hint of peanut-y goodness. I didn't go so far as to chew on it, so I can't say that it didn't taste of peanut butter...but it seems highly unlikely.

I can honestly see why this album did not give them a hit. First of all, There are only 3 songs on this album that I can actually stand. But those 3 songs alone don't give this album a hit. Second of all, they seem to have kind of a different sound then their previous album. This album sounds more cheesy R&B and very little Minneapolis sound to it. I reccomend their first album!

Some of the best on here are \\"Teenage angst\\", \\"36 degrees\\", \\"Nancy boy\\" , and \\"Bruise pristine\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect? almost. Addicting? Definitely.","review":"The most major difference between Placebo and Without You I'm Nothing is that the band's first, self-titled CD didn't create enough waves in the US. Without You I'm Nothing, however, caught my eyes on MTV, so I bought that CD first. After a little fan research I found out (gasp) that they had another CD and by then I was hooked, so I rushed out to buy it. I'm glad I did because Placebo is definitely a good cd despite that it is somewhat hidden in WYIN's shadow. If you have ever heard any songs by Placebo and enjoyed them, you will love both CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"pop rocks","review":"Few bands make such a startling debut but thats exactly what placebo have done here.

I think these toys are very fun and educational because you can care for them , walk,trot,canter(slope) and even gallop them!

Because of how my horse chipped (and my freinds horses leg broke) I would'nt recamend giving these horses to cildren under 3 (the leg or any part of the horses body could break and be swallowed) or anyone who might play ruffly with there toys.

I love that song and I know that in Europe and throughout the UK it was played on radio stations and made it to the singles charts. The other song that I thought would be on there also came from Invincible was \\"Don't Fight it Baby\\" which I heard briefly in the US before it fell off the charts.

I was impressed with the sound, unimpressed by the fact that the 1st LP was a bit warped. The \\"jet intro\\" to BITUSSR had an annoying scratch and there were quite a few pops all the way thru side 1. Didn't even bother taking the 2nd LP out of the sleeve.

A little bit of everything is here from the studio wizards that stretched the musical limitations of rock more than anybody.To \\"music fan\\" from Sweden, there are no bad tracks here. Could you possibly decide for everybody, what songs to exclude (besides \\"Revolution No. 9\\"), never to be heard, to make this a single album? Stick to the \\"Red\\" and the \\"Blue\\" albums - you seem to want a best of anyway. And to \\"music fan\\" from Strawberry Fields (I doubt it), McCartney ...Pop FLUFF?

I have heard rumors that most of these songs were done by each Beatle seperately and that Eric Clapon played guitar on many of Harrison's cuts.

No respectable music critic would ever subscribe to the theory that the Beach Boys had a more profound impact on music than the Beatles. (PS - Sorry about all the long words.)

They could do anything in the recording studio. And that's what I find so sad about the Beatles. They couldn't reproduce their truly good music live. No concerts after 1966! That's just ridiculous and unacceptable for a rock band. And it's why I don't care for this album. While some of the music may sound good, I can't get over the fact that I know it was never performed live. That's a travesty. The recorded music is only a small part of what being a rock band is about. Being a great live band is entirely something else. The Rolling Stones. Led Zeppelin. The Who. These are great live bands. The Beatles just hid for half their existence. That's not acceptable. They can't be ranked with the absolute best like The Who since they couldn't get themselves out of the studio. It's sad. Maybe things would have sounded great live. But we'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as today's music","review":"I don't understand all the fuss about this album.

Peppers\\". The Beatles, poor musicians, rely heavily upon studio technology to polish their work. One could argue that producer George Martin is far more valuable then talentless drummer Ringo Starr. The Beatles never really toured after their early days, and there was no edge to their music. They only could write bubble gum pop songs like the hideous \\"Rocky Racoon\\". On the other hand, the Stones would never write such drivel. Their classic \\"Exile on Main St.\\" not only eclipses every Beatle album ever made, but every album ever made period. I am willing to challenge every Beatle fan on this one. I will go as far to say that the Stones \\"Emotional Rescue\\" is better then \\"Abbey Road\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Next 35 Years Would Have Been Fine","review":"No, it's hardly \\"why the next 35 years happened\\", in fact music was being taken on a different and better track by the artists who released the breakthough albums of the previous year.

You would have the greatest album IN ALL OF ROCK HISTORY.I am not kidding. They were so musicaly tight and expressive by the time they reached this album. \\"Dear Prudence\\" is simply \\"AMAZING\\". My alltime favorite Beatles song. And \\"Revolution\\", \\"Rocky Racoon\\", \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"Birthday\\" \\"My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" & \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" are musical masterpieces.

Well, the funny thing about it is, there is some Montovani crap on this record, but it is on a Lennon song. This had to have been a joke.It always cracks me up when people disparage the solo McCartney stuff and then give this record rave reviews. If you like novelty songs, buy this cd. Otherwise borrow it and record the five or six good songs. George Martin is said to have pushed for this to be a single album. He had it half right. There are enough good songs on this to make one side of an album.

Many kids peeled the white cover to shreds on the rumor that the nude photo was actually underneath (and we played Revolution #9 backwards on the turntable to hear if it said \\"Paul is Dead.\\" We did a lot of dumb stuff.)This is absolutely one of my favorite of all Beatle albums, especially for the guitar work in \\"Blackbird\\" and the quirky tunes like \\"Rocky Raccoon.\\" There's also the bluesy \\"Why don't we do it in the road\\" which was pretty rude back then (no gangsta rap in the Sixties.)

It is the most diverse, interesting and well crafted album ever made. The songs range from rock to country to surfer rock to heavy metal to folk to camp to progressive to the just plain weird. The unparelled songwriting genius of Lennon and McCartney is well on display here as is their obvious differences in style. Harrison also emerges on the White Album and showcases his best song ever \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". Some may point to \\"Sgt Pepper\\" as the Beatles crowning achievement, I point directly and emphatically to the White Album.Best tracks: While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Helter Skelter, Dear Prudence, Back in the USSR, Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey, Happiness is a Warm Gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Deserves To Be A Double LP","review":"This record is absolute brilliance.

It's repackaged, not remastered. Finally Capitol has admitted as much. Get the original release and at least have a better protective case.

We all know the music is 5 stars, but the marketing edition gets a zero for raw greed.Amazon's review might do some research and resubmit its evaluation.

This album is not my favorite (that goes to Revolver), but the range of songs and styles never ceases to amaze. I'll spare you all a track by track review (with nearly 900 reviews, someone's already done that), but suffice to say the tracks range from brilliant (While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Mother Nature's Son, Julia) to \\"oh no, there they go again\\" (Revolution 9, Wild Honey Pie, Why Don't We Do It In Road). My personal fave is Yer Blues, maybe the only song on the album when they were all in the same room at the same time.

Anyone who was a good listener AT THE TIME would have noticed that many of the songs (most) are good natured spoofs of then current popular artists;(besides the obvious Beach Boys put on, they have Long, Long, Long (Bee Gees), Mother Nature's Son (Donovan) Helter Skelter (guitar groups, Hendrix in particular), Rocky Racoon (Dylan), Why Dont We Do It In The Road (Tommy James' 'I Think We're Alone Now' reference to 'tumbling to the ground,' etc.) Of course there is original stuff here also, and very good stuff it is! But the point is that this album isnt such a grand work of pop art as some might think, and , with the exception of a few songs-- I'm So Tired being a good example-- this dbl lp was a bit of a toss off that distinguishes itself less on quality than on quantity, variety and it's non-threatening facade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lennon turns in his grave","review":"John Lennon must turn in his grave every time someone plays this album or another insane Beatles' fan defends it. This album is obviously all over with Paul's influences. And that's what makes it complete trash. Paul McCartney never had any vision. John did, but you can see that they tried to keep him out of the loop on this album. That's why it's full of long, meaningless, ridiculous songs that don't deserve to be called Beatles stuff. I'm shocked and dismayed that people defend this album the way they do. You people must have had a horrfying adult life to feel that you need to hold on to the lost dreams of your childhood that made you think the Beatles were great. And don't come back at me with some garbage saying that I'm too young to understand. I'm 41 years old. I was around when the Beatles were. I never liked them. I want music that means something.

Conversely, there are two other 1-star albums in the remaining 20 tracks that overshadow it. Altogether it averages out to 2-stars. Don't portray Revolution 9, Long Long Long or Good Night as innovative and insightful music. It's not. That's not say you shouldn't buy it for the good songs, but it doesn't make it a 5-star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The song","review":"The track is 'Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey' by Paul McCartney.

There are beautiful ballads such as \\"Long, Long, Long\\", \\"I Will\\", \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", and \\"I'm so tired\\". There are amusing songs like \\"Rockie Raccoon\\", \\"Savoy Truffle\\", \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\\", and \\"Honey Pie\\".

They could have cleaned up the individual tracks and really made a difference with \\"The Beatles\\" but they didn't.The mid period albums have shown the greatest improvement from remastering.

The beatles are definitly the only artists in history who have put together a double LP and not have a single piece of filler. Happiness is a Warm Gun, Revolution 1, Blackbird, Cry Baby Cry, etc are all some of the best songs I have ever heard.The white album easily beats Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road and Let It Be. The only thing wrong with the album would be the track-order on disc 1 (ie following While my guitar... with Happiness is a Warm Gun seems like a definite no no). Other than that though, its perfect and disc 2 moves flawlessly.It took some time for me to decide to buy the white album (just because of the high cost) but I am now very glad I did.

Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy had just been assassinated, the war in Vietnam was raging, and America was on the verge of major social change. So when the Beatles self-titled double-LP arrived in its plain white packaging, it wasn't a moment too soon.Never before had a rock record been so schizophrenic. The White Album had silly singalongs, dirge-like ballads, social commentary, love songs, lullabies, and even gospel. And it ran the whole gamut of styles: rock, folk, string-quartet, metal, soul, pop, neo-classical, country, blues, dance, and the avant-garde. But this was truly the Beatles best and most heartfelt recording. There are very few albums like this today. This is well worth the money, and suggested for teens just getting into the group.KEY TRACKS: While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Happiness Is A Warm Gun, Long Long Long"},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T FRET ABOUT EXTRACTING THE CDs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"PLEASE USE YOUR HEADS WHEN REMOVING THE CDs!

I don't think they're anywhere near as \\"influential\\" as everybody says they were. They were just juvenile acting, silly looking, and musically amateurish. Their success had more to do with marketing than anything else. I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of \\"Not Helpful\\" votes from all you Beatles loving hippies, but somebody has to speak out against the BEatles. All the praise and respect they get is completely undeserved, because they had no talent. All they did was dress in silly looking clothes, silly looking hairstyles, and whip togeather 3 or 4 chords and add a bunch of brainless lyrics over them. No talent there.

I've heard five of the new versions, Beatles for Sale, Past Masters, Revolver, The Beatles, and Abbey Road, and this one and Abbey Road sound the best, although they are all much improved from the previous 1987 vintage CD's.

Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour songs, but they are better than the other songs on the White Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beatles 1967","review":"I guess I don't really need another reviewer to interpret what the Beatles intended, or how songs were supposed to sound relative to one another. I really don't like songs like Wild Honey Pie, Revolution #9 or Rocky Raccoon. I think this album is a bit of a clean out of the closet. It's too bad, because while there was an abundance of songs on this album, there is a shortage of completed work on Abbey Road.Unless someone was in the studio with the band, it's pretty arrogant to claim to know what was intended - I can ASSURE you.2 stars, and I'm being generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Lyrics, and awesome songwritting","review":"The White album is an example of the Beatles at their finest. Their driving rock and light bittersweet folk songs revolutionized(literally) rock. Some critics have labeled songs such as \\"Rocky Racoon\\" and \\"Revolution 9\\" as fillers. However, I consider these songs, as well as \\"Honey Pie\\" and \\"I will\\", to be an example of the Beatles unending creativity and range. Put simply, The White Album changed rock. It is a marker that all other rock albums will be compared to."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Beatles\\" aka \\"The White Album\\" sounding better than ever!","review":"I am floored, I just listened to the 2009 Stereo Remaster of \\"The Beatles\\" aka \\"The White Album\\" and WOW!

On the \\"White Album\\" the band steps away from their own image not just to explore new avenues, but to create new roads.

Too bad there wasn't room for George's \\"Not Guilty\\" and his acoustic version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" Regardless of its flaws, \\"The White Album\\" is a remarkably diverse collection. A special nod to Paul's unlisted (and unpublished) \\"Can You Take Me Back?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"TYPICAL BEATLES...GREAT!!!!","review":"The Beatles were true musical innovators and thus changed the landscape forever. This album is just another example of this most diversified group of musicians.

Wow, that was one of the best desicions I've ever made. The Beatles are really at their peak. John delivers knock out hits like Dear Prudence, I'm So Tired, Glass Onion, Yer Blues, Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey, and Revolution. Paul also gets in some classic tracks like Back in the USSR, Blackbird, and Birthday. George also debuts While My Guitar Gently Weeps, which is one of my favorite George songs of all time. The thing about this cd is, it caters to whatever mood you are in. There is blues, rock, kid music, and a raw . anthem (Why Don't We Do it in the Road). The only thing I didn't care for was Revolution 9 which is just a bunch of weird John and Yoko tape loops. If you can look past that, The White Album is a fine purchase worthy of being in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"No album collection is complete without this!!","review":"Diverse, clever, rocking, sentimental, moody, uncompromising, brilliant, brilliant and brilliant!

They feel empowered to try just about anything -- both from a song structure perspective as well as stylistically. Marred only occasionally by a bit of laziness (three blues tunes?) and the periodic shock value experiment, the rest of the work exudes an ease and confidence that makes it a joy to listen to.Favorites include Ob-la-di (Has to be one of the most pure joyful songs and performances every written) and Blackbird (Lovely song and arrangement)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaotic & Unique Masterpiece","review":"The White Album is a singularly gripping musical experience. There certainly is filler littered throughout the record, but all the filler has a purpose, contributing to the overall feel of the album. Furthermore, the filler isn't so much filler as it is disconnected ideas, all executed brilliantly and elaborately. No idea, not even the minute-long dissonant rant \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" or the simple vamp \\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road,\\" tis simply thrown away -- it's milked of all of its possibilities. it was nearly as influential as Sgt.

You may choose \\"eclectic\\". Or perhaps \\"brilliant\\". The word I choose is \\"masterpiece\\". The White Album is my favorite Beatles album. Why? Because never before or since has an album been created with such a sprawling, diverse, fantastic collection of songs with mind-blowing lyrics and brilliant arrangement. I could get into how I feel about each song, but there are just too many. Instead, let me tell you which songs are the best. Some I like because they are beautiful. Others are great rockers. Some make you think. Some make you crank up the stereo and play air guitar. My personal favorites are as follows:Back in the USSRGlass OnionOb-La-Di Ob-La-DaWhile My Guitar Gently WeepsHappiness is a Warm GunI'm So TiredBlackbirdPiggiesRocky RaccoonJuliaBirthdayEverybody's got something to hide...Helter SkelterLong, Long, LongDo yourself a favor and get this album.

This two disc set has been remastered. The sound quality is excellent. Lennon's Dear Prudence, Happiness Is A Warm Gun, and Cry Baby Cry are my favorites. Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps(with Eric Clapton)is also great rock. I received the Lp for Christmas in 1968 and still have a copy on vinyl. This is one of the classic albums in rock history and belongs in every rock collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of pressing is HORRIBLE","review":"This is my second coopy and although better still not good.

I listened to this afetr buying Sgt. Pepper's and magical Mystery Tour, probably the two most psychadelic Beatles albums. I was expecting much the same, but my predictions were totally groundless. The songs are eclectic, but highs include \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"Happiness is a warm gun\\", and Harrison's single greatest song \\"While my guitar gently weeps\\". However, having loved disc one, disc two was slightly more disapponiting, seemingly containing mostly filler, and a few low key rock songs. It's still a simply mind blowing classic, but maybe it could have been slimmed down a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of The Beatles","review":"No doubt, this album is the best of the band. Man, it rocks! I cannot name the best tracks on it, cause it's all great together! This album is for those, who didn't like Help or A Hard Day's Night too much.

After all,Opera and Classical music with all its refinement and history is only enjoyed by an enlightened few. I put the White Album in this catagory.Although some what dated by todays standards, the White Album will always be remembered as the conceptual album of the late 60's. From it's pervocative and sometimes ominious lyrics, it defied all standards by which we viewed music...and the world. From \\"Reveloution\\" for the wars in Vietnam and Biafria to the \\"Helter Skelter\\" of a madman,this album will have an everlasting impact long after the pop songs have died from the radio.In summation, this is not an Album for White Snake fans but for those who immerse themselves into the music and hear much more than is on the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waster Your Money","review":"Wait until the master tapes are used with 24 bit mastering this cd adds nothing over the older CD version.

John couldn't even read music! yet, he managed to produce some of the most amazing rock songs EVER! This album is an absolute gem, John, Paul, and George really display their song-writing abilities.

At this point, John met Yoko, Ringo quit for awhile, George gained confidence, the Maharishi incident, the group beginning to splinter... quite a lot going on in such a short time frame. I've read a lot about the creation of this album and still listen to this repeatedly as one of my favorites. I'm continuously discovering new things in it even though the music is so familiar. Hopefully they will get around to remastering this and perhaps include some additional packaging elements as they did with Sgt Pepper.

It unquestionably comes from the same source. Capitol/EMI either messed up, or they are lying big time. For example, listen to While My Guitar Gently Weeps on the 1967-1970 CD, and compare it to the regular White Album CD. The 67-70 set is remastered - Sounds beautiful, and better than the White Album version! Now compare the same song on the Regular White Album to the Remastered White Album. They're identical! So...if you already have the White Album DO NOT waste your money on this issue.If CAPITOL/EMI were smarter than cattle, they would have released the MONO edition of this ablum which is highly sought after due to all of the differences it contains."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least my Mother's Gravy used to move about","review":"Having a modest but effective sound system I was surprised to be not impressed by this version of my fave Beatles LP.It sounds lumpen, bass laden and somehow charmless.

Whoever is in control of the quality control of CD manufacturing for the US market is not doing their job. Every copy I tried has the same defect. At the 3:24 mark of the song Revolution 1, it hits 3:24 twice, giving the song a third beat at that point. I am surprised no one else has reported this.

But the likes of Revolution 9 and Wild honey Pie keep me from giving this one five stars. It's a great album, just skip over those two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-OWN ALBUM","review":"A classic. Everything great about the Beatles can be found here. Yes, it is a self-indulgent album with several tracks that would have not sat right on any other one of their records.

Simply one of the great rock albums of all-time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I'd like to say this is a truly amazing piece of work. This album is definitely the Beatles' crowning achievement. Every song is great and each song has its own distinct style. Each song has its own flavor and individuality. There are 30 totally different tunes on the same album! That kind of work can be done only by the Beatles, the best band that have ever walked on the face of the earth. This album is one of the best albums of all time, surpassed only by Revolver and The Velvet Underground and Nico."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album but needs some cutting done on it.","review":"I agree with George Martin when he says the White Album should have half of it thrown away. If The Beatles took the strongest songs on the album and issued them as a single LP, then it would pass \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" as their best work. As it stands now I rate it behind \\"Revolver\\", \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".

I many times held this album in my hands at the record-store before I finally decided that it would probobly be worth all the money it cost and so I bought it. And yes, it was, and is, a great album, a very Beatles-ish album, occasionally a strong songwriting/singing/instrumenatal-effort. My instant favourites were \\"Martha My Dear\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Happiness...\\" and of course the Lennon-classic \\"I'm So Tired\\". But there are many more. Many good songs except these. But then there are the 'not-so-good' songs which makes you a bit disappointed. These are, in particular, \\"Why don't we do it in the road?\\", \\"Everybody's got something to hide...\\" and \\"Julia\\". But still it holds up, and is one of the Beatles' finest moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains some of the less publicized classics","review":"I really enjoy listening to this album and thoroughly enjoy about five tracks.

Granted there are about 4 classics on here that you should just download for .99 Cents but the rest don't waste your hard earned cash.

There are far too many bad tracks on it (John and Paul had problems putting it together. There should have been 14 songs in the beginning but they thought that there was too many good songs that they couldn't decide which to put on. So they took em all.) The main point is that we could have been without half of the songs. The strongest ones are \\"while my guitar gently weeps\\", \\"martha my dear\\", and the first revolution-song (isn't \\"no.9\\" the worst song ever recorded?) and \\"helter skelter\\". Crap.

Those who don't own it, or those who dislike it are very deprived. Most of my songs are based off of songs from this record (among a few others), and it takes artists around 15 records to do what The Beatles did on the White Album. Without this album, the world of music would be a very dull one indeed.How come NO ONE ever mentions \\"Long Long Long?\\" True it comes after the bombast of \\"Helter Skelter,\\" but it's a haunting ballad by George Harrison and easily one of his best songs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Beatle album of all.","review":"The Beatles White Album is one of the best albums of all time,Johns voice on Dear Prudence , Julia, is worth the money alone.This album stands out today as it did in 1968. To all Beatle fans and new ones , this is a must have for your collection..Rick Anderson."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-side myself","review":"I can't believe that the Beatles had the nerve to release such a load of garbage. As a Beatles fan, it hurts me. I felt nauseaous the first time I listened to this album all the way through. There are 30 songs on the White Album. Maybe three of them are of the usual, high Beatles quality. I'm so sick and tired of bands releasing albums that aren't worthy of themselves. And the Beatles started it all with this travesty. Songs like \\"Good Night\\" and \\"Long, Long, Long\\" have no business being on anything except a b-sides album. It's shocking that they ever released this whole thing. Beatles fans shouldn't even bother to defend this album. We should stand as far back from it as possible. Oh, well. Obladi, Oblada, life goes on. But if you want a real double album, check out the Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beatles","review":"I am a longtime fan of rock music, but I don't believe that the Beatles were the best rock band ever. They used to rock up through A Hard Day's Night and Help, but then went down the road of easy listening and pop.This album is OK. It has 10 good songs, which I wish were all on one CD, and I wish the other 20 songs were on a separate CD so I wouldn't have to keep skipping over them.Gems like Back in the USSR are great, but there is a lot of mediocrity here. 10 songs out of 30 = 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"White=empty!","review":"Where's the beef? is all I have to say about this album. It's like cotton candy -- a lot there, but there's no substance, and it's not good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I like some of the things that the Beatles tried on this album. Creative. But it just doesn't work. It's way out of line. I've got a right mind to go to the music gods about the White Album, but I don't have their number. My problems with this album are two. First, there is no hard guitar on the album. Calling Helter Skelter hard is like calling Kenny G. rock and roll. Or like saying hardcore porn is high art. It doesn't work, people! Second, I'm offended that some other reviewers would say that the state of music today is poor. As long as Jimmy Page and Robert Plant are alive, everything can't be all lost. But my point is that music was just as much dictated by the record companies in the 60s as it is now. The Beatles were a product. Some of their product was better than others. And the White Album should have made it into the rejected bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles White Album","review":"I wanted to complete my collection of Beatles albums and I was told no collection was complete without the White Album. I was dissappointed, sounded like the Beatles were doing heavy drugs at the time of the release of this album. With the exception of a few known hits, the rest of the album is a waste. I wish I could return it for the Best of the Moody Blues! - RB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains A Great Album","review":"There is a great album buried within the White Album. About 12 songs should have been on this release and the rest relegated to the Anthology series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of The Beatles","review":"This is the greatest beatles album ever it has such great songs from revolution to happeness is a warm gun, I have all of the beatles albums and this is by far the one I listen to the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles","review":"I don't think it's possible for any group of musicians to ever come anywhere near The Beatles. This album is one of the most cleverly done that i've ever heard, where the messages come flying fast, and you have to be fast to keep up. If you are in the right frame of mind, it will blow you away, and you will never listen to any music the same way again. The same goes for all of their later work. I won't bother describing individual songs or moments, there are too too many high points here. A towering album, and a mind altering listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best beatles album","review":"This is a marvelous album. it's the last Beatles album I heard but it is the best. McCartney is at his most understated, with beautiful folk-ish songs left and right. Lennon also chips in with some marvelous songs, esp. \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun,\\" \\"Sexy Sadie\\" and \\"Dear Prudence.\\" George's contributions are more scattershot, from the outstanding \\"Long Long Long\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" to the throwaway \\"Savoy Truffle.\\" and I must add that \\"Revolution 9\\" is a marvelous song. Altogether this album is the Beatles tackling pretty much all 20th century music, from heavy metal and avant garde to folk and country. The best Beatles album if you ask me. Now if only those guys at Apple would remix the album into its full stereophonic glory rather than the \\"processed stereo\\" in which this masterwork is sloppily rendered."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Double Albums Ever made","review":"For anyone who is reading these reviews for help on buying this cd, please do not pay attention to these simpletons who believe that this record should have been trimmed down to a single album. Both CDs are pure masterpieces with not one sub par song. And by the way Revolution number nine was not meant to be listened to over and over like a regular song! So all you complainers get over it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John with a Band; Paul with a Band...and We are so Happy!","review":"One of the most great album of all ages. You can see John Lennon playing with a band. A band that have Paul McCartney and George Harrison as backing vocals. Is Paul singing with a Band; the most big and great of all. \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" is my favourite music, and it is here. \\"Martha My Dear\\": Paul and your dog Martha... Revolution... I Will... Blackbird... What more can I say? HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN. HAPPINESS IS THIS BEAUTIFUL ALBUM. When I Hold You in My Arms and I feel my finger on Your Trigger, Nobody can do me no Harm, because HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN BANG BANG SHUT SHUT."},{"rating":"2","title":"klatuu??","review":"this album like all the preceding Beatle offerings rises to the level of stupendous!! My question to all those Beatlemaniacs is DO YOU REMEMBER KLATUU??? WAS THIS ALBUM NOT THE BEATLES RECORDING UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME?? THE ALBUM ITSELF SHOWS NO CREDITS FOR MUSIC THAT SOUNDS MYSTERIOUSLY LIKE THE FAB FOUR???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"I read the first half of this book while it was still in the development stages, and I knew it was going to be wonderful. I wasn't wrong. Cheryl Reavis is a fantastic writer and has been one of my favorite authors for years, ever since I read CRIME OF THE HEART. Since then she's become a friend. Others have synopsized the story, so I won't. I'll just say it's touching, complex, emotional, and explores that complicated relationship between mothers and daughters. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"What journalism has been and what it should be","review":"Professor Olasky packs a lot of information into 300 pages, and he does it with obvious affection for his subject. He does not take the typical Christian stance against modern journalism, which is to fall down and cry foul.Olasky marches through a brief history of journalism and demonstrates how the most precious truths modern journalists believe -- the independence of the press, the value of truth, the focus on uncovering evildoers -- all owe their existence to Reformers such as Martin Luther and Puritans such as Cotton Mather.But most of the book unwraps the core beliefs and virtues of journalism and points out the nuts and bolts that hold them together. A great introduction to journalistic writing for biblical Christians who want to change the world and how it thinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Call to Excellence","review":"In PRODIGAL PRESS, Dr.Olasky described the descent of secular journalism from objective \\"truth telling\\" to mere public relations and propaganda. In this book, he turns to journalists who claim to write from a Christian perspective. Such writers, of all people, are \\"called to excellence,\\" yet many of them write shallow, second rate material. The author calls for a \\"revitalization\\" of Christian journalism. He quotes theologian J. I. Packer who says this is a fundamentall need in our post-Christian culture. The book is aimed primarily at Christian journalists, or would-be journalists, yet there is much of general interest here. If nothing else, it shows why WORLD magazine (for whom Olasky is editor-at-large) is such a \\"good read.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of your time","review":"Olasky is a nutcase. Unfortunately, I've had him for a college professor. He has some good ideas, and is one of the few people in journalism with a strong sense of ideals, but they are misguided. He seems to think that the only responsible media can be a \\"Christian\\" media. This book is good if you think that The 700 Club does a fair job of presenting world news, otherwise stay away from it except for comic relief"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redundant but improved sound quality.","review":"If you own \\"Collection One\\" and \\"Collection Two\\" then you already have everything on this disc. However there is more room for the grooves on this single, meaning a louder signal. Also the title track is 45rpm. Don't get me wrong, Misfits will never warrant enhancing the sound quality to a high degree; you won't see a Mobile Fidelity reissue pretty much ever. They're a low fi group. The thing is that if you are willing to shell out eight bucks you can have a a better sounding low fi album. At first I was kind of mad at myself for buying this. Once I heard it I am glad I picked it up. Cheaper than two packs of cigarettes--Kentucky price--(and I quit smoking!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Too Much Effort","review":"Have to push it in real hard and keep pushing on it to get it to light up and remain lit. For $20, not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"All of my children have enjoyed this video from the ages of about 6 months through 3-4 years. It combines the introduction of the bible's psalms and teh character of David in a very simple way with fun and entertaining puppets shows and classic Christian music. I have all the babyfaith videos and love them all for my children. I would recommend them to anyone interested in getting their children into \\"baby size\\" bible stories early on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Music and Image Quality","review":"In general, I find the Baby Faith videos OK. However, I found God Made Music to be a weak and poorly constructed video. There are random images of cars going across the screen or sand falling in an hour glass(hardly a biblical story!) . Not really sure why the company claims to make story-based video, but my family was disappointed in the quality.I did like the bonus feature of music, but that did not make the purchase worthwhile. I will stick to other infant videos for the time being."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible baby video!","review":"This is billed as a baby video? The images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value. All of the items are geared toward much older children. I personally like the Baby Miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},G={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",G,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):p("",!0)])}const N=d(D,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-b100b059"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/64.md","filePath":"guide/64.md"}'),W={name:"guide/64.md"},j=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{L as __pageData,j as default};
