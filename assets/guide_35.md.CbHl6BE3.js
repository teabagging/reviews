This book will haunt you in it's vividness and proud classiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments on the book in general","review":"The Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri contains the short stories that depict the inter-cultural aspects between Indian and American perceptions.What I liked about the contents were the factors of food, role of women, symbols of mal-adaptation such as driving What I did not like about the contents was that there were not much concrete endings of the story, which conferred ambiguousness. The mostcompelling factor seemed as the role of women, and the contrasts among them. Most of the stories were written in 3rd person, but \`The Third and Final Continent' was written in 1st person. I felt extremely confused after reading all the stories since those cultural issues were actually occurring nowadays in real world.This story is meaningful in a way that it portrays the inter-cultural conflicts among globalized community nowadays. People who have foreign life experiences could become a good reader for this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than worth the time","review":"In all honesty, when I first read a story by Ms. Lahiri, I wasn't expecting much. It was just another story in the New Yorker (and if you ask me, that particular magazine has gone south, far, far south). But there was something magical in the simplicity of the story (it was \\"The Third and Final Continent\\"). The closing of the story was wonderful, evoking a vague universality in thought and experience. Her use of language isn't exactly terse, yet it excludes unnecessary words that would only bog it down. The sentences are smooth, elegant, even, and direct. It spoke to me as stories should, and all too often don't. I await more Lahiri."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a teenage guy and I liked it","review":"This was one of the two books that I needed to read for summer reading. At first I thought I wouldn't like it, but I actually did. Out of the 9 stories, I wasn't too fond of three of them- \\"A real Durwan\\", \\"this blessed house\\", and \\"the treatment of bibi haldar\\". Others especially \\"Sexy\\" and \\"the third and final continent\\" were great (those two were my favorite). For some of them, I wished that the story didn't end because I liked it so much. The author's writing style is very good and did not bore me. There is some sexuality in it that is interesting for teenage guys :). Also I like the use of brand names, places, and colleges that can help me further relate to the characters. It probably also helped that my girlfriend and one of my friends is Indian. Had I enjoyed all 9 stories, I would have given it a 5/5. All in all, its a good book for everyone, even the white suburban middle to upperclass teenage male."},{"rating":"1","title":"banal","review":"I was disappointed with the book even before it'd won any awards. It's shallow, banal, trite. The characters are all two-dimensional without exception. Her style? Is missing. A sensitive chronicler of the immigrant experience? - I think not - both from the immigrant perspective, and from a writing perspective. I liken her writing to Bharati Mukherji's - another author who's received undue attention, praise and adulation, IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"made me think","review":"I had already read the Namesake quite some time ago and had not realized that these were short stories when I bought the book. I decided to dive in and it seemed like each story was like a fable and after each short story I would think to myself \\"what have I learned what this, what is the moral\\". Her characters were so developed in such a short time, it was like each story was a book on its own. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all in the details","review":"Lahiri's meticulous attention to what's in the freezer, or the closet, or the purse take you right into these stories. Fabulous window into Indian and Idian American experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine","review":"I liked this book very much and..., yeah, very much. Stories are very \\"cosy\\" ,if I can say that, and nice. That it's my first feeling about them and I suppose it's the most important thing. The second feeling was about Jumpha's talent - talent to discribe things and people in a way nobody else does. In a way witch is so simple and straightforward that you start thinking about why other wrtiters does not do it in such a way. The last feeling was not so positive. After reading a few other books about imigrants and thay problems I found this book not so complete as it could be. But should a set of short stories be complete?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of THE Award!","review":"With 240+ reviews already having been written here, I need not be repetitive. For me, I knew the author was a good writer from the \\"get-go\\" when I was immediately drawn into the stories. I did not have to \\"force\\" myself to read them. (This was a selection of the book group that I belong to which meets monthly so I \\"had\\" to read it because it was our selection for June.) In my judgement, it is much more difficult and demanding for an author to write nine short stories than a 450-page novel. I highly recommend the book! It is well deserving of the Pulitzer. I have been somewhat disappointed in some of the Pulitzer winners in the past five to six years so this was a wonderful turnaround!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good review from a surprising place","review":"I was sitting in a tire repair shop awaiting bad news and reading Jamaica Kincaid's My Garden to while away the time. Suddenly, the young technician approached to tell me that things were not so bad after all - and better yet, he informed me that I was reading a GREAT book! Who would have thought to receive a recommendation on a gardening book from a kid with axle grease on his hands!He went on to explain that his teacher had assigned the book in his writing class at the local college, and he found it enchanting. (That wasn't his choice of words, but you get the drift.)And indeed, it was an enchanting read. From her poetic mastery of the English language, to her transplanted Caribbean viewpoint, Kincaid writes from a different place - and don't we read at least partly to hear a different voice? Touching softly upon some very strong political sensibilities, Kincaid makes you think about earth's garden of souls as well as plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle beautiful life-of-a-gardener book","review":"I liked it; I liked it very much. Contrary to the opinion of one of the other reviewers, it is not a showing off exercise for latin knowledge, and any self respecting gardener will empathise with thoughts of rabbit destruction when gazing upon the obliteration of a carefully planned and expensively nurtured border. I thought it was an enchanting read, particularly the descriptions of the visits to the Chelsea Flower show and Jamaica's reactions to the various eminent English garden luminaries encountered there! Maybe I am biased, but she likes the same plants I do, and I had the magical feeling of my own problems and loves materialising before my eyes on print. So there, to the grouch who only gave it one star! OK, so she doesn't have the extensive encyclopaedic knowledge of a plant biology PhD, but that would be missing the point. Most of us don't - we just like gardening, and gaining bits of knowledge as we go and grow. One of my current faves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I found Ms. Kincaid's book to be tedious.

There is much time spent on cheesy effects and a silly wizard imparting arcane knowledge. Past all that crap you do get a great body of info.

I must report that it does hold up quite well, but that nothing in the world could possibly match craziness that ensues when the two of them are together. Unlike the majority of the populous (well, The Moldy Peaches-aware populous, so like...10 people) I so far prefer Adam's solo work to Kimya's, but not by a whole lot. The most noticeable difference between these solo albums and their work as a duo, as far as sound anyway, is an even lower quality production. It almost sounds like they recorded straight to vinyl and then dubbed it to an 8-track tape. This can be trying at times, but it doesn't detract enough from the overall quality of the songs to really matter. The bottom line is that you should own The Moldy Peaches excellent debut before you even *consider* either of these, and then it's your choice from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Closing Album","review":"John's gift to the world of music under his RCA label came to a close with the release of this album- and sadly so. Here we find the seasoned songwriter and performer again on the top of his game. After releasing \\"Dreamland Express\\", an experimental album with a different feel than the ordinary Dever we all have come to love, John crafted \\"One World\\" to be among his finest. The album opens with \\"Love is the Master\\", an uplifting, upbeat, and most certain John Denver classic. As the album continues, we see the softer, honest John Denver in \\"Love Again\\", the open minded optimist in \\"It's a Possibility\\", the socially aware in \\"Let Us Begin\\" (watch out Mr. Dylan, John makes some brilliant moves with this strong dialogue between a world divided). This album showcases John's incredible scope as an artist, writer, and performer in the beauty, and grace you'd expect only from him. \\"Flying for Me\\" alone will give this album 5 stars... put it on your wish list you won't dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A legend and ambassador for life","review":"I've been an avid JD fan ever since he played solo in Cork city in 1987 (I was only 13 then).

Meanwhile, I wanted to find a spell to help someone I care about overcome an illness, and there's nothing in here about that. This book focuses on the trivial stuff.

Alinsky's life was, by design, controversial. He maddened, inspired, angered and incited. Who can blame his critics from all sides of the political spectrum from having a last go at it now that he's gone.That being said, Horwitt's biography presents Alinsky in the clearest and fullest light of any who have undertaken this difficult chronicling.

A collection of Broadway-trained voices interpret some intruingly obscure Bacharach songs with an alarming lack of feeling and a preponderance of technigue.Predictably, the songs associated with Dionne Warwick fare the worst under this Velveeta treatent, and one is left to merely enjoy Bacharach's splendid music imagining how they might sound performed by artists with souls. The best cut by far is La Chanze's \\"Anyone Who Had a Heart\\", and it's always nice to hear Helen Reddy again.The best thing about the album is that it introduces some seldom-heard Bacharach and will perhaps send listeners out to find the original recordings for some indication as to how these songs should sound by artists with a deeper understanding of the lyrics and less of a determination to 'sell it'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well acted thriller, but I wouldn't want to buy it.","review":"The acting is good, and it's creepy enough to hold your interest, but the endingwas a letdown, I'd say - movies, especially thrillers, don't have to be realistic and logical, but the ending just seemed too unrealistic to me, and as somebody else pointed out, tacking on Mama Cass singing\\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\" as the credits roll didn't help. Another one I'm happy that I saw on TV. Worth seeing once, I'd say,and it's now erased. The test of a good film is: would you recommend it to a friend?

The author was witty and the recipes she mentioned sounded yummy and easy to prepare. But if she were my next-door neighbor, I'd constantly be finding excuses not to talk with her. Her excessive whining and inexcusible self-centeredness in the face of family tragedy overshadowed everything else and left me completely disgusted with her.

Bela Fleck's synth banjo is a delight on the opener \\"Bil Mon\\" but the track tends to bring up emotions of nausea for me, making me want to skip past it. \\"Ballad of Jed Clampett\\" takes the Beverly Hillbillies theme and turns it into a rap vocal that is extremely odd and makes me skip past it. Beck's \\"Pineapple Heart\\" starts off lovely with Jeff Coffin's alto flute trills sounding great, but then begins to wander off as if in search for the rest of the band making me skip past. Coffin's \\"Snatchin'\\" has some pep with the opening tenor sax punctuated by keyboards before the banjo has a meltdown halfway through the track making me skip past. In short, this is odd music that while inventive does not connect with me in any significant way other than perhaps being a soundtrack for an intestinal illness. Skip past this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One season too far","review":"Fry and Laurie are probably one of the greatest modern comedy teams. The first three seasons captured the Wodehouse spirit wonderfully. This season, the writers/director thought they were funnier than P. G. and decided to re-write his stories.

The absolute low point was a madcap chase up the Empire State Building; both Bertie and Jeeves were completely out of character. I got through the set just once and re-sold it almost immediately. I highly recommend the first three sets, but if you're a Wodehouse purist, pass on this fiasco."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great DVD set","review":"Jeeves and Wooster is a cute, comical series that anyone will enjoy. i purchased mine new from amazon and it came quickly to my home. i recommend this program to anyone who likes british comedy. the actor's accents are understandable and it's a well-made show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fourth Season Shark Jumping....","review":"Seasons 1-3 were marvelous and Fry and Laurie do their best to save this season but there are some truly terrible episodes. Episode 2 is the worst episode ever, ending with a stupid chase up the Empire State building.

I played it over and over back then but, to my dismay, it doesn't appear on this recording. What a shame. Other than that, this is a wonderful addition to any calypso or Bellafonte collection.

I remember listening to the LP when I was still growing up around 5-6 years old. My dad used to play it so often that even at that age i memorized Harry's version of Hava Nagila. Now I am 29 and my dear dad has been long gone. I was so excited to know that there was a CD on the \\"Live at Carnegie Hall\\" and i wanted to rekindle old memories. To know that there are many parts missing from its original LP version really saddens me as it will not be the same experience.Pleace RCA, put the entire contents of the LP with its original stereo into a CD so everyone can enjoy it as we all did in our younger years.Thank youKuhanBatu Pahat Johore West Malaysia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Belafonte Live in Concert","review":"I, too, was vastly dissatisfied with the fact that they removed 4 of my favorite songs on this concert.

Recharge time is great, and the light output sure makes the cops jealous when their 4D-size lights are just about as bright.The clip-in charger holds the light, period, no matter how many bumps my truck goes over. Best of all, since they include two charger brackets and both AC and DC cords, I can keep it either in my truck or in the closet by the front door, and it gets charged in either place.

This movie makes the effort to show both sides of the war. The story includes an American POW, a young Viet-Cong recruit with a conscience!?, and even a left over mercenary from the French colonial forces who stayed on after Bien-Phu.

Secondly, Clooney fails to step forward as the leader of this retaliatory project; instead of Superman, the audience gets Clark Kent.Pacino tries mightily to be the \\"heavy\\", yet things get so bad at the end that this mobster can easily be taken as a sympathetic character; certainly not what was intended.Looking for a Christmas gift for your worst enemy?

When the action starts to happen, within 10 minutes the movie ends. You can rent this DVD later on when there's nothing else to watch.

While Rueben recovers from a heart attack, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and company (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, ad nauseum) implement a far-fetched and ill-defined plan to sink the big opening.I really enjoyed the first movie and found something to appreciate in the second, as well, but this third installment is just awful from beginning to end. They use the drill that dug the Chunnel to burrow under the casino so they can simulate an earthquake? Really? Are you kidding me? And nobody notices? By the way, when the first one breaks down, they manage to come up with a second one. This is only one element of a plan that would require unlimited resources and the omnipotence of the Almighty himself to pull off. I think it was just made as an excuse for Clooney and his cool posse to pal around in Vegas for a few months.

Of all the low ratings most seem to be unhappy with the DVD quality but finding the movie ok....As I saw it on cable I cannot comment on the DVD format but can safely say I found the movie boring, the acting uninspired and the plot far fetched and overly technical. You dont need to be 88 years old to be unable to relate to the way in which the plot is to be carried out... the main actors repeatedly admit they dont even themselves when presented to them.The movie is very slow paced and often outright boring and there is very few witty lines to cheer up us viewers. Clearly this movie was made, as most sequels are, to make 'an easy buck' which I am sure they did on our expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie! Crappy DVD!","review":"Movie's good!

Turned out, there's nothing wrong with the equipment - thank God! DVD's a problem!Sound (Only 2.1) & Picture Quality (Very grainy, lack of focus etc.) make that movie \\"unpleasant\\" to watch. Even if you have decent TV & HTS. Kind of a bad copy of a very used VHS cassette. Shame on Warner Bros. or those guys who release such poor quality DVDs.

A friend got the DVD and even though it is not as crisp, the grain and noise is so much less. I am completely disappointed in this Bluray version.

Every other Standard Definition DVD I have watched on this system looks fantastic. However, Oceans 13 looked awful. The picture was very grainy and the colors were distorted. The actors all had orange skin which made them look like they slathered themselves with some cheap tanning lotion. I could only stand to watch about 45 minutes of this DVD.I did some research online and found that a few DVDs don't look good when processed by an upconverting DVD player or receiver. Oceans 13 was specifically mentioned on one A/V forum as a DVD which looks awful when upconverted. Very disappointing to say the least.

I mean Pitt keeps looking at his watch as if to say, shouldnt I be picking up Angela's teddy from the dry cleaner? Really, all of the actors in this film should be ashamed to cash their hefty checks, this is totally mailed in. Pacino is totally wasted and the plot, as if their ever really is one in these stupid movies, is totally convoluted, I mean what the f is Eddie Lizzard even talking about, you shouldnt need a degree in macro physics to figure out a movie plot.

I only give this a two star rating for the fact that I know the story, acting, and production of this movie was well worth the money but the quality of the blu-ray was an absolute waste of a piece of plastic.

The DVD had issues such as kicking me out and then breaking up so much that I couldn't watch it. The Blu-Ray didn't break up but just kept kicking me out.

I have the widescreen DVD, not HD, version. I bought this just to see the movie, not to look for a home theater demonstration disc, so my expectations were not too high. \\"Ocean's 13\\" quality however failed to deliver to the low bar I set for it. I watched this on a Sony 70\\" Qualia 006 rear-projection HDTV, a device that is pretty unforgiving of bad source material.

I started noticing this with such releases as OCEANS 13 and the newest HARRY POTTER. It appears they're compressing the video content on the discs more than ever making the quality almost unwatchable on a Plasma or LCD 32' or larger. Could they be doing this to push more people into buying BlueRay? That would be my only guess. This is strange considering that FOX and Paramount are making better quality/less compressed regular DVDs. I know the more extras you have on the disc the more compressed the image quality may be but this has never stopped Warner from making a decent product before (though their DVD quality has always been much lower than most other brands)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this shipped with HD DVD player?","review":"I don't understand why this movie ships with the Toshiba HD DVD player.

By the time you get through the planning and all the long scenes and long boring dialoge that makes political speechs easy to understand by contrast, You don't care anymore.

Too bad because I think they really missed an opportunity to unleash the magic of Izzard. LOL He's brilliant & I wish more Americans knew about him & his unbelievably charismatic intelligent humor. I don't care if he's wearing men's clothing or dressed as executive transvestite, he's hot in a way that Clooney/Pitt are, how do you say, not.

Take my breath away was a huge hit back in the day. Leave it alone. If an artist today wants to remake a song. Then do one that did poorly and make some sort of positive out of it. Overall the album was predictable, but her voice has incredible range and I give her 5 stars on just that.Anyone here knows who originally sang the song Angels? I think it is from the early 90's. Some help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhh.......No.......Didn't like it","review":"There's something about her voice I just don't like.

I love \\"In this skin\\" and \\"I have Loved You\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The only good song is angels, but it isnt up to scratch. She over uses her vocals, and she often sounds very annoying. The majority of the songs are very boring, and all make me sick. She has bad arrangements, and bad accompanying music. The bonus dvd is only 15 minutes long, and is just 50second clips from that stupid show. This cd is a real let down. And now, her sister comes into the music industry, with even more annoying songs. What is the music industry coming to? It would be better if she didnt over do her vocals"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE MISTAKE BLONDIE!!","review":"this woman ruined some great songs here ladies and gentlemen!!What's up with the re-make of Angels? (Robbie Williams' song) HE sings it so beautifully and jessica just came right along and decided to shout the lyrics out practically! This woman killed my song like BADLY...I think GOD sent her the wrong message really. Now another song, Take My Breath Away (I forgot the original singer) nonetheless IT IS A BEAUTIFUL song til jessica got her hands on it. REALLY THIS WOMAN JUST SUX AT DOING COVERS OF OTHER ARTISTS' SONGS...someone in another review said she tried her best to make this album but really it isnt hard ruining a song and it sure doesnt take that long really.

If I ever see Jessica Simpson in public, I will scratch her eyes out and tear out every single strand of that crappy colored hair for taking one of the best love songs and butchering it up and making it into a pop song! Her other songs are boring and nothing but a chance to show off her range which sucks and sounds pathetic when compared to Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera!

However I think she is an awful singer who is trying to be Mariah Carey but isn't in the same league. Her version of Angels is truly appalling and is an insult to the Robbie Williams original. I very much like her as a person but as an artist Jessica needs to totally re-evaluate herself before she is taken seriously..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT music!","review":"Whatever you do, don't call this music! This is simply crap with a bunch of screaming over it. I can't even believe this horrible \\"artist\\" is experiencing success right now. The only reason is because of her idiotic TV show. Pretty soon, people are gonna grow tired of her stupid act and stop supporting her. She certainly doesn't have the music or talent to back her up. The only thing she's doing right now is acting stupid and ruining a bunch of beautiful songs from other artists. Do NOT buy this piece of crap that's being passed off as music. You'll highly regret wasting your money on this atrocity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked her better when she was called Britney Spears...","review":"Both versions of Jessica's latest album \\"In This Skin\\" are dull with exception of two songs \\"With You\\" and \\"Sweetest Sin.\\" This CD was full of terrible filler the first go around, and now she adds a mediocre remake of a song best sung by Berlin, and she expects the American public to eat it up. Maybe she really is as dumb as she pretends to be on her television show.Save your money and pick up a CD by a much more fun entertainer like Britney, Christina, or even Mandy Moore. Jessica's music is just too bland for words."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"A few years back, Jessica was easily my favorite singer. She had so much potential when she first came out, she just needed slightly better songs. I respected her so much and thought she was incredibly talented. I still think she's talented, but I've lost a lot of respect for her recently. It seems that all she's interested in is making money and this re-release is further proof of that. She simply threw this out there for people to buy without putting any thought into it. It truly shows because it's dreadful, which is something I never thought I would say about one of her albums. I'm sad to say she's lost me as a fan because of her recent antics and the fact that she's about the money now and definitely not the music. I hope she's happy, but I'm certainly not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an angles voice","review":"jessica simpson sings like an angel if you want real music buy this album at least this make sence the words have meaning to it not like all that rap that every word is a bad word so if u want good music with a great beat buy jessica simpson in this skin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessica's \\"sexy\\" sound doesn't sell.","review":"Alright, I miss the \\"Pop Princess\\" Jessica Simpson. I say this because her newest project is far from that. Instead we find Jessica barely singing and instead whiserping on almost all the tracks. On top of this I can stand that a mojority of the album is filled with breathy ballads that capitalize on Simpson's lustiness and not her voice. Overall, very disappointing to see another artist sell out."},{"rating":"1","title":"good singing in album in real life not so much","review":"im giving this a one star because even thoughit has really good singing in the album ive heard her sing in real life and she sucks. im sorry but if the person sounds good in the album and bad in real life then thier cd doesn't deserve to be sold. jess. keeps using a backup track when performing live to cover up her bad singing. beside her only hit was with you which used back-up singing. and her new song thesae boots are made for walking well its pathetic that she had 2 use sex 2 get attention"},{"rating":"2","title":"Showing more 'Skin'","review":"This expanded edition is a beautiful compilation.

She oversings when it is unnecessary. She took a great song and killed it--her version makes me cringe every time I hear it on the radio or wherever else is being paid to play it.

I do like her show though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!!","review":"This album is nothing but junk, with crap remakes and horrendous vocals.

Simpson has about as much geunine vocal talent as a lapdancer from run down truck stop having a clean bar of soap. She murders the classic Robbie Williams song by whining out her vocals. You can tell that she totally does not comprehend the lyrical meaning of the song (they go way above her dyed hair). This talentless bimbo made such a lame product that it makes Britney Spears sound like a vocal expert. Vocally, she remains more than weak, she is horrible. She should be embarrased by the mess she left behind. The CD will be trash bound very soon.

She sounded like Britney Spears, which may be a good thing to some people, but sure as heck not for me. Considering her fame, she will probably make this version of the song a hit, and that is really and truly a shame. And stupid in real life or not, shouldn't glamorize airheaded-ness, not to mention her less-than Christian style. Whatever happened to those good old religious moral values your daddy the reverend taught her? It doesn't apply to just virginity alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Do any Better","review":"Sorry but she is always 2nd place. She never made it to the Mickey mouse Club, and I can totally see why. She couldn't release a good CD the first time, so she had to RE-RELEASE the same crappy CD again. Ok I have to admit SWeetest Sin is good but that all she has....... She is nothing but a C-- grading, and its thanks to her husband that people are actually starting to notice her. I mean really.......She does nothing but dis Britney and Christina all because She didn't make it Until Now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Album Yet!","review":"I have all of Jessica Simpson's CDs and this one is the best yet. She wrote almost all of the songs, which makes the CD very personal. Jessica also has an amazing voice: far better than Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, etc etc.Sweetest Sin - great song. shows how much Jessica is passionate about her husband.With You - one of my favorite songs on the album. It is upbeat and is perfect for any girl who wants the perfect guy that she can \\"let her hair down and say anything crazy\\" to.Underneath - my other favorite song on the album. The song is so intense and shows such intense emotion. Jessica really knows how to write passionate songs.In this Skin - a great song she dedicated to her fans.In all, I 100% recommend this CD especially if you've been a fan of Jessica Simpson in the past. It's great and it shows the real Jessica shine through, not just the one you see on TV's \\"Newlyweds.\\" It is absolutely her best album yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful excuse for music","review":"Whatever happened to the days when singers' albums were purchased because they were actually talented? In Jessica's latest flop she whispers her way through the tracks, or else shreiks to hit notes that are ear-splittingly out of her range. Most of the songs have strong, disgustingly blatant sexual overtones in which Jessica glorifies her relationship with (actually talented) pop singer Nick Lachey. After four years of hearing that the pair is together, I think that's become old news (now the real news will be when HE files for divorce from his whining, hissy-fit throwing spouse). Although she tried to couple the release of this album with her current reality series on MTV, her behavior on that show has lost her more than a few fans. Not many people want to support a singer who will squander her talent and money the way Jessica is doing.For someone with real talent, check out Michael Buble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"Okay first off I love Jessica, she seems like she is a good person and is also great to laugh at on 'Newlyweds'. This CD however does not recieve the same praise as her. 'With You' is without a doubt the best song, 'Sweetest Sin' is pritty good, the last two ('In This Skin' and 'Be') are *alright*. The rest are not very good to say the least. 'My Way Home' is terrible, its one of those songs that you will get up to change, it is not bareable. The songs do not grow on you either, Ive had a few listens since I got this CD back on valentines day and it has not improved. 'With You' is the only track I would call great. Jessica attempts a couple of ballads on this CD, but they are not as good as the ones on Christina Aguileras 'Stripped' or 'Everytime' on Britney Spears' 'In The Zone'.It is a shame because out of all the 'pop princess' Jessica has one of the best voices, I think she just needs someone to find her better songs to sing.All in all - skip it, its not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"There's no doubt about it, the girl has a set of pipes. She is a beautiful girl who can back it up with her voice (that much can't be said for many). However, I was really bored with this cd. If you have heard a couple of the songs, you have heard them all. If I wanted the same effect of obnoxius ballads and her love life details I would read an US Weekly while listening to a Celine Dion cd. But hey, at least she sings the boring songs with a nice strong voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Much Anticipated Release!!","review":"Jessica Simpson's Third album is a much anticipated release from one of the Biggest names in Pop Music. Jessica is known for her stunning voice for singing ballads especially. You may remember her hit song \\"I Wanna Love You Forever\\" from her first album. The new album has some incredible producers and song writers such as Grammy Award winning writer Diane Warren. on the sunsual ballad \\"Sweetest Sin\\" the first single. Another highlight on the 11 track CD is \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" a totally Techno Pop track written by Madonna!. and \\"With You\\" another Upbeat catchy tune finally shows Jessica's different side with a live band and no Sythesized music. The whole album is an enjoyable experience! a mix of BALLADS, Sythesized POP, and Acoustic Pop. Gorgeous album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It","review":"In This Skin Is the Best CD That Jessica Simpson Made It's A first CD That Let's Every one get know her more as a singer and not some anti britney wannabe like every one calls her i love the song Forbidden fruit it the best song on the CD it shows her as a r&b singer this CD shows her more sexier side then her last cd and the song in this skin let's every one know that your beautiful and her first single sweetest sin is a good song written by diane warren the cd rocks"},{"rating":"1","title":"This must be a joke.","review":"This album is horrid no words can describe how horrible it is Jessica should be ashamed of releasing such crap I give this album 1 star I would give it none if possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghhh....","review":"It's not so much Jessica's annoying personality that makes me dislike her as her inability to sing a phrase correctly. As a musician, I cannot listen to her rendition of \\"Angel\\" and keep a straight face. When she says, \\"I sit and wait as an an-jellllll\\" I almost lose it. A few voice lessons and a few tips on proper pronunciation, and then maybe, just maybe, Jessica Simpson will only marginally suck.

Fair play, she looks GREAT in her videos, and the production is slick enough, but the gulf in class between her versions of \\"Take my breath away\\", and especially \\"Angels\\", and the original versions is fairly vast.Bland pop, well produced and packeged, but absolutely nothing new, nothing standout - alright in the background, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop Her from ruining these songs!","review":"OK, I can tolerate \\"With You\\" as a bland piece of forgettable pop. At least with that song I don't have to turn off the radio.\\"Take My Breath Away\\", however, does make me turn off the radio. The song is supposed to be sensual and sultry, and Ms. Simpson just doesn't express that. The vocals are a little annoying, too, but not when compared to......\\"Angels\\". Robbie Williams made this a classic, full of overwhelming emotion and expression, and only 5 years ago or so! Well, not only does this version of the song convey no emotion (the singing technique is too mechanical) but the majority of the song is in a higher register which Ms. Simpson can hit and, frankly, her voice here sounds like a twisted piece of metal shrieking while being torn apart. It hurts my ears.She gets more than 1 star due to a decent song selection and the fact the she helps write. Execution is a failure, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"I used to think Jessica Simpson was an ok singer until i saw her singing on Newlyweds? What happened?

(Angels, and Take my breath away) With You has got to be the corniest song/video i've ever heard. the rest of the cd, nothing really stands out. she just struggles with her singing and starts yelling more than singing. i think mandy moore is waay better than jessica simpson.

I really didn't like the single much so I wasn't expecting much with the cd.The songs themselves will not be winning awards anytime soon for their brilliant lyrics, but given the fact that this is Jessica's first attempt at song writing, the are pretty damn good. I believe that on her next few albums her writing will become more professional and more diverse in its subject matter (less lovey dovey songs about Nick).

And I didn't fully listen to it until two weeks later.What I heard didn't impress me much. There were a few good efforts, but so unforgettable that I can't even remember the titles of them. I was really rooting for this to be a great comeback album, something that at least puts her in the outskirts of the stratospheres of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears.But it doesn't happen.This album is full of little ditties and sappy love ballads. I kind of expected that since she married the 98 heartthrob Nick Lachey, but they were boring and didn't catch my attention.Oh, well at least she has that \\"Newlyweds\\" reality show to fall back on.

Maybe she is a big of fan britney i don't know. The songs are okay only the lyrics are so stupid and boring. The music is good sometimes, okay I'm not a Jessica hater but her first album was very good. I did like a lot then her new songs are not good. Maybe if she tries a little harder next time.

Her talent lies in her ballads, which were lacking in her second album, but this album is completely devoid of them. This songs are all poppy and upbeat, as if she is trying to be more like Britney Spears. But the songs aren't catchy enough in the first place, and her vocal talent is beyond underrepresented. Unlike Britney, she doesn't need to dress naked, have hit songs, or collaborate with other huge names in the music industry to sell albums, all she has to do is open her mouth.

She only started songwriting often and besides a great voice, the talent stops their! After all, her reality show did boost her career, but this year she is doing nothing! Her acting is pretty good, but musically she is no where near being supertalented like her most talented peers Willa Ford and Christina Aguilera, despite their image (never judge a book by its cover). Jessica's 15 minutes is definately winding down. Maybe kiddies still like her, but overall, she is really fading.

To my surprise, I am way more impressed with Britney's \\"In The Zone\\", even though Britney can't sing if her tan depended on it, and I am appalled by Jessica's \\"In This Skin\\", although Jessica is the more talented vocalist of the two. If I had to pick the \\"best song\\" on this album, I would pick track 19. You might notice there is no track 19. That's right, because there isn't a best song!!!

Truth be told...thats it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID!!","review":"I don't know how anyone can bear to listen to such an atrocity! I've never heard such a pathetic excuse for music in my life. Each song is worse than the previous one and, by the end, you're likely to have a splitting headache. Jessica's voice is piercing to the ears and the quality of the songs is embarrasing. The re-release is complete with 2 remakes, which should not have been touched, especially by such an awful singer. Forego this piece of crap at all costs!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I have to say that I was skeptical about getting Jessica's new CD since I've never bought any of her others. I was really surprised at how good this was! She really has a great voice and can sing! If people want to hear \\"over-produced\\" albums from a pop star,take a listen to some of Britney Spears' earlier albums. Britney sure can dance,but I have to say Jessica can sing circles around her! I especially love Angels,With You,Sweetest Sin,I Have Loved You,and In This Skin. Listen to this CD without prejudging her from her ditzy behavior on Newlyweds. She can really sing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap","review":"Save your money.

But, really, she just gets worse and worse. Every song is some lovey-dovey crud that reminds you of her pathetic baby talk to Nick on Newlyweds.

My Skin Crawls","review":"when I hear Jessica sings. She has a powerful voice, but something is lacking. She doesn't grab you the way Celine or Christina does. The only reason why this cd is successful is because of her annoying reality show with her husband. The music and her vocals is NOT the reason why this cd is selling. It flopped last year and only became a success AFTER her show. And speaking of her voice, her remake of the 80s classic Berlin's Take My Breath Away was TOTALLY uncalled for!! It sounds like she is trying to do Britney. In fact, when I first heard the song I thought it was BRITNEY!! This tells me that Jessica is taking the \\"dumb blonde\\" thing to the extreme because now she is using that image in her songs. Jessica is milking her new media status for all its worth, but by next year her career will be done. Avoid this corny cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset with this album!","review":"First off the remake of Berlin's song \\"Take My Breath Away\\" is so embarrasing to listen to cause This girl Jessica did a realy bad job on it it sounds horrid and its just embarrasing!Angles is just a stupid song that is realy not worth to be made!The disc is absulutly makes me not like Jessica watching her say stupid things and just stand around in her house acting spoiled!I suggest you dont get this and get something thats much worth your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!!","review":"Throw this in the dumpster, along with Jessica's career. This album is so painfully awful, I can't even begin to describe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take My Breath Away is wrecked, sadly","review":"As much as I like Ms. Simpson, Take My Breath Away was just SO overly stylized (you can just SEE her head and body jerking along with her voice) that I'd take the original version any day of the week over this one. I'm sure she didn't mean to, but she has quite simply ruined this great song here. LESS IS MORE, my dear - make that your mantra!!! Listen to the original again, then re-record and destroy every available copy of this hideously over-stylized embarrassment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEEZE - - SACRILEGE TO ROBBIE'S VERSION OF ANGELS","review":"Why does America settle for mediocrity like this - with the likes of her and Clay Aiken - - who doesn't the States wake up to Robbie Williams - - - why - why - why - -"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing albulm","review":"Jessica Simpson is an amazing singer. She has a breath taking vocal range. her first simgle with you was awesome. You could sing along and dance. She is a very inspiring single. Her song Angles is my number 1 favorite song. She holds the highest note for 12seconds! This girl has range. This album is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone age 13-99"},{"rating":"1","title":"skin crawling","review":"when jessica hit the scene she was one of few strong singers... now she blends in with the others. In this skin shows her voice a more whinging and strained then the previous albums. The remakes of robbies \\"angels\\" and berlin's \\"take my breath away\\" do not add up to the original power. \\"In this skin\\" is a poor attempt to measure up towards christina's \\"beautiful\\", instead it comes across as a feel sorry for yourself kind of song. The best part of the album is the dvd. The wedding is beautiful, and jessica's personality is what saves her. Her ditzy behaviour is more preferable than her singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jessica has the voice and the looks!","review":"This is a great CD! I bought the first issue of In This Skin. Being such a big fan I had to buy the second one as well! Standout tracks are: \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" \\"Underneath\\" and of course he remakes of \\"Angels\\" by Robbie Williams and Berlin's \\"Take My Breath Away\\" - Excellent job on the remakes! She has such a good, distinctive voice. It has a lot of ballads and a few \\"bumpers\\" to it as well. I really like it and the DVD is good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"I have never bought an album by Jessica Simpson so I did not know what to expect. I did buy the album because I liked the first two singles. The album was not bad but it was not great either. It was okay. I think Jessica has a very pretty voice. I just don't think the songs have that much excitement to them. I thought they could be better. But I don't think the album is bad. I will be listening to it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 songs that are worth it.","review":"This album was a huge let down. She is known for singing great power ballads and I wonder why she took the road to bubblegumpopdom. This album is all about her. I don't know why it's not even self titled. It's about sex, Nick, herself and her father. Jessica needs to become like her idol Celine Dion and sing more power ballads that can last for generations to come. If only she believes in herself.The only two songs that are worth it on this album are The Sweetest Sin and Underneath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I absolutely loved this CD! I was never really a big fan of Jessica until after seeing her video for Sweetest Sin and watching the show Newlyweds I decided to give her album a shot. Even though Jessica may seem like your typical dumb blonde on the show Newlyweds she CAN sing and that shines through on every single track of her album. My personal favorite song is 'I Have Loved You' because it's just such a beautiful love song. The only bad thing I could say is that some of the lyrics are maybe a little bit cheesy but I still enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO TALENT AND NO BRAINS","review":"Its very sad that such a talentless person can sell so many albums. Its a sad reflection of a youth culture that has lost its way ,musically speaking. The only good thing is that this talentless no-brainer will be forgotten in a couple of years.Such music has NO WAY of lasting.The fact that she is as thick as two planks makes her chances of lasting even slimmer.Add her husband to the equation and you get ABBOTT AND COSTELLO. Give this a miss and buy some real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Making my Skin Crawl!!","review":"I believe her fist album was her best work. She sings to shrilly for my taste and theres nothing really catchy about her. And after watching her new reality show even more disgusted with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe time to do something else?","review":"This is her third album and also the worst. She's got married and got her own tv show aswell, so it feels like the music is not her first choise anymore, that's too bad cause i always liked her as a artist, Good voice and good songs. But on this album she tried to reach a older audience, her album might sound more personal and mature but it's not inspiring at all. Many songs sound dull and it simply don't get my attention \\"Sweetest Sin\\" is probably the best song but there aren't many to chose of, sad to see this happen but i hope she'll be back stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm.....","review":"Okay. I've only heard 2 songs on this CD: \\"Sweetest Sin\\" and \\"With You\\", and I know it doesn't really seem fair to write a review based on those 2 particular songs, but I couldn't contain myself. \\"Sweetest Sin\\"...um...horrid. Jessica is a stunning girl with an AMAZING voice, and it still hurts me to hear her sing such slapped-together record company garbage. \\"With You\\" isn't THAT bad of a song...okay okay...the 2 stars are for her voice... I'm a fan of hers, but these songs were just very very wrong choices for her to sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet","review":"I enjoyed Jessica's first 2 albums, especially Sweet Kisses...her voice just blew me away! Her second one was alright...a little over-produced, but good songs. In This Skin shows more of what Jessica is capable of; where she's headed. She seems more comfortable with the songs on this album than the others. She's not really pushing herself, she co-wrote most of them so she is able to relate to them on a more personal level. I would have to say that \\"I Have Loved You\\" and \\"With You\\" are my favorites. She's grown up, she understands true love in it's truest form and feels content with her life...and it shines through in her voice. I have to say, though, that not all of the songs really suit her. It was almost as if she was trying too hard but, you know, you can't please everyone. All in all I think it is her best cd yet and I hope to hear more of this laid back, free-feeling sound from her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than average......","review":"The cd was overall pretty good, but in my opinion I thought it was kind of blah. There were only 3 new songs, and 2 of them were remakes (Angels, Take My Bretahe Away) which she hadn't written herself. The songs that she put on her 3rd cd (In This Skin (2003)) were orginal and fun to sing and dance too. But in my opinion I think they should of put those remakes on her nect cd. I really am a big fan of Jessica but this cd is not her best work. If you plan on buying one of this In This Skin versions I'd plan on buying this one because it has more than the 2003 In This Skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"still a lightweight","review":"Jessica Simpson has a decent enough range but the material here is just there.She doesn't have enough to carry this lighweight set.nothing much has changed since her debut.soft product&a dime a dozen results."},{"rating":"1","title":"shed this skin immediately","review":"i just cant imagine how such an awful album was released by columbia records.this is one of the worst cd's i have ever come across. i can bet that she got her deal solely on the basis of her cute looks and not on the basis of her lousy voice.get rid of this awful cd immediately.it is my opinion that music this bad should have come with a health warning.no stars.get any album from john fogerty instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take my breath away, yes with that awful cover","review":"I was willing to give her a shot after her reality show on MTV. But it is just impossible when you have an overblown voice and ego to go with it. Yes, she is not the worst singer in the world, that would be her sister Ashlee, but it's not great either. It would be kind to say something nice, but this album and the really overdone and hideous version of Take My Breath Away, belong in a long hidden vault somewhere far away. Or at least burn the masters so that this is never reissued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb blonde with decent voice","review":"It's too bad she has very little singing talent,but a whole lot of emptiness between her ears.Maybe she needs to spend her money on an education instead of wasting it on bubblegum drivle such as this and her other cd's....Give it up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really BAD!!","review":"This is truly a bad collection of songs, especially the covers of Take My Breath Away & Angels. The vocals and production are terrible and it's obvious they were rushed simply to make money off of her newfound fame from Newlyweds. It's sad that buyers are manipulated into buying such an awful album that's a complete waste of money! There isn't one good song on this album and the bonus songs and DVD are worthless and hardly worth it if you already own the album.

Lyrically, this album is seriously lacking. Only \\"The Sweetest Sin\\" shows some promise (maybe because it's written by Diane Warren). There are very few up tempo songs and while the slower songs show Jessica's voice, after some time you find yourself beginning to fall asleep. If I found anything out on this album, it's that she is in love. But there's only so much \\"lovey-dovey\\" you can take.

This album was released before The Newlyweds hoopla, Jessica's vocals just weren't the same anymore, when her first album was released I thought she had the most natural talent of the four \\"poptarts\\" (Britney, Christina, and Mandy).

Well, this one is not better than \\"Irresistible\\" but is good nonetheless. \\"Sweetest Sin\\" is the best song on this album, along with \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" and \\"Everday See You\\".

I very much enjoy listening to it, but it isn't going to win her any new fans, but it will satisfy her fan base that is already established.

But that aside, I recommend this CD if you are thinking of purchasing, she does have very true and real talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid voice with tremendous feeling","review":"This CD is magnificent.

I got used to it, but considering the importance of this part to the product's use (sure, you can use your finger, but...), I was a bit surprised that Handspring didn't spring for a more substantial stylus. That problem is user-fixable with this product.The heft of the replacement stylus makes writing simpler, and the aluminum-colored shafts look better when Visoring in public. It's nice to have spares, and all the colors fit well with my graphite Visor.Handspring should have included a couple of these with your Visor, but since they didn't, here you are. A user-friendliness oversight or marketing strategy? That's another issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product and you may need all the extra packaged.","review":"I didn't think I would need these 5, no less than the 5 more being bought today, until I also purchased their leather case. The case's method of storing the stylus is less than secure. Within a short time the case has lost its grip on the stylus and it is, if your lucky, in your briefcase, pocket, etc... If not, you may be like me, retunrning and buying another package. This time I'm gluing a small piece of sponge in the case that will stop the stylus half way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Leave Scratches!","review":"They look nice, fit the slot perfectly, have a screwdriver and a reset pin... perfect except that the plastic tip seems to be harder than other stylii.

If you write with significant pressure, avoid these or risk damaging your Visor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need spares? They're the best to have around...","review":"If you like to have spare stylis around, unless you \\"roll your own\\" and/or don't have that much disposable income, the 5-pack Rainbow Pack is your choice.At approximately 20 cents more per stylus than a Palm III 3-stylus pack, you get what the newer Visors come bundled with: A sturdy, dependable stylus with the reset pin and screwdriver; not the plastic stick originally supplied.I'm not picky about the color matching-- at least I can tell which spare stylis I have next to my keyboard.

Love it!","review":"I bought the dictionary and thesaurus for our homeschool library. I love them both. They are easy to use and include pictures of selected entries. Some entries have a full page dedicated to them, like geologic time, and solar system. The book also includes biographical information. At the front of the book a lesson in dictionary use, as well as parts of speech and other helpful language arts tid bits can be found. My six year old can use this dictionary, and she will continue to use it for quite some time. It is NOT one of those kids' dictionaries full of pictures.

She had outgrown the children's dictionary, but the college dictionary was just too much for her. The definitions in this volume are at just the right level for her. We like the pictures, too. I especially like the \\"famous person\\" entries. When you don't need an encyclopedic reference for a historical figure -- just an idea of who he or she was -- this is great. My only complaint is that word origins are not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dictionary","review":"I purchased this for my daughter for christmas.

But for now he's seventeen years old, as fresh and brash a sprig of the nobility as you would care to know. The only thing as damp as the place behind his ears is the ink on his brand-new commission.Though through this and his succeeding adventures he will struggle gloriously and win (usually) mighty victories, Dominic Flandry is essentially a tragic figure: a man who knows too much, who knows that battle, scheme and even betray as he will, in the end it will mean nothing. For with the relentlessness of physical law the Long Night approaches.

So many fine actors and well known faces it is a real shame it did not come off better. A great actor can only do so much when handed a piece of trash to work with. This script was lifeless, the direction uninspired, the music completely obnoxious and the filming stiff. I can live with a totally predictable plot (what Bonanza episode wasn't)if it is done with intelligence and style, but a bad plot is a bad plot and this one is worse. Preachy, unrealistic and forced.

First, the tutorial taught me just about nothing. I had to read the manual over and over again. My sheep NEVER had enough grazing land even though everything was cleared. I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make or buy tobacco. I only found 2 cultures and I couldn't even sign a treaty with one of them. If I managed not to lose my scout, the only thing I ever found was more mineral deposits that did me no good because I couldn't build on any other islands but my own. All I did was watch my money go down and down and down. I wish they would of made this game a little more user friendly. It might have been enjoyable then."},{"rating":"1","title":"For kindergarden kids","review":"This is a game for 5 years old. A real economy does not function like that at all! It needs a government, rules, accounts and so on. It is impossible to really control anything in this game where really annoying things happen (why prevent those stupid potatos to reach this stupid tavern for the only reason that a piece of mud road is missing!). This is not the sort of thing that makes a game funny!I am still looking for a strategy game where invading your neighbour is not the only way to win and where the economy functions on a truly realistic basis. This is not the one (despite fun graphics)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Build through power, build through peace and build through pure frustration. This game is so complicated, that its a drag to play. First of all I'll start by saying that the graphics look spectaculaire. Secound of all it takes for ever to do any thing in the game. You'll try to explore, manage a growing empire and build a thriving colony over many many days of playing. You'll constantly run into money problems and to this day I still can't figure out how to set traid routs. Dureing this game you will rarely get attacked on land and your traid boats will conatantly get harrsed by pirates and your enemys. This game looked good on the rack in the store, but when you start to play it you'll relize that the game isnt that great. If you want a good stratigy game, get strongholed or age of empires."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Texas Ranger","review":"A very slow starting book. It got a little better, but not much.

Texas Ranger, you would think the story took place in Texas. It appears the author does not know the difference between Texas and Arizona. I only know of one Yuma prison. Going from Yuma to Texas to get to Mexico? The few towns and cities mentioned are all in Arizona and not to me knowledge in Texas.The author must not be from around here. (No pun intended) Some of the words he uses are outdated and the definitions for them even say they are archaic. The characters have no depth and apparently have a lazy lazy southern drawl. I felt insulted.Try as I may I could not read more than a few chapters before I removed it from my kindle. What a waste of time.

I read the plot and it sounded right up my alley, but i figured it couldnt possibly be as good as it sounded, but for once it was actually as good as i hoped. The book is perfectly set up, and i never got to a part where i wanted to quit reading. The author manages to avoid the boaring inquest and still solves the crime. I havnt been so happy with a book in years, and this is only the first of the series.

Her later books were much better as regards plot and characterization, and were amusing into the bargain, with characters like the inimitable Lugg and a charming Scotland Yard man whose name, at the moment, escapes me. Almost any of the later works would be better to start on, unless your interest is historical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be put off by this poor start","review":"This is silly stuff, full of cliches of plucky Englishmen, sinister foreigners and master criminals. There are too many characters, many of whom aren't involved in events often enough to justify their inclusion or don't even have a speaking role, and I didn't find any of them appealing, unfortunately. The plotting is rather clumsy and poorly paced. Both denouments (of the criminal gang and murder storylines) are ridiculous. As for Campion, I found him a little too roughly drawn to be entirely convincing as a character yet. He helps drive the action without being truly central to the plot. The book could have done without him, or he without it. Thankfully, Margery Allingham became a much better writer with a much better sense of plot and pacing in her later books. A curiosity only.On another note, this is a very nice book to read: an easy size to hold, with quality paper and a good font. Superior to the Vintage editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells great","review":"I bought it for the wife because the original wish was her favorite.

It is compact and very very bright. As you read the manufacturer's description, pay close attention to these two stats: ONE HOUR CONTINUOUS USE, TEN HOUR CHARGE TIME. That's 10 minutes of charging for every minute you use the light. I usually need the light for about half an hour. That means every two uses, it's out of commission again for 10 hours. I have to carry a mini MAG as a backup. The Stinger is bright, small and durable (it has survived a few hard drops), but it is totally impractical because of the fast discharge and long recharge. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good feel good series","review":"This show is sort of a rip off of The Devil Wears Prada, but so what. It is fun, usually upbeat, and the characters are likeable. One silly thing is that Jane is kind of average looking unlike Anne Hathaway (so the mostly female audience will like her) and goofy and irresponsible (except at work) but everybody on the show is in love with her and constantly hitting on her.

The Titan missile was a liquid filled beast that demanded constant attention. One slip of the tool and the chain reaction began. Brave souls gave their lives to try and salvage the bird in silo 7. But, does anyone know that the warhead was blown out of the silo and landed in a nearby field? Are there others we don't know about? You will admire the bravery of the enlisted men, and you will be disgusted at how they were treated. The silent war continues to this day across the plains of Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming. The Minuteman III has solid rocket fuel and is far less vulnerable than the Titan; nonetheless, young men and women risk their lives regularly to keep these birds on alert. We should never forget the sacrifices of the silent heroes that maintain our fleet of nuclear missiles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos","review":"Having been on a TitanII missile crew for 9 years, I was critical of this movie the first time I watched it because of minor deviations from authenticity of the way life was on missile crew.Now it is part of my collection ...

I had pulled several alerts at the site that actually blew up in Arkansas and I had pulled alerts at the site near Tucson where the movie was filmed.Those 9 years in SAC as a Missile Combat Crew member, instructor, and standboard evaluator were some of the best of times in my life.

On this release, tracks 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, and 15 are all rehashes from previous Fresh Aire releases.

Sometimes when I'm working in a dark area I hold a pen light in my mouth so I can use both hands.I finally found out, after a few minutes of experimenting, that you can just push the button in and hold it to get light, or twist the end where the button is located clockwise and it will stay on.I'm glad it stays on when you twist the end where the button is, My tongue isn't strong enough to hold the button in by itself.

When one does a careful and objective analysis of hwa's teachings you'll see that the scriptures used are misinterpreted, misused or meanings changed or re-invented by hwa to fit his teachings, not God's.

However, I noticed that I felt that I had read it before or at least the first part. I compared the text from Eisenhower Italian Campaign and the First Part of Fatal Decision...to my surprise Eisenhower's chapters are just a rewrite of that with a a decent amount of the same sentences or structure interdispersed between the books.

We have used many Graco products in the past and felt that this seat would suit our needs. I love the leveling bar that the seat has, it takes all of the guess work out of installation. However, we found that it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to adjust the straps when the seat is in the rear facing position. By the time you worked your hand down to the strap lever, the seat wasn't tight in the car anymore. After a week of struggling with this seat, we returned it and purchased the Evenflo Triump 5 (with the rollers on the side to adjust the straps) and we love it.Overall, I think that this would be a good seat for forward facing, but it's not very easy to use for rear facing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"We registered for this because Baby Bargains recommended it. What a disappointment. It is cheaply made. Our son was visibly uncomfortable in it. He always got sweaty sitting against the fake \\"leather\\" trim.

I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to adjust the straps","review":"We are very disappointed with the Graco ComfortSport. When it is rear-facing, it is extremely difficult to adjust the straps, especially to make them bigger. We actually found it easier to take the carseat out to loosen the straps and then reinstall it. Hopefully this will improve when we switch to forward-facing next month, but if not, we will be buying a new carseat. I would not recommend this product. We used the Graco infant carseat and loved it, but this one has design flaws. We have since heard this complaint from other people too. Everyone we know who has the Britax raves about how wonderful it is. It costs more, but I wish we had bought that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this car seat as a second one for my husband's car.

It is impossible to adjust the straps when it is rear facing. My son crys every time I put him in it. He just looks so uncomfortable. The other car seat I have is the Britax Marathon, which I love. My advice, spend the extra money for a Britax you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ComfortSport I'm Comfortable With","review":"My baby girl is small, however when she outgrew her rear facing Graco car seat (which I was very happy with), I wanted to find a similar Graco product to replace it. The ComfortSport newborn/toddler carseat was difficult to install rear facing, and difficult to adjust the straps that loosen and tighten. However, since this was only effective for 3 months before she hit the 20 lb, 1 year old, wt./age mark, I wouldn't say that it was a big issue. Once we turned the seat forward facing the install (using the LATCH system) was a breeze, and we had no problem adjusting the straps. The seat fits nice and secure in my car and my daughter appers to be comfortable in it. I also love how easy it is to wash the cover for the seat, it velcros on and off so you don't have to take the seat out of your car (car seats get so crapped up from sippy cup spills and food crumbs) it's nice to be able to wash it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe","review":"This car seat is so so. I had bought it for my little girl because of the extra cushion and the fact that it was a Graco. Well, I returned it. The straps never seemed to work.

It is kind of stiff when you first get it, and difficult to get the visor into, but this goes away after about a week.

The leather is soft and it securely holds the Visor in place. The only downside is it doesn't include a stylus holder and the velcro strap that doesn't work that well on this leather case. I returned mine and got the blue leather case that features a snap-on closure (which works very well) and a stylus holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"The case is completely worth getting. I was sick and tired of pulling the visor out of the case and taking the cover off each time. The case makes it as easy as it can ever be with the protection it also provides.

I wound up putting only one or two business cards in there at a time.The biggest problem came the first time I dropped it. (No matter how non-clumsy you are, you WILL drop your PDA at some point.!!) The minute I did, the innovative pins at the bottom that allow the clip-in, clip-out retaining action snapped off cleanly, rendering the case absolutely useless.Why oh why couldn't Visor have designed a flip cover onto their PDA!?!?!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handspring Visors are great, but their cases are junky...","review":"The case that came with my Handspring fell apart after less than two months of use, so while I'm an unabashed fan of the Visor, I'd recommend you buy your case elsewhere.Check out Franklin Covey's line of cases - they're all better quality, and their return policy is MUCH nicer in case the thing turns out to be poorly made. They also offer instutitional/corporate discounts for many big companies.I bought a black leather clip-on from Franklin Covey and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"slim\\" to be usable","review":"I bought this with my first PDA...a Visor Pro...and didn't give a the design of the case a lot of thought as I was caught up in the excitement of ordering my new toy.When my items arrived, I found the cover for the PDA can't be used with this case. That wouldn't bother me, but without the cover, the buttons on the PDA get pushed, or something, with normal usage (just carrying it around my office). I found I lost data--the dreaded re-set--and had to restore the PDA every couple of days.At first, I thought something was wrong with the PDA but I found that if I keep the cover on it, everything's fine.

This band has some awesome influences, but the music they make (at least on this album) is neither their own, nor is it anywhere near being as good as the sounds that they are emulating. All of these songs sound the same, and the lyrics are completely uninspired. I got this album for free from a friend who hated it, and after a few painful listens, I passed it on to another friend. If you want to hear something that sounds like the Everly Brothers or the Jesus & Mary Chain, listen to those bands.

I thought it was brilliant. \\"Chain Gang\\" fell short of my expectations. I won't delve into the trivial \\"they sound like Jesus and Mary Chain\\" chatter, because they don't. I kinda wish they did. This album sounds like they cleaned up for the music industry. It also sounds like they threw a bunch of songs together in a hurry. The guitar work is not as innovative.

You can get the same effect by playing scratched beach music records from the 50s and 60s that you'd find in a second hand store. So what is the point to pretentiously create a low-fidelity sound in modern times? Marketing tactics using beatnick nostalgic packaging and hyped ads in the music magazines do not guarantee quality. And yes, they do sound like bad Jesus and Mary Chain! (And Jesus and Mary Chain was b-a-a-a-a-d) I think the vote is out on this one folks.

This episode is very interesting and very original. Some people have complained that no religious civilization would have prevented their own existence by changing their past. My response to that is well maybe they weren't religious and therefore did not have to worry about an afterlife. If you think about it, the planet lives on forever because its history is constantly being changed. Brilliant! I wish I had thought of that great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best final episodes","review":"The first season of Star Trek was great, but the series became less interesting, with only occasional outstanding episodes. This is the only episode I know of that does not take place at all on the Enterprise, and has the crew land on a planet that is highly civilized and Earthlike, but nevertheless, has no concept of space travel. Kirk, McCoy, and Spock land inside a building that has a vast collection of CD's (yes, they look like it!) from the planets past history and have the one sole citizen of the planet choose a time in history to go back to. He is not aware that they are not citizens, even with Spock's ears an obvious sign as an alien, and tells them they must evacuate to the past before the planet blows up. Kirk accidentally ends up in a Salem-type society and McCoy and Spock end up in the Ice Age with a beautiful woman who was banished there. The three must find their way back to the library before the planet is destroyed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock'n'roll isn't the Devil's music - _this_ is...","review":"What can you say.

It is human nature to have moments of self-doubt, feeling like one does not fit in. This story offers an alternative perspective. Stephanie Michele is a compassionate caregiver to Fondo, the geese, and the Throwaway people. Instead of focusing on the external flaws that many might notice, i.e., blindness, homelessness, abandonment, Stephanie Michele sees past these things and realizes the inward beauty of both humans and animals. She also cultivates the imagination of a young boy and allows him to dream, something that helps Fondo cope with his family and educational struggles. All children can benefit from a healthy imagination and the ability to dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless tale of love between humans and animals","review":"This story of love between a boy and a blind Canada goose is a beautiful one and sadly, a connection that society is destroying with lies.

In addition to creating the classic rock staple tune \`Hold On' they are known as the springboard for ubiquitous mediocrity Paul Carrack, who spread his particular brand of blandness in later years through bands like Squeeze and Mike And The Mechanics (he also, tragically, released a series of solo albums that I have thankfully never heard). Though this is a \`best of' collection, there is little to recommend here, \`Rock N Roll Runaway' is an ok track, but hardly worth the price of admission. The rest of the tunes (including the disappointingly overplayed \`How Long') are innocuous at best, more often, they are grating. Fans of schlock pop bands like Fleetwood Mac or Phil Collins may enjoy the disc, but why not simply buy another Huey Lewis album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"Don't expect too much from this flashlight.

You get these dry flaky mint leaves mixed in with this round ball style green tea. There's more mint leaf than green tea in the ratio it seems, although the green is more compact so who knows.. It's a nice mix - a bit stronger than plain mint tea, but lighter than a straight green/jasmine tea. Mint is the overriding flavor; the green somehow gives it a stronger body.

I promptly bought the CD and have enjoyed it ever since. It was made back in 1959 when, as the liner notes state: \\"...there are also several spots where Frank Wess, Herbie Mann, and Jerome Richardson make the case for the coming of age of the jazz flute.\\" Some forty years later I believe that it's safe to say that Herbie Mann became the most popular of these flutists having traveled the world over and becoming one of the first true \\"world musicians.\\" However, one cannot overlook the contribution Frank Wess has made either. He is a product of the Count Basie band where he played flute and tenor sax.But, to get back to the music, I think if I had to choose a one word description, it would be \\"boyant.\\" This is really good, swingin', toe tappin' music that you can listen to while reading, cleaning the house or to focus on just the music itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"They leak.","review":"2 D cells in a Maglight flashlight.

Over the course of four years we live with her as she grows in both her mind and her body. From an innocent eleven year old tomboy to a moral young woman, Suse captures the hearts of her readers with her perceptions and unfolding knowledge.

Indeed, while these were the best ideas at the time when the language lacked a lot of features, they are now considered *worst* practices, and are of little use.

The instrumental version is nice if you can sing well and is also good music for if you are having a party. \\"From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart\\"- Ospina's Millennium Funk Mix is a good song to chill out and \\"Deep In My Heart\\" is an OK song by Britney but not one of her best. Overall, a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops...Britney Spears has done it again!","review":"Britney Spears is just the best singer in the world. Not only can she sing, but boy, she can dance too. I love her new single: \\"Oops...I Did It Again.\\" I bet it will be the next platinum hit following \\"...Baby One More Time\\", but a lot better and funkier. I just want to take this opportunity to encourage all Britney's fan (like me) to buy her single and also her new album! It's going to be real awesome, seeing Britney kicking everyone off the charts and getting right to the top! She has a real sweet, cute voice that I bet those people who didn't know about her will soon indulge in her soothing music.. She is absolutely beautiful too!

This cd just put me right to sleep. It was a waste of money. I can't stand putting it in my cd player. The only thing this cd is good for is putting me to sleep, and levling my table.

Unless at exactly the right tension the wheel shakes frighteningly or is too stiff for maneuver. If you are running shaking can start suddenly enough to make you fall over and give your baby a big shock.The locking position sets the wheel in place but makes the jogger so difficult to change direction it's of little use.The help line is useless. They had me on hold until hanging up, several times.The lock nut finally fell off and we will try and install our own with locking ring, together with now missing bearings.I would recommend people don't buy this until they fix the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish we'd done more research","review":"We've used this stroller (In a different color, with matching carseat) for 4 months now. I'll never buy 'Baby Trend' brand again.Cons:Heavy; cumbersome to fold/unfold (takes both hands & a foot); bulky when folded; latch that keeps it folded is flimsy & designed improperly (the stroller can fold much tighter than the latch will allow); tires don't hold air; canopy doesn't pivot fully forward (a problem when the sun is in baby's eyes); and saving the worst for last - the swivel front wheel shakes on demand when you're trying to push in a straight line, so you have to stop completely & start again, hoping it doesn't shake. The only way around this is to lock the front wheel in place, but then you have to tilt back to turn, which causes baby's head to flop forward when using the carseat.Pros:Seems to ride smoothly.

Scattershot choice of topics.","review":"A very fast read -- a book I haven't wanted to put down. I was tempted to skip class to read it -- and I'm the professor! Pool's other book (What Jane Austen Ate and Dickens Knew) is like a research summary. Although it's good also, and well written, it has less to offer to the nonspecialist than this book, which manages to extract good storytelling from what must be quite fragmentary source materials. For scholarly purposes, Pool's chapters could be better focused; also, in general, he seems vague and scattershot on time period. Writing about Victorian lending libraries, he gives pre-Victorian opinions on them (such as from Jane Austen). If he's going to verge into the Romantic period, there's some good scandalous literary and publishing history therefrom (esp. relating to Byron and Scott) that might fit in this book. I feel its absence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mistitled but informative and fun cultural study","review":"Let's get this straight right off the bat: Daniel Pool's book is purposefully mistitled to make you think that it would be a sequel of sorts to his extremely useful and popular compendium of facts important to Victorian fiction WHAT CHARLES DICKENS ATE AND JANE AUSTEN KNEW. This book is very different: it reads like a straightforward narrative, and it's an enjoyable, gossipy, and onformative account of the demands of the publishing market in the mid-Victorian world of the novel, and how it created the careers of Dickens, the Bronts, Trollope, Thackeray, George Eliot, etc. The mistitling (undoubtedly to make the book sell better) is thus quite appropriate, in that the novel helpfully etails the ways in which publishing conventions of the time (the rise of Mudie's lending library, the convention of the three-decker) made and shaped literary careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victorian Letters 101","review":"This is a fun book to read.

That is to say, the text is present, with headings for subsections. However, there is no numbering, which makes navigation very difficult. There is no mention of a translator. No critical introduction. This book is the equivalent of an online text with no source references. It merely saves you the trouble of printing off a few hundred pages.

Epictetus offers a concise guide on the stoic philosophy which allowed him to endure a life of slavery and hardship during the reign of Nero. Does he answer the big questions? Well i can only say that to me he did not answer the question on how to be truly happy (well actually he did I just have trouble accepting his answer), but he does answer the question the question - how do we avoid disappointed in our life, how do we avoid being sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epictetus's eternal insight","review":"Epictetus offer's insightful observations about the power of the will, and the affects of external events on our emotions. It strikes me as so fascinating that this man, who lived so long in the past, still rings true today when he speaks of how the path of virtue and happiness rest within ourselves, and no one or nothing can, or should change that.The only critique I have with the book, or should I say Epictetus proper, is that his dissertations are in the translation of the time, and they don't quite make sense from the modern viewpoint. In addition, some of his dissertations ramble on a bit, and you read them knowing you will find bits and pieces of insight within them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epictetus - The best translation I found","review":"Having developed an interest in Epictetus, I bought a translation of his works, and was sorely disappointed. The wording was awkward, and phrasing often confusing or difficult to understand.This particular book was the third version of the Discourses I purchased, and I was delighted to find it understandable and enjoyable reading. You also get the complete works of Epictetus (The Discourses, Enchiridion, and Fragments), a nice bonus. I have not looked at every translation available, but I can recommend this one as well done.As for the review complaining about many typo's, I'm not sure that he is talking about this particular book. Two other translations that I bought were absolutely mangled and virtually unreadable.

Only the wisdom of Epictetus keeps me from tossing this copy in the trash.

I cuts through any grass very easily and some smaller other growth. Fro the money, I couldn't be happier. The charger makes storage easy. Two things I would change. The string is .08 which is a little thin, but I guess helps the battery last so long. I have replaced the string that came with it with a square string to help with cutting. Also, the Worx GT has a guide wheel on it for edging. The Yardstick would benefit from that. Some of the bad reviews I read said the guard falls off easily. Not a problem with me.

It does the job well, making short work of weeds with pencil sized stems, no fumes, and no noise. Sure it's sort of heavy, but no more than a gas one. If it were light it would be too flimsy to do the job. I have only used it a few times and I left it always off the charger until it was weak, which was about a month. Maybe the key is that with rechargeable items, you must let them run down so rhey get a full charge. It's that way with other rechargeable items.

I have the more powerful gas trimmers for heavier jobs, but I'm an older woman with back problems and find the yardstick easier to handle for everyday use as I can pick it up and trim a little here and there.

In the first place when the battery goes bad in about a year you cant get replacements from the company. In the second place before the battery goes out the thing begins to fall about starting with the shroud that is supposed to cut the line.

Other than these things its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit is heavy, quit working after 3 months","review":"I probably only used this trimmer for 4 hours. I found the weight a large factor.

I use battery operated equipment for all of my woodworking needs (hand saw, jig saw, drill, etc) and they work great with plenty of power and good quality. That's not what you get with this trimmer though. If I could give no stars I would.After 1 month the handle broke - how are you supposed to use this without a good handle? We duct-taped it the best we could because it was either that or buy a new trimmer right away.After 2 months the plastic gaurd piece broke (where the string feeds out).Finally, the power is not sufficient to even trim to my small front yard (typical city lot) so that I eventually went back to a gas-powered weed eater.

The trimmer is attractive and balanced well, and the battery lasts long enough for me to work for almost an hour, which is great. Beyond that, I can't say much in favor of this item. The spool of line jams constantly--I've switched the spool and that doesn't help. Every five or ten seconds I have to manually pull off the spool and advance the line by hand. The bumping mechanism is really poorly designed. The line has also broken the plastic guard at the end, so I'll replace it before selling this used or giving it away.

MORE duct tape and it was stumbling along once again.Then, early the second year, the plastic bump-feed part also broke so now the line has to be manually pulled out (and that is a big pain).I do not recommend this trimmer at all - it is 95% plastic and lousy plastic at that.

Within 20 minutes of using it, it basically self-destructed. I've used many weed wackers. It first impressed me as being underpowered and with a small cutting radius, but I got the hang of using it. Then the cord broke off (as they often do). I took off the spool, re-extended the cord, and replaced the spool. When I turned it on and the cord hit the cutter (which trims the cord to length), instead of cutting the cord, it merely grabbed it, which then bent the cutter out of the way, and then the cord proceeded to smash up the protective plastic shield.

I once ordered a new blade-cutting unit after breaking mine. It was inexpensive and shipping super fast. The string used in this trimmer far outlasts any of the smaller guage lines I've used in other trimmers.

I have actually done my lawn a couple times without charging it. I think this would even be ideal for tackling a single family house with a much bigger lawn than mine based on the endurance of this 24 volt battery. I don't think I'll ever go back to gas trimmers after using this. Dealing with the oil/gas mixture and trying to keep the thing running year after year is a real pain with gas trimmers.

Third the trimmer advertises you may turn it around and use it as an edger. Well you can turn it around but forget edging with it. Every time I attempted this the line broke off inside the head. I had to stop, take off the line spool, fish out the line and start over. This occurred every time I tried it as an edger. Last it is underpowered. I used it for about 30 minutes.

It becomes a nice duet, allowing Miles to sound very pure, melodic and even cooler than usual. Style is so important to Miles, and I think Monk would have just cluttered it here. This has to be one of the best \\"Cool Jazz\\" blues grooves recorded. Monk does solo and comp with the other soloists later. Milt's solo is wonderful as well. The other benefit? With Monk sitting out, it lets us amateur pianists comp along on an F blues to Miles, with Percy Heath and Kenny Clark helping you out.

What is left is some fairly exciting spotlight features: the two versions of the title track, with Milt Jackson on vibes, catch fire, and Sonny and Miles sound inspired on \\"Airegin\\" and \\"Doxy,\\" respectively.

Speaking of the Beatles, Tomorrow's rocked-up version of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is actually quite listenable, and not the travesty one might expect.

They aren't made to really affect you in any way, but moreover are created to hopefully illuminate the careers of either some budding young actors, or rekindle those of some Hollywood has-beens! Well, 'The 13th Child' doesn't do either for either genre it's sad to say as this flick is about as scary as watching the lastest cartoon 'Scooby-Doo Mystery' and about as absorbing as watching paint dry! That said, the only bright spot of the flick is the over-acting by ex-'Soap' star Robert Guillaume! And if you blink you'll miss the beautiful Lesley-Anne Down in her 3 minute role!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"Simply put, Varese disappointed me when they put this one out in '98.

I bought this CD based on listening to 1 of R. williams songs and unfortunately we hated the CD. He adds too much flourish to really nice songs and winds up ruining the piece.

Garmin replaced the unit and I had the same problems with a new one. It was locking up without any reason, erasing saved data, battery did not last more than 30 minutes, was operating very slow, constantly loosing signal (outdoor!). I really wanted it to work, I liked the idea of PDA/GPS - but that was not the case. Garmin has terrible customer service!!! Late on e-mail responses, and try to call them - you will be on the phone for more than 30 minutes before you will speak to anyone. Most of the times they suggest to call them some other time.

So, just as fair warning, If you want a SOUNDTRACK, it doesn't exist. Go get the singles. This is the music from the fight scenes and such.

But nooo, we get cheated into this lame CD with nothing but background, poor music that leaves enough room in the CD for tracks containing the cool techno stuff.

The lack of the good techno music from the beginning of the movie was a huge disappointment, the lack of which makes this album pretty mediocre ,even with the other two good themes.

The CD is actually what is traditionally known as a movie score -- that is, a collection of instrumental pieces that were written specifically to enhance the effect of certain scenes in the movie. Not that the score was unbearably bad, (although I didn't care for it much -- it was sort of \\"New Age\\" classical -- not my type of music) but it just wasn't what I had expected.

After working through Pharr, I could and did read the Iliad and the Odyssey in Greek, with the help of a lexicon. They are much much better in Greek than in any translation I've ever read. (One must also practice reading Homer aloud.) With a little work (learning not to miss the elided vowels), one can then read classic Greek, such as Herodotus. It is a pity that schools no longer emphasize these languages and what they teach about the structure of language. It is great to see Pharr here, and I highly recommend it to the diligent. If one does not understand the concept of inflection, however, and have the patience to learn the Greek alphabet, Pharr may be a frustrating exercise. If you succeed, however, and memorize a few lines here and there, you'll never regret it. \\"En de pithoi oinoio....\\" Homer is so incredibly human and real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, old-fashioned, no-nonsense!","review":"Excellent book, but I'm really writing to correct Amazon's listing of the editor as \\"Photographer.\\" This is not a picture book.

So, at least, now YOU know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"This book is the worst excuse for a text book I have ever come across. The explanations of Greek grammar and spelling are mostly incomprehensible. I would recomend that a beginner start with any other book he or she can find on the Epic dialect. The reference section in the back, however, is a good as the grammar section is bad. It is the best quick-find reference I have seen. I use it constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-round excellent!","review":"I learned ancient greek before I bought this book, so I can't speak to how well it serves someone just learning the language. Basically, I was a few years out of school and wanted to refresh my Greek. It really served me well, and actually gave me a better mastery of Homer's language than I ever had in college. I highly recommend it to anyone. I would say to beginners that Homeric Greek is the correct approach to learning ancient Greek: first, starting with Homer is a better foundation for learning later dialects than vice versa; second the Iliad (and Odyssey) introduces a beginner to characters, themes, phrases, and other allusions that fill nearly all later Greek literature to some extent; third, the Iliad is simply a damn good story that reads even better in the original. Expand your experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alive & Well Recorded not of this earth","review":"I am short of words to describe this Karl Jenkins, John Marshall and John Etheridge Soft Machine. This is SM sound as conceived and delivered by this crew. It would be an unfair comparison with the SM Third line-up. This material stands on its own. Every musician here seems to be performing a dissertation on Soft Machine course 101 \\"Performing Live\\" with utmost brilliancy devoid of pompousness and pretentiousness. This is SM at its professional peak. The end track Soft Space is a reprieve to the intensity of this live album. This is reminiscent of Giorgio Moroder style instrumentals and would play well in dance parties or intro theme for News shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting A Little Chilly","review":"Well played,well recorded, yet unimaginative. This music is more like a new agey Windham Hill type band only with more furious Al Dimeola style electric guitar. This was basically an \\"in name only\\" Soft Machine, with just about all it's core members gone save for Karl Jenkins(and he's not an original Soft either) who has forsaken any horn playing and stuck to keyboards here. Guitarist John Etheridge is a shredder without the personality and voice of an Alan Holdsworth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"I love gothic romances and Jill Tattersoll is one of the best. This book was such an enjoyable read - the mystery was very engaging and for once I didn't skip to the back to see what happens.

(I get them with regular shoes, but I was hoping these would stop that)I suppose if you're playing on grass or fake grass they might be ok but any hard surface I would avoid these sneakers.

Breakdown:CLASSIC:adidas Men's Samba Classic Soccer Shoe- Larger tongue- easier to slip on/off- medium/enhanced arch support. If you wear air-soled running shoes, you probably won't even notice. Personally, I'm NOT A FAN.- The arch support has changed in the last 3 years (the last time I bought this pair). Be warned!ORIGINALS:adidas Originals Men's Samba Reflective Sneaker- Smaller tongue- Old-school arch support (meaning flatter/next to none). I have worn nothing but Chucks and older Sambas happily for many years, and identify with the barefoot-running crowd, so for me, flatter is better.- Harder to slip on/off, but once it's on, it fits like a glove!- Yes, they squeak like everyone says. Doesn't bother me, but then again I'm not a movie usher, burglar or otherwise occupied in the skulking arts.Some people will prefer one over the other. For me, the clear winner is ORIGINALS."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"classic\\" - a dererved name","review":"Indoor soccer shoes come and go but the Samba goes on forever. This shoe design has been around since the 1980's. There are hard-wearing shoes; the soles have great grip and won't wear down easily.

The price was great, cause I never find them on sale. I am looking forward to ordering the white with black stripes as well. And I will most likely be ordering another pair of these for the future. Buy yourself a pair, totally worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality Control","review":"I received my pair of size 13 shoes quickly after ordering. Upon trying my shoes on I noticed that the left shoe didn't fit at all like the right shoe. Upon inspection of the shoes I noticed that both shoe claimed to be size 13 as posted on their tongue tags. Next I put the shoes sole to sole and notice a dramatic size difference. The left shoe was 1 to 1.5 inches smaller than the right shoe.

Buy this style with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, versatile, practical","review":"I bought my first pair of Sambas 9 months ago. The majority of my decision to buy black Sambas was for the look: classic, simple. I had intended to wear them occasionally for events that may last 3 or 4 hours, tops. When I wore them for the first time, I could not believe how comfortable they are. This was an unexpected bonus.Sambas are comfortable, versatile, and with the reasonable price, they are practical.Now, 9 months later, I've purchased another pair. If Adidas keeps making Sambas, I will always have at least one pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shoe Ever","review":"I have bought Samba's for the past 3-4 years, they are that comfortable. i would highly recommend trying these atleast once. the sizing is pretty close to accurate and the width stuff just ignore unless it is the extra wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i needed","review":"I use these shoes for Tai Chi.

This is easily my fourth pair over the years because these things wear like iron and last forever. My last pair were falling apart after several seasons of indoor soccer and general usage.

I can feel the arch part of the insole against my foot whereas I do not have this feeling with the first good pair or even on the other shoe of the replacement pair. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Style","review":"This pair is at least my tenth pair of samba classics I have owned. What keeps me buying them over and over again is the comfort, style, and functionality of the shoe. As a soccer player my first pair was purchased to use for indoor soccer but they made their way into my closet as an everyday shoe. They are comfortable enough play a full game on turf or to wear casually for hours at a time. The black shoe with three white stripes on the side is a classic adidas design that looks good with anything. The reason I have had to purchase so many pairs has nothing to do with the quality of the shoe but because these are the shoe I will put on 8/10 times, I usually end up with a new pair about once every year and nothing looks and feels better than having on a fresh pair of sambas."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comfortable would purchase again","review":"Very comfortable and just what I needed for my kettlebell cross training classes.

Sorrow, Part 2","review":"Although it's not any part of the conceptual storyline of S.F. Sorrow, I feel the music is very similar to the S.F./Parachute-era Pretty Things. The bratty days of the Pretties were closing out,a nd more of the paisley wiggy of their mid-era was phasing in. To me, the highlight was the single \\"Talkin' About The Good Times\\". Signature Pretties all the way...with mellotron and sitar typical of the late Sixties era...and those lush higher register with a touch of Brit angst vocals. Some of the latter stuff sounds a little muddy towards the end of side two (I have the Harvest Heritage vinyl issue), like they might have been out takes from the Freeway Madness era."},{"rating":"2","title":"good compilation","review":"a very good collection that compliments sf sorrow and parachute(three of the tracks are on these albums) very well. the pretty things should be a part of every 60s fan's collection. there are a couple of weak tracks but in general this is a pretty good introduction to the group and the rarities on this cd include some of the pretty things best work: defecting grey(a truly awesome piece of english psychedelia), talkin' about the good times, cold stone, circus mind, and october 26 to name just a few.if you like early pink floyd, tomorrow, the move, and groups like that you'll like this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Driveway Lanterns","review":"Best motion senser lights available, not only do they fully light with motion but you can set them to turn on at dusk for various lengths of time.Only drawback is that the motion sensers cannot be replaced, you have toreplace the entire lantern.

Also it's pitiful that she's been with Carson, Eminem, and Fred in the span of 6 months that you were popular and she is so NASTY for posing like that on the Rolling Stone!

While a theme of displacement echoes profoundly, it is not handled well, and certainly far from the comedic glimpse into tribal life promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flashlight","review":"This is a great little flashlight. Not amazingly bright, but very bright for such a small flashlight. It is about as bright as my 2AA mini maglite. The flexible cable is nice and sturdy.The only other thing is the AAAA batteries that it takes... they can be kind of pricey. I recommend getting 9-volt batteries instead.

The music lifted the movie from merely \\"pretty good\\" to \\"very good,\\" and the CD is flawlessly produced. On a good stereo system, it sounds like George Clinton is right there in your listening room! If you listen carefully, at one point you'll hear a few bars of the music from Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Vertigo\\" -- a sly hint that the movie itself is closely patterned on Hitch's favorite theme of the ordinary man caught in a web of deception. A truly excellent disc; its only flaw is that it's too short. As others have noted, some of the music used in the soundtrack does not appear on the CD, and I have to wonder why. Oh, well, it's still a great CD. Rent the movie first and then buy the soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting ;-)","review":"The reason I love this soundtrack so much is because firstly, I quite liked the movie, but secondly (and mainly) I love haunting music and this is it. When I first saw the movie at the theatre, I was struck by the haunting humming and the funky music. This is a great soundtrack. Idealy it's not really the kind you listen to all the time, but it's enjoyable to listen to every now and then when you want to relax. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent tracks","review":"I just purchased this CD and I have to say its like no other I've ever heard. The music is so addictive and something that I always find myself putting on in the car when I'm driving just to the store. I really enjoyed George S. Clinton's tracks on this CD. Just the eery music score is something that you don't find all the time and I really enjoy listening to this CD as much as possible. Now that I have the CD it seems the movie is on cable tv all the time. I still enjoy the music anyway.

I listened to it a lot. A lot! And today, it still stands as the one album where Eurythmics did limit the electronic sound enough to make a great ROCK album.The brilliant songs nearly stumble over each other on the A side of the vinyl version. The atmospheric Missionary Man where Annie Lennox already shows the treasures of her exceptionally great voice. The simply good poprock song Thorn In My Side. The outrageous rocker When Tomorrow Comes. The beautiful, souldeepening, heartfelt ballad The Miracle Of Love.The B side, or the second half of the CD, makes the album fade a bit. But the quality of the first songs is so high that Revenge is worth a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missionary Man Leads the Way","review":"Despite what the amazon review says, \\"Missionary Man\\" WAS a hit single, and a grammy award winner for the duo (Best Rock Performance by a duo/group-1987).

Guitar work from Dave is spirited. Overall a good cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eurythmics go rock","review":"This album showed a change of style for The Eurythmics. They moved away from their usual synth/electronic sound, and went more rock. Not a bad album, pretty good really, but a lot of Eurythmic fans were a little disappointed. But there are still a lot of typical Eurythmic touches throughout...'The Miracle of Love' uses a synthesizer, and Annie's vocals are still 'Annie'. Maybe not as many memorable songs on here as in previous albums, but still a must for any true Eurythmics fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's missing here.","review":"Even with the 30 minutes of music on the CD, it is enough to tell that this score is definately not one of Goldsmith's better ones.

My French isn't bad, but this book even tells you what chicken \\"a la provencale\\" actually means. It doesn't just translate it as \\"chicken, prepared the way they do in Provence.\\" I found it to be so reliable that I have just ordered the Italy Menu Master for my next trip. My only slight concern with it was the food is grouped only by \\"meat,\\" \\"fish,\\" etc. So if you don't know what type of food something on the menu is, it can be a little hard to find.

The movie is a silent film from the 1920s that reenacts famous historical scenes starting with the Bible and working its way up through the Spanish Inquisition, World War I, etc. in order to present scenes in which Satan was active in bringing down the human race. I was expecting a horror movie, but it was much better than that. Satan would never be obvious and the people he was tempting were seldom easily led. It's a complicated and beautifully-made and acted movie about the choices people make with the Devil waiting for them to err."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS JUST PLAIN AWFUL","review":"i expected to see the keystone cops or laruel & hardyvery boring with only just piano in the background awful awful i would not pay a plug nickel for thispiece of garbage and to think they approved this to let movie goers see this?this is only jmo don't like too many silent ones.btw i forgot to mention sorry, that i watched about ten minuets of this on turner classic movies underground. totally really bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"A shower curtain","review":"I did not purchase this product on Amazon.The material is cheap shower curtain type vinyl.

He goes on and on in a hard to read, conversational (infomercial) style simply trying to convince me that he knows my problem and he knows how to solve it. The first few chapters are 100% sales. The final chapters are recipes.The jist of the book is this: work out very hard using specific equipment (that you may have to go to a gym to find) a couple days a week and eat a high protein, very low sugar diet and you'll lose a lot of weight. There. That's the book.The diet seems to be an unbalanced diet that in the long run will be detrimental to your health.Needless to say I am disappointed, but I didn't return the book.

There is a book out by Adam Zickerman and Bill Schley that is called the Power of 10, that was published in 2003. This is the same concept as the 12 second sequence. They even recommend the 2 times a week workout and then you can go down to 1 time a week. Again, it is exactly the same elements. Slow, controlled movements. You do 10 seconds into the exercise and 10 seconds down. So if you are doing an arm curl, you slowly, controlled, move the arm up for 10 counts and then repeat down for a very slow, controlled 10. Again, this book was published in 2003, so sorry Jorge, this is not a new concept.

I was pleasantly surprised with the fairness and respect that Burkett afforded her subjects.My only complaint is that the section on religious women in America focused too heavily on \\"fundamentalist\\" Christians. An expanded chapter on American Muslims, as well as a chapter on Orthodox Jewish women would have been much more interesting and representative.It may be asking too much, but it would be nice to see this book, or sections of it, included in women's studies classes. The voice of the conservative woman is too often dismissed, and Burkett's book is a much needed forum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info, fun read","review":"Ms. Burkett has written a very entertaining book that is half political analysis and half human interest. I thought she gave a very objective, journalistic report of what is REALLY going on in the mind of the US women.

The initial wearing of the shoe was painful, pinching at pressure points on the foot. After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably, but obviously not for very long.

I am very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shoe!","review":"The Skechers Alley Cat is a great all-around shoe...comfortable enough to wear walking or hiking, but dressy enough to wear with khakis and a button down.

The boots are kind of heavy and not the most comfortable shoes you'll ever wear but I can't complain for the money.

As a young black man, Wright endured abuses by arrogant white co-workers and was even hit with a bottle for failing to call a white man \\"sir.\\" Unhappy with the Jim Crow south, Wright left for Chicago where racial abuses were lesser, but poverty remained.

Even the best authors are limited when writing strictly about their own lives. But Black Boy reads as a wonderful novel as well as an autobiography. Especially worthwhile is the restored second half in which Wright really comes to understand that racism is not eradicated in the North either and limitations still exist everywhere. Black Boy is worth reading as both a moving memoir of childhood and a scathing indictment of an entire country inflicted by racism. A must read classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!!!! !!!!!","review":"\\"Black Boy\\" is a narrative that was superbly written. I read the book as part of my humanities grade. When I saw the book it caught my eye but I wasn't really interested in reading it. Once I started reading no one could pry my eyes away from the book.

I found this book extremely interesting because I don't ever get to see the world through a person like Mr. Wright's eyes. In fact, before reading it, I had not ever even heard of Richard Wright. I just picked this up off the shelf in the bookstore on a whim. Glad I did! I was also very impressed with Mr. Wright's life, as summarized in the back of the book: what a remarkable man. The thing that struck me the most about him was how hard it was to be true to himself and his own perceived ideals in the face of racism and others of his own race who could not overcome the fear or muster the strength to do the same. Too bad we aren't all like that, but I guess that's why we have role models. Mr. Wright certainly is one, in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I read Black Boy years ago and wanted to refresh my memory of the book.

Richard wright is definately one of my fav authors, wheather the book is Black Boy, or Native son, or any of his other fine Novels, he is definately one of the great authors.

Book is divided into two sections, the first about young Wright in the South, and the second about his experiences as a young man in Chicago.Some brilliant writing, and heart-wrenching sequences when Wright is a young boy, facing the racism of the South, and dealing with poverty. His love of books and writing is a fascinating journey to watch unfold.For me, the second part, \\"American Hunger\\" was not on the same par as the first, \\"Southern Night.\\" The focus here was largely on the Communist party, and not as enthralling for me. Although the revelations of the politics of black communists was interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will teach everyone of the hardships of a negro.","review":"I wasn't too sure about this book at first, which is why it wasn't one of my choices. I mean, it sounded interesting, but not enough so that I'd want to read it. I ended up reading it anyways, since I didn't like my other choice plus there were a lot of recommendations from others reading Black Boy by Richard Wright, so I read it and was glad that I did. It was hard to stop reading because I got really into it, and it's the type of book to read more than once. It's so well written that it should be a required book, especially since it's educational in the racial experience of a young black boy growing up with racism, which the story is named after."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful portrayl of African American youth.","review":"This novel tells of the hardships African Americans faced. In one part of the book, Richard is to fight a boy that he doesn't hate. They made an agreement to go easy on each other, but when it came down to the real blows, the punches are hard. Richard wins, but later he is not happy at all. This is a great novel to educate you about the prejudices of the time, and show you that even though much has changed, it hasn't change enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading","review":"This is one of the most moving books that I have read. Its message stays with you and motivates you to considered thought about it long after you have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is Better","review":"I bought this for my son who had to read it for a school assignment. We were going on a car trip and he thought it might be good to listen to in the car rather than reading the book. The book-on-tape (CD) is very slow moving and after just a few chapters, he reverted to the actual book. The reader is slow and plods along and its actually quicker to read the real book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was very interesting and knowledgable.","review":"This book can give you a different view of how AfricanAmericans were treated during the 1700's. Richard Wright illustratethis point very well by using his own experiences during his childhood as an African American. Every event he describe in this novel was very powerful and inspiring. You can really feel like you are in the scene while you are reading this book. Throughout this novel he was able to make your emotions go up and down using the characters in this book. For example, you can really feel for the mother and child throughout this novel. This book is a very good book for an Ethnic class because you can really see the experiences African Americans had to go through before the fourteen amendment was created. The fourteen amendment abolished slavery which gave African Americans the chance of freedom. In my opinion, this book was extraordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like learning about the black experience","review":"This was a great read, written by a man who grew up in Mississip during Jim Crow. His life was anything but easy, yet he preservered and became a wonderful story teller.Very interesting and informative, would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important- for many reasons","review":"Richard Wright's \\"Black Boy (American Hunger)\\" was an important book to me not only because of understanding I gained of black experience in the rural South and urban North, but also because it caused me to think about myself. Wright's introspection is both powerful and thought-provoking. Few people have the courage to truly look inside themselves and write about who they really are. Similarly, Wright's ability to analyze others is amazing. This book should be requierd reading gor everyone not only because of the way it illuminates the horror of racism and oppression, but so that it serves as a catalyst for people to stop and look inside themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Boy","review":"Paperback in excellent condition. His later followup of the book is also included. Riveting biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Boy","review":"Book ReviewBlack Boy, The Horror and The Glory, by Richard Write, is a very good book. The Horror and the Glory, is part 2 of the book. It's 2 books in one. I have previously read the first book, which is also very good. I enjoyed Richard's explanation of his adventures throughout his life. The different experiences he endured were amazing. My favorite part was when the animals got loose and Bill, Brand, Cooke, and Richard had to put them away before the doctors got back. I think it's very difficult for him to stand all those remarks about his color.I recommend this book to people who enjoy American history and non-fictional books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Boy","review":"As a very poor inner city youth living in Kingston, Jamaica in the 1970's and early 1980's, this book was a guiding star for me.

Works great! I work in a very rural area so streetlights are not even thought of. If there is no moon out then it can get to be pitch black. This light seems like it is almost as powerful as the spotlight on the patrol vehicles. Make sure you keep it charged because once it starts to dim you don't have too much time left. Thinking about a second battery very soon just for that reason. As long as I keep it charged in the car I can usually go through a full shift with no problem.

The overall quality of this flashlight is excellent, as it is very light weight and durable. It's so light weight that I take it out with me every night when it's time to walk the dog before he goes to bed. The recharging station is easily mountable anywhere in your house and can fit in some smaller spaces where you normally couldn't fit anything else. The brilliant light that this model offers is incredible and can only be compared to the intensity that a floodlight can offer. There's no way you can get lost in the dark when you've got this flashlight to light your way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashlight (Streamlight Ultra Stinger)","review":"Pros: Light weight, Bright Light, came with 2 chargers (1 for home, 1 for car).Con: gets approx. 1-1.5 hours in between charges.I have been a home inspector for almost 13 years now and this flashlight is lighter and brighter then any hand held flashlight I have had even my handy rechargable maglite (the maglite which works great when it is working - each one of them have had switch problems and would dim by itself. I would need to tap it to get it to go bright again).So far The streamlight Ultra stinger seems like a better flashlight then what I have had in the past and it defenitly a brighter light (I would recommend an extra battery with a dual charger if you want to use it every day like I have to. So far I think this flashlight is great (I can see further and its brighter meaning less time in an attic).Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra Stinger Flashlight","review":"The Ultra Stinger flashlight is light weight and provides excellent lighting in tight places.

However if you plan on going hiking, camping, or any other activity where you need a prolonged period of light, the charge only lasts an hour. This flashlight works best when you are in law enforcement, big rig driver, fireman, etc. Where you can utilize the charger port. If you do not recharge often after short periods of use the baterry pack will only supply enough charge for one hour!!! Don't get stuck in the woods with this one! But if you only need an hour this will get you out of the woods quick!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let there be light!","review":"When some one says,\\"I need some light\\", the ultra stinger has plenty of power!

OUTRAGEOUS!","review":"I got my Ultrastinger from Amazon today. It has a cracked/torn rubber nipple over the on/off switch, and from all the fingemarks and other tell-tale little marks on it, it's clearly a USED, PRE-OWNED item. Other evidence: the product box was not shrink-wrapped or sealed as it should be, and the battery was fully charged (new flashlights do not come with fully charged NiCad batteries).I am outraged that Amazon would re-ship a returned, defective item, but that's exactly what has happened. This makes me very wary of ordering from them again. I immediately ordered that UPS come to pick this up and take it back at no charge to me. Now I have to \\"wait 7-12 days\\" AFTER they get this POS back before I get a refund. Nice.Also, now that I've seen the way the rubber switch cover fails, I've decided not to get this product anyway.

So I haven't actually seen the whole thing. It's a bunch of interviews with fans who really don't seem very knowledgeable or fanatical about Morrissey. They have trouble remembering the correct titles to His songs. One says he could never remember if \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\" is by The Smiths or Depeche Mode. As expected, there is no music in the film. Really a waste of time. Don't waste yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"mind-blowing electric jazz","review":"This CD contains truly jaw-dropping musicianship. In particular, the first nine minutes of the disk (part one of \\"Hazard Profile\\") will make you smile in joyous disbelief: Holdsworth's seemingly impossible yet mellifluous guitar shredding extends with nary a lull for some six minutes, while Marshall's drumming weaves a complex, groovy foundational beat that, alone, merits full attention.

Randy discusses each circuit in detail explaining the operation and in many cases the reason for his choice of circuits. Complete details of construction are explained with a parts list, schematic, circuit board template and parts layout. The circuits are broken down into small workable units and in many cases can be tested before final assembly. This \\"test as you build\\" method could eliminate extensive trouble shooting when the project is completed. The writing style is clear, orderly, conversational and, occasionaly, humorous. This is an advanced project, however, there are many building tips and suggestions that anyone, beginner or advanced, will find helpful.

As a result, the chapters tend to drag on. \\"God's Debris\\" allowed the reader to relate to the protagonist and feel engaged. The globe-hopping antics of the same character in this book only makes the reader want to skip to the ending.While some interesting ideas are touched on, don't expect another \\"God's Debris,\\" because it isn't \\"The Religion War.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thought-Provoking Quick Read","review":"While there's nothing philosophically profound here, there is a wonderful book with some excellent twists. I generally don't read fiction, but this book grabbed me from the start and I read it every free moment until I was done.Adams portrays the inevitable escalating conflict when 2 opposing worldviews (each held zealously with certitude) reach their conclusion: immoral devastating war.He covers well the concept of how does a deluded person know if he's deluded? He also repeatedly demonstrates, using interesting dialogs, how many people hold beliefs without having thought it through.This is no philosophical tome (we've got enough of them and they do little to open the eyes of the public), but it will provoke thoughts in any zealots (or non-zealot) mind if they were willing to allow it.

In fact, he's on Coltrane's Impulse debut, Africe Brass. In the manner of Curtis Fuller he does some great work on this record as a lead. Between those two I've come to enjoy that instrument far more than I ever have.Of the records McCoy Tyner played on leading up to this one, none foreshadowed exactly where his tone and style were going as much as this one.

Granted, it makes a good, bouncy sendoff from a live show after their pensive arrangement of \\"Silent Night\\", but its very existence proves that these guys could have come up with an upbeat prog lite instrumental that isn't a remake of a traditional Christmas song (e.g. \\"Deck the Halls\\").

Plus you get a couple of tracks that were never available on the original...including Monroe's original tracks, a couple of bonus tracks with Merman and the full track of \\"A Sailor's Just A Sailor.\\" This was Merman's last film musical as well as the last film musical from Irving Berlin. Great songs with great performances by the above as well as dazzling Mitzi Gaynor along with Donald O'Connor and Dan Dailey. I give it 4 stars rather than 5 due to one track which sounds, to my ear, out of sync. Johnny Ray's \\"If You Believe\\" seems to place the vocal a split second off from the musical track.

We understand nothing lasts forever, even the cheaper Microsoft headsets for $20 each broke, but they at least lasted around 9-10 months (and my son was a few years younger). If we were purchasing for an older teenager or an adult, we'd go with a higher quality headset costing around $50-100; but since most younger kids tend to be a bit reckless and would probably break a pair of high dollar headsets as quickly as a bargain set....but these are no bargain.

It's amazing. It tames frizz without creating crunchy hair. My only complaint was that it was kinda slimy and hard to wash off my hands. I finally figured out that that is because it is mostly aloe. And just like aloe, it's slimy. But it is magic for the hair. I bought a liter years ago and am just finishing it up, so I'm thrilled to see that it is still made. I have very curly ringlets, but my hair is not thick. Fixative is best used when my hair is damp, but I can even put some on my dry hair when it gets frizzy and it will tame it.

All of these are sung well, with great conviction (However, I've heard a far more rousing version of \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" by Tucson's The Mollys on one of their cds; the cast's rendition of \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" isn't as riveting a performance.).

It's not worth paying money for a public domain author when you don't even receive the whole work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this edition of this book.","review":"The edition of \\"Fear and Trembling\\" that amazon is selling, from Pacific Publishing Studio, and printed as recently as Sept. 13, 2010, appears to be entirely illegitimate. There is no translator given credit for this edition, and no notes accompanying the text at all. As far as I can tell, it appears that the publisher has taken the Walter Lowries' translation, available on-line, and used it for this edition, without giving credit. The link here speaks to this assumption: [...]I am already wary of using amazon to purchase books, and this is likely the last straw for me. I feel awful having unwittingly purchased a book that is, at very best, not a typical scholarly edition of a scholastic text, poorly printed and annotated, and at worst unfairly filching other's hard work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost impossible to use","review":"I bought this lens 10 years ago when I was using a Pentax Super Program. I was initially attracted by the zoom range and compact size to use as a walk around lens. After one roll of film it was obvious to me that the lens had two serious flaws.1) The focus scale was way too short. Minimum to infinity takes about 1/6 of a turn of the barrel. This isn't too bad at the 28mm end but at the 105 end it was nearly impossible to get into focus; not to mention that the smaller aperture darkens the rangefinder spot.2) The front lens elements \\"trombones\\" under its own weight. 45 degrees above or below the horizontal and there it goes. I suppose this could be tightened but with the focusing problems, why bother?Anyway, I put the lens in my junk box where it resides to this day. I wouldn't even give this lens away to some unsuspecting soul. It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayers Rocks","review":"A fine one-disc compilation culling some of the best solo work from a charter member of England's \\"Canterbury Scene\\" and one of the founders of the legendary Soft Machine. Ayers' rich, world-weary baritone (which completely belies his pretty-boy Peter Frampton looks) croons over some very interesting music ranging from prog and Chuck Berry style rockers to sweet pop and mellow jazz. Ayers' most memorable ballad, \\"May I?\\" is bonused here by the inclusion of the French language version \\"Puis Je?\\"...a nice nod to collectors. Fans of the brilliant, highly-underrated and difficult-to-collect guitarist, the late Ollie Hallsal (Patto, Boxer, Tempest, The Rutles, etc.) also might want to pick up this disc, as he is featured prominently on several selections. His soaring solo on \\"Blue\\" has to be heard to be believed. An excellent addition to any 70's Anglophile's music shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice product; if you don,t use it much!","review":"I ordered my first one in Jan. motor burnt apart by Feb.

Just a dark hard edged unsentimental story swiftly told, with good insight into the people swept up in Parker's path.

Firstly, the sound quality (especially when compared to See For Miles' later EP collection) is a bit suspect; She's Coming Home is sourced from an off-speed '45, of all things! And secondly, the liner notes could be better. But from a strictly music point of view, this comp is EXCELLENT; the Zombies are great great great, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a band more worthy of your time. This disc is almost entirely in stereo, too, so if you buy this and discover you like the Zombies, there's basically no overlap between this and the Big Beat catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad coding, bad Idea","review":"I saw this game at my friend's, the first thing that offended me was the war against Islam and being so racist calling people defending their country terrorists (but that's up to what Westwood think right?).My friend has a very high end machine (P4 2.4, 512DDR Ram, 64Mb ATI VGA, etc.) and it could play the most demanding games like WCIII or the poorly coded GTA3 and the awesome Vice City.This game totally sucked at his machine, GTA3 was way better (I think GTA3 didn't work fine on low end machines cause it was originally coded for PSX, but Rockstar games did an awesome job on Vice City).Well, if you own a super computer with a high end (128+) VGA card, and you're not offended by the racism and wrong political views of the game then buy it.Otherwise, I recommend that you find another RTS game..I'm sure not waiting for any other RTS games from WestWood studios, I guess RA2 will be the last game I got from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"r u stupid","review":"u r 3 stupid yes u who rote 1,1 &2 this is 1 ov the best games eva best c&c game eva mint grafix tonnes ov stuff it rules i just wanted 2 say u r stupid"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and gorgeous","review":"Wow!

It is the first graphicaly pleasing C&C game, besides Renegade which really wasnt a RTS. It finally put new life into the C&C line that Tiberium Sun and Renegade didn't. The game play has a different feel, with in game cut scenes looking much like Warcraft III and Age of Mythology. Yet it still keeps its own style with some differences from the last C&C game. However, C&C Generals may have become a bigger title then it deserved from all the hype. Don't expect this to be a revolutionary type of game, it sticks to the basics that it has used for years, nothing extremely different or new. And to view it at its best you will need a good rig. Its a good RTS, like I said, solid, and if your a fan of the previous C&C games or if you like RTS styled games I would recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dissapointment","review":"Buying this game when it came out was a mistake i think to this day. C and C previous titles were ones to marvel at, this one is one to chuck in a garbage can.

In Generals, you play in 3 campaigns, terroist, chinesse, and AMERICAN, however, with only ten missions, +or-, you can get through the game, quite quickly. Also, being in 3D, i expected some quality of the game sprites, or on ground units, however, they dissapointed me greatly.

The main highlight is the fact that you can actually play as real life nations. Instead of the GDI and the NOD terrorists, you play as the US, China, and the Global Liberation Army (the terrorists). There are lots of new units and structures, and the graphics are better then any C+C game to date. The only problem with this game is that in my opinion you need an awesome PC to run it to its full potential. I have an AMD 2700+, 512MB PC-3500 RAM, and an ATI 9700 Pro graphics card, and the scrolling still tends to get choppy once your base gets significantly large. Overall, this game's concepts are great, and is worth getting if you have a P4 2.2Ghz or AMD 2600+ or better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst coding in a game since the beginning of time","review":"Stay away from this game. It is poorly coded, patches are worthless and the price tag is [too much]. It's a perfect example of what EA Games does.

The game has continous serious errors which occur randomly and that is the worst experience I've ever had with any games. Just that this one is a lot worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Torch","review":"As long as I don't misplace it, this will probably be the last flashlight I'll have to buy for many years. This isn't a flimsy, plastic toy. By loading the batteries, clipping it on your belt, or simply switching it on, you can tell that it's built to some pretty fine tolerances. You could toss it against the wall and not worry about breaking it. The light from the LEDs is kind of a cool white with a hint of blue. It's more of a flood light that illuminates a wider area instead of a pinpoint light that shines on a single object. I've had other flashlights before -- such as the popular metal one that we've all bought -- but this one beats them all. It would be ideal for emergencies, performing work, or walking at night. I've seen other LED flashlights that were slightly less expensive, but none of them had 10 LEDs with such a quality casing."},{"rating":"2","title":"85 lumens and 350 hours runtime!!!","review":"You won't find another flashlight in the world that is going to give you 85 lumens of light output, along with 350 hours runtime on a single set of three C-cell alkaline batterys. The 10 LED's provide a difuse floodlight effect. This is not a spotlight, but a true mini-floodlight. It gives off an odd blue-white light that takes a little getting used to.

I had it a week. Update 11/14/03-after several emails back and forth, the company did send a free replacement LED bulb unit. The flashlight works again. Only thing now is that they sent blue LED lights instead of the white ones I had originall purchased.

The 4AA is smaller and fits better in the hand and since it is just as bright and costs much less I can not recommend the 3C but am happy with the 4AA.

The book arrived exactly as desribed. This is a vocal score, meaning that the orchestra is reduced to a piano. In the bibliographical note it states that this Dover edition is a republication of the edition originally published by G.Schirmer, NY, 1900. The lyrics are in Italian and English(translation by Natalie Macfarren). The layout on the page is clean and quite easy to read. I haven't worked from the score yet, but the only problem I foresee coming is the fact that it won't stay open on the piano stand. So some bending is most likely required. In my opinion this score it's is great for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Which version is this?","review":"I didn't buy this score. I bought a Shirmer Don Giovanni. I still can't figure out what this is. At least one reviewer says you get the vocal score but most of the others seemed to have gotten the full score. I wanted the vocal score a couple months ago but now I also want the full score. What is this?I notice that the preview pages only contain the pages with straight text. This is not very helpfull.

However, 3 QT volume is not true. The kettle is much smaller and doesn't hold 3QTs even when filled to the brim. Moreover, when full it actually leaks the water from under the lid when the water starts boiling. Thus, to be usable you have to fill it with no more than 2 QTs. It is a shame because I specifically needed a larger capacity steamer to avoid filling it up many times during the day (I keep my woodstove running most of the time). This is also not an error in the on-line product description, but the misrepresentation directly from manufacturer (it says 3 Qts on the box). Otherwise, the kettle is pretty basic and has greyish/greenish hue (another minor disappointment - my wood stove appears comparatively darker). I, guess, after all twenty-something bucks just doesn't buy enough iron to make a true 3 Qt kettle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"This kettle does its job but it rusts like crazy.

If The Rain's Got to Fall, Long Ago, and the title tune are my favorites. It's a shame the original score was shortened for Broadway, and that the CD can't show you the fabulous Onna White dances, but this CD release is a treasure.

I love the way Liz starts each chapter by retelling the story of the woman the way it may look if it was happening today and gives us a new insight into that life. She then goes step by step through the Bible verses and does a study on them - showing insights and ways that it relates to us today. The questions at the end of the chapter are good as well and the whole diverse group of us is learning... There are different types of women in the Bible and each of us relates to at least one of them! I like the catagories: Bad to the bone, Bad for a season and Bad for a moment. Witty, fun, real and relevant to me today."},{"rating":"2","title":"For former bad girls and those who want to understand them","review":"If you've done time as a bad girl, are flirting with being a bad girl, or just want to understand a little more about what makes women *do things* like that, this books is for you.Liz has spent her time as a bad girl and knows the routine. And if you, like so many of us, have spent time wallowing in the pit of despair and self loathing, then her genuine joy in salvation will seem anything but insipid or sugary -- it will seem real.Her fictionalizations are that -- fictional, updated versions of classic stories. Her followups are verse by verse dissections of scripture, not overly academic, but useful.I found this book fun, informative, sympathetic and most of all, a gentle reminder of where I don't want to be and why I don't want to be there."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"If you are a knee jerk PC, left winger, forget it. If you enjoy good stories, this works pretty well. Each story pairs a modern parable/retelling with the Biblical story. I found the modern parables pretty weak. At the end of each story is a series of questions and \\"truths\\". I usually found that 2 out of 5 were pretty decent.I know this doesn't sound like a 4 star review, so why do I rate it so highly? Liz Higgs makes these women accessible. I've used this concept as a sermon series and got a powerful response from women in the congregaton who found a lot of joy in imperfect characters, and the permission they found to be imperfect. Also Ms. Higgs willingness to embrace her own not so positive past makes it easier for the reader to accept his/her own flawsA good read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book, Not only has Liz Curtis Higgs done her research, but she's a great storyteller, as well. By first placing each featured woman's story in the appropriate historical setting, and then creating a similar story in current times, Curtis Higgs does as any good pastor would, giving the reader a sense of how lessons from the Bible can be helpful today. It helps when an author can take something that happened in the past and relate it to something present. The way the stories are written, do make the reader stop and think about current issues and how today's problems are no different from thousands of years ago. There is redemption for all of us if we stop and get on the right path"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I thought this book was really great. I love how in depth she goes into each verse. It's really neat to learn how the verse is translated into different versions of the Bible.I hope people don't take the woman who called her \\"too serious to be a mature christian\\" to heart. That is a very judgemental phrase. I hope we all can be as happy and giddy as Liz is about her devotion to the Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Girls...Good Lessons","review":"Everyone loves a bad girl, right? But surely they are not the ideal teachers we want to influence our lives. In \\"Bad Girls of the Bible and What We Can Learn From Them,\\" author Liz Curtis Higgs, attempts to persuade us otherwise.This book takes you through several fiction stories based on the \\"bad girls\\" of the Bible, such as Eve and Delilah. The stories bring a modern twist to a classic Bible story and truly bring the character to life, maybe making the read think \\"Hmmm...this could be me.\\" Higgs follows the fiction story with verse-by-verse commentary of the Bible story to put the \\"bad girls\\" actions into perspective and make the reader realize that all girls, no matter what our actions portray us to be, needs the love of a Savior.*Although, I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review, the content displayed is of my own thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for personal and group study","review":"I was able to read an advance copy of this book and found it excellent. Liz Curtis Higgs blends fiction, strong scripture teaching and questions to offer her readers a great book for personal or group study.

Having been a bad girl who is now saved by grace, and having learned many things the hard way, i thought that i could learn a few lessons from those who have gone before me. Well, i tried to read it, but honestly, this book is not for me.Just recently i shared with a friend why my family won't be attending the really big Easter production in our city...i am very careful about the graphic images that we take in. And the written images in this book are ones that i simply don't need. This may be a useful tool for others, but not for me. While the Bible certainly does mention scandalous behaviors and women, most of the Bible isn't written in an alluringly graphic way.So, this is my honest non review, of a book that was sent to me by the publisher. There are many other much more thorough reviews of this book, if you are interested, you can read some of them here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the story telling as lesson","review":"I got this book as part of a blogging for books program. I chose it because I enjoyed Ms. Higgs Christian fiction books and wanted to check out what she was like as a more serious author.What I really enjoyed was the beginning of each chapter was a re-telling of the traditional story in a modern way. It made it more relatable.The biggest thing that hit me was the author's note of seeing herself having more in common with the \\"bad girls\\" of the Bible than the typical heroines. I found that to be true for myself as well.Ms. Higgs did a great job of taking well known stories and getting you to look deeper at each life and see how it relates to your own sinful nature. But she didn't stop there, it was also about steps that could have been taken to avoid the ending we see in the Bible. That was the best part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Girls of the Bible, good lessons","review":"So far, I'm about halfway through this book & I recieved it about a few days ago.

I assumed it would pull lessons from back then and bring them into today's real world of women. I assumed the lessons would teach us about faith, commitment, and love. I assumed this book would teach me to fight the good fight of faith, to overcome any obstacles in life by continuing in my faith walk, to believe God no matter what happens, and to develop more effectively in the fruit of the spirit.

God said: \\"Do Not Eat.\\" Adam now acting like a god told Eve: \\"Do Not Touch.\\" Christ came through women from Eve. He was born of flesh from Eve/Mary. His perfection came from the Father.

In these entries Gifford offers little research or argument to support his views, instead tossing off praises or dismissals without bothering to justify them. The trouble is that this is a book, not a conversation at a coffeeshop, and so there's little chance of understanding why Gifford thinks the way he does. The result is a book that's more frustrating than illuminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gifford is the worst","review":"I just can't stand this guy. At least these books keep him away from his unreadable fiction or helping David Lynch foist more garbage on the silver screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap production of a wonderful book","review":"Not surprisingly, this was a very inexpensive production of Kenneth Grahame's classic text, and as such didn't equal more elaborate editions with good reproductions of the original illustrations--but it's good enough to go on with."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmm","review":"It's funny to me... nobody who rips this book apart has anything bad to say about its literary genius, only that it's about pedophilia. It's also funny that I read close to one hundred reviews of this book and of the many favorable reviewers, all but one said that Lolita is about pedophilia. I applaud that one reader for being something more than the rest of you. Not only is pedophilia not the major theme of this work, it is not a secondary theme either. It is buried beneath the most beautifully poetic prose written about a man in love. How long it takes you to figure out he is in love with Annabel and not Lolita is not my problem, but yours. Get past your inane social taboos and read this book, especially the annotated edition. There is a reason it is considered a masterpiece and eroticism, pedophilia, and hype have nothing to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delves into mental illness...","review":"I don't know if the author ever intended to delve into the development of a mental illness, but this book does a good job. The main character, H.H., even acknowledges his downward spiral. A depressing, sometimes erotic book but well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick story or psychological drama?","review":"It's obvious that the main character of the story, Humpbert Humpbert (!), has a problem discerning reality from fantasy. Several times in the book, he mentions being in a sanitorium of one sort or another. The story is not a question of his mental stability, but more of an in-depth look at what \\"love\\" really is.Some will take issue because the love interests are all young, prepubescent girls. However, if you read the story with the understanding that he cannot discern the difference between the love of little girls and the love of adult women, it becomes clear.It is a fascinating book, leaving you feeling for the main character, faults and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I've been in the S&M community for over a decade and this book/movie is a must in our collection.

Read this book and then consider that it is written by a Russian who, after writing several novels in Russian, switched to English for Lolita. The first time I read it, I was looking up vocabulary words on just about every page. It is full of puns and intellectual games, and the book remains an iconic work not because of any scandal, but solely because of its brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme feat of language","review":"Admirable achievement of language, but disturbing content. Makes you see how crucial language skills are -- because you keep on reading, and yet you realize that ordinarily, a story such as this, told by a novelist of lesser talent, would be thrown into your trash can before you got through the third chapter.The book that is popular now in our reading group is also a narrative told by an unlikable protagonist: Brauner's \\"Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf\\". It, is, like Lolita, brilliant and funny, but dealing with some disturbing aspects of a more contemporary American culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully-written apologia for child rape","review":"I agree with trauma expert Judith Herman's analysis of this book, that it is the most beautifully written apologia for child rape ever put to paper. That this book is highly regarded speaks volumes to the hatred of women and of children that pervades our culture. I guess it should come as no surprise that in a culture where 25 percent of all women are raped in their lifetimes, and another 19 percent have to fend off rape attempts, that a book celebrating the sexual abuse of a child would be considered one of the best books ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale of two parts","review":"This book is a tragedy; not in the standard literary sense, but in a comparison of Part One and Part Two. Part One has an urgency and emotion to it rarely encountered in fiction. Part Two is a dull romp across the country, with blood and irrational action dominating the final pages.In Nabokov's notes at the end of the novel, he writes that publishers thought Part Two was too long. They were right. He should have published just Part One as a novella, and left the magic stand alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Pedophilic Mess","review":"I ended up throwing this book away after reading about 5 chapters..if you enjoy reading the pedophilic ramblings of a perv, go for it! Yuk! And I'm a very open minded person but this book is just gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have to disagree with the other reviews posted.

There's enough strange things in this world and reading a book about one wasn't enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me When It's Over","review":"1.) I'm bored 2.) He uses too many allusions to other novels, so that if you're not well read, this book makes no sense. 3.) Most American readers are not fluent in French, so to have conversations or interjections in French with no translation, is plain dumb. 4.) Did I mention I was bored? 5.) As with another reviewer, I agree, he uses a lot of huge words that just slow a person down. And it's not for theatrics either, it's just huge words mid-sentence when describing something simple. Nothing in the sense of imagery is gained. 6.) Also, to sum it up, it's a story about a pedophile, whether you interpret it as something else or not, is up to you, but there's the main plot for you. I would not reccomend this book to any of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Style","review":"I read 187 pages of Lolitta and just did not feel like finishing it.

Page after page of this novel fill the eyes (and ears, if one reads aloud--worth doing, BTW) with words of perilous, haunting loveliness. If I could save from apocalypse only one Nabokov, it would bePale Fire, but Lolita is the novel everyone remembers him for, if only because of its subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Nabokov could pull this off","review":"Only a great writer could make one sympathize/empathize with a pedophile. As creepy as that sounds - it is fiction however - and Nabokov's style pulls you into the story and makes it all feel immediate and imperative.I was just sorry that I saw the film (years ago) as I still can't get James Mason out of my mind as the protagonist and he was too short for the part - and Shelly Winters was (in my opinion) mis-cast as well and Lolita (Sue Lyon) was TOO OLD - and not particularly good.The book - is faboulous - its Nabokov!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly realistic characters","review":"Honestly, I only picked up Lolita because I knew it had been banned at one point, and I was curious about it. That was one of the best decisions I have made at the book store!\\"Lolita\\" was beautifully and compellingly written, and while I see why some refer to it as a 'love story' I felt it was much more than that. I think the reason there was so much controversy with this book is that it dared to portray a child molester as a person, a real person, who had good and bad in them. He was intelligent and well-read, and felt guilty for what he did, but did it anyway. This story allows you to see the man behind the monster, and see the little monsters in the innocent.I am tempted to say so much more, but I would rather you discover it for yourself. I highly encourage anyone with the slightest interest to read this book. I find it rare for a book to be so eloquently written without confusing the meanings of the story.(...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable Experience","review":"I listened to this audio probably about four years ago, but it was such an amazing and glorious experience, I can't forget it. Jeremy Irons is perfect for the role of the protagonist, and the writing of Nabokov is like listening to the most beautiful classical music.

Apart from the illicit sexual theme - which you can get more and better of in beeline novels if that is your sort of thing - who cares what happens to either of them?After reading this I began to understand why Nabokov was so critical of Dostoyevsky - it was sheer jealousy.

I had to read it for school and would not have finished except I had no choice. I simply did not see much of a plot, and what was there did not hold my attention at all. Humbert's character was slightly fascinating in that he was so twisted, but things like that just do not interest me. When I put the book down, I was left with a creepy, unresolved feeling (yikes--there are actually people like that out there!), not to mention being fully relieved that I was finished with that book forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly Good","review":"I don't know how to describe this book. But I'll try (and fail). It's disturbing. It's sad. It's hilarious. It's immoral. It's beautiful. Let me try again. This book is about a 40s European male who has an attraction for girls between the age of 9-14. He calls them \\"nymphets.\\" He does everything he can to be with one he names Lolita. He gets to be with her. And it becomes a physical and mental hell for both (mostly the former for Lolita and the latter for Humbert). Which leads me back to this: It's disturbing. It's sad. It's hilarious. It's immoral. It's beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Civilization's Great Works of Art","review":"I felt I was in the presence of great genius while reading \\"Lolita\\". Nabokov's prose style is reason alone to read this stunning work of art; it was to me the closest thing to \\"singing\\" I have ever come upon. The Dolores 'Lolita' Haze character was so tragic and compelling that I cannot understand why anyone who actually read the book would think of it as pornography; and ditto to the masterfully realized Humbert and Quilty. My only complaints were the need to consult a dictionary so often and the sometimes rambling narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Classic","review":"Nabokov's novel \\"Lolita\\" was a beautiful, yet dark and chilling account of a man's relationship with his 12 yr. old step-daughter. The prose in this book is poetic, lyrical and disturbing.The character Humbert Humbert has this overwhelming desire for young girls, which seems to consume him. He lusts after the main character, Lolita and seizes the oppurtunity to take her across the country on an extended journey. It is a shocking look into the mind of a pedophile. I do not want to give the whole plot away, but Nabokov's writing is phenomonal. I do agree, however, with some other reviewers in that it does get a bit boring in the middle and in the end. This book is a timeless classic and is worth a read, even just for the amazing writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nabokov wrote the greatest novel of the 20th century. His Lolita deserved the best and indeed this","review":"...spoken word edition performed to perfection by Jeremy Irons is as good as it gets.Long after you have finished listening, Irons voice will continue to haunt you, much as Lolita herself haunts Humbert who remains eternally \\"pregnant with Lolita, as a mother is with child\\".A must for the library of anyone who appreciates great writing and great theater. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I enjoyed Nabokov's writing style. Lolita is a little unbelievable at times but many of her behaviors reminded me of thoughts or behaviors from when I was an adolescent. Ah the plight of prepubescent/pubescent girls...It was also very interesting to see Humbert Humbert's struggle throughout the whole ordeal. It is obvious that he loves Lolita and honestly wants her to be taken care of yet he just can't help himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more powerful than even its controversial reputation would indicate","review":"Wow. Beautiful, witty, clever, perfect. A masterpiece (or \\"un chef d'oeuvre\\" as Humbert would undoubtedly say). Any book that makes me laugh and cry with my whole belly, face, and heart repeatedly throughout the book (though most of the crying came at the end) and within the same ten minutes has accomplished an amazing feat. I found this on the shelf of our family library, and when my mother tried to discourage me, her not-really-that-innocent seventeen-year-old daughter from reading it, I knew it must be good. Of course it's disturbing, but people who dwell on it excessively are missing out on quite an experience. It's one of those books that must be read again and again because there are so many allusions, puns, etc. that are easy to miss the first time. Next time I'll be reading an annotated version, but I enjoyed trying to pick up on everything myself the first time around. I recommend doing the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Idyll","review":"Lolita, and Nabokov's writing in general, is in a word brilliant. The reader must be quite well read and culturally astute to understand many of the nuances of this novel (unless you get the annotated one, but I found it more fun to see what I would understand on my own, followed by looking up which I didn't). I stared in wonder when my fencing instructor asked, horrified, \\"Why are you reading THAT TRASH?\\" I asked if he'd ever read it. The response came, \\"No, I don't read filth.\\" Lolita is not filth, in any way shape of form. Filth is purient. It is hard for me to imagine Nabokov as a Russian. He captures the American landscape so idyllicly; his description of the advertisements, magazines, music, and the people are wonderful. Nabokov captures what many have been trying to cage for years: the subtlty of emotion which can only be found in obsession."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far Nabokov's best","review":"I first began reading \\"Lolita\\" this summer due to all the buzz. I had purchased the book about 3 years before the movie premiered--it just sat on my bookshelf because I figured I would get to it at some point. Well, \\"Lolita\\" provided me with one of the most fantastic and rewarding reading experiences I have ever had. The story is NOT about some sick and deranged pedophile--it is about love and the strangeness and the uncontrollability of it. Nabokov's prose is exquisite--so refined and beautiful it sucks you in like a heavy sleep. Read between the lines and don't take the story at face value and you will find a hysterically funny and perfect love story. A must on any bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those who read this book for the hype have missed the point.","review":"Honestly, this story is about love. Now granted it perhaps does not fit with the traditional American conception of love, and in many ways Humbert Humbert is a very sick man. However, those that pick up Lolita because of its media hype are those that are disappointed when the story does not live up to its risque image. They have missed the point. They read for action, for excitement. They seek a climax in every chapter.What they miss is the construction of the portrait of a character that reveals detail that the most expensive camera will always fail to see. I urge anyone in this position to reread the very last page if my position is still not clear.Lolita is a story worth reading. Dare I say a must read for anyone who truly enjoys literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Poetic","review":"I had tried to read this book before and I had thought it dry but I waited and gived it another go.

His mastery of prose is without peer. His words dance, they sing, they cavort.I just wish he had written another story, instead of this miserably depressing tale of a crazy pedophile on a cross-country raping spree with a twelve year old girl.I guess I am not one of the \\"wise, sensitive, and staunch people who understood my book\\" which Nabokov writes about in his condescending 1956 afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"I read this book at the beckoning of an English professor who described as one of the greatest love stories ever written. I was horrified when I realized that this book is about a pedophile that takes advantage of a little girl.

I continued reading the book in search of any inkling of non-perverted \\"love\\" and I found none."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no love story!","review":"All this hoopla about Lolita made me curious enough to read it. Don't tell me this is about love. This pedophile clearly stalks young girls. Maybe his first true love could never blossom, but to carry that feeling throughout his life screams psychological problems, not love."},{"rating":"1","title":"child pornography masquerading as art","review":"It is a fitting testament to our times that this novel, which should never have been published in the first place, has come to be regarded not only as a modern classic, but as the finest novel of the last century. Only a thoroughly immoral man could have written it and only a thoroughly immoral age would celebrate it. The review cited on the cover - describing it as the \\"only convincing love story\\" of the century - is the perfect punch line to this absurd joke: what better way to demonstrate your unimpeachable sophistication than by characterizing an explicit account of pedophelia as a love story? If you want to read erotic descriptions of children and sickeningly-detailed depictions of child molesting, the law is apparently powerless (or at least unwilling) to stop you, but please, please, don't hide behind \\"art.\\" Admit, at least to yourself, what you're really doing; admit what you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read.","review":"I bought this book with a great excitement for reading it. Once I got passed the first chapter, which took a fairly long time, I guessed that the rest of the book would be better considering it gets such great reviews. I was desperately wrong.

It is a genius of the english language. Bravo! I am appaled by all the people who misunderstood this book. I believe that the author was writing about tragedy all right, the tragedy of young girls who seduce and therefore ruin men's lives. Lolita was the persuer here people. The proof? Lolita went on to have immoral, premarital affairs after she is finished with her stepfather. How could she have been a victim when she went along with it? All she had to do was say no.

Lolita is not about love--pedophilia never is and Lolita is 12 years old. As a professor of English and as a feminist (and the mother of a young girl), I have never been able to ignore the troubling content nor the blatent misogyny in this text to appreciate Nabokov's clever narrative structure.

Child abuse is the vilest act any of us can imagine yet Nabokov makes his narrator the most eloquent in the canon.He leaves traces everywhere of the true nature of the abuse so we can \\"see through\\" Humbert, even if he refuses(most of the time) to see his true nature. But if someone can use language to mount a defence of the sexual abuse of achild ,in effect constuct an idealology, where does that leave other ideals? I live in Northern Ireland so this has a particular resonance for me, day and daily for the past 30 years here we have listened to people defending the indefensible, to the point where one wonders is there such a thing as morality or is all just a clever use of language?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It was wonderfully written, Nabokov was a genius. I was 18 when I first read this book a year ago, and at first I was genuinely disgusted, but at the same time, intrigued. My grandfather almost passed out when I found out I was reading it. He read it back when it first came out and was banned in the USA. His exact words were \\"Why are you reading that? It's just a story about a dirty old man.\\" However, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It is truly a love story, however one sided. Humbert genuinely loved \\"Lolita\\", and he understood that his feelings would never be accepted by her, her mother, or the society in which they lived. When he finally DID consomate the relationship with her, he was plagued by guilt, and paranoia. I don't want to reveal the end to anyone who hasn't read it, but you can definately see the mental anguish of Humbert in the end. I reccomend this book to anyone. It is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but interesting","review":"I bought this book solely due to its reputation, having no opinion or previous experience with the writer. It is a book that I am glad I read but it is unusual due to subject matter. His writing style is also a little strange, it is written as if the character is writing the book himself and he sometimes refers to himself in the third party. Quite humerously at times. A working knowledge of French (which i do not have) would have helped the book flow a little better but it was not essential. The second half was a bit slow and did not grab my attention as much as the first half. Worth reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irons's reading brings much to this wonderful book","review":"I had already read the book \\"Lolita\\" and seen both versions of the movie when I stumbled across this set of tapes. Because I thought Jeremy Irons had done a very creditable Humbert Humbert, I decided to give the book on tape a chance as well.This recording far exceeded my expectations. Irons's reading is flawless, simply flawless, and hearing Nabokov's prose read aloud made me realize that, as wonderful as the book is, a reader cannot fully appreciate it until s/he has actually listened to it being read. I never thought this could happen, but by the time I'd finished listening to the tapes I firmly believed that this book on tape was BETTER than the book on paper. Not a word had been altered, but the literature was made even richer for being spoken."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOLITA","review":"I have just finished reading Lolita for the second time. Its prose is poetic. Its word play is perfect. Its narrator is infuriating, hilarious, and tragic. I highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful reading for a free time","review":"I saw the two movies of 'Lolita' before reading this book. I found this book way better than the movies - as many other movies that based on the novel never exceed the original one. I love the design of this book. Its size is not too big or small, good enough to carry or put into your bag. I love the references and the expository comments for the readers. The historical time line that relates the real life of the author really helps you to understand the background of the time. I had a great time reading this book - full of wit and good expressions. This is a great book for a fan of Vladimir Nabokov, or just someone who wants to have a book for read in his free time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking yet intriguing.","review":"My first reaction to the main character was shock and disgust.

They instill desire in the reader's own heart. But more so in the first half of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary literary achievement beyond comparison.","review":"One of the most amazingly evocative and entertaining novels ever written, Nabokov's Lolita, as sensitively read by Jeremy Irons, is an extraordinary literary achievement beyond comparison. To hear this masterful actor breathe even more life into this essential reading experience...well, it is a pleasure and a privilege. Driving with my tape player on has never been so enriching. Irons captures every emotion in this sad, sensual, and--yes--funny book. If you could only have one audio-book in your library, I could not more highly recommend this one. The film versions are both very special experiences, but no other medium contains every remarkable word of the towering book besides this stunning tape. You will want to play it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasteful treatment of a very tasteless type of relationship","review":"I purchased this book to see how the author would describe the sexual relationship between Humbert and Lolita. There is very little of it in this book, and this lack contributes to the book's greatness. Nabokov treated this subject discreetly and tastefully by omitting graphic descriptions of sex. This is the only way he could have done so, since the subject is taboo. My hat is off to Nabokov."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achingly beautiful account of a sick, twisted love","review":"In style and content, Lolita has no peers. One of the most beautifully written books in the English language (and Nabokov was a native Russian!)Its greatness lies in the fact that such beauty is in service of such twisted love. So rather than the subject matter being offensive, it is what makes this book so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insane for the average but awesome","review":"Loved the book, it made me laugh a lot, I don't know what that makes me but I don't care.

If you read it before judging its controversial contents, it will be sure to expand your mind and make you think about subjects in a whole new light. After I read this book, I could not stop thinking about it, and the moral questions is brought up. Most of all, it made me think: what is love? In the middle of the book, I was convinced that Humbert Humbert was a despicable monster who did not love Dolores; by the end of the book, I was less convinced.The book was also enjoyable for the writing style; although the overuse of French annoyed me, it was fun to figure out what the literary allusions meant."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwritten, overrated","review":"Writing?

Overwritten, overrated, the very definition of 'pretentious'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The script that never was","review":"Its not the book, and its not the film. So what is it? Its the screenplay of course! Chances are, if you are reading this, its either because you saw the film and liked it; a fan of Stanley Kubrick: director of the film; or you read the book Lolita and the Annotated Lolita and figured \\"I might as well read the script;\\" or just a big fan of Nabokov and its the one book you dont have in your collection. Whatever the reason may be, it falls between the book and the film. This is Nabokov's version of the script that was cut, recut and then edited by Kubrick (incidentally, Nabokov still recieved on-screen credit for the screenplay). It may hold water on its own, but in comparison to either the book or film it cannot stay afloat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schweiger'sBabe \\"Liz\\" is mistaken","review":"Schweiger'sBabe \\"Liz\\" says Irons reads in a horrible american accent.

Just my personal preference.I enjoyed the story nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unparalleled","review":"In a word - WOW. Mind-bending. Beyond belief.

The fact that a 40 year old deprives a 12 year old girl of her innocence will at most times in the book leave you in disgust and feeling disturbed. But credit be given where its due, the author is a genius and some would say a madman himself to be able to tell this story of a mad man. I do admire that with the touchy subjects that he wrote on he never used any sort of vulgar vocabulary to describe certain scenes. in my opinion its a mentally strenuous book to jump into because of the monster who is telling his story but the author hit it dead on, minus some parts which i think get very repetitive. take what you can from this story, which is hard to with a closed mind, and then move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"You love it while hating it. Such a work of art.","review":"I found myself guiltily reading this book. It was given to me and it sat on my shelf for years. Then I curiously picked it up to read a few pages. . .I was hooked. The lush sensuality of the language pulled me in. I wanted to live in a world with language like this. While enjoying the author's delivery, I was acutely aware of the disturbing direction this book was taking. It felt honest in that you could see through Humbert's twisted thinking to the distruction he was causing. This book didn't idealize perversion and the idolization of Lolita was like a piece of fruit that was gorgeous on the outside, then you took a bite and realized that it was being devoured by a worm. This book made me think and is one of the best books I've ever read.I remember being an adolescent girl. I remember the subtle looks or even the daring catcalls from men twice my age. . . this book is scary and divine, disgusting and beautiful. That is why it's a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just read the first page...","review":"...and you'll be hooked! I realize one cannot open the first page and begin reading in this forum but if you could, that's all it would take. The first page of this novel sucks you in as I imagine Nabokov intended. All I have had to do in the past is read the first page aloud and I've convinced a room full of people to go out an buy it the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perverse, yet a masterpiece","review":"Lolita is certainly one of my three favorite books. There'ssomething about it that weaves a web of enchantment, mesmerizing thereader. The language is absolutetly gorgeous, so beautiful. It gives me such a deep respect for the English language; i never could have imagined that prose could be so exquisite! The plot is perverse, true, but that's the topic. It really is fascinating, though, to see from this perspective. Lo was such an annoying brat, but still endearing somehow. And Humbert-- well, he was such a pedophile, but so pathetic that you had to feel sorry for him. Somehow the story is tender, despite the lust and unromantic sex. Was it a love story? I don't know; I'm still unclear on the definition of love. Sometimes it seems like it might be. But love or not, it is poignant. I just wish there wasn't so much French in there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 20th centuries finest literary expeditions...","review":"Introducing Humbert Humbert or H.H. - one of the strangest characters in all of literature.. A man obsessed.. and blinded by love..Nabokov's prose just drips with tantalising beauty.. he captures the psychology of a man so well.. as to leave us feeling like we have just totally inhabited someone's mind.. It is disturbing, sure, but also thought provoking and thouroughly engrossing..Strangely this is not a book about child abuse or a tale of morality.. It is the story of love and what it does to the brain... How we are so overtaken by our emotions as to blind us to everything else... This is truly an achievement few authors have made.. Only the likes of James Joyce could probe so deeply into the subconcious of such a character.. A work of genius.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated book of al time","review":"This and Catch 22 are the most overrated books of all time. This book is dated. The second half of the book is boring. The writing is cumbersome and pedantic. Most of all, the people who love this book - 18 year old freshmen - seem to love it because they are told to love it.Other thoughts - so the guy f--cks an underaged girl. Big deal. The guy likes underaged girls - big deal (that's why we have SORA i.e. Megan's Law). Maybe this was a big deal in the 60's but now its old news.PS - The only thing I ever liked about this story was the movie (the first one in black and white) - in particular the one scene where the girl is drinking a soda and using her toung to reach into her bag of potatoe chips. Goddamn erotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written dirty joke?","review":"So much talent expended on such a filthy fetish! Nabokov writes better than almost anyone of the last century and what does he write about? The slobbering Humbert, middle aged seeker of female children, lusting and plotting to have the child Lolita. It is written with genius. Sentences flow like honey. Comical lines abound. It is amazingly fresh - I checked the copyright as I could barely believe it was written in 1954! But what is the purpose of all this carefully crafted writing? Some will have you believe it is a metaphor for the clashing of European and American cultures. That is utter nonsense. Much of this is a bit too real to be mere literary invention. The fact that Nabokov wrote another novel, \\"The Enchanter,\\" on the same subject, suggests that this is auto-porn and has no other purpose than tittilation - of the author and anyone else who is a slave to this fetish. It is not a meditation on love. It is a well crafted dirty story for pedophiles."},{"rating":"1","title":"-","review":"Not too bad, but I think it's placee on he greatest of the english language list is a bit stretched. Nabokov has an excellent command of the language, which in itself makes the book worth reading. But the story itself didn't live up to the hype. I just didn't care what happened, and this came dangerously close to being one of those books one just never finishes because of a lack of caring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish this book.","review":"I thought I could handle this book. I'm trying to read all the \\"classics\\" and I figured there had to be something more to this book for it to be so famous. There wasn't. I don't understand why people think this is one of the greatest love stories of all time or one of the best books ever written. It's a book about a pedophile and people think it's beautiful. That makes me sick. How would these people feel if that was their daughter, would it still be beautiful? I didn't even put it on my bookshelf, I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lolita","review":"Lolita was not only a slow book to read, but it is completely about pedophilia and how a man get's to have his way with his ward."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Love her madly'","review":"If there is anything greater than this book, I would like to know where to find it, for I believe that I've just read the best book of all time. Not only could I relate to the way Humbert Humbert saw things, I also found him a beast. Which relatively makes me love the character all the more. Aside from the symbolism, and the awkward, yet intelligent things Humbert says, one must look past all the perversion for just a moment, and try to understand the poor fellow. Since I can't spoil anything, I will say this: If one must blame the other, surely Humbert and Lolita are both at fault. But to me, this is a story far beyond guidelines, and sophistication. If you are pondering as to whether or not read this book, I once again tell you it is an absolute delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lolita (Vintage International)","review":"I know for many people the topic of pedophilia is uncomfortable.

I would recommend reading this book because it is well written, grabs your attention, and will be hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I've been wanting to read this for a while, and when I finally did, I definitely wasn't disappointed. Nabokov's language in this novel is incredible -- the way he portrays the psyche of \\"nymphet\\"-seeking Humbert Humbert is entirely unique. At times, the book can become a little boring, mainly around halfway through. Also, the frequent use of French in the text can become a little irritating but inevitably adds to the originality of the novel.

I did that and I had the same leaking issue from the base of the unit [there would be a puddle of water] and it would not dispense water from the base into the caraff.Love the idea but do not believe in their quality since they moved their manufacturing of the product to China.

I couldn't determine if they were Sephardi (Middle Eastern Jews) or Ashkenazi (European Jews) - some bizarre mix in the middle - Meah She'arim is a primarily Ashkenazi neighborhood. The wedding was the most bizarre... . Perhaps the producers were short of money to hire extras. The whole feel was very unrealistic as a result.To an outsider a lot of the context wouldn't be clear as can be seen from some of the other commentaries here. The overall themes though if more contextualized aren't totally out of place at all, though I know it is an anti-Orthodox movie, but these are important issues. However, the end result is really messed up and detracts from getting the message across."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Bit Of Truth and A Whole Lotta Lies","review":"This movie shows the beauty of some things Jewish and at the same time shows those beautiful things as sad repulsive.In the scene of the wedding the women seems to be taken away from her festivities. In reality the woman and the man each celebrate with their friends (so the men and women do not mix.) In the film, she looks as if she is done and on her way home. I have yet to be at an orthodox wedding that was like that.Also, there are some truths in this movie. But the vast majority of the truth has been clouded by misuse of context. I add this movie to others like Price Above Rubies for showing the most blatent damaging look at orthodox people with the worst amount of personal prejudice thrown in for effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oy vey.","review":"It takes a strong stomach to watch this film, and a large grain of salt as well. I have to start with a word of caution: there is some horrifying stuff in this film, and it is all the more horrifying because it appears to be so blatantly inaccurate. Watching this film with my friend (who was raised as an Orthodox Jew), neither of us could stomach much more than the first forty minutes. I know that there are people who might watch this and suppose that it is simply discussing the darker side of life in Israel, but this film really quite simply goes over the top. If you watch it, keep in mind that it appears to anyone familiar with Orthodox Judaism to be, in the words of my friend, \\"complete fantasy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than a dirty anti-Semitic lie","review":"Every one who has even a little bit of familiarity with a Jewish Orthodox way of life or an Orthodox community will reject this movie as a piece of anti-Semitic garbage.A couple that has no children must divorce? According to the Orthodox Jewish law? This is not true! There is no such thing in today's Jewish Orthodox life.I am wondering how those people produced this movie in Israel (!) without even making a simple research on the subject. An American movie \\"Stranger Among us\\" and a European masterpiece \\"Left Luggage\\" engaged much more knowledge about ultra-Orthodox Jews than this Israeli movie! Is not it funny? What a shame!And who cares about performance? Who cares if this movie is touching or not? The movie is lie from start to finish. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not see this film!!!--does not deserve the one star","review":"This film is a completely inaccurate portryal of the Orthodox community. Yes, fiction does not have to be true stories, but the scenarios in this film are utterly beyond the norms of the society it seeks to represent. I know people in Meah Shearim, and there lives do not resemble this film any more than the averge Manhattan socialite resembles a Hasidc rabbi. On a political level, thiis film is detrimental adn anti-Semitic--spreading lies about other communities, painting another society in black when one's own in far from perfect--will hardly achieve a more unified or knowledgable world. I regret the two hours of my life I devoted to this bigoted film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most touching film ever","review":"I don't know how accurately this movie pictures Orthodox life but I do know that the theme of the movie is love and not tradition! I am not one that cries easily but when I saw Kaddosh I was so deeply touched that I cried through the second part of the movie without even realizing it. The characters are torn between two choices that are equally important for them in their hearts, yet either way they lose the other half of their hearts...The movie is so good I almost fear to watch it again because of the overwhelming feelings it brings onto surface in me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but entertaining","review":"The story was entertaining but that is about all you can say. The heroine, in particular, was not believable for the time period. This might have worked as a time-travel romance in which an assertive, 20th century, American woman gets transported back to Regency England. Still, it was sufficiently entertaining, and the characters were sufficiently likeable (not well developed, could have used more depth) that I decided to buy the sequel, AN AFFAIR MOST WICKED. Big mistake. If this book's heroine did not fit the historical period, the sequel's heroine was a joke. Not only is she unbelivable, she is annoying, spoiled, rude, impulsive--they don't get much more irritating that this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wooden","review":"The dialogue creaks and churns, the 'spark' between the couple flickers and dies, and the two people are really not very likeable. James is wooden, a duke who does what all day? They are supposed to be betrothed for two months, yet the supposed sizzle is contained for that long? And they hardly know each other, we never get to see his family?The whole blackmail thing is predictable and trite.James' cruelty is inexusable, as is his lack of explanaion to his wife.The whole latter half of the book is a tragedy of errors and i ca't honestly say I know enough about these characters at the end to be interested in them enough to figure out why they fell in love. Or care.Her second book is a lot better, sexy and witty. This one was passable, a tried and tested formula that in this case has the emotional intensity of a log."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average rehash of a tired theme","review":"The author says she read \\"The Buccaneers\\" by Edith Wharton, and you can save some money by just reading the original classic. It's the usual too-handsome hero with a wounded past, marrying the too-beautiful and so-wealthy heroine. Decades of misunderstandings are cleared up in a trice by her charm and brave forebearance. Standard sex scenes and the let's-make-everybody-happy ending complete another run-of-the-mill historical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glimpse of Greatness","review":"Probably the best of Geston's short catalogue, Out Of The Mouth Of The Dragon details the story of a young man who ventures out into the wider world to join the final battle of armageddon.The biggest hurdle readers face is the books ponderous, slogging opening. It should also be noted that this, like Geston's other novels, isn't exactly the tightest narative, although for me, the style imparts a welcome dream-like quality, though im sure others see it as a bit sloppy. With that said, once it starts moving along, Mouth of the Dragon is an experience like no other. Geston's hard-edged world is one of sorrowful beauty and moral ambiguity, and he does a great job of immersing you in his strange, melancholic vision of the future.Reading this novel, it strikes me as a real shame that this book is probably the best of a writer who produced little, instead of a flawed early work of an author who went on to become a true master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book is a waste of money unless you know nothing about dogs. If you want pertinant information specific to the Lab, then look elsewhere. The words \\"Laborador Retriever\\" could be deleted and the name of any dog breed inserted."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the Book from the Author","review":"So you want to know about Labs? Well, they're certainly the most popular purebreds, but what makes them so special? Inside this book, you'll learn about Labrador Retrievers, their history and personality as well as hereditary diseases and activities.Unlike many Lab books out there, this is a pet guide, aimed at the first time Lab owner. It's not intended to be a guide to show dogs or pedigrees (why would you consider picking up an Idiot's Guide if you want that?) This book deals with all facets of Labrador pet ownership and contrary to the title, I don't think you're an idiot if you check out this book.Be my guest to peruse through the book online here and enjoy. This book is the winner of the DWAA Maxwell Award for 2003 as the best pet breed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best album from the 80's but not this version","review":"Two different releases of this album are available:1) the EMI European/Japanese release with 12 songs and Dirty looks clocking at 3:20. Two songs are only available on this version: Mr. Lee and Tell mama.2) the RCA US version with 10 songs and Dirty looks in a 4:10 different mix.This album is really wonderful. Dirty looks is one of her sexiest songs, like Love hangover in 1976, the ballads There goes my baby and Summertime capture the magic of her fragility, Stranger in paradise is haunting and mysterious, Shine and Shockwaves are 100% delicious swing. The production by sound engineer Tom Dowd, who worked with Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin during their Atlantic years, is flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Australia Fair.","review":"I'm a New Zealander, so take it from me, this guy is good. He's not in danger of toppling Neil Finn from his antipodean throne, but this is a truly evocative and strangely catchy little album.It is quintessentially Australian. The anthem \\"Adelaide\\" is this collection's brilliant cornerstone, and elsewhere it boasts little rippers like \\"Before The Old Man Died\\", \\"I Won't Be Torn Apart\\" and \\"Leaps And Bounds\\".Just buy it if you think you might like it. You can always give it away. Go on, it's good, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control Lacking","review":"The quality control on this is lacking.(1) The screw holes drilled into the top shelf for the side handle did not align, forcing you to start the screws yourself on one side (without using the pre-drilled holes).(2) There were dark stains on the wood slats that could not be removed, even with abrasive cleaner (see photos)(3) The top shelf is two separate sections. One section is a little higher than the other on one side, which means the top shelf is not flat across the entire top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy","review":"Got this as extra counter space. Its sturdy and holds weight well. Careful when installing the castors cause the wood can crack easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality","review":"Finished wood was scratched and dented.

It was a nightmare to put together and I am still waiting on extra screws from the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Study Guide","review":"This book is well-written with many activities and ideas for leading a study group. It would also servce as an individual Bible study guide just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start Over","review":"I didn't think this book was a very satisfying read. It talks about the prayer of a little known Bible hero. It instructs you to leave the past behind. For me, that is quitting drugs. I first got into drugs when I was 13 or 14. I remained perpetuallly stoned until I was 26. As you do drugs you stop maturing mentally. It impairs your judgement and motivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book of Jabez - Bible study","review":"This book was listed as New, when I reviewed the book on a few pages (each full page) of questions had been written into, with a pen. Which takes away from the purpose of ordering the book in the first place. Very disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prayer of Jabez Bible Study","review":"This book was well used. It was handwritten over half of the pages in black ink and not fit for study. Someone's scribbled opinions leaves no room for other interpretations. This is the seller's fault.

Well, I have, and now I am able to after reading this small, delight- ful book by Dr. Bruce Wilkinson. It is not preachy, dull or long. In a short time, you can read the whole book, and find yourself hungry to know what the author is talking about. So you keep on reading it over and over and finally you start to get it! Then you make copies of the Prayer and tape them on your bathroom mirrors to remind you. Then you start praying this prayer every morning and evening. Pretty soon it is in your sub- conscious and you are praying all day long when something comes up. This is so great! What more could you want than to be in touch with your Heavenly Father? Well, so try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Criticism answered","review":"First, let me say that I found the book, \\"Prayer of Jabez\\", very inspiring. So much so that I have read it six times. Using the devotional and the original book, I led a morning bible study for five days that everyone participating enjoyed greatly. Our church in in the midst of using the book for an eight week Sunday night study.As for the criticism voiced in \\"Mistake-ridden\\", I can only say that the Bible Study and Leaders Guide were probably rushed to press without taking necessary time to check out all the references. The Jude reference mentioned is obviously Judges.All other thoughts aside, it is wonderful to see a Christian book capture the attention of so many readers that it have been on the best seller lists as long as Jabez has. I might add that \\"Secrets of The Vine\\" is better than Jabez, and I look for great blessings from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad","review":"The book I received was in bad shape, but I received a refund without asking and a apology.

It's a rip off of those really expensive ones (I think they're called Petunia Pickle). A couple complaints- the changing pad is flimsy and the magnetic \\"button\\" fell inside the material before my baby was even born."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive bag, but returning it - AGAIN","review":"I fell in love with this bag when registering at Babies R Us. A good friend purchased it for us and I was so excited to receive it. When it arrived, I noticed that there was yucky sticky stuff on the side, so returned it to a Babies R Us store and got a new one. I packed up the bag and before my baby was even born, I noticed that the little magnetic closure (which is attached between the outer and inner material) fell down to the bottom of the bag and I am now unable to close the flap!! I hope to return it to Babies R Us, even though I cut off the tags and no longer have them. I will NOT be exchanging it for another one of these bags. We have been using the free diaper bag we received from the hospital when the baby was born and are happy with it. I don't recommend this bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bag!","review":"I just received this bag today and it seems like a very nice bag, I'm given it only 4 stars because I have not used it yet, but it is a very nice size bag, it looks small in the picture and yes, the changing pad is extremely flimsy, but you can always get another one, even though this one will probably be just fine! The way I see it, it's better than spending 175 on a bag, and even if the magnectic button stops working, it still has a zipper so it really won't stay open. The button just holds the flap down to hide the zipper. overall, its a great little bag!Update: I used this bag the weekend and I got alot of complements, yes the magnectic closure seems to have gotten lost; But the zipper still works and that is really want closes the bag anyway, nothing is getting damage or falling out, so I am still happy with the bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks great but doesn't last long","review":"my baby is now 6 weeks old and the bag is already broken.

They've topped themselves","review":"This cd is for anyone who loves heavy music. It's simply a damn heavy pleasure to listen to. It's been a long time coming, but it was certainly worth the wait. Anthrax is at the top of their game and I can't imagine how anyone couldn't like this cd. Simply put, it's the total package...musically and lyrically. You've read the reviews, you know the details...now BUY THIS CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, although I also wish they had Joey!","review":"When I first put this in, i didnt like it. My main beef was i thought it was too much like anthrax, meaning: it sounded alot like white noise. I was hoping maybe they would have changed their style a little bit, or did something new. However, after my second listening I really like this album now. I listen to it alot. I like it better than their last album, but as others have mentioned, Anthrax will never be the same without Joey. Nice album though, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"................","review":"When this came out I had already considered myself a fan of \\"Spreading the Disease\\" and \\"Among the Living\\", and had just started to get into \\"The Sound of White Noise.\\" So I had zero pretensions about Bush, or even their slower and less thrashy guitar direction they had taken since acquiring him on the aforementioned album. The issue for me is the sheer redundancy of the riffs. There are a bunch of \\"blocky\\" sounding chug-a-thons that really do nothing for me. \\"What Doesn't Die\\" despite being one of the worst offenders of that formula is actually one of the best on here. \\"Cadillac Rock Box\\" has a nasty guitar riff, and really doesn't sound like anything else on here. Had they taken the album in the direction of that song I would have liked it alot more. There were a few other songs I got into, but on the whole I can't really say I care for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Metal album out there!","review":"From start to finish, this album totally rocks! Anthrax shows the world that you can be successful and not have to change everything to please the masses! This album has some nice crunchy riffs along with great off the wall sounds that really show some thinking outside the box. Safe Home is probably one of my favorite Anthrax songs now! BUY THIS STUFF, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you listen the more you'll like..","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Anthrax with WCFYA. But this is a *great* record. It's easily the best since \\"Sound of White Noise\\". The playing is tight and the musicianship is excellent. This band shows time and again why they are living legends of american heavy metal. Interestingly one of the weaker tracks is the single- \\"Safe Home\\". Don't misunderstand, it's very good. But the title track, for example, would probably have made a better first single from the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal insanity from our friendly NYC thrashsters, Anthrax","review":"A longtime fan of Anthrax, I've waited 5 hard years for the release of this CD. Has the wait been worth it? You'd better believe it. For starters, it's the heaviest CD Anthrax has ever made. Scott's rhythmaniacal guitars are skull-crushingly heavy and Charlie's kick drums clobber you in the head. Thank god, because I am sick of all the pseudo nu-metal crap on the radio these days. The world needs real heavy-metal and Anthrax are back at their best, with John's voice raging away. As for the CD itself, the artwork is cool and there's some extra material that you can view on your PC, some videos and stuff like that. The production is crisp and clean.Thanks for including it, boys! All the instruments are balanced well, and when you turn it way up, the ground shakes, as it should. I can't wait to see these guys Saturday night at the Stone Pony in NJ!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Other than the title track, What doesnt die, Nobody knows anything and Refuse to be denied, this album is kind of weak. It could be a lot faster with more of Benante's signature double bass. It's heavy but it lacks the energy of their older albums. It sounds like they're trying to produce radio hits, but they have no mainstream potential and they might as well stick to what made their older stuff successful, Energy, originality, and more humorous songs (ie:Startin up a posse, NFL, I am the law, Bring the noise, I'm the man) . Otherwise It's about time they hung up their instruments for good before they recycle more material on their next album like they did with this one and the 2 albums before that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A refusal to age gracefully","review":"It must be hard for a band to remain a viable outfit yet still realise they are never going to recapture their past glories. Since jettisoning the increasingly ludicrous Joey Belladonna in favour of the leather lunged vocal powerhouse that is John Bush, Anthrax has enjoyed mixed fortunes and become very familiar with the law of diminishing returns. It's a shame, because when they get it right, as on What Doesn't Die and the stupendous Safe Home (unbelievably a song which brings to mind a mix of Rocket From The Crypt and Survivor!), they still sound like worldbeaters and show their peers how it's done- put this against St. Anger and see which stays in your cd deck the longer; it's just that, as with their last album (Volume 8-The Threat Is Real) the highs are spaced too far apart to really offer much hope of a sustained return to form. If you can, get hold of the limited edition which comes with a bonus cd collection of some of their more interesting cover versions"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"Is this some swort of joke?!This isn't the real Anthrax as we know them. They should have changed thier name after Joey left, so it wouldn't of mattered if they'd change it after the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax envolopes. If you want real metal, then you would generaly have to go back to the 80's and early 90's. That's when everything was mostly better.The same goes for the last albums that came out with John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"These guys need to drop this band and focus on new S.O.D. material. John Bush should reform Armored Saint. At least they didn't try too hard to write radio playable metal. I'd have to place Anthrax in the Metallica category, i.e., I never listen to the good old albums anymore because the new albums are so extremely disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is a waste of money. Don't buy it.","review":"If you heard that Anthrax plays thrash, and you like thrash,i.e. old school Forbidden, Exodus, Testament, Sodom, Destruction, etc. Don't be fooled into buying this album....This ISN'T thrash!! It's crap! I wasted money on this album having never before listened to Anthrax and what I had heard was completely right, the singer SUCKS, the jams are weak and lame, and the lyrics are garbage.Why do record companys produce lame stuff like this? Because they think we're stupid enough to buy it. Let's show them they're wrong. Don't buy any crappy new albums from washed up 80's thrash bands , i.e. Metallica, Testament, Overkill, Exodus, Forbidden, Anthrax. Trust me, just because some of them were good in the 80's doesn't mean they don't suck to high heaven now.1 star for a lame-ass ripoff record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthrax should be called Nu-thrax..haha","review":"I really can't believe people actually like this weak music. Anthrax only has 3 good albums, Fistful of metal, Spreading the disease, and Among the living. In other words, Anthrax has sucked now for about 17 years. Whoa, thats longer than Nu-tallica has sucked. Anthrax is just worthless. None of them can play anymore, it's just all jumpriffs that any band could play. When they fired Joey belladona, they killed themselves for good. John Bush is one of the worst vocalists ever. Their bassist Frank Bella realized how bad they were sucking, so he decided to quit. haha. Slayer is the only band of the \\"big four\\" that still plays metal. I don't know what Dave Mustaine is doing with Megadeth, he might just do some kinda dumb solo album. But anyway Anthrax has been Nu-thrax ever since they got John Bush. They need to just quit and die for good. And just for the record, all Nu-metal is for sissy little girls and f@gs. Long live Death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthrax finds redemption easily","review":"With a style distinctly their own, just short of formulaic we find ourselves with another titan among metal offerings. Although nu-metal has swept us by storm and by infection they still cannot achieve what aggression their fore-fathers have and still display. Yes, this means you, Chester of Linkin Park. Armed to the teeth with John Bush on vocals and an incendiary performance (as usual) from Scott Ian. The drums are vital and fast with a very urgent feel. This is a must-have for any metal maniac. No, this is not a rehash, this is not copycat. It is a full on 100% ...whuppin'. Prepare yourself. We have come for you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the defination of awesomemetal!","review":"This album is one of the best of Anthrax career which has so many amazing albums it's hard to pick a best one.

Play it loud mutha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've read lots of reviews saying that Anthrax's finally back. And let me tell you, that's not true. \\"We've come for...\\" is not Anthrax's comeback, and is not better than metallica's St. Anger, nor Megadeth's \\"The World Needs A hero\\", these three albums are desperate desires in re-gain the strength and speed, but they're such failures.OK, this album is more solid and consistent than Stomp 442, but there's no thrash, just a couple of good, aggresive and well-delivered songs that's all. When Anthrax's sound changed with the release of SOund Of White Noise i was pretty much OK, and in fact loved it more than other Anthrax's albums of the \\"Belladona era\\". So i don't have a problem with the vocals or whatever, it's just plain boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on Jesus","review":"This is a pretty good book.

It was a great review of the history of the descent of modern Cuba that started in the late 1950's and continues today.Unfortunately, this movie was not a big hit at the box office.

Yet, the widespread criticism that Garcia does not show enough of the poor and destitute of pre-revolutionary Cuba is only partially mitigated by his ridicule of Batista in the first part of the movie. The title itself (translated \\"Adieu Cuba\\" in the French version) betrays a certain nostalgia by the author for the bygone days. But in the end the viewer is left with a strongly negative view of both Batista and Castro, as well as Guevara. Well deserved.The movie is a bit long but well worth its time for it allows the viewer to savour the colors, music and atmosphere of Cuba 50 years ago. But this is perhaps due to the long script by Guillermo Cabrera Infante."},{"rating":"1","title":"My sympathy...","review":"My sympathy to Andy Garcia for trying so hard.

I was only nine years old when the overthrow of Batista occurred and was living in Colombia, S.A. We moved to the USA in 1961, because of the civil war that had taken place in Colombia;as a nine year old child I did not understand the political factors involved in the world and specifically the Cold War. The Lost City fills in a gap of time that I was too young to appreciate. Seeing a family struggle with what is the right thing to do during a very difficult political situation only makes me appreciate how lucky we are in the USA where our forefathers had the wisdom (after having experienced the injustices of European life) to have safe guards with checks and balances of power built into our Constitution and thus avoid despot rulers like Batista and Castro, regardless of what side of the political spectrum they espouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANDY GARCIA, OPUS 1","review":"***1/2 2005. Directed by Andy Garcia. Havana, Cuba. 1958. The Fellove family belongs to the Cuban high bourgeoisie with at his head Don Federico, a university professor. Don Federico's eldest son, Fico, is the owner of a famous night club while his two brothers are politically engaged. Dictator Batista's regime is soon threatened by Fidel Castro and his comrades. The screenplay of the first film directed by Andy Garcia is obviously and, let's admit it, rather elementarily anti-Castrist. The unique fully-developed point of view is the point of view of the Cuban bourgeoisie, the characters of Luis, Aurora and Ricardo Fellove, who are pro-Castrists, being anecdotal at the most. If you can disregard this preconception, the film is interesting, above average and you'll certainly appreciate a couple of scenes featuring Bill Murray and Dustin Hoffman. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is a great movie, showing Cuba before the comunist came and how they changed this beautiful island country. As always, Andy Garcia was Great, he was perfect for the part. over all, it was well cast and a movie to see over and over again!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That","review":"This film has more meaning to people who experienced what this film is about as I did. I am Cuban and left the island in 1962. As a Pedro Pan kid, I can tell you Mr. Garcia has done one heck of a job, with friends and not much cash, to tell what happened in those early days of the of \\"Our\\" Lost City. Congratulations to him and all the people who gave of their time and talent to make his dream come true. If you're a Cuban, don't miss this movie. If you're not, what the heck, watch it anyway. I bet you'll understand more than you do right now.Maria Hernandez Mills"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Propaganda","review":"Pro american view of events at that time. The story was good, but too much of a political statement for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a mess","review":"S l o w, painfully slow homage to the last days of Havana before the revolution. Trouble is Andy Garcia acted AND directed, and no one told him, no. The pace is glacial. Garcia loves Cuban music and he pays almost as much homage to it as to his plot, such as it is. And what is Bill Murray doing in this? He is totally out of place. The colors really pop and the scenery is pretty, but Garcia should stick to acting. The script stinks, and the directing is painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated film now available in HD!!!","review":"First off, this movie is well done. Sure Bill Murray's character seems random, and I wish Dustin Hoffman would have had a bigger role, but still, it is a beautiful film. Andy Garcia captured a Casablanca-ish feel and the Cinematography is top-notch. I have a copy of the film on DVD and this HD-DVD is a BIG improvement. There are some minor artifacts in a couple of scenes, but that's it(I have 50 inch 1080P LED DLP). Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible movie about how it began","review":"As a young Cuban-American it helped me feel what our families went through during that time. Very emmotional...The movie was great and done very well. It's really not a movie about Castro, but a movie about a beautiful island that had so much passion, beauty, culture and talent and how it was all stripped away by deception. Andy Garcia did a beautiful job with this movie and was joined by an incredible cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and scattered","review":"This movie is about a nightclub owner in Cuba shortly before Castro took power and thereafter. It is too long and tries to cover too many things.

A couple of hours later I was very disappointed. The author has some good basic ideas (albeit a bit trite) but they are clogged by the tales of her version of \\"the good life\\"--a round-the-world trip at age 16, multiple trips to Bermuda and Paris, her meals at the \\"finest restaurants in New York\\". I especially loved the part when she gently chides her readers to ease back on some of the technological demands of their jobs, as she does thanks to her three assistants. I can't afford to pay someone to screen my e-mails for me, and funny, my boss doesn't seem to be receptive to picking up the tab either. Some of her examples are alienating, insensitive, and insulting to the readers out there who are squeaking by financially and can't afford to have a dress made for themselves in Hong Kong.

I didn't find it. Stoddard does nothing but quote Western philosophers and brag about her own experiences living the good life. The book is, literally, all about her. We hear about her trips to various resorts, how she and her husband (an attorney)treat themselves to a hedonistic dessert every day, and about her design business. We hear about what type finial one customer requested and about the maple bed another client fussed over. I have no idea what any of the Aristotle quotes, Barbados trips, ice creams, or design customers have to do with me learning to live the good life, but Stoddard spends the entire book sprinkling mindless rhetoric with these unremarkable bits of news.If you want to help yourself live the good life, save a few bucks by avoiding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dead Matter not","review":"Not to burst anyone's bubble, but this film isn't that great. In fairness, it's obvious that those that made it gave it their best shot and made it with heart. And, there are some good ideas here. Still, the film is convoluted, suffers from poor pacing, editing and looks cheap. It also does a poor job trying to decide if it's a horror film or satire. One scene meant for laughs features a zombie drinking beer in a pub, a funny idea. Amazingly the crowd in the bar doesn't even notice the monster and the joke just dies. Beloved Cleveland celeb Big Chuck has a cameo but isn't given much to do, which is a shame. Midnight Syndicate is known for their music but the score feels overproduced for this kind of B movie carnage and intrudes more than enhances the movie. Listening to the soundtrack (which is very good) by itself would be the better option. I have to note that the beautiful DVD cover artwork is truly awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My wife and I were very disappointed by this movie.

In a careful liteary analysis the author shows that John is written in the contemporary literary form of the day - the 5-part Greek tragedy - with well structured sections and chiasmi from beginning to end. The resurrection of Lazarus and reaction of Sanhedrin form the climatic turning point in the literary structure. This analysis convincingly defends the textual integrity of John, and answers objections of source critics who claim the text has inconsistencies pointing to editing or composition by multiple authors. On a personal level, this new insight into the design of John is very profound.

While the acting and effects were sufficient enough for a film of this type, the director's lack of creativity in building suspense makes it a slow watch but still very worthwhile for fans of Clint Walker or 70's schlock sci-fi.Even at 70 minutes, they were kinda stretching it primarily because of lack of suspenseful scenes or creativity in cinematography.

The graphics are nice, the music options are tolerable, and the tile sets are cool. You can also make your own layouts! The only major drawback, to me, of this game is that it will ONLY play at 800x600 resolution, and it will reduce your resolution if you have it set higher. Because of this, I don't play it as much anymore, since all of my systems are set at 1024.

Even though the true events are distant now, this cold-war story is as chilling and exciting today as it happened. Ably directed by Delbert Mann, photographed sharply with minimum special effects, Disney has delivered once more a family adventure as interestingly as can be done in the tradition of \\"Swiss Family Robinson\\" or \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\" I would also recommend this to those who wish to prick the interest of science in youthful minds before they give way to passive X-Box consumption.

Mr. Mister was a great Contempory Christian band that played to the \\"masses\\". The songwriting on go on... is first rate. Dust is one of those songs that make you think. The Tube is a great look at how TV can take over our lives. Power Over Me is a look at the power of having a loved one in pain and how your life is centered on trying to understand their pain. Man Of A Thousand Dances deals with how we get to know God and our perception of our faith.

I searched for a long time to find this on CD to no avail. Last year they released a Greatest Hits CD, which, in my opinion, should have included every song on this album.

Lead vocalist Richard Page is in fine form and the songs expertly crafted. Mr Mister was often lambasted by musical crtics for being artificial and possessing little talent. I have to disagree. They're really one of the better bands of the 80s and this collection affirms this status.The best tracks IMO are DUST, a haunting song supported by its flowing musical accompaniment; the infectious HEALING WATERS; the driving CONTROL, STAND AND DELIVER and WATCHING THE WORLD; and the powerful closing track, THE BORDER.It's unfortunate the band didn't have a long career but they did make an impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and overhyped","review":"I buy cookbooks as much for the reading material as for the recipes, but in this case, reading carefully brings out the worst in the book.

The recipes, too, disappoint. Many of them are the sort of thing you'd come up with on your own such as sauteeing a given vegetable in parsley, garlic, and olive oil.

Lewis and have come to notice the name Walter Hooper everywhere. I would have believed he was who he claimed to be had I not by accident picked up this book.I realize that the author is biased, occasionally provides evidence that are somewhat sketchy, and--of all things--attacks Hooper's sexual preference, but her sarcasm is brilliant. Besides, no matter how one-sided she is, facts are facts. I only feel sorry that this had to happen. I would have loved to see how Lewis's papers would turn out had they fallen into the right hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"fraudulent claims","review":"I am glad to see this book is NOT in print. The author attempted to smear the reputation of Walter Hooper by claiming that he had forged the text of Lewis' posthumous The Dark Tower and had overstated his claims of friendship with Lewis. In fact, in 1992 Lindskoog herself revealed that she forged letters in support of her claims. Several independent handwriting experts also confirmed that the manuscripts were written by Lewis. So \`nuff said; this book deserves to be used as kindling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous general reference","review":"For the person who wants to get an excellent grounding in stage makeup, this is the place to start. It very well may be the place to end, also,unless you need to delve more deeply into special effects makeup. Rather than giving you hard and fast rules, the author explains the principles behind good makeup design and application. There are tons of pictures, and it covers most basic makeup situations for stage, with a cursory treatment of other applications such as film and television."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to surf fish? Not from this DVD","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this DVD and subsequently returned it. One would hope that an instructional DVD would cover topics such as how to surf cast which is more difficult to learn from a book that can only present a sequence of photographs. Instead the information covered is actually better presented in Burnley's \\"Surf Fishing the Atlantic Coast\\". Information on how to identify good fishing spots and the equipment to use doesn't require a video format for effective presentation. The only action in the DVD are scenes of good ol' boys fishing the Carolina Coast--it was more of a travelogue from the fifties than an instructional video.

Things are usually resolved at the end, but for younger children who may not follow the story through to the end every time, this can be a big problem.Caillou uses very hateful words towards his little sister in the book and even the resolve isn't satisfying.

Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the worst things to ever happen to American films and deservedly so. He's ruined many a good movie that he has painfully performed in. And after such a stellar film as Braveheart, Randall Wallace could have done better justice in adapting Alexandre Dumas' classic tale of adventure, betrayal and ultimate redemption. It's not all bad, but it certainly isn't all good, or even half good for that matter. It's entertaining, but not the best big screen version of the movie there is. Entertaining, but just not quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Truly this is some of Leonardo DiCaprio's best work. For me it takes a very good actor to pull off two completely different roles in a movie and he nailed them both! Being so mean and cruel with one while shy and loving with the other, amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over-shadowed by Titanic","review":"This is a moving, true story, that is wonderfully acted, and an all around comepletely wonderful movie. It is, it seems, over-shadowed by the long and mysterious Titanic, whose rave reveiws are not really helping any other movie which came out withen in six months of it. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, I'm a Leo DiCaprio fan, so of course I've seen Titanic. Seven times in fact, and I think it was well worth seeing every time, because I only love it more whenever I see it again. But that still doesn't mean it was good for any of the other movies coming out around it. The movie The Man in the Iron Mask is one of the most captivating films I have ever seen, and I rate it five stars with no hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the right look...","review":"When one thinks of Alexandre Dumas' three musketeers and of D'Artagnan, one usually imagines men who look exactly like the ones in this movie...in other words, the casting is just right. Leonardo DiCaprio also does a terrific job in his dual role, able to act evil and underhanded as King Louis or gentle and vulnerable as his twin Philippe with wonderful ease and feeling. Hats off to this talented young actor for such a versatile and interesting performance. The musical score, the costumes and the sets all contribute to the making of this a fine period drama...Bravo to all, cast and crew, for this highly enjoyable movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"i love this movie, and it was in awesone condition! the shipping was even quicker than I thought it would be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!!

But at a friend's urging to see it because of the talents of Byrne, Irons, and Malkovich I gave in. The results were I was surprised at how well the film turned out. All four Musketeers were wonderful, but especially Byrne and Irons as D'Artagnan and Aramis repectfully gave brilliant performances. The film had it all: romance, angst, swashbuckling, and gorgeous men with long hair and swords. My only fault with the film was diCaprio, he was not playing Louis or Phillipe, but diCaprio. His performance made me cringe, but I managed for the most part ignore him and focus, on what I considered the main characters, the Musketeers."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ambitious forgettable film forgotten like the true Man in the Iron Mask","review":"Call me sentimental but I far more enjoyed Richard Chamberlain's Man in the Iron Mask from the 70s as it had more style and less big budget hokeyness.This film is another forgettable 90s big budget piece that tried to be more than it was. All the heart stirring and melodramatics might have worked on the teeny bopper crowd but it raised groans from older audience members. There was too much heart-pulling hokeyness to the whole thing - the charge against the muskets for example which ended dramatically lifeless since no one died. The one who did die in the movie didn't die in the book.I don't want to hate on DiCaprio as he is an easy target but his portrayal of young Louis XIV was terrible. He did a better Phillipe because he had to be more subdued.I think the film took itself too seriously and as a result it became a rather soppy melodramatic affair with shallow roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad acting, bad script, terrible movie","review":"This is an unsophisticated, badly written, terribly acted movie that just doesn't work. I can't imagine what the reviewers who like it were thinking. DiCaprio is ghastly. None of the actors can read any of the lines convincingly. The damsel in distress has the most childish, silly voice.... Awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!","review":"Now, girls, be honest, I know 98% percent of you saw this movie simply to see Leonardo DiCaprio. I actually read the book before I saw the movie, and the movie doesn't even deserve the same title. The movie totally departs for what is a magnificent book, and twists it all around in to this sex story that I found totally unappealing. And DiCaprio? Can there be a worse man for the part? And the blonde girl he falls in love with ( I think her name is Christine) I challange you to find me someone who is a worse actress than her. Plus, she obviously had the brain mass of a drunken parrot. And that doesn't even begin to pick at the whole love affair between the Queen and D'Artangan (pardon my spelling)that absolutely sickened and appalled me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DiCaprio's a good actor but not the for this part-not believable","review":"Leonard DiCaprio carries off his role in Aviator with aplomb. As for his role in the Man in the Iron Mask he's a bomb.A King of France with an almost squeaky voice? Shouldn't have accepted the script Leonard, you did better as \\"The Kid\\" in\\"The Quick and the Dead\\" and that wasn't completely believable, but then neither were Hackman, or Stone, both too over blown.Back to \\"Iron Mask\\" the whole thing seem too contrived. Russell Crowe, the Preacher who swore off killing gunning down his opponents, for Pete's sake take the bullet Russell you'll still get paid.The Iron Mask needed somebody who could be suave and nasty as all get out, and young sir, you didn't have the chops for either of those qualities at the age you were when you made that film. Daniel Day Lewis, Alec Baldwin, or Tim Roth are names that pop into my mind who could be nasty and suave, that is to say perfidious enough to carry off the role.Old Timer"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film should wear a mask","review":"Don't want to be down on anybody but this film pretty much wreaks.Good scenery. Superb fight scens though the last one was pathetic. Nice costuming but awful diolog and poor plot.Jeremy Irons plays his role well but nobody else does. DiCaprio pretty much dcapitates his characters. As Louis he is an inept villein. As Philip he plays an innocent badly.It wreaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Crap in the iron mask","review":"This movie is unfortunately not worth the price. There are two fatal flaws that any well-educated member of the human race ought to realize straightaway: 1. The star is Leonardo DiCaprio. 2. The star is not Patrick McGoohan.In short, WIMPY!!! The better version is the '70s edition starring Richard Chamberlin, and possibly the best actor ever, Mr. Patrick McGoohan, recently appearing in such films as Braveheart.My Advice: Toss this out with your copy of Tomorrow Never Dies and get some real pictures. But I will say that the new Count of Monte Cristo is awesome, as compared to the older one. So as they say, \\"1 out of 2 brings in just as much cash as 2 out of 2.\\" Way to go, Hollywood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is all about that little kid who can't act: Leo","review":"YAWN.

Other wise, see the 1976 version for true entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace to a Classic Novel","review":"This version of The Man in the Iron Mask is terrible. I had heard several very highly rated reccommendations for the movie and I was bitterly disappointed. From the very beginning I was bored completely. Leo fans are the only ones I can see being interested in this film. Definately NOT on my wish list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"This is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is disappointing for several reasons. One it does not do justice to the excellent writing of Dumas. Two, the directing is poor, managing to elicit less than spectacular acting from Malkovich, Irons or Depardieu. Three the sword fighting is poor. Fourth the movie drags on without inspiring any particular interest in the supposed heros (except for the scene where Athos goes to revenge his son's death). If you can rent this movie it might be worth an evenings watch. I wouldn't bother buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being John Malkovich","review":"I really liked this movie for the casting roles of the Four Muskateers. Jeremy Irons was great. But I am impartial to Malkovich. You see, I live in a town not far (actually 35 miles) from where Malkovich grew up. My town plays his home town in sports. I even know his cousin. And from her stories, growing up, Malkovich really was like he acts now. A real stinker! I love his acting because it's a no nonsense type of acting.I think this movie would have done alot better at the box office if it hadn't been for the sinking Leonardo. Actually Brenden Frasier would have been better as King Louis.Good sword play at the end. With a feel good moment, to boot.All for One and One for All!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun day at the movies","review":"I loved the movie it was well acted out, and the plot was good. I have seen old version of the classic story, the Iron Mask- but this one is my all time favorite picture. I loved the clothes and the set used to create the movie. This is a good buy, if you love classic periods and enriched acting. Plus romance is always a plus in my book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful story","review":"This is by far one of the most beautiful stories I've seen in a long time and I've never thought to buy the DVD. I just finished watching it on AMC and was reminded how much I enjoy it. They truly don't make them like this anymore. The characters do a wonderful job of portraying the story. I don't want to go into much detail, because I don't want to give it all away, but the best part was finding out the boys (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) are actually sons of one of the muskateers. I really hope you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nearly great movie.","review":"I had not considered seeing this movie mainly because I am not a Leo fan. However I caught it on cable and was stunned. I bought myself a copy the next day. My 16 year old son thinks I am crazy because I have watched it 10 times in 2 weeks.Leo did well, but Gabriel Byrne was outstanding. I especially love the last thirty minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film has been under-rated and is really a lot of fun.","review":"It wouldn't have mattered WHAT film Leonardo DeCaprio made after TITANIC, the biggest blockbuster ever would have overshadowed and dwarfed it. To say that THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK suffers in comparison is unfair. The film is actually surprisingly well-made and a rousing adventure story. The exceptional and talented surrounding cast of Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gerard Depardieu, and Garbriel Byrne practically guaranteed a thespian success with or without the also-talented Leo. Give the film a chance and a break--it really IS a lot of fun to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful movie for anyone who loves outstanding movies.","review":"Leonardo DiCaprio plays the intriguing and cold-hearted villain, and also his charming, naive twin brother. The great Louie the sixteenth has unjustly sentenced his twin brother to live in a mask for forever (until he dies), for fear of losing reign of France. So Phillippe lives in a cold iron mask until the Three Musketeers free him, with a plan to switch Louie and Phillippe, since Louie is so mean. Ending with a legendary show of bravery and courage, the battle scene is the best part. Truly a gem of a movie, this is a must-see and also a must-have. A little inappropriate, at times, for a young child, but there's always the old cover-the-eyes-with-the-hand. I don't think, though, that violence or sexuality is a reason not to see this truly magnificent work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, and laughably inaccurate.","review":"I have seen worse films. I can't think of any right off the top of my head, but I'm sure I have seen them. Not many though. To begin with: DiCaprio's acting, never all that good, was at an all time low. \\"Titanic\\" was the only film in which he managed to do a worse job. The acting of the elder characters was quite decent, save for the poor choice of Malkovich as the aging Athos. Dumas was turning over in his grave, of that I've no doubt. The historical inaccuracy was pathetic. I am certain that any country that was ever ruled by a hereditary monarchy rolled in the ailes from border to border when this film was shown. To think that D'Artagnan was involved with Anne of Austria (something totally incompatable with the book), is laughable. I shudder to think what the French reaction to this film was.All in all, it is not worth either buying or seeing. A pathetic attempt to recreate the muskateer legend. . . a failed attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Kept Wanting It To Be Wonderful!","review":"With all that talent how could it go so wrong! Mr Malcovich seemed only to want it over with so he could get away. DeCaprio was lost and in desperate need of direction. The others tried, but there was no saving this movie. It was scenically beautiful, packed with talent, and a total waste of time. I recently watched a silent version of this story which held me as this group of fine talent should have been able to, but could not. This film just makes me sad for what it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of the King","review":"Wonderful and excellent movie also best performance! Philpe had true heart of the King not Louis. You have to keep box of tissues and you will get tearful when the King met his mother for the first time at the beautiful Ball. Love the part where D'Artagnan noticed something different about his King and just went right up to him and stared him down good. Wonderful movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Dissappoinment","review":"Leonald Maltin is the film critic I respect the most, but this time I must disagree: this version is lame. Gerard Depardieu is the only thing that makes it worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Original is Better!","review":"I didn't think movie was great at all! I don't like Leo either. I think the movie dragged on too long. There were some immpressive actors in this movie though..but I still give it a bad review. It is better to see the Original first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trav man!","review":"This movie is great!!! There is some pretty funny comedy in this film. There is also alot of action.

I found the movie laughable. Bad dialog, bad acting, and just plain silly. I have seen other versions of this story that are far better than this one. I have never thought much of DiCillio's acting abilities, and this movie only reinforces that opinion. Just awful. Waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"* The man in the iron mask *","review":"This dvd is in good condition and once again the price I paid with shipping and handling included is excellent and I will buy more \\"used\\" dvds in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closest to the idea of the Musketeers.","review":"I know that every movie should be judged independent of it's source material, but I have a really hard time when it comes to Dumas' stories. He just did them so well that I find it hard to watch my favorite charaters get butchered on screen. This movie didn't do that so bad. They butchered the story, and many of the charaterizations were just wrong, somehow I think this movie captured the spirit or essence of the novels beter than other movies.That being said now I need to review this as a movie independent of the novel. Most of the performances were good, the direction was adaquite, but the story was flawed, though beter than any other version of the Iron Mask I've seen. More or less it is a good adventure that is quite fun to watch, though it leaves no lasting impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great movie .","review":"In my opinion everything was ,just perfect. The acting was fabulous and ofcourse the actors gave their best self. Iam a Leonardo's fan and i think that the role of king Louis it was performed excellent from Leonardo . The movie was one of the most overwhelming movies that i have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched performance - No redeeming value","review":"I have to say this is the biggest letdown I have had in the past 10 years. L. DiCaprio is pathetic. The other actors are sleep walking through the entire thing, probably regretting the fact that they were ever involved and wanting to end their self-induced torture as quickly as possible.If you are brain damaged or a 14 year old acne faced female in love with L. DiCaprio you will enjoy this film. If you have enjoyed previous adaptations of Alexander Dumas' Musketeer stories or can recognize bad acting then you will be looking for a garbage can to throw up in (Better get a bucket!). If you paid money and saw this in the theatre without violently demanding a refund afterwards, I admire your Olympian self-restraint."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films I have ever seen...","review":"Well, I just tried to watch this film on TV but I couldn't make it all the way through. This is one of the worst films I have seen in years -- I found myself unintenionally laughing and cringing throughout. Malkovich, Irons, Byrne, and perhaps Depardieu should be ashamed for taking part in such a lemon of a movie. Di Caprio is the worst part of course as he is totally miscast as the King. In all, the entire film is a highly melodramatized piece of rubbish that should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeremy Irons is awesome, but DiCaprio...ick","review":"I just saw this movie a few days ago, and I still have a lingering bad taste in my mouth from it. It's all right to veer away from the original book's plot, but I can only take so much. The twist at the end was just too much to stomach. DiCaprio was a horrible casting choice, sounding very much like a 20th century brat rather than a spoiled French king. He was better as Phillipe...I guess he just doesn't play royalty well at all. The only glimmer in this movie were the familiar old Muskateers, Jeremy Irons in particular. He's always brilliant, so I tacked on one more star than I wanted to, just for him. DiCaprio may pull in an audience, but it's the Muskateers the put out a quality performance. Too bad this movie was such a waste of their talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Di Caprio?..........","review":"I really enjoyed watching four excellent actors but, hated to see Leo with these actors. Why God why, did they give Di Caprio an opportunity to be on the same movie with these actors? I think i'll never get it... See the movie, if you even hate Di Caprio it's a real classic a must see. And even Leo acted well in that one. Don'tmiss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overshadowed by Titanic","review":"This is the best movie of the century, not Titanic. I had had seen this movie before, when I thought that Leo was cool, but then I relized that I would have loved it whether Leo had been in it or not. He is a great actor though, and you can totally see that when he plays a double role, because he is so different when he is Louie, and then the scene changes to Philleppe. My favorite scene is the one: \\"What is Porthos doing?\\" \\"Walking into the barn naked.\\" (Without any surprise in his voice) I was in gales of laughter at that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie -- See it, you won't be disappointed !!","review":"Once I saw Titanic, I did not believe I would find a movie that would really hold my intrest. I did not believe that Leonardo Dicaprio could do as good a job as he did in Titanic. However, I did change my mind when I saw this movie. Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne, John Makovich and Gerard Depardieu (I thought Gerard Depardieu was hysterical, especially trying to hang himself) where a great cast. All the characters complemented each other. I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants to enjoy a classic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE the Book, HATE the Movie","review":"If you love the book, don't torture yourself by watching this movie. It is obvious that the Hollywood has stopped reading the book, and started writing scripts from the title of the book. This movie betrays everything about the four noble musketeers, and used their names to sell a movie to their fans. There's absolutely nothing salvageable about this movie. Even the background design looks terrible. Who ever was the make-up artist for this movie should be banned from any future job. After being in stuck in prison for most of his life with a mask on his face, the prince had perfect set of white teeth and nothing hideous on his face other than overgrown hair. This movie is terrible from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Movie","review":"I've never read the book, so I came clean to the movie. The action sequences are good, the explanations as to what motivates the Musketeers are reasonable, and the performances are, for the most part, excellent. There is very little to complain about for this movie.Plus, we get to see Leonardo play two roles! :)Highest rating from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"People are trashing this movie mainly because of Leo, who was -- admittedly -- miscast. The role should probably have gone to someone with some talent. But apart from that and the dialogue, the movie is worth almost five stars just for Gabriel Byrne's acting, which is -- as always -- breathtaking. He is superb and shows all the nuances of his character's ethical dilemma. As for the historical inaccuracy, the movie wouldn't be faithful to Dumas's novel if it didn't completely rewrite history. Dumas himself is notorious for that. As for not following Dumas's plot, that's because the novel was jumbled and uninteresting and had the worst ending possible to a story. In the movie, we get to see the Musketeers together for one last stand -- and in spite of the cliches that everyone else comments on, it's actually really cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone love this movie?","review":"I don't understand the appeal of this film.I cringed through the entire thing. Leonardo disappoints me more and more, the more I see him act. He was terrible in \\"Titanic.\\" It is unfortunate how stardome has influenced his judgment choosing his films since \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\" which was phenomenal. John Malchovick's performance was also a gargantuan let-down. He was desperately unconvincing as a loving father (he looked too young to be a father of a marraigable man, first of all) and his acting was so terrible you could have driven a semi through his lines. Leo was equally transparent in his character development, not to mention, completely unappealing physically. Get the boy a comb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched!","review":"I can only surmise what people were thinking when giving high marks to this movie--controlled substance abuse and chemical dependency come to mind as excuses--but I can see it earning nothing more than 1 star. The acting was horrible, the plot thin (I suppose it vaguely resembles Alexandre Dumas' novel), and the sets third rate. What we have here is the avaricious hollywood establishment banking the success of a movie on a star whose acting skills barely rise above high school drama class. The end product is a shoddy movie that the studios have foisted on us in the hopes that minions of 13-17 year old girls will shell out $$$ to watch this movie over and over and over again. The success of this movie will only encourage more hollywood schlock I fear. Read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too much!!!","review":"This movie is mediocre at best - 3 stars would be mildly generous. However, subtract a star for the price point. Almost $25 for a movie this mediocre and this OLD! This is not a classic, it was a so-so movie from years ago, and doesn't deserve a price point higher than most current just-released movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gorgeous Film, but too Ambitious","review":"The film dives into too many characters and winds up distracting from the main plot. It's over 2 hours long and will feel that way when you watch it. Not enough time was spent on the 2 main characters (Phillipe and his twin), so you feel deprived when it's over. Way too many scenes showing the sexuual trysts of one of the Musketeers, played by Gérard Depardieou. He is shown doing a threesome, a twosome, a onesome (O.K we get it, the ladies dig him). The settings and the costumes are gorgeous. With a Better screenplay , this could have been a great film. Needed more Leonardo time and less Gerard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal about Leo?","review":"My friends (die-hard Leo fans) dragged me to see this movie in the theatre. I'm not much of a musketeer fan, but I found this movie mildly entertaining. To be honest, I think that had this movie not featured the \\"lovely Leonardo\\", it wouldn't have lasted more than a week in the theatres. If you like watching a bunch of men in strange costumes riding around on horses, you'll love it. Otherwise, give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Should be Kept in an Iron Box, Far Away","review":"You know, I for one liked Leonardo DiCaprio in \\"Titanic\\", so I wanted to see what he would be like in this movie, a version of which I had seen years ago with the king of the miniseries, Richard Chamberlain. Lous XIV's twin brother has been kept all these years as a prisoner in a remote place, with an iron mask covering his famous features so that no one will know his true identity. People who are tired of the mean king they've been having all this time now want to take a chance on this new guy, and train him to impersonate the King. Wow, what do you think is going to happen next?Mon Dieu! Quel bad movie!LDiC is absolutely AWFUL. There's just no getting around it. Please see Mr. Chamberlain's take on it, and relegate this to the salvage dump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonardo stinks","review":"Great Film, with one exception. Leonardo Dicaprio. Whats worse, in this film there is two of him!!!! UUUGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near ........................","review":"This film is interesting at first but then if begins to sag like a souffle. Leonardo is just too cute to be Louis IV. He made the king look like he was twelve. The movie is not interesting in the sense that it doesn't show Louis's character in detail or Phillipe's. It had little action as well. The French mustv'e laughed at this film. Leo looks nowhere near the real king! It's amazing how a director hires \\"a popular actor\\" to make some quick kaching$$. Now the costumes are wonderful and the scenery as well but even this could not save this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent RC plane","review":"This is a zone 2 hobbyzone plane, it's intended for poeple with some experience with RC planes, if you have no experience you should seek help from a flight budy.This is an upgrade from another excellent plane the hobbyzone pahntom.This one is a lot more stable than the phantom, I guess it has to do with a larger wing area, it handles a lot more smother than my little phantom, controller works great, it's a very smooth plane.It's kind of a fast plane... this is my second plane, no issues at this point... no crashes at all (not even close to crash) even on my first flights.I will higly recomend this plane if you are upgrading from a 2 channel plane or some other trainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"AB3 is tough and fun","review":"The plane is faster than many would like for their first flights, but I adapted fine. I think this is easier to fly (especially in wind) than the two channel versions. This is because you have pitch/elevator control that lets you control up and down movements. I've crashed mine pretty hard, required a new crystal in plane ($5) and a new wing ($15). Backin the air and ready to fly. I'm broken the fiberglass boom twice, repairing each time with JB weld and some bamboo skewer stints. Lots of fun. The radio receiver and motor control are built into one, which limits their future use. The servos are standard 3 wire that could be replaced or used in other planes if needed. Motor has plenty of power for ground takeoff. In grass you can hand launch and land with landinggear off for a 'belly landing'. Lots of fun. After 10 flights, I switched to pro mode which give you more control for mild aerobatics. This is a great learning tool on how to fly. Birds like to soar with it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"plane toy","review":"Purchased this as a gift for my teenaged son who has experience flying toy planes. This is a piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY HOBBYZONE","review":"OK, this is a great plane. It flies well and it is very aggressive, lots of power and lots of aerobatic potential. Apparently you should be able to do aerial battles with some X-port module. IIt has no bad habits once it is trimmed. HOWEVER, the plane has a fatal flaw--just like the Phantom-- and that is the very very very very very poor construction of the boom.The thing is so brittle it will not take a hard landing, let along a crash. If Hobbyzone descides to modify the boom, which should be extremely easy to do, this plane will be the best thing in the market for intermediate flyers, well maybe not, but still great. As it is now, it is essentially useless because it cannot do what a fast and aggressive plane should do: withstand some impact and air strain.Given the fact that the boom is bonded to the pod and it cannot be extracted without deamging that part of the fuse, one would think that HZ is just trying to force us to buy the fuse over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big and Sturdy!","review":"I got this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it.

Frederator has their animatics, production art, backgrounds, character designs, etc. available online. One of the writers even posts the chords to the show's songs.

I purchased the large-print edition, the largest type available, for my mother. She could barely read the print and the type did not appear as large as it did in the example. Because of the increased size of the text the book's volume increased, becoming quite heavy and cumbersome. It would be better divided into two volumes for ease of handling.

I have not rested until I purchased the video, through the magic of computers and website. (I was late for the wedding, too, 'cause I could not turn off the TV) From her humble beginnings as an unwanted, adopted infant to the top of the musical universe, the film envelopes you in the warmth and human qualities of this person as well as her immense talent and dedication. She has the purest voice I think I have ever heard, without exessive vibrato or other typical operatic devices. I have never been an opera fan, but I fell in love with her, heart and soul, watching this video. You will too, when you see it. Join the millions who adore her and buy this video. (Available on DVD also, but I like the sound quality on VHS better, even though picture quality is not as good as DVD)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice illustrations of old advertisements.","review":"Having recently acquired a Sellers Hoosier cabinet I wanted to find out more information and decided to purchase this book. I was pleased with the quality of the photographs which were primarily the old advertisements. I found it very interesting looking at all the different brands and styles. Unfortunately there is very little \\"written\\" information in this book. The \\"price guide\\" is only two pages. Also, my particular brand (Sellers) had only 21 of the 134 pages dedicated to it. Napanee had only three pages. Boone only one page. The remainder of the book was dedicated to four brands information (McDougall, Hoosier, and KitchenMaid and Wilson). If you are interested in one of those four brands this book might be more for you.

I hope this is the start of a new musical renaissance, which sees boybands and manufactured music fade, and a livelier music scene happen, with original sounds and high energy lyrics! If you like your music rebellious, in which you can ride along the tide of rebellion with the band rather than having it thrust in your face, this is your scene! Put this music to the test if you are about to hit the highway, the powder in the mountains, or bike through a canyon of double-decker buses!

Although it was originally published over 20 years ago, it still reads fresh, with interesting ideas on paradox and history. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite of his books so far","review":"This is my favorite Koontz book. I do not like some of his newer books, but this one I found to be plausible, well written and entertaining. I could not guess how it ended. Overall, the story was well done and left me feeling as if this could really happen. Charactera and their relationship are well developed and leaves you turning pages to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books","review":"When I brought this book I put it on the headboard of my bed. MY MISTAKE!!!!!!!!! I got sick and had nothing to do but read. I picked up this book and could not and i repeat could not put it down. i took it every where. I loved it. It made me cry it made me laught it made me think. The romance was wonderful. Her son was a great charactor. Mr. Koontz out did himself on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read.","review":"I was twelve when I first read this book and eleven years later the magic is still there. Great characters that you can care about. Plot twists are everywhere keeping the reader entranced the entire book. The WWII time travel plot makes the book even richer and engaging. The science that Koontz puts in the book is easy to understand, that even a twelve year old will have no trouble following along. Bad guys to boo against and heroes to cheer for. Simple, yet beautifully done. Heartily reccomended, once again Koontz delivers, his best book alongside Watchers and Phantoms. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighting","review":"Great book. It's one of his best. I have most of his books, but this one was especially good. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read better","review":"I can honestly say that, compared to the other Dean Koontz books I've read, Lightning didn't do much for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, but I definetely didn't enjoy it as much as his books that I've read so far. I picked it up after finishing the wonderful Watchers and frankly, it couldn't hold a candle to it. I found myself groaning with boredom whenever the perspective would switch to Stefan and at times I had to push myself a bit to continue. I didn't really feel attatched to any of the characters, and at times they were irritating. The dialogue for the child characters is very unbelievable. It was a good book, but I prefered the other Dean Koontz novels I've read so far (Hideaway, Watchers, Intensity, The Funhouse, Whispers, The Bad Place, The Face Of Fear, and The Door To December)."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK EVER","review":"I like Dean Koontz. He's my favourite author now because Stephen King has so radically changed his writing style. Anyway, Lightning blew me away. I had no idea what to expect and this is absolutely brilliant work. I love the time travel theme and the discussions about paradoxes. More like this please Mr Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent - how can anybody not like koontz","review":"I can't understand some of the latest reviews on this book. Koontzs characters are really human. Other books that are fantastic are : the voice of the night, whispers, shadowfires, the house of thunder. How can anyone read the likes of Partricia Cornwall after reading this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I miss this one?","review":"I found this book by reading some reviews on line. I loved the book and could not believe that I had not read it. This was a great time travel book,full of adventure, romance and excitement. The only disappointing fact is that I read this already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightning","review":"This has been my favorite book I have ever read. It was my first Dean Koontz and it made me want to read all of his novels. If a reader wanted to experience Koontz, they need to read this novel first. I just want everyone to know that this is a great novel and it shows his talent as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLASH! A Review of \\"Lightning.\\"","review":"Lightning is, without a doubt, my favorite book by Koontz. The whole concept of time travel has always fascinated me. Koontz really brings a fresh look at time travel to the reader. The main characters are wonderful. Laura - As you \\"see\\" her grow up throughout the book, you begin to feel that you know her as the girl next door. You are able to see your own frustrations and feelings in her. Stefan - He is doing what everyone wishes they could. Trying to find, and protect, that one true love by doing anything he can within his power. His sincerity will no doubt mirror your own. This book is a work of art. It would be worth your while, even if you are not a big fan of science fiction novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever","review":"The best Dean Koontz book I've ever read. I hadn't read Watchers but I will now go back and read that one next. I hope it's as good as Lightning.."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first dose of Koontz... and I was hooked!","review":"This is the first novel I picked up from Dean Koontz. In this story I found sure entertainment, excitement and intruiging mystery. Like Intensity, which is my favorite Koontz by far, Lightning zips along from the very beginning, making it very hard to put down.Since reading this novel I have gone on to read other great Koontz stories, and regardless of what some may say about his writing, I highly recommend his work for someone who wants real entertainment, fun and excitement, with colorful characters and clever twists. Koontz is a natural!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The concept of the book left out in other reviews","review":"Everything of what I've read of these reviews are all accurate. To me, it's my favorite of all, in meaning of not so much horror, as The Bad Place, or evil as Hideaway(which is my favorite of the scaring to another level one would never expect), and I won't get into the demolition done to his books in movies. Lightning is unique from his other books. You can sense the humor in Dean Koontz and he's definitely a Disney fan. I felt the concept of the entire story was near the end, and depicted in one sentence. If one thinks about it, you'll see the truth of what was meant be *the moral of the story*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightning","review":"If you've read \\"Cold Fire\\", \\"Mr.Murder\\" and \\"Hideaway\\" and just loved them, you'll probably enjoy this one too.

It has something for everyone, except, perhaps, the dog fancier. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Not one of his best in my opinion as some of the \\"jokes\\" were corny, but I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but still a gread reaad.","review":"It's a little outdated but I love to go back and read stories that do not include all the changes in the past 15 years. Did not want to put this book down. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I really liked the ending. It could have gone so many different directions but Koontz did a great job with the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Koontz never fails to entertain....and make you think as well!","review":"I hadn't read this early work by Dean Koontz, but I'm glad I did. He's a great author, who makes me think every time I read his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and addictive","review":"My personal favorite along with Cold Fire. The starting of the book alone foreshadows its brilliance. This book gets going from the start and it gets addictive after that. I remember myself going an all-nighter b/c of this book. Just the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A primer on time travelling and alternate realities","review":"Not only does LIGHTENING have strong characters, but also an intriguing plot dealing with both time travel and alternate realities. There wasn't anything displeasing about this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfull, enticing & mindboggling, Koontz does it again!!","review":"Once again, Koontz manages to totalally enthrawl the reader. His brilliant portrayel of charecters and events totally encapulates the reader and takes them far past their wildest imaginations. Lightening strikes and the terror begins..kind of an ironic phenonemon. It was a fairy-tale turn nightmare - I loved this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"12 year olds don't talk like that...","review":"I enjoyed the book, but was put off in the beginning by the dialogue of the 12-year-old twins. I'm sorry, but 12-year-olds just simply would not have such a vocabulary, or be as wise as they were portrayed. Getting past that, though, I did enjoy the book enough that I tore through it in 2 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written crap","review":"i liked this book until i saw where he was going with it then it became just dumb like the movies on the syfy channel"},{"rating":"2","title":"I deff. recomend you read this book","review":"I read this book because everyone I talk to about Dean Koontz says, \\"Oh, have you read Lightening, it is so good!\\". So one day I picked it up; and it turned out to be everything you could want in a book. Action, Romance, Suspense.......I absolutly couldnt put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Figured it out","review":"I loved the story, the premise and everything about the book except.... I figured out the twist halfway through the book and it took work to finish it.However, I honestly don't understand why this book hasn't been turned into a movie yet... great premise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awe inspiring work from Koontz","review":"I have read more than 20 of Koontz's work and this ranks at the very top of my personal list. Stefan is a confusing and complex character who I came to rue as a hero. Laura and her friend (who amazingly became a hollywood star) both went through a lot of experiences and grew but the characters stayed true to form the entire book. How many authors can illustrate growth among main characters while still stick to core personality traits while keeping a book great? Very few.The book is very much science fantasy and is not long by Koontz standards but is DEFINITELY worth a read or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading, refreshing, new and fun to read","review":"This was my first Koontz book and I finished it in four days. I have already made a list of more Koontz books to read. It's a fun book to read, it is enjoyable and easy reading. The character development is done well and it has a little bit of everything in it. I do not watch a lot of TV anymore, so I read mostly for enjoyment and to keep my mind off of daily problems, this book did both. It was very refreshing because it was different, something new, not the same old, predictable plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did not see the end coming","review":"An excellent read as I didn't want to work, didn't want to make dinner, just wanted to read this book. Upon finishing, I passed it to some friends and within a week, two of them had finished it. It's just one of those grab-you-by-the-lapels stories. For example, I got to like the main character so much that when bad luck, bad guys, etc. assail her, I find myself taking it personally and getting ticked off. I'm a late comer to Dean Koontz, but lucky lucky lucky me, there are a lot more of his works to discover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Time Travel Tale","review":"Koontz crosses genres and spins a fascinating time travel tale that entertains and satisfies. Best-selling novelist Laura Shane has lived a difficult life full of tragedy and heartache. Throughout her life the same man continually appears at just the right moment and repeatedly saves her life. However, each time Laura encounters him she notices he has never aged. Who is this mysterious guardian angel and why is he watching over her?Koontz has written another powerful story full of mystery, suspense, and just the right touch of romance. A great addition for Koontz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Open Minded","review":"I've read several of Koontz's novels now, and this one is in line with the Koontz formula. I won't give away any spoilers, but there is a revelation midway through the story that rather disappointed me at first, but as I read on and Koontz expanded on his ideas, the plot grew on me, and by the time I was finished I was setting the book down with white-knuckled hands. 'Lightning' touches on fate, science, and war, and if you think about it too hard it will bend your mind into a pretzel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprising disappointment","review":"This was my first Dean Koontz book--and will probably be my last. It was recommended to me by one of his millions of fans. I was mildly curious at first, but the book quickly became childish. The only thing that kept a tiny bit of my interest was the main character's evolving writing career. The whole time-travel debacle wasn't worthy of print. I found Koontz's characters shallow attempts to imitate the interesting and believable people you find in a better horror story--like any of Stephen King's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed","review":"This was the first Koontz I've read. He's no Stephen King, for sure, but mildly entertaining. I thought the dialogue was really dumb, and his depiction of an 8 - year old, even a really smart 8 year old, is pretty lame. (Reminds me of a bad made for TV movie.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Great....","review":"The Book was very good in the beginning and then it got boring in the middle. Most of the book was unbelievable, the dialogue was just so fake. It took me forever to read this book because it made me feel tired and I thought this was Dean's weakest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay story ruined by plot contrivences...","review":"Scientist from the future uses time travel to protect the life of a girl in our time. She grows up through several horrific events to become an author. A passible story gets jolted in serveral points as Koontz attempts to explain major plot holes by saying his protagonist \\"did research on it for a novel\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Rollercoaster","review":"1. The character Laura Shane was terrific she was a strong confident woman with the zest for life to rebound through all kinds of turmoil. Dean Koontz out did his self with this story. His books guide a person to a different time era and for a brief period of time one can escape for a thrill ride of adventure an intrique it is just fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!! Koontz is a brilliant story-teller!!!","review":"In this thoroughly engaging, fascinating novel, Koontz introduces the public to Laura Shane. From the day her mother went into labor with her, Laura has had a handsome, blonde, blue-eyed guardian hopping in and out of her life, trying his best to spare her life's tragedies. This is an enchanting novel of love, dedication, passion, and triumph. I urge any fan of the awesome Dean Koontz to make this purchase. Lightning is my favorite novel. Perhaps Koontz's gift could reach you, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery, Suspense and Romance all in one!","review":"\\"Destiny Strugles to reassert the pattern that was meant to be\\", or at least that's how it is in this suspensful novel. Koontz has made a masterpeice.Forget about Monet and Michelangelo, There's a new Artist in town!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant novel... but with one little problem...","review":"OK... all i have to say about this novel is that it was great. Laura Shane is a great protagonist and the minor characters are, i think, the most colorful Koontz has ever created. The Ackerson twins especially show this. Unfortunately, koontz lacks in this novel where he generally exceeds other authors...there's no main villain. There are thugs, but no really major figure. But this is a small quibble, considering that this is not only a thriller, but also scifi. Also, Dean has the audacity to have one of his lead characters actually meet up briefly w/ both winston churchill and hitler. don't ask me...just read the book! you'll be glad u did. This book is wholly satisfying except for a sense of urgency a bigger villain would have supplied. but, for me at least, watching laura struggle and seeing her strength of character was more than enough to make this book a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected adventure","review":"Koontz shows a vived imagaination when this story leads to unexpected time travel. The end was drawn out a bit but itcould have been my impatience! Good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hooked..","review":"This is the first book of his I ever read over twenty years ago and I have been hooked ever since. The Bad Place is my all time favorite but this remains in my top ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This book was a great tale with strong character development. I could not put it down the book kept me off balance with the ever present twist and turns of the plot. It was a pleasure to read and discover how all the foundations of each character played into the end with nothing waisted. Thank you Dean Koontz. I read this book on Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Electrifying Mystery","review":"This books starts with a bang! A beautiful blonde stranger showing up to stop a drunk doctor from going to the hospital to deliver a baby. Then we meet the baby, Laura, and see her grow-up, and the blonde stranger pops up now and then to protect her. Is he an Angle? Where is he from? Why doesn't he age? And in his desire to protect Laura, he unwittingly puts her life in grave danger because the people he works with think he is a traitor and that he and Laura have to die.Awesome adventure, a love story too, and a great mystery. Love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I read this many years ago and loved it, recently I read it again and still love it. If you haven't give it a try you will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, then downhill","review":"\\"Lighting\\" starts out with a bang, and then fades like diminishing thunder. The book is riddled with cliches, stereotypical characters, non sequiturs, and an astonishingly embarassing number of product placements: Smith & Wesson, Disney, McDonald's, Ralph's, Goodwill, Mark Cross, Ray Ban, IBM, etc. etc. Parts of the book are laughable; Laura becoming upset at Chris's use of profanity after Laura has \\"blown away\\" several of the assassins, Laura's concern about the nutritional value of the food Chris is eating.However, if television shows like \\"Survivor\\", \\"Oprah\\", and \\"One Life To Live\\" appeal to you, this may be the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like this book but... (2.5 stars)","review":"I was really hoping to like this book but unfortunately there was hardly anything exciting about it. There were some suspenseful aspects to the novel but the few exciting areas could not make up for the boring parts.The first half of the novel moved really slow and when I finally got to the second half and was expecting things to come full circle, I was left disappointed and surprised by the change in plot. I thought Laura was destined to be some great person with supernautual powers or whatever, hence the reason this stranger made every attempt to protect her, but the book surprised by doing something totally different.The only character I liked was Thelma, though her humor at times was a bit of an overkill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspense doesn't make up for cliches and lack of depth","review":"I admit the story was suspenseful and kept me reading, but the dialogue made me wince with its cheeziness, characters were cliche, the plot was ludicrous, and I was glad when I finally finished it. It seemed like Koontz was writing more of a movie script than a novel. Wishful thinking on his part maybe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"I loved this book and have read it again and again. It's a lovely story. Even my husband, who reads nothing, read this book and loved it but said he wished it had been a movie...lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst.","review":"This one was too contrived and felt like amateur science fiction. I prefer Koontz when he applies his considerable imagination to stories of horror and evil. Try \\"The Bad Place\\" or \\"Hideaway\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNSTOPPABLE! One of the top 3 he has written","review":"OK, finally we don't get a cop/marine/spy for the main male lead, we did get a woman with problems in her past, but that I could live with. The possibilities of time travel have been well explored, but not from this angle. The idea that the technology is coming from the past brings a whole new angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean's Mantlepiece Book","review":"At first I thought I was going to be a huge Stephen King fan, until someone told me to try a Dean Koontz novel. Lightning was the first (and by far not the last) novel by Koontz I read. Excellent, quick-paced, and heart-pounding excitement kept me turning the pages faster! I believe this is one of Koontz' best works, and I always recommend it to someone who is ready to try one of Dean's novels. It will get 'em every time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It!","review":"I could not put this book down. I started reading it on New Year's Day & finished it with five minutes to spare until 1998.

This was a wonderful audio book. I listened to it while making a 3-hour drive. I started it just as I left and it finished about 10 miles from my home.Yes I do have some negative input. This was the abridged version and I feel it was abridged just a little too much. It was rather obvious where large portions are missing. However; it was still a good audio book. Mr. Mariner (narrator) did a wonderful job.I have read and listened to many books by Mr. Koontz. This was a great book and I am considering reading it. Typically I don't read a book after listening to the audio book, but this may be the exception.If you like Koontz, Sci-Fi or Love Stories, then this is a book for you. I guarantee, it will have you wanting to read other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"from trixie to gestapo","review":"after reading bliss.........was really surprised with the sci fi turn of this delightful but gripping novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has been in my head sins I started to read books","review":"It has been \\"many\\" years now sins I have read this book.In fact this was one of the first books I have ever read. Now I have comed over it again and I hope it is just like I remebered it. I will give this book a high rate because of the speciel feeling this book has given to me all this years, but I cant say if that was because of my age or it was because of the fact that this book is a \\"real MCcoy\\". The answer wil be in my next review of this book, when I have read it again... Now in a age of 23, and is a little writer of my own. Look out for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somtimes it's the past that we really need to fear.","review":"I read this book about a year ago and it is still fresh in my mind. This was the first Koontz book I had ever read but far from the last. His ability to walk you through this girls life was uncanny. Very similar to the way he treats Chris Snow. I found myself white knuckeled and totally engrossed, my mind ablaze with the craziness of time travel and what could be. More then once I put it down to go to bed then ended up picking it back up. It was very nice to read a book that held me in it's clutches all the way through. Something most books have fail to do. So read this book and never look at a storm the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Kindle Version is very badly eddited","review":"I read this book in high school and thought I would read it again. It is still a fun read, but the Kindle version is so full of typos and errors, it was really a distraction. I'm not sure why the text in the paper book could be perfect but the Kindle version so bad, but they really made a mess of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book - and by far Koontz's best","review":"I love this book. It's about a girl who is rescued by a stranger whenever she is in danger. One day the stranger shows up on her porch unconscious and in desperate need of her help. There's a great twist about who he is and where he comes from. \\"Lightning\\" is very suspenseful and imaginative, it draws you in right at the start and never lets go. If you only read one book by this author (and I hope that you do - the rest get very redundant and annoying) read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying read","review":"This book is a satisfying read. It got me involved with the main characters and made me want them to win over the bad guys. I particularly enjoyed the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard time believing this is Koontz' work","review":"The basic idea behind the story is good. But I thought it was a bit too hard to follow. At times, I felt like reading this book was pulling teeth without anesthesia. It was also a little bit too long. I kept waiting for a plot to unravel quickly, like most of his other books, but it took too long. In conclusion, I have a hard time believing that the author who wrote such great pieces of work as \\"Phantoms\\" and \\"The Vision\\" also wrote this. But i guess we all have our bad days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant rip-off of Terminator","review":"Koontz should be forced to pay royalities on the plots that he has stolen over the years. Doesn't this guy have an original thought in his head. I had high hopes for him after I read Watchers. I thought that he was the next Stephen King. Boy was I wrong. With each book since Watchers he has stolen more and more from competent authors and this one takes the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Worse Than Koontz's Usual Trash","review":"Listening to this book on tape was even more painful than reading it because of the phony slavic accents. Koontz always lacks interesting characterization & any flair in his prose, and this time he also lacks an original story. \\"Ho-hum...\\" and \\"Who gives a good goddamn?\\" flittered through my mind as this inane rip-off of a story prattled on. Worse than listening to your best friend describe the minute fluctuations in her bad relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not wast money and time in this book","review":"I read 2 books of this author and didn't like any of them.

I find that these upgrades are complimented with a more free flowing air intake system, or if on a budget, a K&N; air filter at the least.After much research, I found K&N; to have the greatest filtration properties along with the best airflow available by a mass produced air filter, so I use it in all my cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noble attempt at a novel...just doesn't work","review":"\\"Allende' by Fernando Alegria, is a very noble attempt at accurating portraying the tragedy of Salvador Allende, and the \\"other\\" 9/11. It fails to be entertaining, and it uses references that only a South American could understand or relate to. This is not good if you want to reach a general audience, which I assume is Alegria's intent. Allende is portrayed as a complicated, stubborn, heroic man who tried to reform an unfair system, and was destroyed for it. The book is not flattering to the USA at all, and does feature a cameo by Che Guavera that doesn't work at all. Bargain bin material, but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but uncomfortable","review":"These shoes are so cute but as the day wore on they got tighter and tighter.

I discovered Wainwright by accident and am so glad I did. This could be the album to turn all your friends onto him. The tunes are quite catchy--just watch out that you don't end up with (...) in your head, 'cause others might not approve. \\"Tonya Twirls\\" is the best commentary I've heard on the former ice queen--including all those late night hosts who tried to be funny about the Tonya Harding debacle. \\"The Picture\\" is my favorite song from History--poignant and beautiful. His social commentary is both biting and hilarious. The liner notes are great--he comes across as a slightly bitter middle aged man who's still out on the road having a blast. This album deserves to be heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle!","review":"This is the record your grandparents don't want their children to hear. Loudon sends another fragrant boquet of thorns with a note written about how you're getting older, and how it hurts the same way the only love you've ever known hurts. And, in true romantic form, he hands another boquet from behind his back. The funniest roses you have ever laid ears on!Why does he do this? Build us up. Make us feel great. Then scare the living hell out of us by holding up that mirror. He really wants us to stop and remember. To remember to smell those flowers, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best soundtracks and movie compositions ever","review":"I loved the music composed for this movie - it has a magnetic effect - captivating with vigor and emotions.In fact, I used the 2nd track - Heart of the King (which has a hue of military drums) as my military wedding procession music. The effect was wonderous ! It captures the attention of all my guests, and helps build up grand and angelic mood in the ballroom.If u have watched the movie, you would like the music.

A must have for every soundtrack collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruno Dante's Way!","review":"The masterful Dan Fante, author of Spitting Off Tall Buildings, does it again. Easy to read, easy to relate. His protagonist Bruno Dante is a regular guy/struggling writer going from [bad] job to [bad] job in New York while at the same time hoping to create something worthwhile on the typewriter, etc., something he can be proud of... I like Fante as a human being, I like his \\"voice,\\" and so will you. Unlike so many writers out there, he manages to stay clear of B.S. Life isn't easy for a lot of people; that's just the way things are and he lays it out. The style is pure, raw, from the heart and gut. The way it ought to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"gritty and raw","review":"Bruno Dante's life is like a noir film without the dame or cool look of black and white. he's broken and f*%^&ked; up, the reality of what's left over when you wake up from the american dream.Fante writes a bit like Bukowski, hell, he lived a bit like Bukowski only one of those may be a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the King","review":"Man, this is totally freakin' awesome. Filmed nearly 80 years ago, this classic King Kong film still is completely fascinating. The stop-motion animation is outstanding and very realistic looking.Ebert said \\"the effects are not up to modern standards\\"??? Huh? I strongly disagree. Compare this to Indiana Jones 4, I Am Legend, The Mist, Anaconda, or any of the new CGI footage inserted in the original Star Wars trilogy. It's not even close.Now, the recent King Kong adaptation did have some remarkable computer effects. But this original, filmed in glorious black & white, harnessed a certain energy that was much more ferocious and primeval. There is no drawn out buildup to the action. No cute little ice skating scene. No Jack Black/comedic elements. Oh no no NO! This is no friendly, oversized gorilla. This is KONG, the 8th Wonder of the World.It doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever!","review":"Peter Jackson did a excellent job restoring this as close to the origional as possible. The back stoirie were very imteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early indicator of American Impirealistic Character","review":"Viewed in context, King Kong points to what would (for better or worse [mostly worse]) become the American cinema's ability to create visual marvels that appeal to the lower brain. It is no mistake that the American showman (Carl Denham) exploits the giant ape for a dollar and then regrets the destruction of his shallow idealism along with his enslaved show piece. Then the sentimental fool has the audacity to wax poetic at the end. This is the American drama. Superficial American idealism proves to be exploitive and destructive. It's as true now as it was then. What has changed? We were blind then and we are even more blind now. Absolutely brilliant allegory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews are misleading!!","review":"More than 3/4 of the reviews listed here are reviews of a DVD release--or a VHS release. VERY FEW are for the KING KONG BLU RAY BOOK. This blu ray version has been listed on Amazon for at least a year, and not as a pre-order. The official blu ray release wasn't until September 2010--How does this happen? I buy EVERYTHING from Amazon, and this is the first time I've been afraid of what I'd get. A poor-quality blu-ray that was somehow produced (bootlegged??) prior to the 2010 release? To show \\"270 reviews\\" on the product listing and then have more than 3/4 of those reviews be for a totally different product is DISHONEST! Shame on Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-Notch Restoration; Great Extras","review":"The documentary extras on the making of the 1933 classic would alone be worth the cost of this set (as would Peter Jackson's loving re-creation of the lost \\"spder pit\\" sequence). The restoration of the film itself is first-rate, with astonishing clarity, albeit a bit grainy. If you love classic fantasy, you should not hesiate to purchase this near-Criterion-quality set."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True King","review":"The True king of the Monster movies.

IF YOU LIKE MONSTERS AND DINOSAURS AND FUN ACTION....GET IT NOW!!! IGNORE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"buy them both","review":"One reviewer was dismayed that this Collector's Edition Kong has more material than the one in the box set. It's true, but the disks are the same. You just get a nice box and extra printed matter with this big daddy. The price is right, so buy them both. It's going to kill you to have an extra copy of the two disk Kong sitting around your house? You can always give it away. That's probably what I'll end up doing. The important thing is you'll have the Collector's Kong and two other movies. Of course, you COULD buy Mighty Joe and Son of Kong on single disks, but you'll end up paying more for them than you would for the full box set. Buying this Collector's Kong is a no-brainer and ponying up for the box set should be one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Twas beauty killed the beast...\\"","review":"After growing up watching all of the great stop motion films that were influenced by King Kong, I've finally seen the big K itself. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the animation -- it was quite sophisticated and is always effective. The story starts a bit slow, but after the first 25 minutes, the action gets going and doesn't let up until the credits roll. The film is somewhat dated: the character of Charlie is a horribly racist stereotype, and Fay Wray's character spends much of the movie screaming, waiting for some man to rescue her. In spite of these minor quibbles, King Kong remains a poignant love story, an incredibly entertaining adventure film, and a film worthy of its spot on the AFI top 100 list."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest monster movie ever made","review":"\\"King Kong\\" has a magic all its own, untarnished by age or the development of better special effects. Even today, there is a warmth and humanity to him missing from every last CGI monster around. The movie packs an emotional wallop that hasn't diminished either. When Kong falls to the ground, and Denham intones the immortal \\"Twas Beauty killed the beast,\\" I still get choked up, even though I've seen the movie over twenty times since I was a kid. The acting is deliciously over the top, Fay Wray is still the century's greatest screamer, and Kong is still the saddest, most powerful ape ever put on film. My daughter is three years old; she recently watched this and the original \\"Mighty Joe Young\\" with me, back-to-back. She was mesmerized, and so was I. A classic for all time, no doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL THE BEST OF ALL TIME!","review":"This is my fourth video purchase of KING KONG. I bought this copy because I too thought that the famous spider scene would be included. (Oh Well!) KING KONG is still the best of all time!!!

Don't worry about the Region 1 logo; my player indicates that these two discs are Region 0."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe original is still the best","review":"I cna't add to what others have said. This movie is terrific, combining power and pathos, fear and love, beauty and ugliness, bravery and cowardice, into one of the best movies ever made.It contrasts the simple, brave, powerful and beautiful King Kong and his actions with the ugly, modern, selfish, destructive modern man."},{"rating":"2","title":"cliff pick","review":"THIS IS THE FIRST FILM A PERSON SHOULD SEE WHEN INTRODUCED TO THE SCIENCE FICTION GENRE. CONSIDERING IT WAS RELEASED IN 1933, IT IS TRULY A MARVEL! I HAVE ENJOYED IT AT LEAST 20 TIMES AND AM OVERDUE FOR ANOTHER VIEWING. THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY SCI-FI COLLECTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star Movie, 2 Star Blu-Ray","review":"There's really no reason to upgrade to this Blu-Ray edition if you have the DVD released several years ago. The improved resolution simply magnifies the grain of the film and unfortunately it detracts from your enjoyment of the movie. The Special Features menu is particularly difficult to navigate. While it has quite a few features relating to the making and history of Kong, you don't know which feature you're going to see until you hit \\"OK\\" on your remote. Some movies should not be transferred to Blu-Ray. The original King Kong is one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent blu-ray but...","review":"I really love this movie: direction, editing, score, special effects, stop motion animation, photography and so on...However, I noticed some scenes with a lot of grain (e.g. foggy scenes on boat). Aside from this, Blu-ray transfer is just perfect!!. All documentaries included and BD_Book itself worth the money. If you're a fan of \\"Kong\\" and Merian C. Cooper extravaganzas, do not hesitate to buy this BD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Missing 3-Minutes !","review":"My critique is based on the 3-minute difference between the original theatrical release (c1933-34) and the sanitized/PC version. What has been post-production cut is a dialogue below decks between Armstrong & Wray wherein she uses the phrase, \\"I'm free, white, and twenty-one.\\" It is curious that that is 'blipped' but they leave in the phrase several scenes later, \\"Yeah, blondes are a little scarce around here.\\" Still, this endures as both classic and relevant entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Blu-ray Transfer","review":"Avoid this blu-ray editon at all cost. The picture quality is so grainy that it is like looking at the film through a fog as thick as pea soup. Too bad KINO did not undertake the transfer. Warner has a history of poor and sloppy film transfers to DVD. And with today's technology there is no excuse for this careless blu-ray edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"King Kong is truly a classic in every since of the word. Though it may be kind of slow starting off, when Kong shows up, it more than well makes up for itself.The special effects in this movie is better than almost anything you see today. And this was 1933. They didn't have all the computer equipment that we have today.This one is a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live the King!","review":"The blueray version of \\"King Kong\\" is marvelous. There are a few scenes that aren't as pristine as the rest of the film, but those are short, and do not really distract from the total enjoyment. The disc contains all the extras that were with the previously released 2-disc dvd package, but some of the inserted packaged extras that were with the dvd deluxe edition (the one that came in a metal casing) were not included with the blueray edition. But for a film that is nearly 80 years old, the blueray version looks remarkably fresh and crisp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent No-frills Value","review":"The movie itself is so famous that no additional praise is needed. I found no fault with the single-disc DVD. The box claims Commentary is available during play, but I rarely enjoy this during a movie, and did not test it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Kong (1933)","review":"The original King Kong is one of the all-time masterpieces of cinema. It would be on my list of the best 5 movies of all time. It took special effects into a whole new galaxy in 1933 and raised the bar for all subsequent movies. Many of the special effect concepts in the movie have been copied over and over by less original and less creative film makers. The black and white format fits the tone of the movie well. It would not have the same impact in color. The acting is good, and Fay Wray's performance is exceptional. I like to see this movie about every two years. All subsequent versions of King Kong were disastrous insults to the original version. It brings a tear to my eye when I see Gone With the Wind and watch that big timber gate from Kong's Island burned to the ground to mimic Atlanta burning in the Civil War. That gate should have been left standing forever. It was the cinematic counterpart of a national monument."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Kong 1933","review":"Most classic movie of all. Movie maker Robert Armstrong hires Fay Wray to be his star. They sail to Skull Island in Indonesia where evolution has gone awry. Dinosaurs roam, and a gigantic ape rules. Natives have built a wall to contain King Kong. They capture Wray and offer her as a sacrifice. Armstrong and his crew rescue her and transport Kong to Manhattan's Great White Way as a headliner. He breaks loose and terrorizes yet another island. He climbs the Empire State Building with Wray and is riddled with bullets from planes. He falls to his death. King Kong is a film which touches modern consciousness. It shows man clashing with the nature of which he is a part. There are interracial overtones. Armstrong declares, \\"It was beauty killed the beast.\\" Fay Wray lived with the film and finally accepted it as a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic film gets great release","review":"King Kong is one of the most influential films ever made. The transfer is terrific, audio is decent, based on the source, and the extras are plentiful and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best... thank you, Willis O'Brien and co!","review":"Watching the 2005 version again made me rewatch the original (and the accompanying documentaries) and appreciate it more. It has dated very little and the stop-motion effects are still impressive and, importantly, fun to watch. Everything about this movie is fun, actually. Yes, there is a subtle somber tone as it relates to Kong, but it is not overdone as in later versions. The accompanying documentaries are a real treat -- and this is where the DVD set shines -- and the 1933 film style recreations, while not essential viewing, are interesting in their own right. Great transfer print too. Kong is still king -- thank you, Willis O'Brien for bringing him to life. Maybe one day we'll find your spider pit sequence and reintroduce it into the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"i really thought it was great, i still have not got my dracula dvd. an i am not pleased thank you,"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"KING KONG!

Compare it with CLASH OF THE TITANS from 1981 if u don\`t believe me. Fay Wray i s a good screamer but not that much as an actress. After numerous videotapes I now own it on DVD. Of course it is great but it DOESN\`t include the \\"making of\\". Hmmm. Last friday I watched JURASSIC PARK III and went straight home and saw KONG. Well. Hello? In 1933 they at least had something called WRITERS and story developers. A job that may be overlooked by Hollywood these days. KING KONG?

Face it, if this movie was made today- it would be deemed the worst film ever! If it hadn't had such great special-effects than it would just be another old movie- it's not that good! It is a little enjoyable but there's so many scenes that's nothing but a show-off of special-effects and doesn't progress the story any. Yes, the acting is good- but the plot isn't that great.

Its a unique marriage of special effects, music and design that works magnificently. The effects crew have given us style rather than realism, which is entirely appropriate for the nightmare world that Kong inhabits. Fay Wray - blasphemous as it may seem to say so - offers us one of her lesser performances; I've seen her do far better in other roles, but her persona is exactly right for this film. Superb film making all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray transfer - Horrible!","review":"I love the original 1933 version of King Kong, and always will. This review is about the Blu-ray transfer and it's complete lack of quality. The horrible, grainy picture makes this wonderful classic film almost unbearable to watch. Especially if the scene takes place when it is dark or in the fog (when they ship out to the island). If the master copy of this film was not in good condition, then they never should have put this out for the public. I find it hard to believe that someone viewed this before production and said \\"Yes,it looks fine!

This is a rambling series of interviews with musicians who know little about science and scientists who know little about music. Nothing is covered in sufficient detail to be meaningful and no conclusions are ever drawn. Whenever some cogent theory is developed, it is promptly dismissed with little explanation, such as the relation between the normal human voice and its musical intonations. Ironically, this was dismissed with a very musically intoned voice. The final straw was when they brought string theory from abstract physics into the mix. I then concluded they were just dragging this out to get a full 120 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone who has a weak background in both science and music. Otherwise, you may find the lack of focus rather annoying.It may be PBS but it is definitely not NOVA material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing video that really focuses on music and the brain.

Then I noticed that author Tommy Tenney had also written a novel. Thinking it was just a repeat of the movie, I almost skipped it. I am so glad I didn't! The novel is well written and fleshed out the story so much more. I love the backstory of the modern day descendant of Hadassah and the letter that connects them. If you liked the movie, may I also recommend Hadassah and The Hadassah Covenant? Same author, same topic but the additional subject matter fleshes out the letter admirable. Though not a fan of most historical fiction, all the books will be keepers in my little home library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting Read!","review":"This Biblical historical fiction will keep you reading til the last chapter!

WAY Underated, light hearted","review":"Johnny Dangerously is one of those movies that get's better each time one see's it. The viewer catches more quips and one-liners each time. There are a number of cameos in this picture which adds to the variety and humor. Don't expect a serious, contemplative style of humor here; it's straight-forward, take-it-as-it-is type of comedy which is reflected in the charm of the lead character, Johnny Dangerously, played by Michael Keaton. Bottom Line: It's a fun movie when you're bored and want something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest movies of all time!!","review":"Johnny Dangerously combines slapstick, cheesy gags, innuendo, and general craziness into one of the funniest and best movies ever. Michael Keaton is at his best as Johnny Dangerously (Johnny Kelly in the old neighborhood, just ask the Pope!)The laughs start at the beginning as the now Retired Johnny is feeding the animals in his pet shop, and they don't stop until the credits are over.Buy this movie!!! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fargin Brilliant !!","review":"This film had me in tears of laughter. Roman Moroni is one of the funniest charcter spoofs Ive ever seen. The humour is totally off the wall but there are some great one liners in there too. Keaton puts in a great performance too in a role I havent seen him play much. Id recommend this film to anyone with a light sense of humour. This film doesnt take itself seriously and once you approach it with this in mind you should feel like I do !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my must have alltime favorites","review":"I'm with the other guy, I cant believe that the critics gave this such bad reviews. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and is loaded with hilarious one liners that my friends and I still quote and laugh about. Michael Keaton, Joe Piscapo, Danny Devito, Marilu Henner, Ray Walston...\\"I can see, I can hear and I can see...But who am I?\\" along with the visuals like the vibrator that JDs mother pulls out of her purse at Tommys graduation...Or the maid who asks Vermon \\"One at a time or both of you together...\\" I could go on and on. I think its the movie critics who are the 'fargin iceholes' but then they usually give poor reviews to most of my favorite movies.. I wish they would put this on DVD but I guess theyre too busy printing the spice girls movies and Brittany Spears videos to sqeaze this one in..Note, At least you can mute the spears videos, the eye candys not bad, still Im not adding that to my collection any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Riot!","review":"Those Bastages want a review.

If you Love to watch movies from 80s youwill love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad...","review":"I guess comedy must certainly be different for all of us, in evidence by all the glowing reviews here for this DOA film. Never has a 90 minute film seemed so long. I almost shut it off a few times, as the jokes in this film were just too pain-inducing. Example 1...how many times did we need to see the newspaper man get hit on the head with a bundle of papers, and have him state that his eyesight was restored or lost. It appeared the writer and director of this train wreck were imbibing in some serious drugs during the production of Johnny Dangerously, to think this was funny. With fine actors like Keaton, DeVito, and Piscopo...what a waste of talent.To see a spoof film that really works, check out Airplane or any of The Naked Gun movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm scared...","review":"...Really, I'm deeply frightened and disturbed by the fact that there are apparently (to judge by the customer reviews here) people in the world that find Johnny Dangerously funny. People who find it inexplicable that this film got the critical drubbing it deserved on its original theatrical release. If you want the truth, check out the review below by Tardisweller, which really nails it on the head. (Is it significant that by far the best written, smartest, funniest review of the bunch is the lone [until now] negative review? I leave you to draw your own conclusion.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ante Meridian, Uncle Meridian, and all the Little Meridians","review":"Please ignore the review up top by the Amazon critic. This is one of the funniest comedies to come out of the 80s. I would liken it to fellow 80s alum Better Off Dead in its ability to take the absurd and make it not only totally believable but downright hilarious. My entire extended family has been quoting one-liners from this movie for 20 years. If you enjoy comedy for the sake of comedy, you will enjoy Johnny Dangerously. And remember...My sister hung me on a hook once..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fargin' Hillarious!","review":"Johnny Dangerously still holds up well as one of the best comedies of the early to mid 80's. Starring Michael Keaton in perhaps his greatest comedic role, this is the story of gangster Johnny Dangerously. Johnny's basically a good guy who finds himself forced into a life of crime in order to pay to treat his mother's increasingly bizarre ailments. Marilu Henner is great as Johnny's love interest, Lil, while Peter Boyle is hilarious as mob boss Jocko Dundee. Griffin Dunne plays Johnny's naieve, optimistic brother, who follows a different path to the district attorney's office, and Joe Piscopo is at his funniest as rival gangster, Danny Vermin. All in all, this is a hilarious send-up of the classic gangster genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled With Ethnic Slurs","review":"One of the funniest things about this movie is the way they portray the Irish and Italian immigrants of that era.

He is consistently entertaining and exciting and, here and elsewhere, often funny. Money, Money, Money involves a more complex plot and is possibly longer than some other 87th precinct novels, but it is every bit as good. Considering that this was apparently written just prior to 9/11, the terrorism content is even a bit prescient, and certainly relevant. McBain has a style all his own, and we're lucky to have him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money, Money, Money","review":"Ed McBain (aka Evan Hunter) has always given us great thrillers with his 87th Precinct novels. This one is no exception. He does get away from the long explanations regarding who everybody is.With all the characters presented he gives us this can be a little boring. Especially for us who have followed the 87th for a long time. There are some great scenes between Steve and his family. There is also some humor as Ollie Weeks tries to get his book published. His fans will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money, Money, Money","review":"\\"Money, Money, Money\\" is the 51st 87the Precinct novel by the master of the police procedural, Ed McBain. Steve Carella and Meyer Meyer from the 87th Precinct and Fat Ollie Weeks from the 88th are called to the Grover Park Zoo to investigate the death of a woman who has been eaten by lions. They find out that she is Cassandra Ridley, a former Gulf War pilot. They also learn that she had recently made a drug run to Mexico. They also find out that she was paid a tip with \\"super-bills\\", bogus $100 bills. The plot to this one is rather complex with drugs, bogus money, murder, and a bombing at Clarendon Hall. More attention is given to the criminal element than is usual in McBain's novels. The characters are all well-drawn, especially a drug dealer named \\"Wiggy the Lid\\", a man you would not wish to meet. This is another excellent addition to a series that began in 1956.

For that reason, this CD is very dissapointing for me because it's not how I remembered the songs, and not the songs in their best form. For that reason, I don't even plan on donating the CD to the library.

The DVD doesn't offer any other viewing method within the menu.The only way to view this in full wide-screen is to have and use the analog input into the TV and use the zoom function to get rid of the bars. This will make the picture grainy and hard to watch (no it's not my TV - I have a very high-end system).This was very disappointing since in the DVD literature it says the concert was filmed in HDTV.

Plus, there are at least 10 people in the background who shout, hoot, \\"woooh!\\", and \\"awww yeah\\" at every new move Kathy does--this is extraordinarily annoying, especially if you're just trying to learn the steps. In general, I think once you get the hang of it, it will probably be a fun workout. Meanwhile, if perky, dopey people continuously shouting enthusiastically isn't your thing and sucks the motivation right out of you, I recommend something different, such as Denise Austin or Gilad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing clips from old videos was very disappointing.","review":"I was very excited when I bought this Kathy Smith DVD until I tried it and found out that there were old routines from old videos that I never liked.However, I have purchased several other videos from Kathy Smith, such as \\"Secrets of a Great Body: Lower/Upper Body Workout\\" and \\"Great Buns and Thighs Workout.\\" I lost 55 pounds in four months using all three of these videos from Kathy Smith. Those videos are priceless to me!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think out of the box, Kathy.","review":"Kathy can't seem to break out of the rut she's in. If you are familiar with her other tapes you will recognize the same moves she's been doing since the 80s. At least with this one she finally changed her music. I did not care for the cardio workout, too much V-step and repetition, BORING! The \\"personal trainer\\" title is a gimmick. Aside from the workout there is a lot of printed text you're supposed to read, is this a video or a book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"Great all around workout -- you can pick and chose which session (or more) to do on any given day. Clear instructions.

I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive Book on How Early Childhood Ed. Evolved","review":"As an early childhood education teacher, I appreciated seeing how the entire field grew from rudimentary beginnings to what we see today. This book does not just skim over things. Lascarides goes over things in painstaking detail by mentioning the numerous figures that played a part in the development. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Joe Williams compilation","review":"The CD was fine, as advertised. It was delivered very promptly after purchase. It contains several tracks from an old Joe Williams album that has never been re-issued and that I have never been able to find another copy of. So, I was happy to obtain these long unavailable tracks in digital format."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAVED MY MARRIAGE","review":"Counselors, friends and family would have me to leave a problem marriage of two very selfish people. Created to Be a Help Meet was just what I needed to hear. It is not a warm fuzzy feeling book to read, at least at first. It is hard to read...or maybe to hear, and hard to put into practice, but when I started seeing clearer Gods plan for marriage I started making mostly just attitude changes, and by God's grace and the Pearl's help my marriage was saved. This book goes against what the world teaches but I believe if you really study it, pray about it and consider what the author is trying to teach, your marriage will change for the better too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not read this book, ladies!!!","review":"Ladies: the summary of this book is: All men are jerks! Pick your jerk! Hold on! He'll leave you because he's a lust filled maniac! Good luckThis book can be compared to a powerful drug: If used wisely by an intelligent, mature, emotionally stable couple, some limited, positive effects may be obtained. If it is used by those who are naive, ignorant, dysfunctional and foolish, however, the effects will be devastatingly destructive and toxic. (Ironically, it is the latter group for whom the book seems to be primarily intended).As others have noted in their reviews, there are far more valuable, insightful, helpful resources out there than \\"Created to Be His Help Meet.\\" Why waste your time and money on it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Evil","review":"Misguided scripture.

I would reccomend authors such as Martha Peace, Susan Hunt, John Piper, Bryan Chapell and Douglas Wilson instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downright abusive","review":"Appalling and hideous advice. The author seems to think that women are evil (I don't think she likes them) and that the reason some husbands are cruel and/or abusive is because they are responding to the horribleness of their wives. I am not even going to get into all of what's wrong with this dangerous book because I would have to write a dissertation and I've already wasted too much of my life reading it. I will say that it, in my opinion, is abusive toward women. God does NOT want you to live like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"twisted views","review":"the author is articulate and interesting - unfortunately. besides having a skewed view of marriage, submission, and the husband-wife relationship (to say nothing of child rearing), she also builds on two erroneous Bible doctrines: pelagianism (original sin)and gnosticism (where matter is seen as evil).while there are thought-provoking issues discussed, and occasional good (even Biblical) advice, readers should study this book only if well-grounded in the scripture, their faith, knowledgeable in the area of heresy, and are unable to locate any other books on the subject.this book received one star ONLY because no stars isn't allowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book","review":"This book is wrong on so many levels.

Period.","review":"This book saved my marriage. Really. Read it when you're mad at your husband and ready to give up. The most important message I received in the book came from Michael Pearl, the author's husband. He said, \\"When God puts you in subjection to a man [who is ignorant and foolish] whom he knows is going to cause you to suffer, it is with the understanding that you are obeying God by enduring the wrongful suffering.\\" \\"And when you suffer wrongfully, as unto the Lord, you bring great glory to God in heaven,\\" he continued.

However, in my opinion, it includes more opinion and legalism than it does biblical truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want good advise, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!","review":"I was so impacted by a very well written review of this book that I had to share it:\\"From the first page of Created To Be His Help Meet to the last, Debi Pearl shows that she is an unsuitable mentor; her counsel is too often foolish, her words too often harsh, her grasp of Scripture and theology inadequate and, not surprisingly then, her grasp of the utter centrality of the gospel almost completely missing. I would recommend avoiding this book at all costs.\\"Please read the full review if you want an in-depth look at what this book truly offers: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive kindling, but I had to find a good use for it!","review":"This is one of the most cold, legalistic books I have ever read on this subject. Reading this book will leave you confused, with a wounded spirit! Woe to Mrs. Pearl for using the Bible as a soapbox upon which to mete out her tongue-lashings (if you aren't exactly like her, that is). Instead, read Feminine Appeal: 7 Virtues of a Godly Wife and Mother and/or Biblical Womanhood in the Home...both written by Nancy Leigh Demoss. Other greats include Lord, Meet Me in the Laundry Room by Barbara Curtis as well as The Mother at Home. I couldn't even bring myself to resell this book in an attempt to recoup the money I wasted on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"According to Debi, Women are NOT Equal","review":"Debi specifically says that women's only role is be a helpmeet for me. Did you catch that? ONLY role. If you're an adult woman and you're not married, your life is pointless. And Debi tries to make women think this what God has to tell them.Debi encourages women to stay with their husbands even if they are being abused! Women are to obey their husbands IN ANYTHING (except doing something illegal, watching porn, or having anal sex). This is ridiculous. In fact, she tells women not to even question their husbands. Period.Debi tells women that they must have sex with their husbands at least every three days or so, or their husbands will cheat, and naturally so. This sounds remarkably similar to Afghan law which says women must have sex with their husbands every few days, and can't refuse.In summary, THIS BOOK TEACHES WOMEN TO BE DOORMATS. This is AWFUL. Women are equal to men, and have equal rights, but Debi doesn't seem to know this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly, Horribly Offensive!","review":"I received this book as a gift and I felt it was not relevant to my life or my marriage at all! As many others have mentioned, you have to dig DEEP to glean insightful wisdom (for example, delighting in your husband). However, I was so offended by the author's judgmental tone and seeming disregard for a wife's well-being. By reading this book, one would think a marriage is about one person and his 'assistant'--not how my husband and I think of our marriage at all!I have no idea how this book has such a high rating as I would *never* recommend it to anyone to read. Granted, some bits (maybe a sentence or two per chapter) are worth reading, but you can get that in another, more well-reasoned and thoughtful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is full of Debi Pearl's twisted opinions","review":"Unfortunately, I read this book before reading the reviews. It was in my disgust for the book, that I got online to read the reviews to see what other Christians thought. I firmly agree with the many negative comments that have already been brought out. This book is full of Debi Pearl's twisted opinions, but rather than be stated as that, the book uses a type of pathetic guilt to try to lead the reader to think that what she is saying is Biblical. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but those that are in a failing marriage due to physical, emotional, or verbal abuse need be very cautious of the harm that can be done if following the opinions of the Pearl's, especially where kids are involved also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This book literally changed my marriage. I got this 10 years into my marriage and wished I would have had it from the beginning. We have been married 15 years now and the last 5 have been so much better than the 10 before. I buy this book for every young women I know who is getting married. When you figure out that you are really created to be this man's help mate and embrace what you were made to do, it truly does make for a wonderful marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"wife instructions","review":"This book is ONLY for those wives who are ready to change and look inward and upward to be truly a help meet to their husbands...It is the first \\"wife instruction book\\" that has changed/saved my marriage; I am married to Mr. Commando...I finally know how to be the best wife I can be to my husband! Exhilarating! It was a total God \\"thing\\" in how this landed in my hands. I am now doing a Bible Study with six other women who are excited about the glorious changes that are taking place in their marriages."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book nearly got a friend of mine killed","review":"I'm not a feminist or anything like that nor have I even ever been married, but a friend of mine followed all the advice in this book and continnued submitting to a husband who had put her in the hospital after beating her. I tried to get her some help, but she cited this book and said 'He is my head he has the right to do that.' She was saved by her loving parents who got her away from the creep. i think if she had not been reading this garbage, she would not have lost years of her life to that man. \\"Husbands, LOVE YOUR WIVES AS CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH.\\" The Pearls seem to conveniently ignore this part of Holy Scripture. Ephesians 5 spends twice as much time telling husbands to love their wives as it does telling wives to submit. Evangelical culture needs to focus more on husbands loving wives."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Is A Cult Member...Look Into It!","review":"Please do not read this book! It is mean-spirited (i.e. calling a woman \\"hillbilly ugly\\"), judgmental (assuming the worst of people), sexually inappropriate (i.e. talking about a young man ejaculating upon seeing a woman in a tight skirt, who was standing in front of him in church) and theologically unsound (taking Scriptures out of context and misusing them)! Debi Pearl and her husband are highly controversial people, who started an extremist group that is not truly Christian. It is believed that they may very well be plants being used to disrupt the church. Please see Tim Challies article on this evil book. Avoid this author at all costs! God give us discernment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful Book","review":"This book helped me so much. It helped me realize how much of the feminist movement had infiltrated my thoughts and actions without me even realizing it. Calls our hearts back home to our husbands and children, to put them first, and be totally fulfilled as a woman of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, very good","review":"As a pastor I can say that women in our church have read this book and it has helped them see in very practical terms some scriptural principles that are all too often overlooked or deliberately ignored. Quite honestly it has been a factor in some real transformation in some marriages in the church - leading to much happier wives, children and husbands.I give four stars not five because in one or two places Mrs Pearl, I believe, is unnecesarily frank about certain things; and in a few other places I think she should have developed or explained her statements a little better. However, the book will stay in our home and as a ministry we will continue to recommend it to women because overall it has borne wonderful fruit in the lives of people we know."},{"rating":"1","title":"created to be his help meet","review":"i have been married for thirty years and was looking forward to further strengthening my marriage. this book is not the way. i found as i was reading this book i could not respect a woman who would offer such destructive advice and if i followed her ways i would not be able to respect myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I was given this book as a wedding present by a very well meaning friend. I believe that a man should be head of the household but this auhor is living a delusional fantasy world. This book seems like a guidebook for someone living in a 1950s sitcom or in \\"Stepford\\". Yes women should cok clean and care for children but, men also help. Many women work nowadays and you could never be a working wife and follow all of the rules in this book. I believe if I lived like her my life would be a living hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"Be very careful when reading this book. It contains some truth that is wrapped around some dangerous lies. The Pearls basically believe that men are gods, women are slaves, and children are dogs. Thus, men are to be worshiped, women are to be used and blamed, and children are to be switched until they respond to every order with blind, knee-jerk obedience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped at \\"Taco Night every week\\"","review":"I never finished this book. It was presented to us as a book to do together in our women's ministy.I love my church Family.... I refused to keep reading this book.I cannot reccomend it.. and while some things may be good... Most of it for me... Was NOT FOR ME.I will stick with the Word.... Respect my Husband.... Obey him as I obey the Lord.. and the PEARLS... Can do it the way they want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a fundamentally and dangerously flawed book.","review":"The Pearls have written a book that is fundamentally and dangerously flawed. In the book, Debi claims her husband is a Greek scholar (hence an authority). His understanding and use of scripture shows otherwise. They use scriptures out of context, and twist them to prove their points. They sprinkle in just enough truth to cause some of their most blatant errors to be masked. This may be a good primer if you want to start a male dominant cult, but is dangerous for Christians that want to improve their marriages by understanding Biblical principles. Instead of bringing redemption into relationships, this book deepens the effect of the curse.There are several great books available to help couples learn to love and respect one another, this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"created to be his help meet","review":"This is the absolute most bizarre book I have ever read in my life. It is full of wrong teaching, condemntion & namecalling to any who do not agree with her, judgemental, full of blanket generalizations, shame based, misleading, motivates by fear, legalistic, excuses mens sin issues, & promotes doormat women. Jesus came to set the captives free. He is life giving & releasing. One might say that there are a few good truths in this book. I say, there are hundreds of other sources to go to rather than muddle through the distortions and oppressiveness of this book trying to find a decent truth. I would recommend to find ANY other book. If I were Amazon, I wouldn't carry this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is great for setting up an abusive marriage","review":"I bought the book b/c I've seen so many contoversial reviews and wanted to read it for myself. To put the entire book in one sentence: A husband can do whatever the heck he wants- cheat, view porn, physically and emotionlly abuse the wife and children and they(the wife and children) must obey him, treat him like he's the best thing since sliced bread, and never, never need anything or have any feelings about his treatment of them. In my opinion, this book is just the kind of poison that Satan promotes- just enough truth to make a person stumble into his trap. Truly there are better resources out there. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of helpful advice but needs to be read with discernment","review":"I read this book with a group of other Christian women and we were all changed for the better by reading this book. While some people have asserted that Debi claims that women are to blame for probelms in a marriage, I did not find taht to be the case. She is simply addressing women about the issues they need to deal with. This isn't about your husband. It's about you, the wife. Even if he is a rotten husband, we are still called to be godly wives. Yes, that is very hard, but that is what God has called us to do! As we read through this book, we each admitted that we were treating our husbands better. We were encouraged to whine/sulk less and honor more. There were definitely a few times where we did not agree with what Debi said (Bathesheba being to blame with David's sin for instance), but overall, this was a great book and I would recommend it to every single wife out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Twisted Misrepresentation Of God's Will","review":"I could not return this book because it would be horrible to have some poor soul pick it up and be hurt by it. I threw it away in the garbage. I then wished I would of looked at the amazon reviews before I bought it. Pretty much everything negative written in the reviews is true. This book is a twisted misrepresentation of Gods will for marriage. Parts of the bible used to support Debi Pearls views are taken out of context. It upsets me that it could hinder those of knowing the true compassionate loving God that we have who gives dignity and respect toward women and all people. It is not a feminist non- feminist debate. It is the fulfillment of all Gods rules summed up in this one to \\" Love thy neighbor as thyself\\" so how much more if not your neighbor your own wife. A christian man would love his wife as his own body as Christ loves us. Please do not buy this book and if you already have please do not believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tone does not convey love of the Lord","review":"I'm a Christian married mother of 2. Although there is some good information about submitting to and honoring your husband, the author doesn't (in my opinion) write in a manner that shows she has the love of the Lord in her heart. Her description of single mothers was really disturbing as was the story about Sunny an abused, cheated on wife. This author comes across as harsh, uncompassionate and arrogant. I've actually prayed for this author which is about all I can do -- Hopefully she'll grow in tenderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my best gift. It caused a lot of grief.","review":"While this book has some good points, I would recommend seeing if your library has a copy before buying it. I read it, and then gave it to my wife to read. It did more harm than good to our relationship. If a woman has been in an abusive relationship before this book will most certainly put her back in a dark place. My wife never finished reading it and when I asked her her thoughts on the book, she said that the author was \\"full of crap\\". I gave it a single star on behalf of my wife. We also wound up getting rid of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Love it.

Despite hearing bad things about it, I went ahead and purchased it. Mrs. Pearl seems to think that every Godly Submissive wife needs to be a doormat. I also did not take to her description of ALL mental illness as a \\"madness inflicted by God as a punishment.\\" I put the book down after I read that. It only showed her ignorance."},{"rating":"2","title":"trish's","review":"I got this book very quick, in 4 or 5 days. The book is an excellant book too!

This book is great for the \\"Type A\\" women out there who are married to what Debi Pearl described as \\"Mr. Steady\\". It is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS both emotionally and relationally, not to mention physically, for the mild and passive wives who are constantly told by well-meaning Christians to continue being submissive and to \\"win their husbands without a word\\". If I had read this book 6 months ago, it would have been tragic for me. But thank God, I was given 'Boundaries in Marriage\\", which is what too many passive spouses haven't read, but need to. And the other reviewers are only too right about her putting all the responsibility on the wife. This is dangerous and unbiblical."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"Essentially this book tells you that unless you imitate a \\"Stepford Wife\\" you are blaspheming the word of God. Debi Pearl claims you are never to contradict your husband or even make helpful suggestions or you'll cause your husband to leave you and will end up a lonely old lady or you'll go insane. This is a very extreme view. She says your ONLY PURPOSE in life is TO SERVE your husband, quietly and with a smile. My husband suggested we burn the book.Interesting that Michael Pearl has not penned a \\"How to Love Your Wife as Christ Loved the Church\\" book.I am a christian and I do submit to my husband. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER! STAY AWAY!","review":"I found this book to be an unrealistic, unbalanced view on how marriage should be. I am a Christian, but I found this book to be poison to anyone who is seeking marriage counsel. I feel the Pearls have missed the mark on what God has intended for marriage. A woman was made from Adam's rib NOT his foot. This book painted a \\"door mat\\" life for the wife. Please read other sources on marriage to receive well thought out counsel on marriage. Gary Chapman or Tim LaHaye are great places to start. If there was a way to give this 0 stars that is what I would have given it.

Self-loathing has no bounds apparently. Anyone who needs to treat their spouse like a doormat is sick and twisted and anyone who needs to be treated like a doormat is sick and twisted. Apparently, there are a lot peas in the same pod in this legalistic cult they mistakenly call \\"Christianity\\". None of what they're advocating sounds Christ-like to me. It's because it isn't.The Pearls think that their advice for Christian marriage and child-raising (their other books) bear witness for Christ. I think that have it confused with Stockholm Syndrome. I think that their methods for Stockholm Syndrome are more effective than the ones who originally invented it. Good job, Pearls. You'd make good guillotine or public noose operators. The Dark Ages are calling you - they're running out of barbarians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great advice for most married women...","review":"I know that some women just swear by this book, but a lot of what Mrs. Pearl talks about is simply unBiblical. Do a google search on this book and look for a blog by spunkyhomeschoolspot and you will see why there are some big problems with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this book!","review":"Instead - get The Excellent Wife by Martha Peace. TEW is truly biblically based. Help Meet has many issues - most have been listed in other reviews. I will only add that you should do some research about the Pearls. Mr. Pearl feels that he is without sin - has been for several years - through a process of sinless santification. He even teaches a course so you can learn to be completely without sin as well! Where does that leave Grace?

While I am not as legalistic as she seems to be, I learned so much about myself and was truly convicted on a number of behaviors.

I am an outgoing girl, not the doormat Debi Pearl seems to be advocating. This book caused me to doubt my ability to be a good wife. I expected my husband to look at me, say \\"You can't do this!\\" and leave me after reading half of this book!Thankfully, my husband loves me completely. I love him completely. We both are trying to be God's love personified to each other. That's what we need to know. That's what we need to live in.

I started attending a Bible study in my church, which used this book, and by the end of the third session I was completely turned off. My husband asked me not to go back. I believe he was even more horrified than I was. The advice is so wrong, so unscriptural, so blatantly evil it defies description. No, you don't have to cover for your philandering husband. You don't have to pretend everything is rosy when the slob is too lazy to get off the couch and get a job. And you do not have to apologize if you're too sick to keep a \\"Father Knows Best\\" home!

Then I find the Pearl's materials. WOW! If I could have written a book on marriage and family this would be it! I have several copies, they are great gifts as well. If you need help in your marriage, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. It will make all the difference in the world. Some will say that she blames the woman for everything- that is not true, she just lets you know what YOU can do to change your marriage. Michael Pearl is writing a book for the men. She,being a woman, is speaking to the women about things they can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannah","review":"Hard to swallow; but almost the best thing I have ever read and applied to my life. My marriage went from miserable to wonderful. I watched my husband change from beaten down to bold. I am so grateful to Debi for telling the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it no stars, I would","review":"Really, really awful. I just cannot understand this line of thinking. In their other work they \\"teach\\" that children are manipulative and should be punished for being so, yet here they say that women should manipulate their husbands. Ugh - they must be watching too much Home Improvement.I only read their books so that I can argue against them intelligently."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I've had this book for 5 years now and it has really helped me have a much happier marriage. I've given it to many other women over the years, and it has helped most of them, too. It gives some much needed balance to all the things everyone else tells you that you deserve in a marriage or what the role of a wife should be. This is closer to the way that God intended a wife to function, therefore it works great! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not biblical","review":"I read the whole book and found that it was not always based in Biblical standards. Some things sounded good until I investigated further and found they were not Biblical. Read carefully (if at all) and with the Bible handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conversation starter","review":"This book has a very interesting perspective. It is a good book to use in a group to create discussions, but not as complete biblical truth. There is lots of legalism from the author and the book is very derivative of Pearl's own feeling toward marriage. There are some good ideas, but lots of odd ones as well. This book is NOT for the feminist woman! She is very against working mothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly mislead christians!","review":"This book focuses on mostly the \\"obey\\" part of the marriage vows for the woman. There is some good points but mostly say submissive wives are the only way to have a happy marriage. They advocate in this and other books abusing your children, recommending to keep weapons in every room of the house and the car in the event your child acts like a child you can beat them quickly. Talk about misinterpreting the Bible!!! I am sure the Lord is disappointed in them as well. My sisters and I are burning their books in the fireplace later...seriously. Children have died due to their teachings. Do NOT buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful of Other People's Interpretation of God's Plan for Marriage","review":"There are plenty of other books out there that are uplifting and promote a HEALTHY relationship between husband and wives. My suggestion is to find those and read those. Husbands are not given a free pass in a marriage. Check out Patrick Morley and his Devotions for Couples and other books if you would like to build a strong marriage and not simply become a the authors version of what a wife should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Content in Book","review":"I was part of a study where we read and discussed this book. After reading most of the chapters I was angry as this book portrays all problems of marriage to be the woman's fault, and attributes things such as men cheating due to the women not being pretty or good enough. There is quite a bit of scripture in the book, but usually just one line. I would read the whole chapter to get the context and most of the quotes were definitely in another context. One example the author wrote about 3 pages of her \\"wisdom\\" and then at the end of the chapter she said, here's what the Bible says about wisdom. These bits of scripture just said things like gain wisdom. I felt this was very dangerous as anyone could write something down as \\"wisdom\\" and then use the same scripture to back it up. Do not spend your time reading this book, but read the Bible instead to gain true wisdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to blame the wife for everything manual!","review":"The author is either a mistreated poor wife who is seeking the miserable company of others to help her feel better, or she is being brainwashed into really believing that women are to blame for every \\"evil\\" in this life. Both are a possibility of this author Mrs. Pearl. After reading the first few chapters, where she blames a woman for not making her husband happy enough- resulting in his \\"emotional affair\\", I was compelled to return the book to the lender and say \\"If you have so little respect for yourself as a woman and wife, no one else will either!\\" This is how I feel about the author- sorry to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Trash","review":"I would never spend good money on SUCH TRASH written by Such haineous people as the pearls and one that negates the abuse of women and children shoudl have never been allowed to gain money on how to torture your children to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"much better book","review":"I recommend \\"Marriage in the red\\" by Dr. Levi Skipper. This is for both the husband and the wife. This book used scripture far better than this Pearl book. This book is not watered down or secularized. Dr. Skipper takes marriage and God's word very seriously and has a very practical way of presenting sound biblical teaching with marriage counseling and putting God at the very center of the marriage. I learned as a wife how to value my husband and my marriage with scripture memorization and how to hide God's word in my heart so that I might not sin against God or cause pain to my husband. I am far from where I need or want to be but I am encouraged, blessed and guided in the right direction by Dr. Skipper's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marriage changer!","review":"This nook is the most INCREDIBLE, WISDOME filled book I have read on marriage! I wish someone would have given me this book when I was in my teens so that I could learn these things of God and what my roll is LONG before I was married...I truly believe this will make a major change in any marriage ESPECIALLY if it is failing! Have given it to 3 failing marriages, they have now reconciled! WOW! Thank you Debi Pearl and Holy Spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Created to be His Help Meet","review":"I used to think it was my job to change my husband. This book helped me to realize that the only way to change him to change myself.This book opened my eyes to a lot of things I needed to change about myself.I am not finished the book yet, but I have already seen a big improvement in my relationship with my husband.It's a must read if you would like to have true contentment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Recipe","review":"If you knew a cookie was made with chocolate chips, sawdust, and manure, would you eat the cookie for the sake of the chocolate chips?Ladies, please find a better cookie that will truly nourish your soul and bless your marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Will Indeed","review":"There are so many personal things I could say about this looney tune stuff. I will keep my review ambiguous and say thank God loved ones in my life have been able to pull themselves away from this crazy talk. There are those out there that use crap like this to manipulate and brainwash people, esp. when they are young and vulnerable. In the end, true love wins though and the BS is seen as it really is, isn't it? No one truly knows God's will or plan and if they try to convince you otherwise, run for the hills. Think for yourself. Follow true love and you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by the Pearls","review":"I purchase this book a number of years ago and have read it many times. Without a doubt, I believe that this is the best book on marriage a woman can read. Debi's use of God's Word is spot on...hard to hear maybe...but not taken out of context. Created to Be His Helpmeet has taken my miserable marriage and turned it around...not perfect yet...but definately not on the path it would have been on had I not read the truths in this book. I guess the proof is in the pudding. Look at the fruit in Debi's own life (the joy in her marriage as well as the lives of her daughters). My girls and future daughter-in-laws will all receive this book as a wedding gift! Thanks again, Pearls, for encouraging us to live joyfully for Christ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book ONLY if you can handle MORE satisfaction","review":"I think the problem people have with this book is that we are not ready to handle how much GOD loves us and wants for us. We don't trust HIM enough to take care of all the things we try to accomplish on our own strength. You won't like this book if you are content with mediocrity or if you like to stay frustrated.Read. Pray. Read in a group. Pray. Then live in the freedom of the Word of GOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to swallow","review":"This book has definitely been a major help in my life. Every chapter has something in it just for me. I have already seen improvements in my relationship with my husband and even my relationship with the Lord. While it has been a pleasure to read, it has also been very difficult. It is challenging to acknowledge the areas that I am wrong in and work on those. But with each victory, it makes the next seem much more attainable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife can't be wrong.","review":"My wife bought this book and has changed our home! I have no words to express my thanks for an older woman with a teaching spirit. Mrs Pearl has brought a message of mutual love and joy to our home. We are different. I hope this book does for your household what God has used it to do in mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or Hate it?","review":"After reading the other reviews of this book I guess you either love it or hate it!!! I loved it, this book really opened my eyes to my first ministry unto my God. God's plan for marriage has not changed and a womans FIRST ministry is toward her husband, don't miss this first ministry. The book does seem to narrow what we modern christian women think we should be doing. If we fail in our first ministry to our husbands and children then what good would all the other stuff be? This book has a lot of wisdom and practical help. (And yes there is a whole lot to the other side...a book laying out the responsibilities of a husband would be easily twice as thick, but this book is written to women on the subject of her responsibilities, it is not written to men) I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, Practical and SUPER helpful!","review":"I put off reading this book for months after a friend of mine recommended it because I let some of the nasty reviews get in the way. Boy am I glad I decided to give it a go and make my own determination of the author and the book!My girlfriends and I went through this book as a group and WOW, what a difference it has made in ALL of our marriages! It's brought us so much closer to our husbands and we are LOVING the blessings that are now bing showered on our marriages. Some of us have been married 10+ years and others of us only a few months. Regardless, the book has been an asset to every single one of us ladies no matter what stage of life we're in.DO NOT let all the negative reviews keep you from reading this book - read it prayerfully with an open, humble heart and teachable spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching me what God's Word says for wives","review":"GREAT BOOK! Going to read it over and over! This book has greatly blessed our marriage! Covers so many points that wives need to know from God's Word on being help meets to their husbands."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"Good book, read with wisdom and discernment. And be a Berean and look up all the verses - some are misquoted. Otherwise good book. Arrived in perfect condition and a timely manner. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and BOLD!","review":"This book is a wonderful review of the scriptures and how God says to have a happy marriage. It is counter-cultural and hard to hear, however if anyone doubts its efficacy just TRY IT. Seeing the effect it has on your marriage is more of a testimony than words can provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening","review":"I will not give an extremely long review of this book. It truly isn't worth it. This book is not worth the paper it used to print, and I am so thankful that I didn't pay for it, but borrowed it from someone else. The advice in this book is not simply \\"outdated\\" as some people claim the advice in books like Fascinating Womanhood (a decent book, in my opinion) to be, but it is ridiculous, and a lesson in nothing but humiliation for a woman. This is not about submitting to one's husband, but making oneself into a blathering idiot who makes no effort to think for herself in the slightest. This book actually made me sad to read. I hope no one out there reads this book and believes that God truly wants things this way. I consider myself to be a Christian, but I have not read this advice in scripture- anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devastating results","review":"Without getting too personal, this book is majorly destructive to women that deeply want to love and serve the Lord. It strips her of everything she ever thought she could be. It gives men permission to use and abuse their wives. Run from the Pearls as fast as you can!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"90% Great","review":"A lot of reviewers say that Debi Pearl puts all the blame and guilt on the wife for the husband's problems. I don't see it that way. I feel that this book gives power to the woman by instructing her in changes she can make in HERSELF and therefore in her marriage. It's so frustrating to me to read marriage books that assume the husband is a certain way, when he falls short in real life. In CtbHHM, Pearl assumes you are married to an absolute jerk of a man. And by golly, if she can learn to live with her jerk, then I can learn to live with my awesome guy.Some things I disagree with though. My husband would NEVER touch a child, but if he did you bet he'd be one sorry sucker and he would never see his family again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This book is essential to any marriage, whether you are just starting out or have been married for years. Remember. . . a wise woman learns from her mistakes, but an even wiser woman learns from the mistakes of others. This book is packed full of advice, most of which comes from the Bible. So when you are through trying to make your marriage work by yourself, and you're finished listening to television shows and the advice of your single friends, turn your ear to God. \\"Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:\\" Jeremiah 32:17 NOTHING is too big for my God, not even marriage! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Leaven...","review":"I would never recommend this book to anyone. Though there is some excellent stuff in there, it's like rat poison--a lot of good stuff and a little poison. I personally know the Pearls, and their arrogance and pride shows through. I had a real problem with her saying that God Himself pushed a certain woman into madness because she was being unsubmissive and trying to be the spiritual leader of her home. If that were the case, there would be millions of insane women!! There were other, multiple issues I had with her counsel. A woman with a good grounding in the Bible might glean some good stuff out of here (though if she had a good grounding in the Bible, she'd probably have all of this anyway), but anyone else I would seriously NOT recommend this book to them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with the multiple one star reviews. Ironically, one of the author's first chapters is about being a woman of joy, but the subsequent chapters are anything but joyful to read. There is some excellent wisdom hidden beneath the negativity, blame, and self-imposed guilt, but I wouldn't waste my time reading to try and find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"As a naive woman in a serious dating relationship, this book was highly recommended as a book I should read to help prepare me for marriage. As a newlywed, I was given the book and finally sat down to read it. It has done nothing but frustrate and anger me. As many of the other reviews have stated, there is very little scripture supporting her wacky views and many times her advice is no different than something I would receive from my unbelieving co-workers. This is NOT the book to read as a young woman considering marriage, a newly married woman, or by any married woman at all. This book is more damaging then helpful. For those looking for an excellent book on being a Godly wife, I highly recommend Feminine Appeal by Carolyn Mahaney, wife of CJ Mahaney, the author of The Cross Centered Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Advice","review":"I am a christian woman that loves and submits to her husband. This book offers terrible advice. Please find another resource for your marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"wife and mom of 3 boys","review":"If you read this book with an open heart you and your family will truly be blessed! This book is so different from what our America culture is telling us. The topics are not always popular but there is a lot of truth in this book and the truth cuts sharper than a two-edged sword. I hope you will give this book a chance to change your life and help you better love and respect your husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for willing brides","review":"This book had a lot of great suggestions at how to make a marriage successful... though if you do not have an open mind you might be easily offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great peace have they who love thy law and nothing will offend them","review":"Great peace have they who love thy law and nothing will offend themThis book was very helpful to me. Debbie has much insight.Really enjoyed the outline on the three types of men. Could see my husband so clearly as the steady man. This really helped our marriage.God's truth in his word will offend some but I want truth notsugar coated water down nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This can change your marriage","review":"I believe that this book teaches God's view of the women. We are so endoctrinated today to believe that we as women need to \\"achieve\\" according to the world's standards. However, as this book explains, we should quit fighting what the Bible says, and start obeying it. When we do so, our marriages will be better. It may not be PC, or popular, but the Bible doesn't change or apologize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Every Wife and Woman","review":"Ladies who will choose to accept and follow the teachings in this book are almost guaranteed to transform their marriage. God's way works and this book spells out God's way in the simplest of formats. Excellent book especially when completing the word searches and coupled with the journal. It can be life changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help Meet","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\" Created to Be His Help Meet: Discover How God Can Make Your Marriage Glorious. I feel in the age of divorce and blended families this book tells it like it is and is very refreshing. It is Biblical based and using the Bible as its authoritative guide. After reading some bad reviews I didn't know what to expect but after renting it from the library, I went out and brought the book. I saw myself in the pages and saw the outcome and I'm totally a believer now. I hope this helps with you deciding to purchase this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE most helpful book for wives!","review":"Next to the bible, I have found this book to be the most practical guide in helping me be a better wife and mother. I have bought this book for many newly married friends, and they have found such life in it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theological Errors abound","review":"I really do not know where to start on this one. I'll hit the systematic issues primarily. Most of this book is based on cultural preference rather than biblical principals. Her proof texts and scripture verse are typically out of context. Debi Pearl relies on what her husband says the Greek says in the Bible (some one please tell her that the O.T. was written in Hebrew and Aramaic)rather than doing the work herself. Also, her teaching women on how to make a petition to her husband is totally counter to how Matthew 18 says to deal with conflict and the whole idea of iron sharpening iron. One large concern is her reference to an abusive husband being a Mr. Commander gone wrong because of his wife!I cannot understand how this book is circulating among mainstream evangelicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"un-Biblical, un-christian, horrible advice","review":"I showed this book to my sister, who is a counselor (and also a Christian). After reading through it, she described it as \\"the worst relationship advice I have ever seen!\\"This is a book written by a woman whose only qualifications to write this book are that she is 1) a woman, and 2) married to a pastor. She has not been to seminary to learn how to interpret the Bible. She has not had training in how to counsel others in relationships. She gives advice to stay in abusive marriages, not talk to other women about your problems, and basically blame every marital problem on yourself. She even says in chapter 8 that hormonal imbalances are caused by women being irrationally unhappy with their husbands!The author is not a therapist or counselor or theologian or anyone else you might trust as an \\"expert\\" on marriage, family, or the Bible. Do yourself a favor and buy ANY book besides this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with great discernment","review":"Although I agree with approximately 70% of the content, the other 30% overshadowed the positive. My concerns are:1. There is little mention of mercy and grace.2. The text is written in a very prideful and arrogant manner.3. Scripture is often twisted and used out of context to support Mrs. Pearl's opinion.4. The overarching theme is one of blame.5. The author uses the book to shamelessly promote her husband's books. It felt like a literary commercial at times.6. The author presents herself as knowing all there is to know of the male gender.7. The author presents her thoughts, interpretations and opinions as being the same as God's.8. A man's moral failings (as a husband and father) are presented as being the fault of his wife.Be very discerning in reading this book. There are some excellent points made in this text, my concern is the overarching attitude of the book. Be sure to know who you are in CHRIST and His grace before you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil","review":"Debi Pearl states that if your husband molests your children, you should call the authorities and \\"have him do\\" time in prison. Then, when he gets out, you should welcome him home with loving arms. Because \\"God hates divorce without exception.\\"Let me get this straight. If I'm married to a man who HAS SEX with his own children, not only am I NOT to divorce him, I'm supposed to welcome him back as my husband?? Have sex with him as my husband?? That is sick. What kind of woman in her right mind could have sex with a man who screws children?Not to mention such a woman would deserve to be disowned by her own children. Can you imagine being a child molested by your father and then have your mother welcome him home? That is a slap in the face to all abused children.Do we really have to go on about all the other wrong points in this book? That's enough for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"I could not finish this book. It was ridiculous. I am a Conservative Christian wife and mother. But, this puts all of life's emphasis on the husband and making the marriage complete. We are nothing if we do not have God first in our lives. Our hopes, and dreams should be God centered - not husband centered. A man can add to your happiness, but he is not your happiness. We must put God first, always. Single women are no less than married ones. God gave all of us the ability to reason and think... so, must a man reason and think about his actions and life (just as I do)... Beware of this book - very damaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"some truth is hard to digest","review":"This book offers some hard to digest truths. Many people may write negative reviews about this book but if you really try these approaches to marriage, you can't deny, they work! This book is for the woman who is at the end of her rope in her relationships. She has to be willing to lay aside all preconceived ideas about marriage and try it another way. Simply put, this book is for the woman who is willing to put her marriage first. There is such joy and peace in finding your place. I hope every woman finds the gold nuggets in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Hogwash","review":"The advice in this book is wrong, so wrong. As wives we are not helping our husbands if we let them throw trash for us to pick up, let them threaten us, berate us, use and abuse us. I choose to be a woman of dignity. I honor my husband, he honors me. We are equal and happily married for going on 14 years, hope it's at least 60 more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book for any marriage!","review":"Very good book for marriage. . will help through the tough times and teach you how to be a better help meet... talks about a couple things I disagree with hence the four stars. . . but I own it and love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!","review":"Mrs. Pearl has some good advice here... but unfortuantely the book is mired in much of the Pearl's doctrinal views to be of any good help to those with troubled marriages. She places the weight and burden of the entire marriage on the wife. No study on the one verse that husbands should \\"love their wives as Christ loves the Church\\" type of advice. I found Mrs. Pearl to be insensitive to those with legitimate problems and flippant or legalistic towards those who disagree or contradict their views. There are far better books to read if you want to improve your marriage... this book only stirs up debate and controversy."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes","review":"I guess it depends on your frame of reference, your personality type, the way you view yourself, your husband, the world, and who God really is, to some degree.A lot of women in these reviews as well as women I know were falling all over themselves to get a copy of this book. When someone gave me one I could not wait to get it out of the house after I'd read it.A few good points. The best was her breakdown of the 3 types of men. Mine is definitely a steady and I intend to remember, pray about and learn more about my man and how to be the best wife to him.Ms. Pearl speaks with a chilling lack of compassion, and I am hard pressed to find grace anywhere in her teaching. Some women are apparently not bothered by this; others for whatever reason don't even appear to notice it. If chauvanistic men (and women), bad marriages and mean husbands really get on your nerves, find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If he hits you, keep quiet.

Wait until your oldest daughter can take care of the pile of siblings, and only if he says it's ok.You want to remember you exist, and would like others to respect you and treat you with dignity?

I wouldn't say Debi Pearl is gospel, but simple things from this book that I've implemented have been helpful :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh please, look around","review":"A book that actually works for once.

However, I thought this one was written in a completely different style, almost making it seem like it wasn't the same author. I thought it was written as an amateur would write. I found it more boring than the others in the series and it did not seem to have a plot. I will continue to read the others in the series, but I hope they are better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF TRAVEL AND OF COOKING!!!","review":"I found this book to be so helpful in planning my vacation. The listings are comprehensive, the descriptions fun and substantive, and the recipes are spectacular! Even if you don't want to take a cooking vacation (but I'm betting you will after reading this book) you will still enjoy taking a mental vacation as you read it. Cooking in Paradise combines the best of travel and cooking writing in a unique, creative way. Great gift for those planning a honeymoon or a romantic getaway, too. The food of love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made, Annoying Label","review":"When I took this strainer out of the package, it had a sticker label with a bar code & product info, across the back. I couldn't take the sticker off all the way; it left pieces here and there, which were a real pain to remove all the way.This strainer looks really flimsy and cheaply made. Doesn't seem like something that will last very long.Also, it doesn't fit 100% perfectly into my Schumann Boston shaker, which is a bit disappointing.Aside from all that, I was able to make a few descent Manhattan cocktails with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"love it. deserves repeted listens and time in order for it to breathe.

I had never heard of this group and was intrigued by the weird title. Apparently He Poos Clouds is the 2nd studio album for a Welsh Indie Rock band and when it was initially released Pitchfork Media and Allmusic wrote very positive reviews. I can only agree with this assessment. The sound is quite different and to me it sounds like a mix between avant-garde and experimental music and a bit psychadelic rock. The booklet contains all the lyrics but the selection of font make it hard to read. We also get a very informative list of whom plays what on album. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"words don't quite do this justice","review":"But I'll try. Take a stack of superb Strayhorn compositions/arrangements, add discordant twists from Ellington's piano and from the band (almost certainly at Duke's behest), collective grief at Strayhorn's early demise (he was barely fifty), and a band rich in great musicians. Johnny Hodges is the ballad player nonpareil and has plenty to play on this record. Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet decorates many of these tracks in a way Ellington had not often tried. And the Duke drives it all home on the piano; he is the master of meaningful dissonance. Nothing cute here, just a fearlessly emotional and rich recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ellington Album of All Time","review":"This is a simply amazing recording of a very emotional session devoted to Strayhorn's music. The solos by Johnny Hodges are outstanding and deeply moving, especially on \\"Day-dream\\". The liner notes are pretty interesting too. Anyone who likes Ellington, but doesn't own this album is missing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, horrible recording","review":"Let me say it again: the one star is for the CD recording, not for the music. Ellington, his men, and Strayhorn's compositions are peerless. In fact, Ellington's arrangement of the last song Strayhorn ever wrote, \\"Blood count,\\"(with a heart-breaking solo by Billy's close friend, Johnny Hodges) is alone almost worth the price of the album.However, I can't believe they let this recording out of the factory. In every cut, the trombone section is so badly mic-ed, and the trombone solos so faint, that it almost sounds like a music minus one recording--seriously minus. And at times, the piano is so loud it sounds like the rest of the band is in the room next door.I've never heard the original release, so, I don't where the problem is. But somehow I can't imagine that the studio engineers would have created a such a faulty master. I'm gong to look for a copy of the vinyl."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad release of a great album","review":"I first heard this album on an audio cassette I borrowed from the library more than ten years ago, and it's been my favorite Ellington/Strayhorn music since.Unfortunately this release of ...and His Mother Called Him Bill is terrible. The first CD I received could not be played past Track 8, and the replacement Amazon sent me had errors from Track 13 until the end. Neither disc has any visible damage.I recommend ...and His Mother Called Him Bill if you like Ellington, but find another version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerds unite to watch this movie","review":"If you hate the world or don't understand what direction we're headed and escape into movies to avoid pain, you should realize you're not alone. Watch this movie or you're a nerd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"I love film, but I really didn't understand what this film was about. It follows a quintet of New Yorker film buffs but instead of painting their infatuation as romantic and wonderous, it reveals them as entirely disfunctional individuals who don't contribute anything, live on disability, and suffer from mental illness.I was hoping for more of a homage to film from the perspective of maybe it's most educated and animated viewers, instead of such a personal look into the lives of such a sad group of lonely adults living in poverty on the edge of eviction.If it was the intention of the filmmakers to illustrate avid film buffs as hopelessly depressed OCD patients, then I have to ask.. What's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"The blu-ray captures the concert experience with amazing detail.

The sound quality is excellent. The video also looks very good, very clear and with some nice touches of editing and effects on occasion to spice things up. I am a little curious as to why 2 of the tracks are relegated to the special features, but that was an editorial decision. The show focuses on a selection of the band's hits and tracks from AYNIN. Concert staples \\"White Lines\\" and \\"Careless Memories\\" make for a very energetic back-to-back in the middle of the show. Also, the bonus feature with the band talking about their 2011 is a nice bonus, and goes nicely with the bonus interview segments from the AYNIN bonus dvd.Tastefully done and entertaining. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the band this August!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DURAN DURAN YAY!!!","review":"I've been a Duranie since way back in the early 80z and for me, that love of this band and the music has never waned...and actually has grown over all these years.

I was a bit disappointed in the choice of songs but then I got over it 'cos really, HOW many times do I have to hear and see Simon Lebon sing Save A Prayer, even if it is my favourite song?

This is even better then the audio version for the sound and the extra songs which never made the cut for the CD. I highly recommend this for Duran Duran fans who have been following them from the beginning & for the new generation of music listeners. My favorites performed on it are \\"Planet Earth\\", Careless /memories\\", A View To A Kill\\" & \\"Rio\\". A interesting number is when they do \\"Wild Boys\\" and mix in Frankie Goes To Hollywood's \\"Relax\\" in the song. The bonus material features a documentary / interviews & bonus tracks \\"Come Undone\\" (my wife's favorite DD song) & \\"Is There Someone I Should Know\\".

Clare Oliver's contribution to Scholastic's \\"Artists In Their Time\\" series does not sugar-coat or contradict the reality of that life, one of frequent reclusion and alcohol addiction but also containing periods of both failure and success. It also does its best to make the abstract expressionist movement understandable and accessible to young readers without passing any sort of judgment on its merit. Instead, the reader is given a clear picture of the place Pollock's innovations held in the history of art. Background information on the era in which Pollock lived and worked is helpful, but not intrusive. Illustrations are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and flat","review":"Let me start out by saying that I've only read the MEK title of this compilation so this review is not based on Reload... However i have read some of Ellis's other short story works and they all seem to wallow in the same pit.I am not going to go into the story details as the previous reviews cover this well enough. Mek is derivative, unoriginal, uninspired and full of instances of poorly executed and unneeded violence that does more to take away from the story then to enhance it. The cyber world Ellis creates is one of countless others seen in countless other books movies and comics. The protagonist is boring and has virtually no likable qualities. The dialogue is cookie cutter at best, and the plot reads like something out of a choose your own adventure book. The book tries to be a political metaphor, a mystery, a revenge story, and a cautionary tale all at once but succeeds only being juvenile.Just avoid this... There are literally thousands of better stories then this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"Reload is basically a spy/thriller type of story. Cue one assassination and one dead president. The story works back from there as to why it happens, and who did it.A man tasked to find the killer has to decided whether or not the assassin is in the right, given what he finds out, and the various politics motivations of the different parties in the book.Mek is a cyberpunk story, at its heart.

This isn't an epic tome of a read, but several short stories that make reading it an effortless joy. Each story contains a Scottish character with some athletic prowess. What happens to each character as the stories unfold is both amusing and touching, with great twisty endings that just make you want to read the next wee gem.Although the characters are fictional, they are totally believable. The first story I read, \\"Isabel Mc Glashlin\\" had me absolutely convinced I was reading a true story!If you have any Scottish blood in you then read this book.

I also get the feel the author and Mr. Zaffis are very sincere and interested in helping people.However, the writing and the vocabulary used are almost obnoxiously dramatic and flowery. This would be a much more effective book if it were written in a more matter-of-fact style.For example: \\"The antediluvian ceremoney started and it would not be long before the tyrannical force of doom would surface.\\" What? This is not a comic book and should not read like one.

The triality symmetry of octonion, which is fully discussed in Cartan's book is discussed briefly in the appendix. Since the notation of the Dirac spinor is not used in the book, it is not straightforward to interpret the formulae in the language of the field theory, but it contains helpful ideas for understanding symmetries of the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement parts not available","review":"I purchased the XLAUTO2 a couple of weeks ago.

In this film, the mail train robbery takes place before the opening credits, and the loot is hidden in an empty grange hall that soon becomes the new home of St. Trinian's girls' school. The next hour is spent setting the stage for the final 20 minutes of slapstick chase as the robbers, school girls and school administrators each try to claim the loot (or the reward) in a high speed chase with steam locomotives along the rails. American viewers may not understand all of the British dialogue on the first viewing, but the closing chase is all visual. I feel it is the film's finish that elevates it from three to four stars. Although I agree that adult activities dominate the plot, the students do determine the outcome more than another reviewer gives them credit for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worlds apart: the story of the Methodenstreit","review":"This excellent book is a must for anyone interested in the historical roots of the dominant economic school today (noeclassical economics) and how it shares foundations with sociology.

However, due to fundamental disagreements pertaining on how to study this phenomenon, economics and sociology separated in the 19th century (the methodenstreit) read all about why and how these schools mnow wide apart maybe are reuniting in a neoinstitutional framework. This book is really well-written by one of the really great authorities in social network research: Richard Granovetter.

Plus, a few things in between. You'll even find hints of electronica in a couple of spots, but the album flows smoothly.These were Dee Dee's final studio recordings. He sang lead vocals on two songs, played guitar and did background vocals. Unfortunately, he passed away before the record was finished, so the band recorded the song \\"Dee Dee Deceased\\" to say farewell in their own punk fashion.Don't let disappointments like The Ramainz, Dee Dee King or Marky and the Backing Band of the Week keep you away from this one.

Both stars go to Tom Hanks performance, the rest of the movie is a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Film Tom Hanks Will Be Remembered For...","review":"Of all the great movies I've seen this year, Cast Away is easily the best. There are so many little touches that it will take multiple viewings to catch them all, and maybe a lifetime to understand them. The casual mood of the film, with hardly any dialog or music, bring alive the sense of aloneness and loss of being a lone castaway on a deserted island. There is a good chance that Tom Hanks will win yet another Oscar for Best Actor, because this is his best work ever. He literally has to carry the entire film by himself, and he does it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie","review":"I was very surprised to see such striking criticisms of the movie by viewers here. I thought Cast Away was great, another outstanding performance in a long line of great performances by Tom Hanks. I felt the isolation that his character felt and loved the statement the movie made about the current American society and how it is \\"GO GO GOOO!!\\" for the things in life that do not really matter that much while not paying deserving attention to the things that do matter. This was the best movie of 2000 in my opinion. If you are the big Tom Hanks fan this is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful idea","review":"This is a good movie to be sure. To fully enjoy it you have to suspend any disbelief you might have of what would have really happened to Tom Hanks on that island. Example - severe vitamin deficiencies, major diseases....it really doesn't matter. It's just about the enjoyment of this movie. Hanks does a superb job and the physical transformation he goes through is simply stunning. I thought only DeNiro could make his body change that much! This movie is one to see on the big screen with an audience. You really catch the full effect of the hardships that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Gilligan when you need him?","review":"This movie is about 20 minutes too long. It drags, is uneven, and really goes nowhere. The one unique thing about it that I'll say is that when Hanks is first marooned on the island, there is never any musical score, thus giving you the feeling of his isolation. Very good and very haunting. Otherwise, there is no real explanation why he would stay on the island so long without trying to escape. An ok film, but not one that you'd want to watch again anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want that diet!","review":"Want to maximize profits? Publish the diet Tom Hanks had to go on to trim down for his \\"after\\" scenes. Other than that... it was okay.

But all in all, a mindless evening in front of the tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best And The Most Touching Movie Ever Since Braveheart!","review":"Once again, Tom Hanks gives his most powerful and pivotal performance in this well-directed movie! It's like watching Braveheart, but with a softer side and a different theme. I was amazed at how this film was made. This movie gives us a sense of inspiration and hope. At the end of this movie, or the climax I should say, I was in tears knowing that Chuck Noland had lost his one and only girl. Even my girlfriend has to calm me down! Ridiculeous, isn't it? And after the movie was over, I left the theater in a state of speechless. From the director who gave you the Back To The Future Trilogy, this is one damn \\"bloody-marvellous\\" movie not to be missed again and again. Kudos and two thumbs up for this film, which was directed by, none other than, Robert Zemeckis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - lots of fluff","review":"The Story, Graphics, Music, and Stars (all two of them, and one of them was appearently a very emerging actor that was rumored to have been contracted to act for the movie for $14.95) in any event, the movie is a must-see and will leave anyone who has enough time (2h 20m) with a sense of contentment that is harder and harder to get from movies these days. However, the 'Bonus' featues that load up the 2-Disc collectors set are a different story. They seem to be there just to take up space. Most are boring, not relevent, and way too long. A couple of the documentaries were intresting, but mainly a bunch of fluff. The bottom line is that unless you are a collector or something of the sort, buy just the 1-Disc edition with just the movie to save money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was.

I would not think you could keep my attention through the end with someone stuck on a island but, it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Original, Captivating Experience","review":"Cast Away, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks, is one of the best pictures of 2000. Tom Hanks plays Chuck Nolan, a 40-year-old FedEx employee who is stranded on a desert island after a plane crash. This means that Tom Hanks basically IS 2/3 of Cast Away, acting all by himself with very little dialogue. This movie captivated me, watching how \\"Chuck\\" went from a workaholic average American to a Pacific islander over a period of several years psychologicaly AND phyiscally. Cast Away is a feircely imaginative movie, completly gripping and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Film","review":"Cast Away was a fine ilm. The acting by Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt was wonderful, and the plot was great. There were lots of messages in this film as well. Tom Hanks plays a character who works for Fed Ex. One night he has to go on an airplane to deliver packages...and it crashes. Luckily, Tom Hanks survives the crash and ends up on a deserted island, where he has to learn to fend for himself. Some of the Fed Ex packages arrive on the shore, and Tom uses what is inside to help him survive. With no one but himself, and Wilson, a volleyball with a hand imprint on it, Tom's character learns that in life you never take things for granted, and live each day with hope, because each new day brings new possibilities. The ending was a little sad, but it made sense and worked out. The film was a little long, but to fit all that into it, it had to be. Cast Away was certainly a fine film for everyone to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than what I expected...","review":"In Cast Away, although I must admit that I had great expectations about Tom Hanks' acting, I did not expect to find the inspiration that I did. Robert Zemeckis has surpassed himself so greatly that when you get out of the theatre you will forgive him for making Contact, Forest Gump and What Lies Beneath. Tom Hanks has once more given a performance that will literally touch your soul. Even though I had not been that excited by the trailer, when the movie ended I was left speechless. It is true that on those rare occasions that Hollywood tries it can still create magic. Furthermore, what else can I say but the fact that Tom Hanks can hold a film together all by himself. He will be definitely a favourite among the Oscar nominees this year. Oh, and by the way do not expect a common ending...P.S: All those who love good cinema must definitely NOT lose this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly boring ...","review":"Tom Hanks is a great talented actor. No doubt about that. He's great in Forrest Gump, Sleepless in Seattle, Big, Apollo 13... and lots more. But Cast Away is a waste of talent, seriously.The story is about Tom Hanks as a Federal Express officer who was very dedicated to his job. One night the flight that he took crashed in the middle of nowhere and he was the only survivor. And for the remaining of the movie, we'll see Tom Hanks talking to a volleyball named Wilson and making fire. He managed to get lots of stuff by opening the sealed packages that were to be delivered if not for the crash. Strangely, he spared one for no clear reason. I guess it was done so for the ending.The movie started well, but lost its direction. Some people may be able to endure watching Tom Hanks alone on an island for a couple of hours, but most people will find it dead boring.Story apart, the discs are well packaged, but I could not see why one wants to watch the movie more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Hanks, WHAT were you thinking?","review":"I've watched almost every movie that Tom Hanks has starred in, I think he's that great. But... Why did he ever choose to appear in this God-forsaken movie about a God-forsaken deserted island? And all that dieting he did... He could have spent that much effort in a whole lot better in a better movie.It's a stupid Robinson Crusoe movie with a stupid plot. Hanks salvages the movie and makes it watchable with his exceptional talent, but not much more.Tom, why don't you switch your agent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HYPE HYPE","review":"The crash scene was unbelievable , I found myself bored after the first hour.

There is a well acted scene by Tom Hanks where he gets very excited about the fire he builds. The rest of the dialogue is with Wilson the volleyball. There was a moment that held my interest briefly when he casted Wilson away after realizing his situation in talking with a volleyball but soon retrieves it. \\"Wake me when he's off the island,\\" is what some of you may say.The third act doesn't get much better. I almost quit watching it but thought that it may redeem itself with a cool ending...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"Perfect Storm\\" That Drowns The Viewer","review":"Tom Hanks is one of my all-time favorite actors, and when I heard how incredible he was in this incredible film, my boyfriend and I rented it on DVD. We were both very disappointed. I won't give away the ending to those who want to see it, but let me put it this way: 1. The only thing good about the film is the great computer graphics. 2. Helen Hunt appears, disappears for four years, then returns, and we have NO idea what happened to her in between. 3. The acting is more humorous than serious or dramatic. I laughed more than anything watching this. 4. The ending is dumb. But these are my opinions. Hopefully others will think the movie is as great as it was blown up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Tom Hanks but this movie was horrible!","review":"My wife and I watched this together and both have very different tastes in movies, we both agreed this was one of the most boring thoughtless movies ever made.

Just my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something went wrong","review":"Could have been a good film, but something went terribly wrong. I think the screenwriter had alot of internal dialogue that he forgot to share with the audience. Long, long, very long stretches of silence and \\"meaningful glances\\" that are disconnected from the action. The relationships are fuzzy and never come to a conclusion, it's all left hanging ... the woman artist on the ranch, the former lover now married to someone else, the widowed best friend, even his relationship with his job. It's a movie about a personal journey that leads the viewer nowhere. The trailer shows the best of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow-moving movie with badly written characters","review":"After 30 minutes into the movie I was hoping Tom Hanks would starve or suffer from eating something poisonous. This movie didn't engage me at all. I had no respect for the main character. I did not feel connected at all. The tv-show Survivor had more drama in it !!Now for something that really bothered me : why the hell did he hold on to the last box for so long !! They could have saved the movie by having him open the box after coming back to the civilised world and having it contain a letter-bomb !!!Tom Hanks should be ashamed of himself. He played this role like he played most others. Just by loosing 30 pounds, doesn't make you a good actor, Mr. Hanks.If you want to see a good, spiritual Zemeckis film try Forrest Gump or Contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've been Cast Away","review":"WHAT A BORING MOVIE! Tom Hanks character was not likable. There was no emotion whatsoever. This was one script that should've been Cast Away. Only 1 star and that star goes to Lari White, the country singer who play the Angel sculptress. Shame on Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt for accepting the roles in this poor poor pitiful me story. If they had reversed some of the story by doing flashbacks with developing the relationship between Hunt and Hanks would have brought some emotion to the movie and made it somewhat enjoyable. I saw this for free is a sneak preview and my time was wasted. I like Tome Hanks and Helen Hunt and they are two of my favorite stars today. Oh well life goes on doesn't it Wilson?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Tom Hanks is wonderful as always, but this is one of the worst movie scripts ever written. Nothing happens! Everything that kind of happens is trite and predictable. There was a lot of potential here, but they just wasted it on a crappy script. I also could have done with a few less shots of the stupid FedEx logo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost and Found","review":"Whats so great about this film is that one actor can carry the whole thing on his shoulders and make you give a damn. Hanks is a wonderfully talented actor who proves that here with what I believe to be his finest performance to date. As Fed-X employee Chuck, Hanks is stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash and is left to fend for himself woth no one to keep him company but a ball named Wilson for four years. Watching him survive may not sound like watchable entertainment but it is, it truly is, and when he's finially able to make it home your cheering for him because you feel like you know him and you missed him and your so happy he made it out alive. Hanks proves that he is one of our generations finest leading men and this film goes down as one of my favorites for that very reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally brilliant","review":"I never would have guessed Cast Away could deliver such good emotion. The fact that the film starts off with so much human activity and communication which leads into Tom Hanks on an island by himself with hardly any voices being heard at all makes this a really great story.On an island by yourself having to do whatever it takes to survive can be a serious struggle, and that's what the film is about- trying to find ways to survive. I love everything about this movie. I would love to see it again. I recommend this film to just about everyone. Even if you're a fan of horror movies, take a break from that and watch this great movie. It's not a horror flick obviously, but it's worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The extras are almost as good as the movie.","review":"I really like this movie. It says to me that after times of very severe troubles, there is still the possibility of a good life.The extras show how this movie is made, and they reveal where special effects were used, and in some cases, where the special effects (at least to me) looked seamlessly real.This movie shows how good an actor Mr. Hanks is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Blu Ray version like the plague","review":"The transfer of this wonderful movie is pitiful, Fox should be ashamed of ripping off their loyal customers with these poor quality Blu Ray Movies. This movie is not even that old. It looks grainy, the blacks are off and the lines are blurry at times. DO NOT BUY, THE DVD LOOKS BETTER. I do not think I will buy a Fox movie until they start remastering and get their act together, perhaps if enough people stop buying, they will start releasing these masterpieces in a quality format."},{"rating":"1","title":"castaway","review":"Had to stop halfway through due to an emergency.

I am a sucker for happy ending. The ending could have been done better...The crash scene was very well film. The acting was superb all around. The film was all Tom Hanks. He was either going to make it or break the film. Going with Tom, was the smart move. I was expecting more from Helen Hunt. Could have use any female actor to do that role and save some bucks there. It is a THUMBS UP! Got to have for your Tom Hanks' collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie Tom Hanks has ever been in","review":"Robert Zemeckis, Academy Award winning director for Forest Gump, and Tom Hanks, the Academy Award winner for Best Actor for Forest Gump, teamed up again for this epic drama. Tom Hanks plays a FedEx employee named Chuck who is stranded on a deserted island after the plane he was on crashes. Over the span of four years Chuck is on the island, until he devises a plan to get off of the island and return home. The drama between Chuck and his lone \\"companion\\", a volleyball he calls Wilson, is heartbreaking when he loses him at sea. In my opinion this is Tom Hanks' finest film, he should have gotten Best Actor instead of Russel Crowe, and the special effects when the plane crashes are great as well. Helen Hunt is wasted in her role as Chuck's girlfriend, and I would have liked to see more in depth of how Chuck's character develops on the island, and how he coped with the changes when he got home. All in all though, this is a great movie, and it shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 of 5","review":"There's a great movie in Cast Away. The time in which a Fed Ex worker named Chuck Noland is stranded on an island, most of the movie, is a triumph in movie-making. It puts a single actor on what appears to be a single set for a long time with no real dialogue, other characters to interact with or cuts back to the normal world, and manages to stay both captivating and believable the whole time.Okay, there's one thing that isn't very believable. That has to do with a particular Fed Ex package, one of the few man-made items Chuck has at his disposal. There's also a volleyball, ice skates and not much else. This is a tale of survival in the truest sense. What almost ruins the experience is the epilogue, which lasts for too long and seems irrelevant in comparison to everything that came before it.marcellee.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"Just all in all a great movie.

First I like to say that the sound of this movie is great, but thats (almost)all. The first half hour is one big FedEx commercial. Then there is the plane crash, that one is really great, I think the second best (I think the best is in Final Destination). Only.....you can see that the plane which crashes is a boeing 777, and..............those do NOT crash. I think that Tom Hanks is great, but I think he will never be as good as Forrest Gump."},{"rating":"1","title":"A So-So Film That Could Have Been Great","review":"\\"Castaway\\" is what I consider a flawed film. Sure,the moments on the island are wonderful, but it doesn't hide the factthat the plot and motivation of the movie is weak. Tom Hanks is goodin his role (but has he ever been bad in a movie in the last decade)but the other actors in the film are delegated to underdeveloped minorcharacters. They serve no more purpose than for them to just bethere. It surprises me that this film is so hailed as a cinematicexperience. The script is non-existent, the directing by RobertZemeckis, who has shown his extrodinary talent in other films, ismerely adequate, and an ending which strains credibility. Perhaps thefilm's main problem is that it glosses over the relationships that TomHanks's character has with the other characters with short,unsatisfactory bookends. For me, the film left me thinking there wasa greater film somewhere, but instead, I just saw a film that showedthe highlights."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD would not play","review":"dvd didnt work and would cost more to send it back and get a new one so i just through it awat"},{"rating":"1","title":"No meat...","review":"The only movie Tom stars in which we were dissapointed to see.

Okay. Whatever. But if I had known it was a Fed-Ex commercial, I would have avoided it. Whatever happened to making up company names so that you don't become a SELL-OUT? Go ahead, try to watch this movie and ignore FED-EX continually flashing in your face. Believe me, they did NOT have to do it. All it does is distract and disrupt to make them MORE MONEY that they DON'T NEED. I say: DON'T SEE IT ON PRINCIPLE. This movie isn't good enough to be worth supporting a sell-out. I gave it one star to make a dent in the ratings, but without the Fed-Ex, it's maybe a two & a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I wanted to like this movie. Really I did. It had so much potential. But it was long, boring, and completely unbelieveable. Usually whether or not a movie is believeable doesn't matter to me. But this one just appalled me so much that it was disgusting.The movie started out well... but once the plane crashes and Tom Hanks ends up on the island... well, that's where it all goes downhill. Why? Because it's the most boring thing ever to be put on screen. There isn't even any music to keep you going. It's just Tom Hanks on an island. Where's the entertainment in that?My other big problem with this film is in the ending, and I think I'll refrain from discussing that here, just in case someone reads this and still wants to see the movie. I don't like to ruin movies for people--even if they're bad movies.I do agree that Tom Hanks did a good job with this movie.

Whether it's 2 years, 4 years or 10 years, you can tell by looking at the character that a lengthy period has elapsed.Actually, considering how our society needs it's information simplified and spoon-fed, I should be happy it wasn't worse. There could have been an off screen narrator.\\"Now children, Mr. Noland has been on the island a LOOOOOOONG time and has grown very skinny.\\"The audience should be trusted to reach some conclusions on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong beginning-- What the hell happened after that?","review":"I have always been a big fan of Tom Hanks because it seems he reads the scripts presented to him before accepting roles. In this movie, it appears Tom only read the first 80 pages or so then signed on the dotted line. This movie had so much potential to be a modern version of Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" as Hanks' character left civilization and became the savage that had to adjust to normal society. In its roots, Castaway achieves the \\"savage\\" element of \\"Brave, New World\\" in the first hour. And what a first hour it is. We celebrate when Hanks' character discovers fire and wince when he injures himself. It is in his struggle that we can appreciate his battle to survive against the elements. After that first hour, however, it seems Castaway loses sight of its original goal. Hanks' character seems to have no problem adjusting to life and then the movie ends. I think Castaway could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cast Away....I agree...Cast It Away !","review":"I was definately NOT impressed with this movie whatsoever. I think it could have been done a different way and been an ok movie but it wasn't Over half of the movie is him alone on an island doing absolutely nothing and looking horrific.I could actually smell him stinch when watching.

I thought this movie was one of the worst produced movies available today for purchase. Tom Hanks at his worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"First of all I would like to warn you","review":"I thought that this movie was terrible. Why? Well, the movie went nowhere, told us nothing, and was nothing but one guy talking to a volleyball. Sound exciting? I mean, even if you like Tom Hanks it wouldn't bring up the quality of the movie. The sustaining forces of this movie were Wilson, the infamous volleyball, and the \\"undelivered package,\\" which really means nothing held it together. Now, obvioulsy I do not recommend this movie to you, but I do agree that you should at least see it once, and maybe that friend you have that says they \\"like\\" it will show it to you for free.

If I could give it two and a half stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie, annoying script and actors.","review":"Just not a good movie. Starts off okay but once Hanks is on the island for a while it just becomes uninteresting. And once he returns to civilization it gets even more boring. Finally, the ending is pathetically bad.

Helen Hunt is brutal in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cast Away is one of the best movies in 2000\\"","review":"Cast Away is one of the best movies in 2000 and so much better than \\"Gladiator\\" which was so boring.

Faced with the challange of having to act through most of the movie with only himself, a volleyball and the brutalities of nature, he pulled it off miraculously.From the moment he is stranded on that deserted island, you're there with him, feeling every pain and every frustration he feels. You feel every joy and every sense of excitement when he finally cracks that coconut open and when he finally creates a roaring fire. How good that cooked crab must taste!When Hanks develops his personal relationship with his volleyball, Wilson, suspension of disbelief is not necessary. You buy all of it, because you only need to image for a moment the madness and the yearning to talk to someone (or something) one must have to endure to survive on an island for four years."},{"rating":"1","title":"No refunds on instant.","review":"Tried to rent the instant video tonight.

His acting range is great for this role. I compare it to Saving Private Ryan, Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. Picture/Audio quality are just above average on blu-ray. Worth a buy because of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK but a little long!","review":"This film could have been a lot shorter and than I would have liked it more. As usual Tom Hanks is great and does an excellent perfomance once he lands on the island. However, there are a few flaws in this movie that could have been approached differently. For example the scene at the end of the movie was a little to weird for me and not very credible. On the overall scale it does make one appreciate every moment of life as we never know what tomorrow will bring. Unlike \\"The Blue Lagoon\\" filmed years ago this protrays man in a truer sense of abandonment on an Island all alone with no one to talk to. It makes you wonder how he was motivated to get up every morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story...","review":"Cast Away was a very good movie with great action and it would keep you off your seat in the suspenseful parts, but it's a little too long for my liking. Like I said before, it's action-packed in the beginning but in the middle, it sort of became a little boring. Without any human contact, Chuck (Tom Hanks) was by himself, all alone ont the island without any sort of dialouge. Maybe the directors could put in some Indian Tribes to spice it up a bit. I reccomend it to anyone who likes the idea of survival."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"The movie is about a guy that gets stranded on a desert island: that's a new concept!! If you didn't see any of the other 200,000 movies about guys alone, or with beautiful girls, or with a group of people that turn cannibals when stranded on a desert island, then go see this. I am trying to second guess Zemeckis here and what I think he was thinking was to let the scenery do the talking, let the spectator become the guy on the island. I say this because things happen on the island that I either didn't see or didn't notice and that are explained in a brief monologue toward the end of the movie. What I like the most about the movie is definitely the island. An unbelievable place, a desolate, out of this world beauty and a prison from which there is (almost) no excape. I suppose if you have the latest progressive scan TV technology or a 40k projector and screen you can probably add this CD to your collection and file under exotic vacations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Only 3-1/2 Stars","review":"Well, let me start by saying I like Tom Hanks, but I'm not a really huge fan of his. This movie, for me, was only average. I could have written this storyline, and I'm no professional writer. The time spent on the island was OK, but I kept on looking for more. Once off the island, the movie really drags. It could have been easily shortened up by at least 20 minutes with no loss whatsoever. The film ends abruptly, as if they didn't know how to really finish it. This movie badly needs more suspense, more action. As it is, it will appeal only to the diehard Tom Hanks follower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the marooned films","review":"I have seen a lot of \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" type movies in my lifetime. Most of them are usually quite dissapointing in the aspect of realism. Not this one.Too many of these island survival films feature unlikely creature comforts; like gorgeous native girls treating you like a king, or building a 5-room tree house with only a pocket knife.This movie remains primitive, gritty and realistic throughout. It is not a \\"how to\\" survival movie, but just shows one man's plight that living alone on an island is not only unglamorous, but could lead to ones insanity.Tom Hanks does a swell job here, including achieving weight loss to show a malnourished effect of island hardship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vote This Video Out Of Your VCR","review":"Tom Hanks is a great actor, but watching him talk to himself for all that time almost made me wish he had hung himself in the movie, which should have saved me at least a good 35 minutes of my life wasted watching this movie. It was a good concept, but the final execution of watching Hanks and Wilson the Volleyball survive all those years on the island to have the moral of the story be that time marches on whether your around or not...let's just say it was a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie from start to finish","review":"This is an excellent story, told in a way you don't see very often these days. Once Hanks is stranded you are stranded with him too, and you live through him for the time he is there.

If this dilema had been the meat of the movie, then it may have been a testament to the an individual's drive to live. However, since this story line was excluded, the viewer walks away with a vague sense that he spent about a week on the island, and other than getting sick of raw fish, wasn't that big of a deal.And what the heck was up with that ending?

It was your typical stranded on a desert island story. Man loves girl, man gets stranded on desert island, man is found in sea by boat, man has lost girl. The only 'cute' difference in this movie was the many tools that the castaway invented from the various things he found in unopened Fed Express packages.

Then Tom Hanks takes off solo. Now I acknowledge that Tom Hanks is a good actor, but an hour of him on an island is enough to make your skin crawl with anxiety to either rescue him to get other actors on the screen or kill him off. Sadly, by the time he gets back to the real world, the story sinks into a mire of sap that will threaten the loss of your ocular mobility from over rolling of the eyes. I would assume that the intent of the film is to leave you with a wonderous sense of his spiritual change during his time of isolation, but instead, he just became a boring and slightly unbalanced twit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, so I am the only one...","review":"Maybe it is just me, but this movie bored the hell out of me. And this is a movie fan who has seen Gone With the Wind, The Magnificent Ambersons, and countless other movies a lot of people consider long and boring, more times than I can count. It was a good concept that did not follow through in my opinion. He is stuck on a deserted island and nothing else happens. No fights for his life with native wildlife, nothing. Maybe that sounds shallow but I guess a movie with someone just doing nothing is not my cup of tea. I sat through it to say that I did, and regret the lost hours of my life. I supose long time fans of Tom Hanks may like it, but his superstar attitude after Forrest Gump made me sick so I am not really a fan of his.I did not care for the acting, the writing, or anything about this movie but the initial premise.

I guess that what decides it for me is that the theme of boy meets volleyball, boy falls in love with volleyball, boy loses volleyball is a bit overdone.

My main concern would be the forced ending. It was, in my opinion, not worked out fully. This had nothing to do with Hanks or Hunt, to be sure.Still, Cast Away looks good and realistic (except for the computer-made fish). I thought the crash of the plane worthy of special mention. But after Hanks got off the island, things went 'somewhat wrong'.Well, not wasted time, and I'm sure a lot of people have and will like it.

Very exciting start when the plane went down, but very laughable to find out that Tom Hanks was able to survuve the crash from 20-25,000 feet. Now, this was not reality, but come on. Then it becomes a sleeper until the last 15 minutes when Hanks dialogue becomes more believable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"People raved about this movie and the previews for it looked awesome. Then I made the mistake of wasting good money to see it at the cinema. I just kept waiting for this movie to take off and it never did. Sure, the plane crash was exciting and I cried when he lost Wilson, but the whole storyline just seemed to drag on and I kept waiting for it to pick up and tie together all the loose ends. Maybe I'm just a product of the Hollywood machine and a sucker for happy endings, but I really felt let down by this movie - I had expected so much more!Don't waste your money buying this movie. If you feel you have to see it, then head out to Blockbuster and rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too slow, didn't live up to the hype!","review":"The previews looked great for this one, but it really was disappointing. I watched it with some friends and we all sat around waiting for it to end...it dragged on for some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom away","review":"With this DVD, discover the unforgettable journey of hope, courage and survival. Tom Hanks gives one of his most commendable performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed-Ex system engineer whose plane crashes somewhere over the South Pacific, near an isolated island that's twice the size of Texas. He struggles to survive and finds his own personal journey has only just begun...A pretty in-your-face action epic adventure which will be appreciated by all age groups above teenagers (inclusive). For those who seek the new Robinson Crusoe journey on DVD will relish this exquisite work of art by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt, this movie has the smallest cast ever, I think, since most of the movie focuses on Tom Hanks. Apart from that, there are only about 5 other characters.I give this film 4 stars. Enjoy. Kick back, put your feet up, tuck under a nice electric blanket, and turn up the volume, cos' you'll be casted away till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, predictable, like a big screen saver.","review":"Tom Hanks saves this film. Quite a bit of the problem I had watching the DVD (I did not see it in theaters) is that the plot is so incredibly simple that it has been completely given away in even the simplest of commercials. I was hoping to see much 'more' in the movie, but felt like I was watching a very long rerun even though I had never seen it before.Helen Hunt is nothing special in this film, could have been anyone in that role. The actress in the truck at the end of the film showed more acting ability.Luckily, the kids were sound asleep and I had the time to kill. It was good, but I should have rented instead of bought. Several shots on the island were spectacular, but they were sandwiched between average shots.The themes were exactly what you expect. Don't live by the clock, live to your real priorities, don't give up, blah blah. Great messages, but was not executed well enough to be the foundation of a film. They seemed trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been even better!","review":"After seeing this film my first thought at the end of the movie was, \\"thats it\\". I thought it could have been a little longer to tell a better story. I'm not sure if it was the lack of dialog in the movie, or if my expectations were to high, but I was a little disappointed. I thought it could of been much better. Now, I'm not saying the movie is bad, its far from it, I'm just saying I was hoping for more. Tom Hanks gives an oscar worthy presentation once again, and its basically just him throughout the whole movie. I think that if film makers weren't constricted to how long they could make a movie, I think this would have been twice as long, that way they could of told a much better, in depth story. It felt like they cut corners in certain parts of the film, particularly with the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm.. I musta missed the point.","review":"Ive been a long time Tom Hanks fan. Great guy, great actor. I went into see this movie with fears and concern over the fact that supposedly most of his screen time was gonna be him silently moping his way around a deserted island. I was completely bored through almost the whole movie, constantly checking my watch for the time. The only emotion I felt at all, was when he made friends with the volleyball, and they had that split up in the ocean.. that emotion, was happiness! I found myself laughing out loud over the fact that the maker's of this movie actually thought a man/volleyball relationship would affect a audience. Just take this movie with a grain of salt, try to enjoy it, and lets put this Hanks horror behind us and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"What an incredible movie that deserves nothing less than five stars. It's a deeply moving and affecting experience. It's very realistic and true-to-life. Hanks is flawless as are his supporting cast. A number of themes come through here including the importance of not taking things for granted. Why do we all feel as though we have to live and die by the clock? Everything we have can be taken away from us at any moment. I enjoyed this movie, strangely enough, considerably more the second time I watched it about three years after its release. It is sooo enjoyable and you are riveted from the instant the plane is in trouble. Zemeckis is a genius and he and Hanks are greatest team in Hollywood ie) Forrest Gump??I believe it's impossible for someone to say they did not enjoy this movie and if it didn't create emotion within yourself then there is something wrong with you This movie IS that good, even though it may be difficult to watch at times. Great, epic movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"cast away is....","review":"Next Sunday,I watched 'cast away'.I think the story is sad and unusual.expressly,Chuck(Tom Hanks) looks poor. so I'm heartbreaking.Anyway, you have time, then watch it, please~~~!If you watch it, it give some imporession to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting","review":"What a great movie. Tom Hanks was brilliant. I couldn't get over how his character grew, changed and adapted right before my eyes. I was elated when he made fire and I was crying when he lost Wilson - how much more can you ask for? Great details, fantastic story, Oscar worthy acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong acting, but some weak points as a movie","review":"It's hard to say enough for Tom Hank's acting. Not to mention the extreme physical changes he put himself through for the part.The storyline was also strong through the early and middle parts of the movie. Some truly great moments of drama and human insight.But the ending gave me the impression that they didn't really know how to wrap up the movie. It's a bad sign when the main character has to finish the movie with a monolog that sums up what he's learned; a better movie would have made you understand without having to spell it out in words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why couldn't he stay on the island.....","review":"Between all the wooden acting that everyone gives in this movie, it was something of a relief when Tom Hanks got to the island, there we had just him and lots of nice outdoor photography to look at. That island had more character then all the human supporting cast members put together in this big budget piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY DIDN'T HE PUT WILSON'S HEAD ON THAT DRESS?","review":"Try as it might to be otherwise, this is still a man-on-a-deserted-island story and there's a lot of campfires and spear fishing going on and a vague life lesson about deserted islands. The surf is much more inviting than the island which remains an unexplored vista. Tom Hanks watching the rolling whitecaps is a haunted, alien scene. Exactly what Hank's character is doing on that cargo plane is anyone's guess. And when will Helen Hunt stop agreeing to anything?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanks is mesmorizing","review":"Tom Hanks is a magnificent actor. Forget the beginning and ending of the movie. Skip to the plane crash and just watch an artist at work as he is stranded on the island. I could have watched hours of Hanks as the castaway. This movie should be required viewing for anyone interested in a career as an actor. This is not the best movie ever made but it is certainly one of the best screen performances to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Special for Me","review":"Having lived in a similar environ for a year -- but with bananas and people -- this film was magical for me. Hanks really put himself out for this film, doing a magnificent and touching performance, and I am grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome adventure movie","review":"This is a great Tom Hanks movie. My favorite of course is Forrest Gump, but this comes in a not so distant second place. It's about a FedEx Delivery man who's plan get's stranded on an island. Very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOMS ISLAND","review":"Another movie Tom Hanks should have gotten an oscar for! I lovedthis movie, when I saw it in the theater in 2000! I thought thestory was great, and the movie was very well made! I still feelthe pain from when he played dentist, with an iceskate! Thismovie really makes you appreciate what you have! Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAST AWAY YOUR FAT ON DESERT ISLAND DIET","review":"Tom Hanks loses 40 odd pounds a deserted South Pacific island. That's about it for plot in this beautiful but ordinary adventure nicely directed by Robert Zemeckis.What one expects from the intentional double meaning two-word title is that our hero experience some kind of spiritual enlightenment from the enforced \\"casting away\\" of civilization's ephemera. But that is not the case here.It's not giving anything away here to say that during his absence he has been declared dead and his fiancee Helen Hunt has married. But since we've recently seen Hunt cavorting on screen with Mel Gibson, Jack Nicholson, Richard Gere and Kevin Spacey among others (apparently while Hanks was island-bound), it should come as no surprise. The two-disc set includes enthusiastic commentary from Zemeckis, a startling featurette on the remarkable and wonderfully invisible digital effects and much more. 143 minutes, PG-13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost made it.","review":"I really don't understand it when people talk about how Tom Hanks didn't speak during the middle portion of this movie. The volleyball was thrown in there to avoid just that. Tom Hanks has a lot of dialoge while on the island. That said, this could have been a great movie, but it fell short. First of all, we all found out that he would get off the island from the preview. That upset me. But after seeing the movie, I understood why this was done...after he gets off the island, the movie is terrible. Zemekis has therefore successfully made two bad movies out of one project. (He made the sub-par What Lies Beneath while Hanks was losing weight) It makes me worry that other good directors might end up doing the same. Next thing you know, Oliver Stone might make a lousy movie...wait a minute, I forgot about U-Turn. Darn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Great one man movie. Tom Hanks does a great job, this must have been very had to do, just Tom and only Tom for most of the movie. Great adventure flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood third act prblems","review":"What could - and should - have been a triumph for Hanks is fatally ruined by one of the poorest third acts ever made. It is difficult to imagine how this happened, unless (as often) there was studio interference. See the movie as far as the end of Hank's raft voyage, then turn off the DVD and imagine how well the writer could have dealt with the main character returning to society"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a great, great film.","review":"I loved CAST AWAY. It's a facinating film about one man (Tom Hanks) leaving his home to go on a plane only to find himself stranded on a deserted island for four years. From beginning 'til the end, you are engrossed to discovering what happpens to Hanks' character. I loved every moment of this film, and Hanks definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. I mean, what's so great about Russell Crowe?! I didn't even really like GLADIATOR all that much. Also, the special effects in this film are just specatular and the storyline is solid and strong. I don't know why but for some reason this film reminds me of THE PERFECT STORM (maybe it's because both have to do with disasters at sea). But this is one film I definitely recommend. I didn't catch it in the theaters, unfortunately. But I watched it on VHS and thought it was just as superb! A must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph of the Human Spirit!","review":"This was an amazing movie -- Hanks is clearly one of the most talented actors ever (The Green Mile, Apollo 13, Saving Private Ryan), and his versatility is unparallelled. Beautiful scenery, a very realistic plot, and masterful editing make this movie outstanding.If you're looking for fast-paced, predictable, \\"cookie-cutter\\" Hollywood fluff, this movie is not for you. But...with a little imagination and an open mind, you may appreciate the movie for what it was intended: Cast Away is hilariously funny, crushingly tragic, occasionally shocking, and above all, a celebration of the triumph of the human spirit against all odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power in Cast Away","review":"Cast Away is a very powerful and emotional film. When I first viewed this film I was taken by the struggles Tom Hanks went through as he lived on a deserted island all by himself for many many years. The hour long silence provided an effective way to build the suspense of the movie. It was amazing to see the transformations that Tom Hanks took both physically and mentally. His one and only companion for so many years was a Wilson volleyball. The most emotional impact took place when his \\"friend\\" was lost at sea. It allows us to come to realize how much we take for granted and how we should appreciate everything we have. It broke my heart to see how he returned home after so many years to find his one true love, played by Helen Hunt, married to another man. To her, it was like he had risen from the dead. This movie was very powerful and I think that everyone should go see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Displaying the Mentalities in a Survival Situation","review":"So much emphasis in today's world is placed on having the right gear, having the best technology and having the best skills available.All of those are useless unless the right mentalities are present. In Cast Away this is ever so present and brings you the non-stop emotion-driven actions taken by Tom Hanks character in order to survive and deal with loss, isolation, frustration and depression, not to mention the physical stresses and injuries which are inflicted throughout the ordeal.From a survival point of view this movie is awesome! Showing the importance of never giving up, having tenacity, audacity and clinging on to life values which drive us to keep going. A difficult situation represented well, having me deep in thought about how to survive the situation presented. A great survival movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast Away","review":"My son has seen this movie several times but wanted it for a Christmas gift. It was one of his favorite gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast Away","review":"If you love Tom Hanks..buy it. Needed more action while he was stranded on the island. Not a strong storyline, but I did enjoy it. I have never watched a show with Tom Hanks in it, that I did Not like! I did like this. Tom Hanks was excellent as always in it and I liked the idea of being alone on an uninhabited tropical island (come on..haven't a lot of you at least wondered what it would be like?!). Glad to add it to my dvd collection and will continue to enjoy it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie.","review":"I liked a lot this movie, it is amazing what Tom Hanks had to put up with in order to get realism to his character. The airplane crash scene is spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fantastic Acting Job","review":"Since such a desert island scenario involves isolation, the plot thus must by its nature involve such boredom as fishing, scavinging for food, etc.Hanks pulls this off superbly. I was surprised that this kept my attention. Was smart enough to realize that the opening scene of the sculpter would be tied into with the FedEx delivery.Wilson was a treat!Ending was well conceived. Left one's mind to the imagination to fill in the blank.Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent screenwriting tool...","review":"This is the ultimate example for the penniless screenwriter/filmmaker to work from. That's the amazing thing, this could've been made by Joe Independent if he was so inclined. Stick a guy on an island for four years, the only other cast member is a volleyball, and chart his progress. You'd have to dump the big-budget plane crash, but that stuff can be remedied. What you'd figure would be boring is actually quite captivating. Forging for food, bad tooth, exploring the island, making fire. Hanks really nailed it for someone who's shoulders it all squarely lied.So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart already:). Just a friendly tip, a great place for screenwriting tips on how to submit is queryletterclinic.com which has a sample query letter, software, and a huge list of production companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewing the product, not the movie","review":"I'm a big, big fan of this movie, so I was excited to get the blu-ray version, thinking it would be beautiful given the subject and location of the film.Sadly, this is a blu-ray in technical format only.

His performance, most especially in the middle portion, was one-dimensional. The beginning was mildly entertaining, highly cliched and predictable. Tom shouts a lot and is generally obnoxious and insensitive. Then he ends up on the island and shouts some more. Hanks' acting technique: if I shout loud and often enough and lose weight, I'm a great actor. We were supposed to see despair, hope, weariness, introspection, anger, frustration and sorrow. What we got was a lot of crazed shouting. Loud and grating, crazed shouting. If you take out the middle portion of this movie, you have a very unoriginal, short mildly entertaining mainstream movie - with the middle, it just plain stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"a serious waste of time","review":"another overblown tom hanks epic. zemeckis lost his touch after the back to the futures/roger rabbit and has continued to spiral downwards. If you would like to watch Tom kill fish and talk to a volleyball for nearly two hours, this movie is for you.The only reason the movie earned 2 stars from me is because I thought that the action sequences on the Fed Ex plane were superb. So, if you know you will like to see Tom kill fish and talk to a volleyball for most of the film, this is for you.P.S.- When I say he talks to a volleyball I mean it.

If you will note I titled this review \\"The Opposite of its promises\\", and the reason being is that, first of all it shows Danny DeVito on the front of the cover as if he is the main character, and yet he barely has a part, posing as the bartender at a pool and is only seen for abot forty five seconds. Also it says it is heart-felt and funny and is none of those things! The actors and actresses do a horrible job posing as their charachter and don't seem to have any depth or feeling at all. If you read the back of the jacket it says that it is about a man with almost no money and many debts to pay off and that he kidnaps a rich man's kids to get money, that is the entire film and it isn't even done well, in fact I've made this putrid film sound much more exciting and dramatic than it is.

It is no doubt one of the worst films ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost musical that should be heard.","review":"SARATOGA may have flopped after 80 performances.

Another doctor has told me that you should never put anything on sensitive or eczema prone skin that the ingredients start with water or alcohol....so I was shocked to see this dermatologist got us to buy a cream that has those two things first in its ingredients.I believe it may help some people, but everyone's skin is different, what works for one person doesn't work for another so keep that in mind when buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Film Making","review":"Everything about this movie does not work.

Although their usual grim themes are the same (extinction, spying, post-War German life, etc.) the music is a bit more poppy and less industrial. The edgyness of \\"We Came to Kill\\" and \\"Thanks for Nothing\\" is pretty much all but gone. Instead, there is a smoother sound, obviously influenced by FV's related projects, Revenous and Fictional. Kind of like Ravenous and Fictional doing covers of Funker Vogt. On the plus side, the lyrics are a bit clearer here, although they are still kind of goofy. FV's live performances of the same material on this CD at their concerts has more of their old sound.

I wonder what had to be cut out of the R-rated version? We're talking \\"after-school special\\" type horror here. The only real cool scene for me is when maggots erupt from the face of a slime-caked corpse. And there's an ok scene where a guy melts down into a puddle of mush. Whatever.

Kinsella may well be the greatest writer of baseball fiction in America. Except for a few lines at the first and the last of the book, this isn't about baseball. W.P. Kinsella is a fine novelist. This book is not really a novel. It is a short story which has been padded until it is novel length. The New York times likens it to the \\"humerous voice of Garrison Keillor.\\" That may well be the cruk of its problem. Kinsella uses a Keilloresque trick of giving long, descriptive names to people and then repeating them each time he encounters them in his monologue. This works for Garrison Keillor; it does not work for Kinsella. Instead of making the book funny, it makes the book hard to read. In the end, I did what no one should have to do with a favorite author; I finished the book from a sense of duty"},{"rating":"2","title":"Know T. R. Pearson's Examples or Miss Kinsella's Model Here!","review":"Without the example of T. R. Pearson's A BRIEF HISTORY OF A SMALL PLACE Kinsella would have had no precedent for the repetitive style he uses in BOX SOCIALS, a novel set in the time and place of his own childhood, west of Edmonton near a place called Darwell in the 1930s--when you were supposed to have a license from the government to turn your radio on!That he succeeds in telling a baseball tale in a time when he himself knew no baseball and weaves in some truths about the racism that existed in what was, even there, a multi-cultural environment is a tribute to his inventiveness.This book is best read aloud with a Southern accent. So, if you aren't prepared to \\"work\\" at it a bit, you'll probably be disappointed. Otherwise, you'll find yourself noticing the width of the Pembina River-- next time you're on the Edmonton/Jasper highway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Book for Baseball Fans","review":"I am a big fan of all of Kinsella's baseball books. This one takes us to 1940's Canada as seen throught the eyes of young Jamie O'Day. We hear about all the eccentric people in Jamie's life including Truckbox Al McClintock, the Little American Soldier, and many other interesting characters of the region. It is always appealing to me how the author revolves his story around baseball. Bob Feller even has a role in the story. My only complaint would be that the way the author repeats names of people and towns throughout the book can be annoying. Box Socials takes us to a time when life was slower and people enjoyed following the small town baseball teams. If you are a baseball fan and enjoy a good story-I think you will have fun reading Box Socials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Box Socials mediocre, plotless","review":"WP Kinsella's book \\"Box Socials\\" is an excellent insight into the white trash of Alberta.

These wishes often result in tragedy and death, and Menander likes it like that. Sibille's accidental possession of this horrific relic brings her to the attention of the French queen Catherine de Medici and the legendary seer Nostradamus, each of whom has an overweening interest in the box and its contents, albeit for differing reasons.

I was pleased with the way the plot developed, the characters grew and expanded (for the most part) as the story went along. I liked the addition of the supernatural aspects: the angel of history was a real hoot with his ascerbic comments, and the Master of All Desires was a scream, preying upon the weaknesses of human vanity.If, as other reviewers state, is not as good as some of Riley's other work, then I can't wait to read them!

Actually, a few stories had nothing to do with the Empire at all it seemed, maybe just a footnote, but nothing that compares to the grandeur of the Empire as depicted in the movies and some of the other recent novels.I am a huge SW fan, and have read about 80% of 'all' novels set within the universe, and this by far is one I want to forget about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the title","review":"One would think with a title like this, the stories would be about the EMPIRE.

As I watched this I kept wondering: what is the point of this story? There's no moral, no message, nothing for the viewer to take away. It's not even thrilling or scary, just sad. Haley Joel Osment is brilliant considering how young he is; that's the only reason I give this any stars at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie, More than just Sport","review":"Well, what a movie. Anyone who doesn't like this doesn't like good movies. Snipes and DeNiro are excellent, as is the story of the fan who is sick of being taken for a ride by his heroes, who care little about the Fan. The only down is the dark lighting at the games, but you get used to it, and enjoy the movie. The unexpected turn when Primeau dies is dramatic, and helps pace the film well into its thrilling finale, that lacks predictability. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really weird movie","review":"The Fan has got to be one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen in my whole life. Robert De Niro gives a brilliant performance as someone who literally goes insane. His character sells knives and when he blows a chance with his son, his only hope is the San Fransisco Giants's baseball team. When they acquire one of the best players for a lot of money (played by Wesley Snipes), he knows that they will go all the way. But when the acquired star fails because he doesn't have his right number and another player does, De Niro's character does the unthinkable. He then becomes obsessed with Snipe's character and just goes nuts. The movie is for one highly unrealistic for soooooooooooooooooooo many reasons, and on another hand, it's just plain weird. It starts off good with a good plot and then it just goes nowhere. A dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a full frame only edition","review":"Contrary to what the product description mentions, this DVD only offers the full frame version of the film. The original format was 2.35 so you've now been warned: the picture was butchered by Sony on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I strongly disliked/hated every character in this film in the first 10 minutes. I wanted virtually all of them to get stabbed to death. None of the characters had any redeeming values, save for Rayburn's love for his son. Everyone was either crazy or self-absorbed, or in most cases both.BTW, if this film hadn't jumped the shark for most of you early on, then the reference to Barry Bonds later on should have. This film was made in the mid-90's when Bonds was actually playing for the Giants. How do you reference an actual player on the actual current team without him being in the film and playing himself? This is akin to having a character on Law & Order SVU talking about the original TV show Law & Order. (John Kruk at least made a cameo.)A lot of train wrecks of a movie still keep your attention. This was one train wreck that I wanted to divert my eyes from."},{"rating":"1","title":"is there a robe?","review":"A friend really enjoys this film, and I agreed to watch it in deference to her insistence that I see it. This is a rare sort of role for Robert DeNiro, although he is always full of surprises. It does not quite work, though, to see him as a crazed baseball fanatic of sorts; it is not quite believable somehow. My dislike for Wesley Snipes contributes to my distaste for the film in general. The only truly redeeming thing here is Benicio del Toro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one!","review":"I don't know what Bob de Niro was thinking about while making this movie...it's flat, flat, flat...if you think you're his biggest FAN then try to forget this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST EDITING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED","review":"I love Robert Deniro and thought he did a great job in this movie but anyone who knows anything about baseball knows this movie is a joke. Whoever edited this movie needs to give anyone who ever saw their money back. For example, there are overhead shots of a football game and the next image is a baseball game. There are overhead shots of Dodger Stadium and then next shot is of a game supposedly going on in SF. In one scene the announcer says the name of the player throwing the ball except the name he says is entirely different from the one stiched on the player's back. This could have been a great film if any effort was put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I thought a film directed by Tony Scott ans starring Robert de Niro would be worth watching. Unfortunately, I was wrong.Do not waste your time or your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batters Up!!!","review":"This ain't such a bad movie, eventhough I gave it two stars. The reason why I gave it two stars was because, at times, it got boring. But I like how Robert De Niro acted. He was a mentally ill man, that went around and gave people a taste of his baseball bat, and also stalked his favourite baseball player, Wesley Snipes.This movie should be watched by many. I thought that De Niro was just hilarious. Especially when he threatened his son's stepdad with a baseball bat.I thought this movie was pretty much an okay thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, but not good enough thriller","review":"Tony Scott's film \\"The Fan\\" based on Peter Abrahams's novel of the same name is very disturbing to watch, and the camerawork certainly doesn't help either. Gil Renard(Robert DeNiro) is a frustrated rabid-Giants fan(which isn't true to the novel) and his life is falling apart at the same time that Bobby Rayburn(Wesley Snipes) is in a big slump. Gil and Bobby's lives get closer to intersecting, and a murder occurs which changes both characters and heads the film towards its tragic climax. Gil is too scary to relate to even though we want to. Bobby is too selfish and sleeps around too much to be the hero. Great work by the supporting actors. John Leguizamo and Ellen Barkin do the best in this film as Manny, a sleazy agent and Jewel, a ballsy sports reporter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"A poorly concieved movie, it was unconvincing and predictable. The music of NIN, which in itself is pretty good, does not mesh with the actual action of the movie at all. Don't waste your money on this sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, But Ultimately Disappointing","review":"Despite some style, rythm and a couple of intriguing ideas, this Tony Scott\`s movie soon falls into most of the cliches that trap a typical Hollywood blockbuster.Wesley Snipes plays a baseball star that ends up being the object of devotion and obsession of a lonely, convulted man (Robert DeNiro). The picture builds a growing tension, yet the second part lives on the strenght of chases, kidnappings and tiresome predictability. Nine Inch Nails are a fine addition to the soundtrack, helping the development of the paranoid plot, but the movie is still too flawed and unsurprising to truly engage.Not too good not too bad. Watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I read the previous reviews. I couldn't disagree more!! Yes it is thin, that's a plus!! I love the way my mouse operates on this surface.

Her writing is so smooth yet real, she effortlessly engrosses me in the characters to the end. These characters are truly enjoyable. Evelyn Wheaton is wonderfully awkward and bookish as a young girl, and flowers into a compelling and attractive woman. Her crush on Martin Langdon is completely believable and as it develops into something more, the sexual tension is exquisite.Julianne MacLean seems to capture the period perfectly and yet gives us characters with universal flaws and strengths that I can always relate to. Surrender to a Scoundrel is a delicious and delightful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very forgettable book","review":"This book was just very \\"blah\\", in my opinion. MacLean utilizes the same plot vehicles familiar to hundreds of romance novels, but with the least amount of depth possible. I really didn't care one way or the other about either the hero or heroine, or the very minor conflict in the book. The reader wasn't involved in the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters on any more than a basic, superficial level. In my opinion, it was like reading an outline of a novel. The only reason I didn't give this book one star was because there was nothing overly wrong or offensive with the story...really, there was nothing there in general. An extremely forgettable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so - One you can skip and not miss","review":"I have enjoyed reading the 5 previous titles by Julianne MacLean in this story line but this one just did not do it for me at all. I found it to be a so-so read that I would not have missed had it never been written. I, like many others do not understand the rave reviews given this title. All I can say is to each his own but I would advise you to choose another of her books to read and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book for young adults.","review":"This book is a good book.

It is a fast-reading book and I reccomend it to kids about 10 years old and over, because of the rare but harsh cursing. I give this book 10 thumbs up.

In reality, this cable is not natural sounding and strips out the midrange inherent in high quality audio equipment which defeats the purpose in my view. The added \\"clarity\\" is code for poor sound quality. Even the least inexpensive patch cables I own (free cables shipped with all new stereo equipment) sound more natural than this \\"hi end audiophile\\" cable.

The product itself is great, comes pre-gapped and protected for shipment, but don't put too much faith in the Amazon part matching system. Oh, and why so much? The dealer said they have rare earth metals in them and the cost of such metal has skyrocketed in the past few years (They used to be around $11).

While it pains me to say it, Kiss Of Evil was a painful reading experience. Although filled with murders and gore, I found the plot to be predictable and somewhat slow-moving. Further, Montanari didn't develop his characters well enough -- both the good and bad ones -- to make me care enough about what happened to any of them. The main challenge I associated with this book was to see if I had the determination to finish it rather than give up on it. And while I met this challenge, the real mystery was why I bothered. My recommendation to you is to read any of the excellent books by Montanari I mentioned above but definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hannibal Lector?","review":"In this story, we meet another evil psycho who not only likes to kill his victims, but mutilate them as well. Pursuing this monster is the jaded cop, Jack Paris. This is an engrossing tale, with a down to earth hero who has his own share of problems in addition to tracking down an elusive, vicious murderer. The story is frightening and graphically violent, so if you are the least bit squeamish, think twice about reading the book. Interesting characters, fast moving plot and a monstrous villian make for a quick, tension filled read.This is the first book I've read by Mr. Montanari. I plan to read the others to find out what I have been missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real help for a fearful flyer.","review":"I read this book with fear as I was apprehensive about flying although I wouldn't say I was fearful. It relaxed me because of the light way it described the flight from start to finish. I learned a lot. It also talked about a specific remedy to calm me down which I took and will say it delivered what it claimed to do. I also learned what to do about my jet lag and although I did not follow the suggestions, I may consider them on my next long trip. I though this book was fun and useful and would gladly recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booklet of minimal aid and interest","review":"This is a very small book from a vanity press that has churned out other titles on hemorrhoids and pet care. While the author, an experienced pilot, is no doubt knowledgeable, the book itself is spotty, repetitious, poorly punctuated and just not worth its price. It comes up in searches for books on overcoming flying anxieties, and while it does touch on that topic, there are far better and more comprehensive books to be read for that. In fact, until the section that is dedicated to alleviating those fears, the author demonstrates a rather sadistic attitude about potential plane disasters, so the more phobic will probably want to avoid this book.Also, a good chunk of the text is dedicated to recommending various quackery to relieve the health hazards of flying with flower tinctures and the like, and the writer lets the lecture bleed into the evils of things such as sugar and soft drinks in general rather than sticking to the issue at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!!!","review":"Meager (and often inappropriate) attempts at humor about the ins and outs of flying make this book not simply a waste of time, but yet another reason for fearful flyers to avoid the aviation industry entirely. After having perused the rather flimsy book, I found myself thinking of ways to get out of my upcoming flight. Not exactly what I was looking for in a write-up about how to tame my airline anxiety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Ms. Anderson's attitude throughout the book is condescending and smug. The list of \\"commandments\\" (such as \\"Worship the Pilot\\"), speak more to a battered ego than compassion for the timid flyer. The entire tone of the book is one of disdain for the passenger, omnipotence of the crew, especially the pilot, with wise-cracking threats if one is not properly intimidated. I'm not without appreciation or gratitude for the experience of the airline pilot, the cardiologist, or the hazmat team, but I find it offensive to have it hammered into me as karmic law. Try reading Patrick Smith's Ask the Pilot, which is at once informative and thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous price","review":"Really sad that they are trying to force Tassimo customers to replace their units by over-pricing the accessories.

I would buy it if it were reasonably priced. That said, you can't expect it to be since it has not been manufactured for a long time. There are a few on ebay, for around $12.99, but it won't be long before that dries up too. I have been putting pre-filtered or spring water in my machine and will continue to do that instead of paying this price for the filter. If I get tired of that, for the money I have saved not paying this price, it won't be too painful to buy the current generation of Tassimo machine. Still you hate to give up on something that's working perfectly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous price!","review":"Follow the other reviewer's advice (Angela) and buy this from coffeebiz.

Regardless...do more research than I did before buying this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a fly fishing book","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. It dealt far too much with the authors philosophy & non fishing life and was, frankly, very depressing. I don't buy books on flyfishing to be bummed out.

Luckily I read it first. It in NOT appropriate for young readers, and is not about fishing.

I rapidly turned to detoxification products such as high amounts of green and rooibos tea, French green clay and activated charcoal. So...my review is that it can be an effective but overpowering anti-fungal. Should be modudulated carefully as the die-off was impressive (to say the least). Too soon to tell if the candida is eliminated but this product likely will get you on the road to healing...So, not five stars.....yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"has drastically reduced the itching that daughter had due to alergies.

I never watched it while it was in production, but I have discovered it on DVD and am enjoying it immensely. By this point, the writers and actors are taking full advantage of the large ensemble cast, which offers numerous story opportunities. Interesting character dynamics have emerged by this point in the series, such as the way in which cast members mirror each other in male-female pairings. Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) are the romantic ones, Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Monica (Courtney Cox) are the neurotic ones, and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) are the ditzy ones who live their lives in their own idiosyncratic ways. By the end of this season, two of these pairings have literally paired up. Will the third do the same?

Briefly, the humor was dry and awkward, with almost every one of Chandler's lines coming totally from some uneasy self-consciousness. Typically, this season's humor made me want to cringe.

It has every element that makes a good fantasy--elements that Brooks has down to an art. While it is understandable that every book cannot live up to its forebears, no matter how great it is, that is no reason to condemn an author or his readers. I love the family element Brooks keeps in prominent with the Ohmsfords; it made me reconsider my own sibling relationship. Brooks also brought in some interesting secondary characters in the form of Garet Jax and Slanter, yet failed to develop Brin and Jair much farther than they are presented at the start of the novel.

But it could be better.","review":"Brin Ohmsford is... the worst character Terry Brooks has created. She's not exactly likeable, but she's not exactly detestable either. And then there's Rone. He's just stupid. And there you have it, the main characters. Slanter the gnome saves the whole charcter thing with his uniqueness and his ability to really come across as \\"real\\". And then there's Garet Jax... He is WONDERFUL! Jair isn't bad either.Anyway lada lada lada, I did give it 4 stars. It does kind of deserve it. The battle scenes are awesome, the characters... well.. anyway.. the book is an all over success. (But why did Brooks have to kill off the best, butt-kicking character?) Now, that we could have lived without."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the bad","review":"The works of Terry Brooks have always stunk. Okay, that's not totally true, they were good when I was 12. This is the worst of those books.

The first book was laughable and the second wasnt a whole lot better. This was the best of the three, but was still just way too vauge and rushed. I hate to keep writing bad reviews for this series, but WOW was I dissapointed. I was expecting an actual trilogy type story, not three seperate stories with one unlikeable character (Allannon)the only thing to connect them. I know Terry Brooks is supposed to be some what of a classic, and no disrespect intended, but I would rather have someone jam an icepick in my retina than read anymore of his writitng.

I was extremely disappointed when I watched the movies. First, the video quality is terrible. The movies are cropped so that you only see the middle of the screen, but they didn't go to the trouble to pan the view so that you see the action, so lots of action happens off screen. Also, some of the movies are dark, hard to see, grainy, and just generally poor quality. I guess you get what you pay for in some respects. I recently bought the Kung-Fu Theater Collection (10 movies) and have been MUCH happier with those. The video quality is significantly higher in that collection than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Bad","review":"In Snake Fist Dynamo a guy eats a lizard.

My only real gripe is there wasn't enough of the \\"Shaolin\\" style films...oh well.Now not to say that ALL are bad, as there are actually a few really good ones too.

The situation was completely unbelievable - okay, this is true of lots of romantic comedies - but in a distasteful way that didn't make me suspend my disbelief in any way, shape or form. The characters were cardboard cutouts going through the motions, without any real feeling, or over the top cliches. The dialogue was totally inane - come on, what 21st century guy (even one who's supposed to be a jerk) would call a woman a \\"hussy\\"? (And only because she wouldn't go to lunch with him).

After reading the reviews, many suggested reading the Coxwell Series before beginning this one. The reviews of \\"Double Trouble\\" seemed favorable enough. I purchased the other 3 novels before beginning \\"Double Trouble\\". I'm beginning to think this was a mistake! I just finished reading Book #1 \\"Third Time Lucky'! It took me till almost 50% of the book to become interested. The beginning was painfully slow! Now to the part that really irritated me (besides the slow start), the ERRORS! The errors in this book were horrendous! I can't believe I paid $5.00 for a book riddled with errors! I am on Page 2 of \\"Double Trouble\\" and it already has omitted words and spelling errors! Oh, but shame on me...this is the FREE one! Hopefully, books #3 and #4 are better edited, that's if I ever read those books. Book #2 will be the deciding factor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"Claire Cross writes some of the best dialogue ever read in this type of book, sprightly and fun. Her heroine has an outlook on life and a turn of phrase so clever that this character borders on genius. Still, the romance genre itself is limiting. THIRD TIME LUCKY conforms to the genre with a single storyline that is linear and ultimately predictable. There is an additional plot about the heroine's business partner that could have been expanded, but that would have taken the novel outside the limitations of romance novels. Also, the mystery which drives this tale wasn't explored thoroughly enough to be exciting, though the book starts with great promise. Nonetheless, THIRD TIME LUCKY is an easy read, and a fun one. I look forward to Ms. Cross's next book in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love to read good books","review":"Series of four books - must read them all.

I actually remember this one when it was running in theaters and it deserves better treatment than this. It's a strange little tale of a hotel across the street from MGM in 1939 that is trying to cash in on the publicity of the making of The Wizard of Oz and all of the strange goings on that surround it.

Fred and Wilma Flintstone live in the stone age and yet in a wacky way they seem to have all kinds of mod cons. Their neighbours and best friends are Barney and Betty Rubble. Fred and Barney get into all kinds of trouble together and they seem to be constantly finding ways to keep their wayward behaviour from Wilma and Betty.

L'adaptation franaise n'a jamais été populaire et ces extraits confirment leur médiocrité. Les autres épisodes en québécois sont hilarants. Les dessins de cette saison sont plus brouillons, mais je trouve que ce sont les meilleurs épisodes. Évidemment, Paul Berval en est le principal intért.

We will all wait patiently for the following seasons and then buy them too. I am very disappointed that they are not on tv for us to watch anymore like it used to be. Shame on the cartoon network.

Yet again, as a child, I swallowed everything the church fed me as well.

And lo and behold, there is Dino, living with the cavemen. It makes me sick to think that once upon a time, all our children were watching this smut. And believe me, all the Creationist preachers probably watched this show daily in the 1960's.If you want your children to believe this lie, go on ahead and purchase this.

Out of 28 episodes, 5 were dubbed in France. For a big fan of the Flinstones from Quebec, it is unacceptable. Moreover, I know that the episodes dubbed in France have been dubbed in Quebec as well.

Many of the tools are made by Bergeon, a legendary Swiss manufacturer of very high quality tools for the watchmaker trade. And some of the tools appear to have been made by Wenger, and they don't seem as well finished, or by comparison anyway. Then there's the bulk issue: The unit is thick and needs a holster if you're going to carry it all day. Great to have at your desk, or to take to watch shows, but not an everyday carry. Also, it's wise to buy the accessory kit which expands your choice of tiny screwdrivers. There's space for the additional blades in the swing-out tool carrier module which holds many of the Bergeon tools, including screwdriver blades, a file, and a broach, if you know what that is. Still, the inclusion of a corkscrew mystifies me...is there a niche market of drunken watchmakers? Anyway, a neat but expensive little tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good little Sweet Valley book","review":"This book revolves around Olivia's crush with her art teacher.

Unfortunately, first company I called no longer serviced Haier products. They told me it was not profitable for them. Second company took 3 weeks to get parts (needed a new compressor & tubing was kinked) and 2.5 hours for repairs to be finished. Pretty sad for a NEW wine cooler. Hopefully it will work now.

Unfortunately, it was delivered damaged but Amazon.com was great about sending out a new one quickly, etc. No problem with Amazon.com. The problem is that the racks do not \\"slide-out\\" as Haier claims. If you lift the back of the rack out of a groove the rack can be lifted out - careful if you have 5 wine bottles on there! No \\"easy access\\" as it says in the product description. Haier should be honest and call them \\"adjustable racks\\" like in a regular refrigerator. We called Haier and they said their \\"gliding\\" racks come out on a track. But who knew to look for \\"gliding\\" instead of \\"sliding\\"?

Unfortunately, the contents between the covers fail to live up to the promise.If you can avoid choking on the force-fed propaganda that the PLEX company is, and always has been, the only company in the world that makes transforming robots, you'll be tripped up by the boring designs and uninspired art. While there is good art and the occasional basic concept to be found, they won't be on the same pages.There are several much better books on the same subject. If you must consider purchasing this volume, please get hold of a copy and flip through it first before committing to purchase.What drags this book up from the depths of uselessness is that it's a rough guide to the way PLEX designers think. If you need to sketch a couple of robots that mimick the simplistic PLEX look, this book gives you some design boundaries for avoiding too much mechanical elegance or visual appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best when the band just plays","review":"Santana's forte as a band has always been the playing; it's not that the singers or the songs have been bad, but they're (mostly) second in importance to the band just cutting loose and wailing. What makes \\"Dance Sister Dance\\" really kick is Carlos' anchoring riff and his solo towards the end; likewise, the timbales are what move \\"Gitano,\\" with Chepito and Armando in a tight groove. \\"Europa\\" is the high point on the album, one of the best instrumentals the band ever did and one of Carlos' finest solos ever.

Let Me and Tell Me Are You Tired are great funky-R&B-like cuts, and really have that mid 70s classic style. Gitano is totally latino, and sounds just as fresh today. Dance Sister Dance is classic combo of latin-pop-fusion. Let It Shine is almost a gospel-sounding disco tune, and there is even a two-parter instrumental that starts off as an 'Incident at Neshbur' tune, but moves into a Coster-ish latino samba-like thing. Add Europa, a tune which still gets airplay in Paris, and the CD is a great mix.I also think the chicks dig this too, at least from my experience they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST BAND EVER!","review":"Hey!

One wonders how many of the same behind-the-scenes activities are going on at present, as was offered in this film.There are many fine performances in \\"The Late Shift\\", but Kathy Bates really shines here. Her role as Helen Kushner, the hard-driving agent behind Jay Leno, is forceful and convincing.

Where art thou Tiffany?","review":"The opening, title and credit graphics were excellent. The overall film was, at the least, a decent portrayal of urban, African-American men fighting against the odds and obstacles to reach their dreams. However, one can also see from watching this film that urban life can have an unyielding hold on you. One bright spot, which is definitely a reason that this movie will be a staple on my video shelf, is the character of Tiffany. Not only was she one of the few characters in the movie that can actually act, that girl is fine as hell and her semi-nude scenes didn't hurt either. Get this movie if you like urban/gangster/rapper/shoot-em-up fare. And I know the TIFFANY character will have you watching over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIGHT MOVIE","review":"I really enjoyed watching this movie and the music was exceptional.

She has succeeded in being new and different, but not clearer and better.A reader interested in modern physics would be well advised to read Nobel Prize winner Robert Laughlin's book, \\"A Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down.\\" It is smarter and more insightful.

There are many books by physicists intended for the normal non-technical layperson. (I'm one of us!) This book is by far the best.

And relativity theory.A really great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscures at least as much as it clarifies","review":"I'm not sure what audience this book is written for, but it isn't me. Randall finds it necessary to provide analogies for almost everything she says. Unfortunately, these analogies add to the length of the book, but not to my understanding of the physics she is trying to explain. They come across as \\"dumbed down\\" and condescending, and as with all analogies they carry the risk of being misleading and inaccurate. I completely lost patience when I encountered the sentence, \\"More of something (like lead pipe or dirt or cherries) is heavier, and less of it is lighter.\\" (p. 309) Really?I will look for some of the other books reviewers have mentioned to see whether they accomplish what I had hoped this book would - provide me with a reasonable understanding of current physics without requiring that I take several math courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Though I seem to be in a minority, I thought it was poorly written. Confusing and full of gaps in the sense that metaphors are freely used, perhaps necessarily but without explanations regarding how they are merely metapors. E.g., if branes are like sheets of paper with space between them, how are they NOT like them? What is the nature of the space between them? Do they have shape? Are they finite or infinite? In what kind of space do they exist? If there are 3, call them a, b and c, sure a can touch b, but can c touch a? Again and again, I found myself thinking, \\"But what about ... ?

The narrative line is repetitive and convoluted. There are some stylistic pearls as \\"the German-born Max Born\\". Words are repeated once and again -- has anyone counted how many time the string \\"later on\\" occurs in the text? -- and the tone is patronizing of the reader.

One suggestion would be that her next book include a bit more of the exotic mathematics which, I am sure, her editor required her to omit.

Professor Randall is a very good 'explainer', and through this book my understanding is now much more complete.I would not recommend this as a first book, rather it provides an intermediate explanatory platform to prepare the interested reader for futher, deeper study, such as a book like, 'Subtle is the Lord', by Abraham Pais.This book is a MUST read-it ties up a lot of loose ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable!","review":"In order to keep this short and sweet, this is a very readable book about string, superstring theory, and branes!

This happens at least once every chapter, and gets a little old after the first 5 times of reading it. Secondly, this book doesn't seem quite capable of filling a gap between the last book (Dr. Cheney Duvall M.D. #8) and where they are now in their lives, and where they were when we last left them. It seemed to me, that a big chunk of info was missing, even though I read it twice over Christmas.Over all, this book was both enjoyable and rewarding.

There is only one thing I have noticed in the writing style that seems changed from the previous ones. I'm sure other fans have noticed also, that because the tension between Cheney and Shiloh has completely dissapeared, so too has the complexity of the plot and style.

While I may stipulate that Mormonism - Shadow or Reality? isn't a scholarly work, I'm impressed with the sincerity and general honesty of the writers. Mr. and Mrs. Tanner's greatest contribution to history is their unceasing effort to gather and publish source material which the LDS church has modified over the years beyond recognition. The LDS church would say that a living prophet is better than a dead one, and that any changes have been authorized by God through His servants. Perhaps, but if that's not enough for you, the Tanners give you some of the material you need to come to your own conclusion.The LDS church itself teaches that \\"by the power of the Holy Ghost you may know the truth of all things.\\" They should let history stand where it is, without the tampering.I'm 40 years old and served a 2 year LDS mission to Chile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth doesn't change -- ever!!!","review":"Gerald and Sandra Tanner, both formerly \\"blueblood Mormons\\" (she a direct descendant of one of the Church's two founders, he a son of one of the 12 apostles of the church)take the position that Truth is universal, doesn't change over time, and that, if it changes, it is not truth. They take every major teaching of the Mormon faith, then, step-by-step, use the Church's own documents (they own a microfilm company)to show how the teachings have changed over the years. For example, at one time, blacks could not attain the priesthood because they had the \\"mark of Cain\\" on them. However, following Federal interest in possible Utah discrimination, the head of the Church experienced a new \\"revelation\\" that this major church teaching was no longer valid --blacks can now attain priesthood.

When she became apprenticed to the Goddess, I knew it could get no worse. (I was wrong, of course.) By the time she wound up married to the Archangel Michael and beating a major lord of Hell in single combat, I was in physical pain.The book mixes Christianity and Paganism in a way that would make even the writer of \\"Teen Witch\\" take a step back and cry hold. The heroine is a bossy and unpleasant woman who everyone ends up loving, who can knock down walls, and can probably leap tall buildings in a single bound. The disclaimer that Ms. Sky put at the beginning warning the reader that all of the spells in the book were REAL but too powerful to use almost drove me to homicide.Caveat emptor: this is a bad book. A very bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i am a melodic animal","review":"yes i need some kind of melody - maybe just bits of melody.

Talk about publishers milking a trend! Unfortunately, not every author is a Peter Mayle or an Ann Barry. Greene's book, for example, is hopeless--- a shambles as far as organization goes, peopled by clueless, insensitive, and incompletely delineated characters (maybe that last is the good news, because the bad news is that this is a work of non-fiction.) It is about as illuminating of the French culture and countryside as a Greyhound bus tour of the Top Ten tourist sites of the Ile-de-France.Don't be taken in by the book's title, as I was. Even we bibliophilic Francophiles have some standards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive trip to a french village.","review":"Jeff Greene is doing what the rest of us dream about doing. I found this book to be enchanting. His descriptions of the village physical are so stimulating. I have a sister living in a small village in France so I found so many similarities between his village and my sister's village. The characters are wonderful, full of life. The next time I visit my sister I will surely stop in Rogny and see for myself Jeff Greene's dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure to be a classic!","review":"This book so clearly transcends the current crop of travel and/or memoir books. It follows in the tradition of My Family and Other Animals (Gerald Durrell) and Life Among the Savages (Shirley Jackson), a book of delight that is ever mindful of the transitory nature of all our pleasures. Jeffrey Greene, an accomplished poet, writes with a poet's eye and ear, transforming the ordinary into an illuminated world. One hates to return to reality after this pastoral foray into the French countryside, at once both comical and lyrical. You'll remember these characters long after you close the book and you'll be packing for your next visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A significant disappointment","review":"This book is tedious from cover to cover. The author isn't a bad writer, he simply has little to say--at least in this volume. Having had a love affair with Burgundy for over 20 years, I picked up this book with great anticipation. I found little inside that created for me any feeling of connection, either with the region or the writer's experience. The detail is crushing in its weight. The entire read reminded me of those awful typed holiday letters from people one hardly knows that contain a level of detail of daily life that makes you wonder why they haven't attached the garden hose to the exhaust pipe to put an end to their misery. The problem here is that the misery continues for 282 pages. I stayed with it only to see if somehow the ending would vindicate my decision to doggedly plow through the prose. It didn't. I know this review is harsh, but it is richly deserved. The author wasted his time and mine too."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE BORING BOOK","review":"I was expecting a true romance story filled with intrigue and adventure, but instead I got a boring lifeless story that could put any heart-thumping human to sleep. I have never been so frustrated with a book as I have with this one. I wanted the story to move forward from page one, but till the end the narrative just got slower, slower and zzzzzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Then what?","review":"I just finished French Spirits and then read other reviews. It never occurred to me that the author was being a braggard. The story is full of real characters and the author's acceptance and appreciation of their quirks is obvious. My only complaint is that this swift read ends abruptly. There are implications that his mother does not continue to live with them in France, but we never learn what happens to her. Surely there is a sequel, but perhaps more life has to be lived before he will be ready to write it. I will certainly be waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haier 46b wine cellar?","review":"Unfortunatly, I can't give a legitimate rating AND will never know if this is a decent wine cellar because it arrived TWICE (yes, I took the change and re-ordered) damaged and delivery-the second time-was refused.I finally canceled my order and bought a GE Monogram for 2X the amount, which holds up to 57 bottles. (I own a smaller 20b Haier and have had no problems with it in three year.)But the larger 46b: BUYER BEWARE! It is not packaged to protect it during shipping and will sustain significant damage if dropped or hit on the sides.

While not-pregnant I am a tall 5'10\\" and lean 125lbs which would have led me to purchase the petite size; however, I used other reviews and purchased the small and have used the largest setting on it since receiving it. I am pregnant with twins so I also ordered the medium for the future. I presently am 30 weeks and around 145lbs and still using the small but it won't be too much longer to get to the medium. Would recommend this product to anyone but based on alternate sizing suggestions. I am using this belt for abdominal support and not back pain so cannot comment on its use for back pain but excellent for abdominal support. I also really like that no one can tell you have it one because it is so small compared to other options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Cradle Review","review":"I love this thing. I didn't think it would make much of a difference with my back pain, but it's worked really well. I can stay on my feet twice to three times as long as I could without it (I'm in my 3rd trimester and work fastfood). It doesn't magic the back pain away by any means but it takes longer to start and lessens it when it does start. Also, I really appreciated that the sizing was accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipped quick! Great product","review":"Very pleased. Shipped quickly and has really given me alot of support during my pregnancy. Would highly recommend this to anyone. Hides nicely under clothes too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help my round ligament pain","review":"If you bought this for some other reason than to help with round ligament pain due to pregnancy, skip to the next review. I bought this belt because I began suffering significant round ligament pain, to the point that walking was extremely painful, around 20 weeks of pregnancy. In particular, for me, it seems to be severely exacerbated by jogging or running.I purchased this belt after surfing around Amazon looking at the various maternity belt options. This one is definitely one of the smallest options of the bunch, and also one of the cheapest. Unfortunately, after trying it out for a few days, I really don't think it's helped me at all. The round ligament pain is as bad as ever. Perhaps it would be worse without the belt as my pregnancy is progressing - who knows.The belt itself is well-made and easy to put on. I am 22 weeks pregnant and 140 lbs or so currently, and I found the size Small fits on the smallest setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"I found this to be very uncomfortable, I am a nurse and am on my feet for over 12 hours a shift and I ended up taking it off the first night within just a few hours of wearing it. I also couldn't sit down with it on, it pressed into my belly and just hurt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh, what a relief!","review":"I got this belt in the mail today and immediately tried it on. What a relief, I have a lot of ligament soreness and this relieves most of it. It is a bit big, but I know I will grow into it. It isn't as tight as it needs to be today, but it still is providing relief--as I grow it will become more effective I'm sure. The size is a little off, I could probably have gotten by with the smaller one, but all in all, I'm happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I've been wearing this for several months, and only until recently (I'm almost 32 weeks) did it start to feel a little uncomfortable. I still wear it if I'm walking or standing around for longer than usual. I used to have terrible sciatica pain, but really didn't have that problem when I wore the cradle. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - sizing issue","review":"I definitely agree that their sizing was off for me. I am at the high end of what they call a small, but I ordered a medium based on other reviews and it fits great right now on the smallest setting. I'll be able to continue using this as my belly continues to grow. (I'm 5 months pregnant.) Otherwise, it's comfortable and serves its purpose to give a little (not a lot) of back and abdominal support."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only way I got through pregnancy","review":"I had terrible pelvic pain during my pregnancy - putting this brace on provided instant relief. I agree that it runs small, so consider ordering a size up from the recommended weight ranges. Also, just like a bra, it cinches in on the skin so you get some \\"side fat\\" hanging over the edges. It's not terrible, but it did keep me from wearing it under shirts of thin material. Finally, i wouldn't recommend wearing it if you know you're going to be sitting for a long time, as it starts to dig in (we made a 6-hour car trip, and I had to remove it after 3 hours). However, I would highly recommend this product (especially given the price). I wore it during exercise and at work. It cleans very easily, too. (I washed it in a lingerie bag along with my bras etc.) Provides pelvic relief as well as back support from the moment you get a \\"bump\\" all the way through your ninth month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Medium Support, but not for the bouncy belly","review":"I purchased this product for support while walking on the treadmill. It works great now (Second Trimester), but I don't know if it will hold up to my bouncy belly in the 3rd. All in all, it was money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing way off!","review":"Everyone reviewing this product said to size one up. I did and it was huge. I could not exchange, just return and was charged shipping. My belly support from Amon just arrived and thankfully it does fit according to the size chart and seems much more supportive for the whole belly."},{"rating":"1","title":"sizing is way off","review":"I purchased the It's You Babe Mini Cradle, size small. At 5'3\\" and a current weight of 152lbs, I ordered the SMALL because according to the size chart it ranges from 136-180lbs. I am almost 35 weeks and have already stopped gaining weight (the same thing happened with my first pregnancy). I was afraid the medium would be too large since I am not anywhere close to 180. I should have listened to the other reviewers! The second to last clasp was way to tight. I put it on the last clasp and it fit, but just barely. If I gain any more weight or if my stomach drops anymore this would not fit. I adjusted the position several times thinking maybe it was in the wrong spot but no such luck. I ended up having a weird crampy fealing both times I tested it out and haven't bothered with it since. The company needs to change their size chart so it's based on your stomach circumference. Then maybe people would have an easier time getting the right fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big","review":"After reading the reviews, I purchased a size up as many reviewers said this product ran small. I'm 33 weeks and weigh 170 pounds and decided to order the medium. It is definitely too big. It does not fall off, it stays on, but even on the tightest hook setting, it doesn't actually give me any support. I don't use it at all at this point. I should have just ordered the Small based on the product's weight chart."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"I got this on my 21 week, 139bl. With other people's review, I bought the one size up, and it is totally correct. I am using the smallest setting right now, and this belt will give me plenty growing room. One thing I do not like (I guess it is related to my job)is it is not comfortable if you like me, sitting all the day. But it does lighter my back stress. Would recommend it.

I ordered the medium at 190# and 28 weeks. It's snug, but not supportive.HOWEVER! i have a few pairs of full belly pants that refuse to stay up over my rump. this band works great at holding up those problematic pants. i can comfortably wear it all day while sitting at my desk, and it does a great job holding them up on the weekends when i'm running around (bending) more when they really slip down. i'm very happy with it as a belt for the listed price. who knows, as i get bigger, maybe it'll start to be supportive, too.*edited* at 32 weeks this is supportive, and i wear it daily. i'm shocked at how much a little elastic band really helps support. i love it, and well, well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok...","review":"Didn't give the back support I was really looking for - sizing was a little off as well. This helped some while sleeping at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have only had this product a few days now. So far it's lived up to its expectations. I'm just starting my third trimester and this is my first baby. I'm around the 20 to 25 pound weight gain and this product is already helping my back. I bought the medium. It is a little big but I'm sure I will still be growing for the next three months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizing is off but all around great item!","review":"I ordered the large based on reviews and my actual pant size. Turns out, it was a little too big. I know the poundage is inaccurate (I only weighed 160 when I purchased it, not the 226+ as indicated), so actual inches would have been a better way to size. I stitched the excess to shrink it and it feels great! My lower back and pubic bone pain is nearly gone. The large belt is a total of about 46\\" long with the tightest hooks beginning at 38\\" and 3 1/2\\" in between hooks. It's a very sturdy, yet comfortable belt, I like to wear it over my pants when possible but is comfortable enough to have on bare skin. You can't go wrong for the price and performance. Hopefully this helps a bit in your hunt for comfort :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it is supposed to do!","review":"This belt eases back pain but only when you are using it while standing. It's so painful to sit or drive while using it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Support & comfy... wish it werent white though","review":"this band is great because it is not huge, can be covered by tank tops or long tops. I have used it over the belly panels in bottoms & folded the panel over it to cover it. I notice the difference without it - PAST my due date now! - & it really supports the belly weight, relieving pressure & preventing swelling & varicose veins. I move it up on the belly a bit more for more support at times as well. It is a great price for the function. Just gets so dirty... wish these were made in black or brown!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"This belt didn't seem to do anything for me.I don't feel more support. I am glad that I read reviews prior to buying this item because you really do need to get one size up otherewise it will be too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but I could not use it","review":"This band can provide back support if you are not experiencing any other issues due to pregnancy. My abdominal discomforts, especially sharp round ligament pain got worse with the band. And also, because of the pressure, I felt the urge to run to the restroom every half hour. But of course, if you are having a pain-free very comfy pregnancy, and just looking for back support, this band could be for you.The sizing info is a bit tricky. I am 5'6\\" and my pre-pregnancy size was 0-2 (occasionally 4) or XS-S. Now that I'm passed midway, I hit 136lbs, I got the size S following the chart. There is no way I could fit into smallest setting. The medium setting provided support while giving more room for the future. I think I would use the largest setting at the end of my pregnancy, but I ended up returning it because of the discomfort I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small!!","review":"I ordered the petite size.I was size 0 (pants) before my pregnancy, and 122 pounds at the time of ordering it.On the biggest setting (using the first set of loops) it is still too tight!!!I should have ordered the small! Cant use it as it hurts me so I cant say if it really works or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too small","review":"I was in the weight range for the small, but it was too tight even on the largest setting. Its great though, I would definitely recommend it, just buy 1 size bigger than you think you need based on your weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what I expected","review":"I just received my belly belt (as I like to call it) in the mail today and whipped it right out of the box to put it on. I should start by saying that I'm 5'2\\" and in my 34th week, at about 38 lbs and based on other reviewers suggestions, I ordered the medium. Glad I did. I have it on the smallest setting which will leave me a little wiggle room as I get bigger. I'm not sure what I expected from this belt, maybe a miracle. I don't feel a lot different, but I'm not sure what I thought I would feel like. I think it might be helping with my posture so far and could be supporting my belly better than if I wasn't wearing one at all, but all in all, I wouldn't call it a miracle worker. Maybe as I get bigger and wear it more often I'll come to appreciate it more. For now, I guess I'm glad I bought it and I'll just have to see how it goes. I definitely recommend getting one size up, though, as has been suggested by others."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thought given to design","review":"The band was made of very hard, uncomfortable elastic. It was poking me and binding. It should have been covered in some sort of fabric. Further, the hook and eye closures were very far apart making it difficult to get a comfortable fit. The belt was either too lose or too tight. Babies R Us has a mini belt with a velcro closure that is a much better design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited","review":"This belt was absolutely useless for my wife. her size fell between the 2 settings. it was either too tight or too loose.Though the idea of having the hooks seems like a good idea, it's not as easy as velcro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helped back pain","review":"I ordered this item along with another style of maternity belt. Even though this one seemed much more basic compared to the other, it did the trick... I work in healthcare and am on my feet for most of the the day. I started to have some minor back pain & heaviness/tightness in my low abd/upper pelvic area at the beginning of my 3rd trimester. This really helped take the load off a bit and keeps me comfortable through my work day. I followed the sizing directions, ordered a Large size. I am about 5'8\\" and 210 (beginning 3rd trimester), and this fit well on the tightest setting... with two larger options for my growing bump!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, hard to size","review":"I initially ordered a medium based on previous customer reviews about the sizing. It fit but was too loose to actually offer any support. I returned it and reordered a small. Yesterday was the first day I wore it all day, on my feet, at work and it made a HUGE difference. My back pain was barely there by the end of the day.The item has 3 different sets of hooks to adjust to the proper size and allow for room to grow. It would be very helpful if they posted some sizing recommendations in inches instead of just weight. I'm 5'9\\" and carry weight ALOT different than someone who is shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits weird","review":"Didnt fit well. 5'3\\", size small pregnancy clothes, and 140lb at 40 weeks, this never seem to fit comfortably.

When I went for a prenatal massage and evaluation - its just a knot in my back that's formed from the baby's weight and its pressing down on part of a sciatic nerve. I researched and thought I'd buy this belt because I saw the good reviews - I'm 5'5, started at 118 and am now 145 so the medium was the right choice but the belt doesn't help anything.I took it on vacation with us when I knew I'd be walking alot, wear it at my desk at work, wear it in the car, etc. but it doesn't help the pain at all and its not really supporting anything. I think something with a broader back brace and possible straps would work better so I'm going to buy the Soft Form and see if that works - sadly I threw away the packaging on this piece of crap so I can't return it - $ down the drain...sigh and no back pain relief. =("},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"The doc told my wife to get this one, and so far she loves it. very good price compared to other retailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belly Belt","review":"This belly belt saved me during the last half of my pregnancy.

This one fits me on the tightest hooks, and not knowing how much larger I'd get during pregnancy, I wanted to be more safe than sorry. In hindsight, I'd recommend ordering whatever size you are around your 7th month and hold on to the packaging so you can exchange it for a different size if needed. It really does relieve some of the weight on your back though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"This belt did not work for me.

She used the tightest setting for the belt and it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for lower back aches","review":"I began to get lower back aches in my 7th month of pregnancy. My chiropractor recommended getting a support belt (like this one). After reading the reviews for this product (and liking the price)I decided to order it. I feel as if it gives just the right amount of support without being constricting. I definitely feel the difference now when I forget to put it on! I purchased a small and weighed about 138lbs in my 7th month. I do think the sizing is a bit off on this product. I can't imagine someone over 150lbs being able to wear a small as I am already on the last hook and I am about 143lbs now in my 8th month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supports your belly","review":"I bought this when I was 20 weeks pregnant and started having horrible round ligament pain and pelvic pressure. This helped take the weight off some. I liked that it was thinner than the belly bands I already owned, though those worked well, too.I agree with previous criticisms regarding the sizing. I bought a medium instead of a small based on manufacturer's recommendations. The belt was a little loose at 20 weeks, but at 22 weeks is working fine. I think maybe buying the small and the medium might be a good option for some. They are cheap enough that you could do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"Maybe for a smaller woman it would be helpful. I am a pregnant size 14/16, xl in maternity and I noticed almost no support for my belly while wearing this. Also, it is a huge pain to move when going to the bathroom and readjusting. I would not recommend this product at all. I find the much wider belly bands with no hooks to be more supportive, and less hassle to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt help","review":"I bought the mini cradle because I was getting bigger and needed support to hold my growing belly.

I've been wearing it on and off and definitely notice a difference when I wear it. I don't feel as bad as the end of the day... The only reason it did not get five stars is that there is such a big space between the fasteners....the outer fastener is a little too loose and the inner fastener is a little too tight.

For me, the mini cradle was ill-fitting, as many other reviewers have said. The largest hook-and-eye setting was just too large, and the medium setting was far too small. Additionally, the band was uncomfortable, and I was not able to find a position that worked for me.The Boppy band was much more supportive, and it's extra width helped lift my belly more evenly than the Mini Cradle, which put a lot of pressure on one area. I'm planning to return this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked very well","review":"I was pregnant from late 2010 until May 2011.

The other reviews indicating that the belt runs small are correct. Except that I *just* hit 130 pounds, and their \\"small\\" size says it goes from \\"136 - 180 lbs\\". It is ridiculous that their sizes should be *that* inaccurate. I'm returning it, and going to buy one in a store that I can try on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relief even though I look silly","review":"I think I have found some relief from my low back and hip pain by going to the chiropractor and using this belt. I wish there were more clips because the middle setting is not tight enough and the tightest setting is too tight. I wear this because I have to, but for anyone who has the least bit of chub on their belly your prego belly will not be cute anymore. It makes my back look lumpy and my stomach looks mishaped. Regardless, I am feeling better. I am 5'1\\" and weigh 180 near the end of my pregnancy--so I bought the medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"For now...","review":"I'm only 17 weeks but wanted to try this out because I am already having sciatica. I ordered the medium based on other reviews saying the sizing was extremely small. I'm 5'8\\" pre pregnancy 145 lbs...now 155...the smallest setting is very uncomfortably tight and huge on the mid setting...it is pretty worthless to me for now (maybe when I'm a little bigger...) I ended up getting the Babies R Us support belt...it's got a lot more fabric but is extremely comfortable and fits properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Cradle","review":"I am 27 weeks pregnant and am a massage therapist. Leaning over people for 8 plus hours a day was getting very taxing. The mini cradle helps my lower abdomen and lower back feel so much less pressure from bending over! I highly recommend it to pregnant women with physical jobs, it is allowing me to work longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So uncomfortable","review":"This was the worst thing ever! I understand that it would need to be rigid enough to offer support, but this thing dug into my hips so bad! I had it on for 5 minutes before I took it off and sent it back. Look elsewhere for something different!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Order a size up!","review":"Great product - but really order a size up... I am 5 feet tall with a current weight of 113 pounds at week 29, a relative small belly and ordered size \\"Petite\\". It fits with the largest setting so I hope the band will stretch out so I can still wear it the next 10 weeks... Maybe a size \\"small\\" would have been better for me, even if I am far away from 135 pounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it should","review":"The cradle did just what it said it would do. The only thing I don't find comfortable is wearing under jeans. It's more comfortable to wear under stretch pants or under a dress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops I got the wrong size","review":"While my weight was within the guidelines, I should have gotten a size smaller. Or maybe I would have preferred the type that has a strap both above and below the belly. It just seemed like this was a bit too big. And I didn't like that it could move if I sat down with it on. For taking a walk though, it worked OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product but follow size chart","review":"I followed everyone's advice to order a size larger. I am a size 16 and 200 lbs (pre-pregnancy) which would put me in a medium. I ordered a large instead and when I got it, it gave me no support at all because it wasn't tight enough. Instead of sending it back and waiting for a different one to come in I took the last set of hooks off and sewed them back on the other side to make it tighter. After I did that, it works great and I have noticed relief from pelvic muscle pain and pain in my back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is TOTALLY OFF!","review":"I ordered the petite size 90-135 Pounds. I weigh 120 pounds and am at 28 weeks. I figured by the time I reach the end of my pregnancy I would be at or under 135 pounds (my end weight goal is 130-135 pounds according to my Dr.). I just received the prenatal cradle, and I can only hook it to the last notch. Even at the last notch, its super tight! So looks like the sizing is totally off!!!I'll obviously have to return it as there is no way I am going to be able to wear this for the next three months!!! Very unhappy, as I was really looking forward to wearing this belt and having some relief from the constant back pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this!!","review":"I'm so glad that I read the reviews and got the bigger size. I'm normally only about 125pounds and 140ish when pregnant. I do carry my babies almost entirely in the belly, but this totally saved me. With my 3rd pregnancy this saved my hips and back. I wore it all day for about 4 months, I will use it again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was worried about sizing due to other reviews...","review":"I was so worried about sizing bc there was so many bad reviews about the size being too small. I'm approx. 235lbs at 5'3\\" and I ordered the large. I can snap it on the tightest setting and still have too much room. I should have gone for the medium but the reviews scared me. I just received this product and will update everyone with how much support the product gives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my back, if it fit right","review":"Upon the recommendations here I bought the size above what was indicated for me personally, moving from a medium to a large. I am currently 34.5 weeks pregnant & am wearing the large on the smallest setting. If the belt were tighter I really think it would be helping my back, but right now it is still a bit too big. Hopefully in a couple weeks it will fit better so that I can get some relief. So, while the reviews saying to buy a bigger size might be relevant for women moving from small to medium, I think the sizing recommendation might have been more accurate for the larger sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Pre-pregnancy sizes quoted are not accurate. I ordered a small belt based on those recommendations and although I am not in 3d trimester yet the first two sets of hooks are already too tight, while the last set of hooks makes it still too lose. And since there is no velcro I can't really use it, until I get big enough to fit the last set of hooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"A day after receiving my belly band I went to my prenatal visit and was instructed by my Dr NOT to use this product. It decreases blood flow to baby, for the same reason u can't sleep on your back. His exact words were, \\"these things should be banned\\" ... Sorry to be Debbie downer just think all mommies should know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do what I thought it would...","review":"I had high hopes that this belt would help with back discomfort, but it hasn't. I think these must be for very specific types of problems. I am only 32 weeks pregnant, so it may prove more useful later. My advice is to not have very high hopes about this helping significantly--it is not very expensive, so it may be worth a try for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I opened up the small 3\\" x 3\\" box labelled \\"Its you Babe Mini Cradle, Small, New\\", and inside was a very nice roll of Scotch brand Magic Tape, 1/2 in by 450 in!

Need to know what's going on??? thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I had expected; but fascinating","review":"I was hoping for a more applied type of book and it is definitely not that. It has a lot of math theory (a little contrary to the Amazon info) and is definitely not for the math faint of heart. It implies that there isn't much math background required; but unless you have a strong background in the nomenclature and theory of sets then you'll be lost in the first few pages. I don't have a strong background in set theory so it has been very slow and a bit agonizing going. But, on the upside, it has given me a very wonderful and exciting bunch of insight into risk that I am glad I'm getting. It has been a fascinating read and adventure. I highly recommend it if you can handle the math."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again...","review":"Janet Jackson's third and last single from the ALL FOR YOU album is yet another mis-step. \\"Son of a Gun\\" samples the Carly Simon classic \\"You're So Vain\\", and also includes Carly Simon with some reworked lyrics. Overall its a poorly produced, badly sampled, jumbled mess. Definately one of the weaker songs from ALL FOR YOU. However the saving grace for fans may come in the form of the remixes, there are some decent ones here, including the Cottonbelly Vocal Remix, and the Rockwilder Mix. However, the remix featuring Missy Elliot is just pointless and jumbled as well. Sorry Janet, maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage","review":"Please do not buy this item. I am really surprised to see that there are actually some good reviews for this thing. It is so cheaply made and will not stay open. The little latch that is supposed to hold the umbrella open will not keep it open. Try using it on a shoot and you will be really embarrassed. I won't even attempt to re-sell this on Craigslist because I know whoever buys it will be disappointed. At first I thought maybe I got a bad one but then I had another photographer friend that bought one and she had the exact same problem. Suck it up and buy the Lastolite ezybox instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely RUN from this","review":"An absolute piece of garbage. I had to buy a boom stand so I could use this effectively as it barely tilts on a regular light stand. I took it outside for a shoot and the wind blew it over. 2 pieces of the rod were bent, and Westcott wanted $45 to fix it! Please. I'm better off getting a speedlight softbox off Ebay than wasting more money on this junk. Way overpriced to begin with, and such a pain to use. You have to reach inside the front of the box (pulling away the velcro holding the diffuser) to change your Speedlight settings.How anyone could recognize OR recommend this as a useful product is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wescott Apollo Review","review":"I purchased the Westcott Apollo 28\\" Light Modifier from an endorsement from one of my photography teachers that has used the product. I Used the product and found it easy to assemble and use it worked well with my canon speed lite.The only negative comment I have is the opening at the bottom that allows the stand and light to fit through is not big enough for a person such as my self to fit may large hands in a comfortable manner.I will and have recommended this product to my fellow photographers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This K Drama has was excellent all around. Jang Dong Gun was outstanding he is the cocky, suave and brilliant doctor that sometimes is a real put off. He really took his character and made him more human and made me care about what happened to him. The relationship between the brothers and their loves was very moving as well. Watch this if you want to see an emotional drama that can touch your soul. It is not like a lot k drama with lots of funny scenes just a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpening Tool","review":"I first came across this item when vacationing in Alaska and bought one.

As a cop in Portland, Oregon, Hanson squares off with the demons he brought out of the Vietnam war. But even more importantly, Anderson gives readers the most honest portrayal of life as a cop I've ever read. Be warned, NIGHT DOGS is not for the polictical correct or the weak-minded, it's for readers who want the truth, no matter how ugly that truth may be. Simply put, NIGHT DOGS is the best novel to come out of the United States in twenty years"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty police procedural of vietnam vet cop.","review":"Wonder what hour by hour police work in the roughest neighborhoods is like? Read this. Special forces vietnam vet turned Portland police officer follows his pent up rage and violence through his daily work. The atmosphere here is old styrofoam cups of cold coffee with cigarette butts floating in the oily film on top. Gritty and Good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bitter, tragic, beautifully written book.","review":"This book may suffer by somehow having ended up assigned to the mystery genre pile. It is not genre writing by any means,. In fact, it is almost anti-plotted--there is no great unraveling of mysterious deaths, no terrible villians revealed and brought to justice. Just page after page of real life crystalized by a expert chemist. What if Rimbaud was a Burnside cop? Or rather more what would an American version of the old French anti-Roman look like? Like this. Stunning book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night or Day...This book is a real dog","review":"This is the type of book that keeps you on the edge of your seat....Waiting for something, ANYTHING, to happen. Kent Anderson certainly can write words, but as far as a real story, I just could not find it. If you enjoy reading about the daily life of the main character, the ebb and the flow, by all means purchase this book. There was no real plot development, no overall story direction, just the same old daily routines with minor changes. This book reads more like the ideal Seinfeld episode...a story about nothing. If you really want to get a feel for police life, or any life, do not waste your money here. If however, you really have a desire to know how every scene in the book SMELLS, grab this book and dive right in. I do not know why, but Mr. Anderson feels the need to tell us how everything in life smells! Once you notice that he sets up nearly every scene in the book this way it can drive you crazy. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, full of devices.","review":"This may have worked as a short story. But it sure went nowhere fast as a novel. I have nothing against turning the standard storytelling method on its head, but this seems to become too self-concious of its objective after awhile. It's one of those assemblages of barely related observations of the edgy lives these cops lead. I'm sure it is a hard life, but it does not necessarily mean good fiction. It's more like a mosaic documentary that is full of irony. If you're going to do it this way, do it well! I find that some of the more proceedural style books give more irony and ambiance to this life on the streets than these more intentional styles of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed by the slow pace of this book, and the vulgarity, while maybe realistic, was just too much to take. This book will NOT end up on my shelf. I'm afraid someone will see it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"ok let me start by saying crime/mystery books are not my usual reading material. but all the rave reviews for this book along with the interesting subject matter led me to give it a try. about 10 pages in i realized that this guy is not a very talented writer. did an actual person really write this? it reads like the output of some cop-story-writing computer somewhere. so cliche, so flat, ugh! but then again it was no worse than other crime/mystery stuff i read after crime/mystery book fans gushed about them to me. but if you are a reader who likes fresh, well-written novels-- this ain't it! here's one: The Contortionist's Handbook by Craig Clevenger (interesting, \\"edgy\\" subject matter AND well-written!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Cop books I have read!","review":"Great characters, gritty action, and the low life of the streets. Hanson, an ex-special forces Vietnam veteran is a cop on the streets in Portland Oregon in the mid 70s.

When reading this book, I ran across several names I knew from the Dak Pek and Dak Seang A-Teams as well as from the Mike Force. To me this was a \\"do not put down until finished\\" project. I laughed when I read of requested air-support to destroy enemy tanks a few kilometers North of the camp only to find that the \\"tanks\\" were the same earth-moving equipment that we also had snuck up on several years prior; it truly amazed me. I recommend this book to all Vietnam vets as well as to any reader who enjoys a down to earth documentation of life in a Vietnam Special Forces A- Camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the same as Perlas Negras","review":"I felt like a fool when I received this CD, even though is an execellent recording but I already have it on another recording label and with another CD title."},{"rating":"2","title":"A piece of the puzzle","review":"I was skeptical at first, but this wedge pillow does indeed help with my acid reflux. I chose the 10\\" pillow thinking that the 7 inch would be too flat, and the 12\\" would be too high. I think I was mostly right. The 12\\" would have been way too high, but the 7\\" will be beneficial after the acid reflux is under control. So for now, the 10\\" wedge is helping to alleviate the nausea and burning that is common for GERD. It does take some getting used to, and it's best used sleeping on your back (I'm a side sleeper). I use my regular pillow right on top of it which helps if I end up turning on my side. The case is easy to remove and clean. Definitely get the convoluted foam. All in all, a very good product. And the shipping was quick. Four stars due to the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Courageous and Honest Story","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is impressively well written and quite moving. It is an honest account of one woman's struggle to find her individuality in the face of both society and religion. One feels the author's integrity and sincerity throughout. This is a courageously told story, one that weaves selected journal entries into a unified whole and in the process transforming the book into a universal journey for all people. In particular, women in similar marital situations will find encouragement from reading it. Though it was born out of nearly unbearable pain and confusion, it is truly a remarkable achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly melodic and witty","review":"You just have to love a band that, quite seriously, labels itself as \\"Gay folk church music\\". Add to that infectuous melodies, wonderfully witty and provocative lyrics (don't even ask me what Golden Streams is supposed to be about..), the on/off similarities to R.E.M.'s debut masterpiece Murmur (something about the singer's voice and the instrumentation, I think) and an overall lush, fresh and intensely unique sound and you have a must-have album for all true music lovers out there. Highlights include the fabulously melodious single Ban Marriage, The Man That I Am With My Man and The Animals of Prey. Lovely spring time music that makes you realise just how important tunes are."},{"rating":"1","title":"droll","review":"after reading all these rave reviews i had great expectations of The Hidden Cameras when i bought the cd in dec 03.how disappointed i was\\"catchy\\", \\"infectious\\", \\"melodic\\" are certainly not words i would use to describe this off-key grab-bag of droll, repetitive, self-indulgent fluffnovelty act yes. this rubbish is aural mogadon.i strongly advise any prospective purchasers to get a whiff of \\"the smell\\" before opening your wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perplexing...","review":"A really difficult, intellectually challenging album. Fascinating. Is it to be taken seriously? Or are the Romantic-style paeans (uh, pun intended...I guess) to gay fetishism to be taken with a wink? (Think Wordsworth writing for the letters section of a gay porno mag. Or Dan Savage writing a la Wordsworth.) And what of these overwrought arrangements? Mere camp? Simply bombast? Or earnest exercise? No matter: They work so wonderfully together--the ambiguity of the lyric and the lushness of the music--that they elevate what could be the reincarnation of the disposable three-chord novelty songs of Pansy Division by adding layers of texture, meaning and tone. It borders on a truly important, singular album. But, alas, only borders. My feeling: this album issues a challenge--go ahead and dismiss us...we dare you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pop Masterpiece...A Must-Have","review":"This CD is absolutely amazing. As the other reviewers have noted, there are beautiful melodies, lush instrumentation, and simply gorgeous gorgeous songs. It's not all harps and wings though, there are some poppy, infectious tracks that will force you to get up and dance (\\"Ban Marriage\\" and \\"Smells Like Happiness\\" are irresistable). This is the feel-good album of the summer. While the lyrical content might seem off-putting at first, at its core this is an album of simple, universal joys-no matter who you are, nor who you're with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Stern, the best Spidey writer","review":"Just who was the Hob-goblin? This story answers those questions and a lot more. It marked Roger Stern's return to writing Spider-Man in almost a decade.

This story was so good, I wonder if Roger would write a novelization of it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting mystery for fans of Spider-Man","review":"Hobgoblin Lives reveals the trues identity of the hobgoblin, by the writer who created him. This story takes the reader through the mystery of the Hobgoblin which went on for nearly 15 years. The book is very interesting for fans of Spider-Man and I recomend it highly. The only downside is the book may be confusing for those who have not read the origional Hobgoblin stories. If you are one of those readers I suggest you check out Spider-Man: The Origin of the Hobgoblin trade paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender, powerful memoir","review":"Why read this book? Because you had a childhood, had a mother, buy maybe you don't have the words to express all the complex feelings--both amazingly sweet and wrenchingly sad--that only a writer this gifted can fully express. The slow loss of a beloved mother to Alzheimer's Disease is a tough subject, and this book does not sentimentalize the pain. It's better than that. It tells the whole truth: the frustration, the fears, the moment you first know that the family you've known and depended upon is under seige by a frightening illness, and also the way your heart can miraculously open wide to love this much, to keep going, to visit in the nursing home and try to sing your favorite song together.

I thought that the story had some promise, but the cookie-cutter characters did absolutely nothing for me. Even worse, the dialogue was really forced and unnatural, particularly for the two brothers and the tabloid reporter. It felt like I was reading what my grandmother would say if she were trying to pretend she was my age. Overall, it seemed more like a plot for a corny soap opera written by a first-time author. I logged on to Amazon expecting to see a bunch of negative reviews and was shocked to see so many positives. Maybe somebody replaced all the pages between the covers of my copy because the story I read was boring and generic, and one of the worst pieces of fiction I've read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Another GREAT read by Fern Michaels!!

The story line was not bad, but this read like a first time author. Phil(E), Rick(E), Rox(E), Grac(E), Lain(E), it seemed like every characters name sounded the same.

Still, nobody sounds quite like Cable Regime -- their music demands patient listening in order to discern the intricate sounds & textures buried in the layers of white-hot guitar distortion. Think of a mix between Godflesh & Loop -- the spaciness of the latter & the obsessive abrasiveness of the former. The chunky industrial rhythms are featured more prominently here, making this release perhaps a little more user-friendly than in the past. Highly recommended.Some trivia: Paul Neville, one of the two guitarists, played w/ Godflesh on Streetcleaner & their self-titled debut. Justin Broadrick of Godflesh co-produced the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else.","review":"I was not happy with this product.

The rubber insert that allows it to be \\"universal\\" is not durable and wore out as I was twisting it onto the shifter, so now the shifter wobbles around and is borderline unsafe because of how loose it is. I am searching for a higher quality replacement. This was soooo disappointing. My original shifter and boot were seperate and independant of eachother, this one is not.

Doyel later contradicted homself when he got them right in laterchapters. The only thing interesting is the content of the book, but that jumps around from one year to the next and back all in the same sentence. Doyle just spit everything out onto paper and did not worry about the flow of the book. Aweful, the only reason it is interesting is because it is Duke, and Doyle does not have anything to do with that, thank goodness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coach K did not listen to Doyel","review":"Hi My name is Julio.

You constantly wonder \\"how did someone this poor at writing ever get a book published?\\". My brother gave me this as a Christmas gift. We are both Duke fans and have been since 1972.

When I first opened it I felt very happy with the picture quality, but that was short lived. My friend got a Dynex 7 inch from Best buy on the same day and belive me when he played it I was stunned by its quality. Dynex is owesome but it doens't play any movies/mp3. But I think the digital frame is not required to play all those, it is meant for viewing pictures. I would rate this 2 star as far as picture quality is concerned. It really turned off my exictement. ASTAR should have concentrated on the quality of screen, when you have the pictures in widescreen it gets streched a bit and looks bit ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition - No Pictures","review":"The story is great, but I really missed the pictures.

That is really too bad because part of the story is about the photographer. The worst part, though, is the formatting on the Kindle. It is a disaster. It is left justified, and badly at that. There is not any indentation for paragraphs and no separation between paragraphs. The result is that each page looks like a messy column of words.

I think it's supposed to be remastered but it doesn't sound all that great. It's very tinny in the high-range and kinda hollow in the mid-range.

This DVD gives you no extras either, it is 14 minutes and that is it.

The music is primitive but ok for most listeners, arrangements are poor and the sound quality could be better (it's a live record, after all). However cheerful the music in this release may be, it can mislead international listeners into thinking that it's about everything brazilian music has to offer. It's like saying that the american culture is limited to Britney Spears or the Backstreet Boys, for example. Try any Milton Nascimento or Chico Buarque release and hear how the famous brazilian beat can be used in the context of intelligent folk music - that is, in case clever music is what you're in the market for, of course. If what you're looking for are teeny up-tempo songs for playing at your party, then this CD is the way to go.

If you plan on installing in your kitchen, get something else with UV protection. Haier has a higher end model that does feature UV glass. Too bad because I think it's very stylish and understated and actually nicer looking than the higher end model.The main thing to remember here is that you need to either situate this in a dark place (a basement would be better than a garage since your electric bill will be less) or you need to plan on using it only for short-term wine storage -- very important fact to remember in deciding on models to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Simple Design","review":"I ordered this from Amazon as a gift.

The box was a little mangled but there were no problems with breakage or malfunctioning once I plugged it in.The temperature controls are easy to set, and although the temp does range approx 5 degrees between cycles of turning on/off, a variance this small will not affect how wine ages.

However the writer's style became very tiresome. Poetic and repeated adjectives get old after a while, and the author seems to be trying to inpress his reader with his use of flowery and clever descriptions. I found it repetetive, and hard to read. I love history and have been a psychiatric professional for 35 years, so my interest level was high. The author should have included the diagnostic criteria for some of the diagnoses which were being used so often in those years, which bear little resemblance to todays criteria. A great accomplishment however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I have read many books on WWI, and this is one of the better ones. The maps are adequate, and there are many black and white photos, a good number of which I hadn't seen before. The book was easy to read and the writing carried me along. The book gave the best explanation for the failure of the Nivelle Offensive that I have ever encountered. Every front gets at least some mention in the book.In terms of negatives, the discussion of 1918 seemed a little rushed to me, almost as though the author was trying to meet a publication deadline, and unlike the rest of the book the sequence of events at times was a little hard to follow. In one of the few misprints, on p 175, Richthofen is credited with only 16 kills.All in all, a good introduction or a quick read for a buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle version is missing all the photos","review":"I've purchased another Kindle book that had no photos, but it was clearly stated in the item description that they were missing.

To this very day I gladly submit myself to their charms."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 1980s revisited!","review":"This album by the Go-Gos (probably the #1 female group of the 1980s) is a fun mix of top-flight dance/new wave music of the era.

You'll hear this music from time to time on oldies stations (alas, were the 80s really that long ago!?).Think back to those happy times or discover this genre of music for the first time as you listen to the Go-Gos.

From the first track to the last, this is an excellent CD.Plenty of the songs became prolific in the early 80s, and even the tunes that didn't hit are excellent. \\"How Much More\\" and \\"Fading Fast\\" are two of the greatest songs that are often overlooked from this album.Overall, GREAT album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like new","review":"The spring inside my original pop-up drain stopper was broken and the gasket was torn, so I opted for this replacement, which is about the same price for the entire assembly as for the gasket alone from another retailer.I unscrewed the \\"chrome plated\\" plastic cap from this one, and my original decorative top threaded right on to the new assembly - works like new!I can't speak to how durable the chrome-plated plastic top is, as I only bought the item for the base assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many lollipops-too funny for words!","review":"This Henry the Duck book is a personal favorite of mine.

The authors took the pictorial geometric approach throughout the book. Now, geometry of this kind (pictures in two dimensions) may tell us why a result should be true, but it has serious limitations towards proving results rigorously.

Don't bother - not enough here to make it worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart has its reasons, reason knows not why.","review":"Whatever one writes about this work, will be inadequate as it will tend to reduce it to a plot, or a sociological analysis. It is an intense emotional experience for the reader, as it deals with the inability of most of us to connect (see E.M.Forster) made evident in the characters drawn by Mr Trevor. The reader, however, is made privy to the feelings and thoughts of the characters in such a way, in such detail especially of the everyday reality of domestic life, that one aches with them, suffers loss with them, and so on. Thus the reader, becomes as it were, Lucy herself as she explores life through the novels she reads, but the reader,not being Lucy, knows what she does not have in terms of lover, brother, sister, child and so on. Does that make sense? Perhaps not. The heart has its reasons, and reason knows not why.If you don't want your heart squeezed, don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Plodding Misery","review":"I loathed this book so much that I was compelled to come here and write a review. I'm on page 212 and I don't think I can bear to make it to the end (page 228). With every ponderous page, I feel more irritated at the stupid, foolish plight of the dull and lifeless characters. The author never lets us into the head of Lucy herself--who one would assume from the title might be the main character! In this book, people sit around doing basically nothing for 20-30 years. If this is supposed to be a sad paean to missed opportunity, it fails. Rather, I regret my own missed opportunity at buying a book with a semblance of drama. Some critics adored this piece of tripe; I can't fathom how it held their interest even for 228 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you appreciate dullness, this book will fascinate you","review":"This was the first book by William Trevor that I've read. I do not anticipate reading anything else that he publishes. The plot has been stated numerous times, and is really not worth repeating here. The first 30 pages of this book are interesting and somewhat engaging. After that, it is simply a chore to read. It is the sort of book that one keeps reading because they expect something will happen. Alas, nothing does, and when the book is closed the story is soon forgotten.If one believes their life is totally useless, uneventful, and without meaning, then read this book as it is bound to ease your depression. Surely no one has ever had a life as truly boring and dismal as Lucy Gault's.Quite frankly, I'm still perplexed as to exactly how this book was ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"just one star","review":"I am from Ireland - visiting the US for a year and read this book (or tried to) for a local bookclub. I have never read anything by William Trevor before and wasn't sure what to expect. I had recently seen \\"The Big House\\", a play by Lennox Robinson, at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin - a much more realistic depiction of the Anglo-Irish than Trevors.The plot was so implausable that it immediately lost my interest. His Prose style is annoying and ploddingly repetitive.As for this book being shortlisted for the Booker prize - It makes me wonder about how good a prizewinning book really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and fatalistic","review":"I promised myself I would NOT read anymore Irish novels and I wish I had kept that promise. Trevor's fatalistic characters really make me angry. I can't accept that the parents in this book wouldn't try harder to find out what happened to their child, or that the lawyer helping the child wouldn't try harder to find the parents. And Lucy's so-called life!! Ugh!! Or as I would like to say to her, \\"Get a life!\\" What's with these Irish old maids? I don't get it.I read the entirel 227 pages, but I never really felt like picking the book up after about page 50. Soooo boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"As the first novel I have read by William Trevor, The Story of Lucy Gault has me hungering for more by this incredible writer. Trevor's prose is so flawless, so poetic, so captivating that it was impossible for me to put this novel at rest. At its conclusion, I felt for Lucy: incredible feeling and emotion. When you feel for a character, when you're haunted after the last page of the novel, you know the writing is timeless.When you read this book, not only watch what the characters do, but also focus on what they DON'T do. Those decisions are as vital to the story as what occurs. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magisterial beginning, weak middle, great ending","review":"This novel starts and ends on a magisterial note. Too bad about that middle part. William Trevor's elegiac novel feels like a short story wearing a tractor tire inner tube. Let it be said - the beginning is a thing of rare beauty. To a lesser extent the end. Trevor is, I think, more highly regarded for his short stories than his novels, though I've never read one that knocked my socks off. This one could have, though, if only he hadn't inserted the needless 250 pages in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left with an empty feeling","review":"A very sad story on many fronts. A little hard to get into, and once the story develops the plot does not get much better. I kept wanted to yell at the parents to get over themselves and get on with life. Losing a loved one - esepcially a child - is tragic, but eventually life has to go on. Frustrating in that the solution to happiness was so close (the parents could have come home, Lucy could have married her dream guy) and yet it seemed the author did not want his characters happy. Even after the reunion, the story leaves the reader feeling incomplete at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make myself finish ...","review":"Boring, boring, boring. It was a struggle to read the two-thirds I managed to finish and I finally had to give up because I just didn't care. I very rarely give up on a book but this one was just unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I'm sorry, but I guess I just don't get it. Trevor's prodding prose is often beautiful, but the story is a little hard to follow. This is the stuff that legends are made of? And whatever happened to character development? I didn't really care for any the characters nor did I care what happened to them. And *that's* my standard for judging a book a good read. Can't really give it a thumbs-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough but too bad","review":"This is the first of Mr Cox' books I've read, and I really can't see how he's got this far without improving his style. He is quite inventive, but his descriptions are awkward and often repetitive, and the liberal salting of references to \\"Star Trek\\" episodes read as if he had a fixed quota of them to insert.He does write Q well, and the book passes the basic test of making me want to read on....but I'll be gritting my teeth, and hoping for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of Fresh Air","review":"Although I agree that the middle drags a bit, I found this novel to otherwise be outstanding. The characterizations were dead on and I actually enjoyed receiving an explanation for the Calamarain's interest in Q, even if it is not officially a part of Star Trek canon. I highly recommend this book to anyone craving an in-depth experience with Q and Q Q..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Peter David's Q novels this one is for you!","review":"Any fan of the Q books by Peter David will like this one. While it's written by another fan favorite; Greg Cox, I have to say I did enjoy the verbal arguments that both Picard and Q were in. Greg handles them quite well. I never got to see Greg at a convention; however after seeing an interview on one of the Star Trek DVD's, he impressed me. I liked him because he's a true Star Trek fan. He's not pretentious or arrogant like some authors are. If you read this book you won't be disappointed.

I enjoyed the most the personality of La Draga, the healer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"This book starts out telling of the sack of Rome and grabbing the reader's attention. It's all down hill from there. The next third of the book is a long drawn out build up with very little of the book actually dedicated to the finale of the build up. The there is this a bit of drawn out rambling that leads into a sudden ending of the book. It was almost as if the writer either got tired of writing and gave up, or she just didn't know how to end it, so she just ended it. I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully Written; But Could Have Used A Plot","review":"No one can fault the author's command of the English language; she writes beautifully.Unfortunately, like others, about half way through the book, I became anxious for a plot - which seemed to have disappeared along with the Rome the characters knew and loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started strong but had to make myself finsh...","review":"I read the first third of this book very quickly.

I tried to like it. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.","review":"Typically, I love this genre of literature. However, I found this novel very difficult to finish. The story started out strong, but quickly grew very monotonous. I had a hard time connecting with the characters, and did not feel that a detailed enough picture was painted of 16th century Venice, which made everything seem kind of one-dimensional. This is certainly not the worst book I've ever read, but it definitely one of the more boring ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Dunant has a knack for writing stories that wander from here to there, with no traditional \\"plot,\\" yet which still are engaging for as long as they last. Her descriptions are wonderfully vivid, and most of her dialogue rings true. There are a few moments that seem melodramatic or stilted, and she's guilty more than once of hinting and hinting at something the narrator knows but which s/he isn't ready to let us in on yet. Some people call it building suspense--I call it hiding the ball. We should know as much as the characters know. Her endings tend to be less than satisfying, but the other 85% of the book makes up for it. Time well spent in 16th century Venice and Rome.I could have done without the gratuitously-thrown-in Shakespeare reference, though. Seeing as how he wasn't born until 30 years after this novel takes place."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to love it...but didn't","review":"Great concept for a novel, but didn't live up to my expectations. SLOW and shallow, there were so many layers for the author to play with to make this a really rich tapestry of a novel, befitting Venice itself, but ultimately she falls short. For example bringing in Titian more would have been interesting, and making a portrait of her as a metaphor for Venice at that time. A snapshot of a moment in time. For a historical novel, she didn't really impress me much with her historical knowledge...I picked up my 'Palaces of Venice' by Peter Lauritzen and frankly found it more compelling. I would honestly skip this book given the opportunity again, but I was halfway through it, and just kept reading hoping to get a return on my time investment...In the end I really wanted to love it, but didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"This is my first novel by Dunant. A good friend loves everything that is written by her. I have to agree. Wonderful writing and a most enjoyable story. Loved learning about Venice and Rome."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*","review":"After reading \\"The Birth of Venus\\" I was in awe of Sarah Dunant. So when \\"In the Company of the Courtesan\\" came out, I couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately for me, this book is the very definition of \\"dull.\\" The story is told by a dwarf who is the companion to a courtesan...yeah, ok. Reading about either character separately might have been interesting, but smashed together it was a mess.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I second the \\"Yuck\\" reviewer ....","review":"I had to stop at page 100. The characters are deplorable - as is the plot. I could care less if the down and out prostitute can rebuild her business. There was no one likable in this book. The Birth of Venus was so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I felt dirty reading this book, not because of the subject matter, prostitution, but because of the imagery the author created. It was an unappealing and a tedious read. i didn't care about any of the characters and the ending was anticlimatic. It is so unfortunate because i really enjoyed, \\"The Birth of Venus.\\" I thought I finally found an author whose historical fiction would capture my interest and hold it throughout any of her books. I only finished it because I had to for my book club, otherwise, I would have put it down and not finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but not great","review":"I liked this book. The story starts off in Rome when the city is being invaded. A courtesan saves her life by cooking and turning her tricks on the soldiers. She is able to flee with her trusted companion, a midget. She goes to Venice where she is from and starts a new life. She is very sucessful but also feels she should be entitled to a life of love. I read the another book written by the same author and it is one of my favorites. This was not as good but still worth the time. However, I thought the ending was a little too predicatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acceptable","review":"The beginning held my attention well enough, but about halfway through the book I gave up and skipped to the end. Excellent characters and interesting research, but Fiammetta and Bucino drown in a web of plot lines. More like a few episodes of a TV show than a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing if you loved Birth of Venus","review":"None of the characters are very sympathetic or appealing in Dunant's latest book. I found the use of \\"courtesan vernacular\\" somewhat vulgar; which took away from, rather than adding to, the period feel of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same","review":"I must admit that I didn't finish this book. It was just more of the Birth of Venus formula..corrupt men, corrupt church and enough erotica to titillate.For all her research , these novels are pure fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Fest...","review":"I hate leaving books half read so I had to REALLY push mysef to finish this. I found myself trying to read as fast as I could just so I could finish. She gets points becuase it was well written, and she paints a pretty picture of the history and scenery of that time. The characters were boring, the plot was boring, which means I was bored. I think I would have felt differnt if the story were told from the Courtesan herself rather than her pimp dwarf?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie does Venice","review":"I heard Sarah Dunant interviewed on NPR, and I thought a book about a prostitute and a dwarf in 16th century Italy had to be interesting, so I chose to review this book for my book club before I read the book myself. I was disappointed. It was pretty much the standard story of the prettiest girl around, this time she's a pro, and the cast includes a few historical figures. I was able to rescue my presentation by researching the cosmetics, undergarments, fashions, and mortality rates of 16th century Italy, and wrote my own supplement to the rather lame story. Too bad the author didn't include these fascinating historical facts in her novel. They were much more interesting than the superficial story she told. (They brushed their teeth with crushed stone, their make up had lead in it, and they would paint blue \\"veins\\" over their white painted skin to appear more pale, for example.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"entertaining, but not nearly as good as Birth of Venus","review":"An easy, enteraining read, but a weak plot and characters that lacked reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Researched Historical Novel","review":"Sarah Dunant's novel mixes real and fictional characters in a story set in sixteenth century Italy in the Cities of Rome and Venice. Among the actual characters featured in this novel is Titian, the famous Italian painter known for his nudes. Dunant explores the life of a Courtesan and her friend and confidante, Bucino, a male dwarf. The story is told from Bucino's first person perspective, and manages to give a lot of insight into the mores, architecture, food and daily life of the period. The book is well written and shows that the author took the time to do her research on the period. The story line was interesting enough although it held no surprises. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy historical novels by authors such as Jean Plaidy and Norah Lofts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bask in the wonder and exoticism of 16th-century Venice","review":"What an unlikely pair--a beautiful courtesan and a homely dwarf. Yet the love and unwavering devotion that exist between them will touch your heart. With outrageous spunk these two, Fiammetta and Bucino, take on Venice after the sack of Rome drives them from their native city. The harrowing adventure in store for them is a real treat for both the senses and the imagination.From its hair-raising opening to its poignant ending, \\"In the Company of the Courtesan\\" takes the reader on a journey that will keep you enthralled on every page. Lovers of Venetian history will not want to miss this.Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The book started out with much promise but Dunant could not sustain the momentum and halfway through the characters lose their appeal. Dunant's writing style is exquisite but a good book needs more than a way with words. It needs endearing characters and a captivating tale, and Dunant failed to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"The latest undiscovered Guitar God!!","review":"Monte Montgomery is the next guitar God from Austin, TX. I have seen him play a Stevie Ray Vaughn tune better than Stevie himself, and on a ratty, beat up acoustic guitar to boot. I have never seen or heard an acoustic guitar played more cleanly or more acurately or with greater speed. His composing is new and different - he clearly has developed his own style. Listen for his use of chimes - you'll miss it if you aren't paying attention. Unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately), it is not top 40 airplay material. You have to see him live to appreciate his true mastery of the instrument. His energy does not come across on the recording. Also, his bassist, Chris Maresh, is phenomenal! Chris also plays for Eric Johnson, and is working on a CD himself. Get this CD and spread the word!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lyrical content, arrangement & world class guitar","review":"Remarkable Guitar Work, Strong Lyrics, Great Vocal Presentation with Original arrangements.

Monte Montgomery plays the hell out of a guitar, but he does it in a way that compliments his songs instead of dominating them. Very addictive music. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoulda been 5 stars.","review":"Like most of the others, I saw Monte on Austin City Limits. He blew me away. I've never heard anybody play an acoustic guitar like that. He makes that Alvarez hum. I am sort of let down by the album though. You don't really get a taste of his full talents until the last song. Then you get a good 8 minutes of close-your-eyes-and-listen licks. I don't understand why they held him back. Maybe it'll take a live album to capture the full Monte. Until then, he's the best kept secret in the music business. I really hope he eventually gets his due."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best music I've listened to in years!","review":"This sounds like anything but a debut CD.

His vocals are great, but his guitar playing ability really sets him apart. He's the best guitarist I've seen. The guy is on par w/ Clapton. Outstanding! This cd is much better than Mirror. If you're new to Monte get this one first. I must add that his cd is not as good as the live shows. If you ever get a chance to see him live take it. The cd lacks the spontaneous guitar solos Monte breaks out in live performances. I saw him play alone once and honestly, he wasn't at much of a loss without his band. He sounds like 10 people playing at once. Great work Monte! Let's just hope he gets signed by a decent label... quick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Talent","review":"Monte Montgomery has it all - the melodies, the lyrics, the voice, the guitar vitruosity. Monte doesn't try to prove how fast he can play - when Monte plays guitar it's a memorable melody that fits the structure of the song perfectly. I've been listening to this one since it was first released and it's still in my CD player. If you love and appreciate good music, buy this. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guitar playing is good, music itself is not appealing","review":"When I saw Monte Montgomery playing his guitar on a television special, I was captivated. I just had to get his CD. Soooo, I hopped on to Amazon, read some reviews of his music, and bought this CD. Alas, the power of his guitar playing appeals to me more visually than audibly. I was disappointed in the songs on the album and, while I count myself a fan of his guitar playing, I can't say I count myself a fan of his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austin City Limits.","review":"I saw Monte on Austin city limits, he impressed me so much with his style and musical ability I immediately purchased this album. When I received the album and listened to it, I was immediately discoraged by the music before me. Hearing his music on Austin City Limits was wonderful, this studio recording exposed so much more of Monte than I had wanted to see. I could ne understand the lyrics which offered me no real insight and came across as sing sony and every veres of every stanza rhymed, no creative ways around wording was attempted, or at least it seemed that way. About the recording, my personal preference is geared towards a cleaner more natural sound, not acoustic, but not full of compression and other things to that nature. I wouldn't reccomend this album to anone, listen to it first, then buy, and definitly don't go buy his great performance on Austin City limits."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is just [bad] pop music","review":"Well you would think with all the glowing reviews that this guy is someone special, well ok he can play a guitar( acoustic), so can thousands of others, its just [bad] pop and love songs , there is no depth or get go, only one track (the last )is ok and thats because he hardly sings and actually plays, otherwise this is [bad] stuff, i own over 1000 cds and this one is going bye byes, its not blues, soul, jazz,or rock its just boring and annoying, . if you like music with depth, then stay well away from this.i say listen b4 you even consider buying this. whats with edits note! do you want the truth or not?.freedom of speech , seems not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed out loud at many parts of this wonderful novel","review":"Angels are real, and God is dead, and therein lies a tale. Like Odysseus before him, the captain in this book finds himself going from one improbable situation to the next, dealing with various groups and individuals who would thwart his purpose. The difference is the captain in Morrow's novel does so with aplomb and a sideways glance at everything that happens. I laughed out loud at many points in this satirical novel that sends up just about every major religion, government and even societal institutions like McDonald's and societies that reenact wars or battles of the past. Combine all of that with images straight out of Gulliver's Travels and you have a tiny idea of all that is contained in this wonderful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreverant and entertaining.","review":"James Morrow's story is startingly original. God is dead, and his lifeless and massive body has fallen into the Atlantic Ocean. Anthony Van Horne, a disgraced oil tanker captain, is recruited by the angel Raphael to tow His body to a final resting place in the Arctic. The ensuing Odyssean voyage challenges the crew's perceptions about God and morality. The result is a divine exploration of the theory that religion is the opiate of the masses.As original as the story is, it never quite rises to the grandeur of its themes, which isn't necessarily a criticism. This is a pleasant and entertaining reading experience, not a dour theocratic and philosophical analysis. Morrow seems to have sacrificed a degree of depth in exchange for loads of irony and dark comedy - not a bad trade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damned, funny","review":"James Morrow is going to Hell and I want to go with him. This book is profoundly sacreligeous and achingly funny at the same time. From the practical aspects of hauling a five-mile corpse to the eschatological implications of deophagia, Morrow keeps you thinking and laughing at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific book for the open minded","review":"Towing Jehovah was a terrific read, with imaginative twists, humor and thought provoking moments all the way through. No other author I've read writes with the imaginative freedom of James Morrow.

Very innovative author. Imagine: God is dead, his corpse is about 2 miles long, afloat in the ocean, and Vatican is worried that it will get spoiled! Interesting characters are involved, including an intellectual Jesuit priest, a drunkard sailor, a nun, and many others. Interesting situations are conceived all the time. And yet none of that quite works: the bits and pieces don't fit together. The characters and the situations are not explored well, there is no inner logic to the book, and you never really get involved. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor man's Vonnegutt","review":"Yawn. I got bored with this book before I was off the first page. The premise sounded interesting, but there is a constant preachy undercurrent of self-rightiousness running through the book that makes it get old really, really fast. Besides, the book isn't even funny, just preachy. Do yourself a favor and re-read something by Vonnegutt if you want biting wit. It will be time better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, they can't all be diamonds","review":"Would you just look at that cover? Now that's just a work of art. Someone put their graffic art degree to good work right there. And the summary? What an idea! The death of God, and a handful of characters from all walks of life learning to deal with it; this book appears to be clarion call for our decade. It's a pity that it's just plain badly written. Each character is mind-numbling one dimensional, to a degree that I wondered if it was intentional. No. No, it's not. The writing style itself is so drab that it becomes a painful experience to get through. Conceptually speaking, the book is excellent. Morrow has the artist's touch and envisions scenes that are both intellectually stimulating as well as aesthetically arousing. However, the characters and diction do the text no good. I wonder if it would have been better as a film.All in all, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Salman Rushdie of Christendom","review":"Towing Jehovah is the most thought-provoking and heart-rending take on God and man since Christ cried out \\"Father, why hast thou forsaken me?\\" It is also profoundly funny. Morrow is as hard on the atheists threatened by God's existence as he is on the Christians threatened by his apparent demise. He uses up-level puns and pyrotechnic language worthy of Tom Robbins. Morrow's religious ficiton has won many awards from the speculative fiction community, but he has yet to find the wide audience he really deserves. I think it's time to start sending copies of Towing Jehovah to prominent Christian fundamentalists. Only when he becomes as hunted as Salman Rushdie will his hilarious and thought-provoking takes on religion find the audience they deserve: Those millions of Americans who only read books someone tells them they shouldn't"},{"rating":"2","title":"a BIG surprise!","review":"God, a 2 mile giant, croaks and floats in the ocean.

Vance is a wealthy, but rather cynical, connoisseur in the arts and finer things of life. He has another hobby, though, helping the New York assistant district attorney solve complex murders.This book focuses more on Philo Vance, showing the reader what to expect in the mysteries to follow. S.S. Van Dine, whose real name was Willard Hunting Wright, while writing mysteries, was also an art critic, and it shows in this book. The whole first chapter concerns Vance's view of the art world.The plot involves that of Alvin Benson who found dea sitting in a chair in his living room. He still has a book in his hand and seems at first glance to be enjoying a leisurely read. It is up to Philo Vance to help the police discover who shot him at close range with a Colt 45 pistol.The book is rather dated but is also an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to the Golden Age of the Whodunnit","review":"A mystery about fans of mysteries.

The story was OK --not up to usual standards, but all right, until the end. The last paragraphs reveal a slap-together out-of-the-blue ending which sort of washes over all that happened up till then.

The \\"locked-room\\" aspect of the book was very well done, and Peter Lovesey is an excellent author. I love Peter Diamond, but that's where I felt the book fell down a bit. I read these books because Peter Diamond is such a wonderful character, but I found that he wasn't as real in this one as in the previous three that I've read. He's still an accident-prone curmudgeon, but I didn't see the human side as much. Maybe that's because we didn't see much of his wonderful wife Stephanie . She is a wonderful foil to the irascability of Diamond. But the book is good nontheless. It's a page-turner and keeps you guessing until the end.

I expected the photos to be colour, like the calendars, and contain relevant, well written captions from classic American fiction. The book does contain some beautifully written snippets, but again, I prefer the excerpts in the calendar. Those in the book seem to be there solely because they make reference to a porch!

Althougth the sound is very different from Neurosis albums the mood is quite the same, very dark and longing for transcendance.

Having grown up in the 50's and traveled by train with my family on numerous occasions, I was deeply moved by the images and stories of the Pullman Porters. The interviews, flashbacks, dramatic depictions were extremely well done, and I particularly noticed the excellent photography and narratives. My own recollection was that the Pullman Porters were highly regarded, and I had a sense of sincere respect and safety in their presence, even as a young child. It is so interesting to see that the fruits of their hard work and sometimes excessive discipline, are the many successful sons and daughters who can now tell their beautiful and touching stories. The filmmakers of Rising From The Rails deserve an Academy Award. I am ordering a number of DVD's to send to friends and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topical and Misleading.","review":"At the conclusion of the \\"Rising From the Rails\\" DVD, I came to the conclusion I had purchased an infomercial for the author's book. Dispite a couple of heart-felt testomonials, this production lacked any balance to aid the viewer's perception of the atrocious working conditions which were common place during the industrial revolution. No reference was made of the European immigrants that were mutilated or killed in the coal mines, foundries, and railyards which supported the railroads the porters rode upon. I would suspect the author misled many viewers that racial inequality in those times was exclusively towards African Americans, when infact it also existed for significant numbers of European imigrants. I expected the storyline to contain other personal experiences such as the train wreck victim experience, rather than percieved racial inequities of the period. Unfair and unbalanced production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asian Front","review":"I enjoyed all the WW III books, but and this one of no exception. THe characters are interesting, like Aussie and the Brentwood Brothers, and technology is very accurate and in-depth. However, I noticed that Slater has a tendency to counter items he has written before and ignore information in previous books. I was constantly looking back to earlier chapters and earlier books because i could have sworn that that character had died already (Sonarman Rogers dies like four different times). Over looking these minor problems, the books are very interesting and engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"All I have to say is JIVEjones is awesome on this CD!

The band is experimenting with slower tempos and other instruments such as the horn section featured in the opening track \\"Miami,\\" but what appears to be missing is the passion, drive, and energy this band used to be able to capture in the studio. Some of the songs such as \\"Pretty Girls,\\" and \\"Don't Loose Touch\\" have that Against Me! feel, but the majority of the album just drags on, plus the whole \\"betrayed by fans cuz they assume we've sold out\\" topic is extremely prominent and gets old fast.

This album smells worse than garbage left outdoors on a sunny Miami afternoon.Against Me! seems to have lost all their passion, and a number of songs convey a feeling that they \\"don't want to do this anymore.\\"The only good song on the album is 'How Low'. Problems, Justin, and Violence contain about 50% of the talent they showed on previous albums (if that). Joy is the biggest joke of all (previously untitled track which debued Live on a WKDU radioshow on January 31st, 2004) because of how quickly produced it sounds, and every other track repressents only about 25% of their former selves.If you are itching for more Against Me!, I suggest purchasing an old EP, 7\\" or 12\\" that you've never heard before, or pray that they release a new album in the near future that lives up to their old standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I dont hate the album. it just seems lazy. its not that bad but knowing they could easily do better is dissapointing. i know they took their time and stuck with \\"fat\\" but the CD sounds so much like they are going through the aingsty anarchist motions that it is far from relivent.

Yes this book can rightly be considered the BIBLE of hip-hop history. Not only is it informative and entertaining, but it's done with tongue-in-cheek humor.Now the reason why my review is biased is because I'm fortunate enough to be listed in this book. In 1983 I was part of the group Rickey G & the EverLOVING 5 MC's and we recorded the single \\"To The Max\\". Well... as far as I knew it was played a couple of times by Mr. Magic in New York, and that was about it. Yet lo and behold it's listed on the Holy Grail that is Hip Hop's Greatest Singles by Year (1983). The Editor's of this book have Exquisite Taste... but that's just my humble opinion.

The author, however, makes no apology and rightfully so for it's length.

I don't feel bad anymore for struggling with it back in 1973. Self absorbed navel gazing, as others mentioned, is exactly what this is. It REALLY drags towards the end.

I followed the program this book advises. My blood sugar levels have dropped to normal ranges, 85 to 110. My blood pressure is back to a normal range also. I have even had to quit taking Amaryl because my blood sugar levels were getting too low. I have also lost 22 pounds in about five weeks.

This story was a joy to read because of the realism, as well as the deep emotion Dr. Smith's writing evoked. His easy familiarity with the times, people, historical events and even the syntax in the dialogue made me feel, as I read this novel, as if I were actually there. The characters are many-faceted and multi-dimensional, so that the reader is able to share the triumphs as well as the tragedies that occur during the unfolding of the story. If you love history mingled unerringly with a realistic human story, this is a great book that is not only entertaining, but makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewelry making info book","review":"This book is a very helpful resource for those who make jewelry.

McKinley has great insight into the mind of the busy parent.

I thought maybe it was too late (at least for my 22 and 20 year olds, but I have confirmed that one main key is to stop procrastinating and start right away!).

I rather doubt it. I have never been impressed with her writing, and her grasp of grammar is tenuous at best, but some of her books have been at least entertaining. Not so in this case--I'm having trouble getting through this slender volume. The story is simplistic, the characters superficial. The author gives us glimpses into her supposedly bright heroine's thoughts, but she seldom does more than state the obvious.There is something that has been bothering me about this series, but I haven't been able to put my finger on it until this, latest entry. The setting is supposed to be contemporary, the heroine youngish. Yet, the feeling and tone is not comtemporary, and the language and syntax of the thirty-something characters is much older. I'm not saying I want to hear a lot of bad language--I don't, but the lack of timeliness is jarring to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popped","review":"Having received this book in a package of three from my book club, and being too lazy to send it back, I read it. I've not read any of Ms. Clark's books, and if this is an example of her work, I will not read her again. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the excellent writers I am in the habit of chosing to read, but if this lady can get publised, then my dog, Bob, has an excellent chance. The characters are cartoonish and one- dimensional, the setting and plot are ridiculous, and the writing juvenille. I've read better dialogue in children's books. I slogged through it, however, mainly so I could know what I was talking about when writing this review. And in the words of Bart Simpson, it was \\"craptacular\\".

It would have been great if it had pan/tilt/zoom, but it doesn't, and the only cameras that I could find that have those features are much more expensive. It is what it is, I guess.All in all, it's a great security camera for the money. I plan on putting up several of them around my house.Here is a suggestion to purchasers of this camera: Get a 7 lb 3M removable hook that has the \\"sticky tape\\", and use the tape to mount the camera. That way you don't have to put holes in your walls, and you can move the camera to a different location at any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely amazing little camera...","review":"The Axis 207MW is well worth the price, in my opinion. While it may lack the PTZ options of higher-end options such as the Axis 213 and offerings from Panasonic, the crisp resolution, size, and MPEG-4/audio support make it the perfect wireless network camera for those looking at a home and small business solution. Take into account its easy setup and plentiful viewing options, and you'll find it very hard to beat for the quality and money.If you're looking for a megapixel outdoor camera--especially one featuring two-way audio and interchangeable C-mount lenses, without care about wireless capability--you might want to look at the Axis 211M. It's the only non-dome camera offered by Axis that comes close to the 207MW.For everyone else, however, this camera will serve you quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless camera did not work","review":"I purchased this camera because of its supposed wireless capabilities.

I corresponded with tech support at Axis for two weeks. After about 12 emails back and forth attempting to get the thing to work, I gave up and returned the camera.All of my wireless computers worked perfectly. My Tivo wireless adapter worked. My iPhone works wirelessly. I have six wireless devices connected to my home LAN, and they all work perfectly. Not so for this Axis wireless camera.If you are looking for a wireless camera that works, look somewhere else.

Wireless was important since I did not wish to run extra cables to the location. While the camera did 'work', it was consistently for only a short period of time before it would consistently drop the connection with the router. Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes a few hours. I am familar with routing, port numbers and such which by the way for a novice can be quite overwhelming. I also have a older wired ethernet Axis ip camera which throughout the years has worked flawlessly. But this one is a dud. Other reviews suggested that it does work when wired to the ethernet connection.

Some metion Dylan as a reference, but there's nothing folk about it. It uses bits of most American pop of the last 50 years and kicks it out in a shambling, drunken, druggie, classic punk rock song fest. It pretty much rocks. If you drink, smoke and like rock n' roll, you'll like this a lot. If you jog, meditate and eat vegetables, you'll still probably like it.

That's the law, so be it. It could make for an interesting courtroom drama as a top legal firm defends itself against violating this law when it dismissed an attorney who concealed his AIDS infection. But what the movie does is politicize the case by using it to denounce the US as homophobic, racist, and oligarchic, plus sentimentalize a homosexual who did not protect himself against AIDS.

I highly recommend all of his CD's as well as the outstanding Hacienda Brothers CD's that he did with Dave Gonzalez. The world lost a true talent earlier this year when Chris passed away. Those who have taken the time to discover his excellent music will miss him and cherish what he released during his lifetime. I highly recommend that you check out this release.

I approached it hesitantly, not expecting much except one or two new tips. What I experienced was an inspirational and emotional event, a journey into the behind-the-scenes look at true indie filmmaking as it was in the 1960's. I know most of the film's fans are surfers. I am not. But I enjoyed this film nonetheless. In fact there were moments where I felt like I'd missed out on something great in the 1960's. More importantly, for independent filmmakers who struggle with the same old notions of how to make and distribute a film, this film offers tremendous insight into out-of-the-box self-distribution. I find this film as valuable, if not more so, than the Robert Rodriguez director commentaries and books. Buy it! You'll want to watch and listen over and over again, but not just for the beautiful waves and scenery. You'll want to watch for the brilliant information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Charlotte - \\"songbook\\"","review":"This a Songbook with the musical notes and lyrics!

He remains, for the deepreader, the best writer on racial traits that the human race has produced. All his books arebig in scope and thought provoking. He backed a theory that sank like a stone, but his writingsoutside that theory set the model for all other big books on insights into human evolution,racial traits and ethnic diversity.

The innuendos take a childs mind racing in the wrong direction and away from the clever story at hand. The enhanced Kangaroo graphics were fair to good. The two main actors catered well to adults and youngins alike in a comedic sense through excellent facial expressions, tone, and body language. An exciting ending for the \\"good guys\\".

First off, the kangaroo doesn't talk at all until the end, and that whole rapping thing was just a dream of Charlie's. Another thing, the plot is good, but needed some touching up. And there are too many coincidences. As soon as the pair is about to die, here comes a police helicopter! Basically this is an OK movie, not good, but not bad either.

The humor is dreadful and the plot is moronic. The two main characters nearly kill a kangaroo then find it humorous to dress up the corpse in a coat. oooo - the hilarity that ensues. They're only in Australia to deliver money to a man doing a terrible Russell Crowe impression who will kill them upon doing so. (Yes, I'm revealing the plot, such as it is.)Our intrepid heroes meet a beautiful zoologist who is studying animals and trying to rescue an endangered species. Once they succeed retrieving the jacket, she of course abandons all her plans to live on a boat with our 'handsome' hero while the 'comic-relief' does cannonballs in the pool.Sound like fun - no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be PG-13","review":"Personaly, I DID NOT like this movie. Even though most of it takes place in Australia, the plot is thin, there is some sensual content, and plenty of nasty language.

That's right--Kangaroo Jack was the best performance in this movie, especially with his Australian accent, facial expressions, and the scene where he raps. I wish the movie would feature more of the Kangaroo and less about the childish plot using every Hollywood formula cliche they could throw in there, including mismatched buddies who have no real basis for a true friendship. I'm glad that this DVD has commentary by the Kangaroo himself, for maybe he can explain this movie to the audience. Although I didn't particularly find this movie all that funny, I bought the DVD just because I liked the kangaroo in the film (I'm a sucker for talking animals). Pair him up with Crocodile Dundee or Steve Irwin and you might have a much better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry O'Connell let my kids down","review":"Jerry O'Connell, what happened? You have always been my kids' favorite Hollywood star and a great role model for all - until Kangaroo Jack, that is. Your disingenuous attempt at children's cinema has gone unfulfilled, to put it mildly. As a strong and unyielding proponent of nonviolent and pure children's entertainment, I came away highly revolted and infinitely appalled at the depths of utter debauchery to which Jerry O'Connell has plunged with Kangaroo Jack.The violence(with and without the kangaroo) coupled with the inexcusable lewd and lascivious abundance of sexual innuendos(with and without the kangaroo) left me with an incurable case of nausea and vomiting. I am demonstrably mortified by O'Connell and his reprobate dereliction of moral decency. My kids loved him in Scream 2, but I won't let them watch Kangaroo Jack - no,sir - not my kids! I almost gave it 1 star - but then I remembered one thing - it's Jerry O'Connell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, and ultimately good fun","review":"The Kangaroo sold me in the commercials. So did Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson, so I gave the movie a chance. It payed off. This movie was adorable, good clean fun.

And the Kangaroo... well he's fun for everybody to look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowbrow comedy, sometimes funny","review":"When lifelong friends Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell) and Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson) accidentally get mixed up in the mob, they are forced to deliver a large sum of money to some shady characters in Australia.

Silly slapstick ensues, but Anderson and O'Connell make a good comedy team.A mix of real and animatronic kangaroos were used.Staci Layne Wilson"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY! FUNNY!! ...FUNNNNNNNNY!!!","review":"May not be for the under 12 crowd, and more like PG-13 rather than PG, but one of the best slapstick comedies to come along in years. And with all the rauch in films today, I can't believe some of the reviews I'm reading. Very little to make you blush in this one. So if you're over 12 and want an extremely fun experience, Kangaroo Jack will keep you laughing. Even the comment about being \\"eaten like that baby\\" when they were surrounded by dingos, referring to the 1980 baby Azaria/Lindy Chamberlain dingo abduction at Ayres Rock, was not done distastefully as some have complained.With some of the other popular comedies in recent years, widely viewed by many children(Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, Rush Hour) to name but a few, compare them to the scenes and language of Kangaroo Jack. You'll be asking what's all the fuss about too. Almost innocent in comparision. Outstanding Kangaroo effects, great comedic pairing."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and not offensive","review":"This cute comedy is not a family film, although some of the adult humor would go over the head of a young child. The friendship and chemistry between the two male characters is refreshing. A light and pleasant romance enhances the story development. Casting was appropriate featuring Christopher Walkin as a mobster with comic aspirations to develop a lofty vocabulary. Good music, colorful characters, interesting scenery, unexpected twists of the plot and cute animals all work together very well. The dialog has many funny lines, some of which are subtle. The plot is neither simplistic nor excessively complex. This movie is politically correct without trying to be which is delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"wooh","review":"Man this movie funny it keeps you goingwith laughter.Thats all ill really say.But wow it was good .Id give it 4 stars becuase jackylegs isnt in the movie too much.The movie had mature ,extermely strong sexual themes ,and language.The should of definately gotton a PG-13 Rating for languge,action violence,and some sexual content.Parents or older teens careful with younger viewers or you might regret specific content thell see and hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"I was surprised at this movie.

In fact, he does not speak in the movie at all. That's right folks. I don't know what they were thinking. Was it too unrealistic? Maybe. But in a film like this who really cares about why a kangaroo would talk in the first place. It was supposed to be a ... of last years Scooby Doo, which was also horrible, but ended up making big business at the box office. It seems trailers have gone from showing you too much of a movie to showing you stuff that isn't in the movie at all. I don't know about you, but to me that's not getting what you pay for.Don't be complacent.

I have used her DVDs a lot over the course of the last 10 years, and I was looking forward to shaking up my routine with a fresh version. Unfortunately, this video is so poorly made that I was distracted throughout the entire routine. The transitions between moves are awkward. She doesn't count down to begin or end movements. She is caught off guard by the change in musical pace. There is no clock counting down the minutes.

They are well made and challenging!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemed to Be A Bit Too Cautious","review":"I have several of her dvds and this seemed to lean to the overly cautious side. She warns again and again about not using too much weight or moving too quickly or over stressing your muscles. While this is good advice for a beginner and not a bad thing to mention, you need more weight than she uses to put a bit of stress on the muscle if you want to make some progress.It just makes me wonder if someone did something foolish and they got sued. It is just another sign of the overly-litegous society we have become.I do like the choice of the one, two or three miles and in general all of the moves are really very helpful. She is cheerful and encouraging without being too giggly or chipper. After you have worked out using a dvd for the umpteenth time it gets annoying to hear that giggle.

Phil also does a couple of solo acoustic country blues tunes that are some of my favorite tracks on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF!!!!","review":"Out of the somewhat 22 minutes of footage.There are about 5 minutes of Beatles.Don't waste your time. Avoid it if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad, but still a lot of fun","review":"This is a horrible movie about Chan Wei Man learning kung fu and then using his skills for evil. Bruce Li goes to take him down and also to rescue some girl. The only good part about the movie is the number of great kung fu actors. They all are in plenty of fight scenes. San Kwai, Funk Hak-on, Nick Cheung, and Chen Sing also star. The end of the movie is crazy. It is just fight after fight, including Bruce Li fighting a guy in a gorilla costume! A must see for kung fu lovers that also love bad movies. And don't worry, I know everyone is thinking \\"how could a man defeat a huge gorilla?\\" Well, luckily Chen Sing is part ape and he shows up to help Bruce Li out. I was pretty scared there for a minute.1.5/5This movie is included in theKung Fu 20 Movie Packand has watchable picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointment","review":"I'm usually a big fan of veggie tales and all that they have to offer, but this CD was a disappointment to both my children and myself.

Four USB2 ports, a Firewire port, Ethernet, Wireless G nicely integrated. Nice big bright screen. Includes Windows Media Center -- I got a Hauppauge USB TV Tuner working well with it. My biggest complaint is the placement of the audio in and out jacks -- in the back of the machine, when the front or side would be much more convenient. Got mine on sale for $800, so shop around. Max the memory and stick in a 100GB drive and you're set.Pros: Big bright screen. Well-ported.Cons: Audio jacks in a most inconvenient location. Heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The back hinges cracked and fell off after only two years, the screen flops around and has to be propped against something to use.

It relaxes and calms me and my kids. We also love to dance and sing to it. What a lifesaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor comic book writing","review":"Terry Kavanagh is one writer who does the most uninteresting stories in comics. He gave us the Spider-clone saga and a teenage Iron Man. This story where he supposedly gives us the origin of one of the X-Men's most dangerous foes has now been contradicted by current stories going on in the X-Men comics and must be placed as one of those false lead stoires like those that have shown Wolverine's origins,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Iris Dement worth the price of admission","review":"Buy this CD if for no other reason than to hear Iris Dement singing 'Big City'. It's the best thing she's ever done, IMHO. If Angels ever come down and complain about their dead end jobs, it'll sound just like this. Only maybe not quite so sweet. Who knew old Merle could write something that could sound like an angel fixin' to turn in her timecard? It just goes to show, \\"the Hag\\" can do it all. Good tribute album to the body of work contributed by a genuine 'force of nature' in American music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This tribute saved Merle's career","review":"The story goes that ol' Merle was ready to pack it in at the time this disc was made. What happened? He heard some young angel named Iris Dement sing a version of his tune \\"Big City\\" and he melted. Merle said that after hearing Iris, he felt there was hope for country music after all! A nice story, but the truth is, this disc is one of the best tribute albums you're likely to hear anywhere. While Iris does shine, the stand-out track is Tom Russell doing \\"Tulare dust/They're tearin' the labor camps down.\\" Fantastic. The rest of the disc is interesting. Some of it quite different than Merle's version, but good nevertheless. A good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and your money!","review":"Save you time and money. You can put $25 to a better use, video is cheep. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying it is inde so it is cheep, I am saying the when I sell out 25 freacking dollars I want a cood tape. Where did they come p with the PG-13? I do not think any one from the MPAA say this cheep pice of crap! Anna In The Sky is the best one on the video. Its is the only moving one.

Delightful. Charming. Splendid. Funny. Enjoyable. There are so many songs that stand out on this soundtrack, paticularly \\"one hundred easy ways.\\" Evey time I hear I just can't help but break out in laughter. Excellent soundtrack; a must purchase!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wonderful","review":"Jennifer Westfeldt hits all the notes required for the role of Eileen, yet her voice isn't my favorite. Donna Murphy's voice is not great either. The real talent there is Gregg Edelman, but I honestly prefer him along Brooke Shields and Jennifer Hope Wills."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!!!!","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I decided to give this musical a try. I excpected it to be a whole lot better. I thought it was a worthless, boring and tasteless musical. I can't believe anyone could love this senseless piece of junk! You are way better off with Wicked which is a treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited appeal","review":"I bought this pretty much impulsively, having no knowledge of the so-called artist, and expecting a learning experience. I have rarely been more disappointed with an album. It appears that Mr. Dale knows a few guitar techniques and uses every one in every tune with the result being that every tune sounds far too much alike to suit me. While Mr. Dale does have skills, and his application of those skills is done very well, the repetition of those techniques becomes tedious and consequently listening to more than one tune at a time becomes annoying. I do regret the purchase.BrianI suppose that I might have liked the album more if it wasn't an attempt to duplicate Link Wray......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dick dales tribal thunder","review":"This is the second Dick Dale CD I have purchased my first was \\"King of the surf guitar, The best of Dick Dale and the Del-tones\\". I was very impressed with that CD but did not know what to expect with this CD. I have purchased some mid 90's surf guitar music that sounds retro but the songs on this CD do not sound like surf music to me. The title cut is an acoustic version of Dick Dales big hit \\"Miserlou\\" but I wonder why he changed the title of the song? There were two other songs from the first CD I bought that carried over on to this alblum making 3 songs that were retreads so to speak and the original versions of the songs were better by far. I would have much prefered all new songs for the money I spent on the CD. If you are a hardcore Dick Dale fan this is a good CD to buy but if you are looking for a good representation of the 90's surf music scene look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"H*A*T*E*D I*T","review":"Could not get the phone out with one hand!

I chipped a big chunk of it off as I was putting the box together. Maybe I am not the most proficient at putting it together, but it should be able to withstand an active toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk glasses, pretty to look at, break far too easily","review":"I bought 12 glasses each of most of this set of Mikasa a couple years ago when it was on sale from Macy's thru Amazon. Forget washing in the dishwasher, you so much as look the wrong way at these and they break. The Highball glasses are the toughest, but have had a couple of them break in my hand while washing with the mildest jar against sink. They are not durable enough to be everyday use and not nice enough to justify taking up storage space as special occasion glasses. I am VERY disappointed in Mikasa, I would never buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same quality. REALLY disappointed in these.","review":"Like others who have done reviews, I bought these over 5 years ago from Macy's and fell in love with them. I bought replacements at the Mikasa outlet in Redding that were the same quality, so I expected that any future similar replacement purchases would be the same. Boy, was I wrong. I ordered 4 boxes @ $69.95 a box, twenty dollars more than orinally paid. I thought that since it's been 5 years, they went up in price due to popularity. Nope. These were paper thin around the top, completely different from the ones I bought years ago. One run in the dishwasher and two were broken. Complete disappointment. There are definitely two different grades or the quality has just taken a nose dive intentionally. These would break just handwashing them. I will never buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the old Mikasa Quality","review":"My wife and I got several Mikasa glass sets for our wedding 5 years ago. After 2 kids and several accidents, we needed to replace a set. During our search, we found this set of glasses that match the set we needed replaced. We where so happy to find them and at a good price. Then we got the package and man where we disappointed!!! The quality had gone out the window. These glasses where about half the thickness as our previous ones, so much so that I'm afraid to put them in the dishwasher. We have already had one break after about 2 months. I would definitely NOT BUY this product again. POOR QUALITY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down to 1","review":"4 years ago we got 3 sets of these as wedding gifts. We are now down to our final glass. They break when you look at them funny. Aesthetically appealing, though, hence the single star. Go another direction with you cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three out of four glasses were gone in just two days!","review":"Three out of four glasses were gone in just two days!As manufacturer recommended they were hand washed all the time BUT two broke simply by tipping to the side in the sink and last one shattered when it was brushed against sink wall.Never seen anything like that, must be some kind of glass defect.Product deserves no stars at all as none of it left.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware, Two Versions","review":"I bought 4 sets of these glasses at Macy's today and in the process of opening the boxes to check for any damaged pieces I discovered that there are two versions. The boxes are the same, and the designs are the same but one version is heavier, has a thicker rim, and the glass is less clear when held up to the light. They appear more casual than the other version. The version I chose was more formal in the respect that it had a thinner rim, and when held up to the light, was clearer, swirl free glass. Both versions were great looking but I wonder if this accounts for the different reviews. The heavier ones are probably less fragile. I would also recommend checking the rims of the \\"finer\\" version. I found a few tall glasses with sharp edges that I traded for perfect ones with the help of the sales lady. They were on sale for 34.99 with another 15 percent off if you use your Macy's card. I think they're gorgeous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers for Mikasa","review":"These are substantial, rarely break and win lots of comments on their looks and feel. They are fine in the dish washer and I have had them for years. I'm ordering another set because I like then so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed..","review":"It's a cool concept, but the picture on amazon is very misleading. The paint job doesn't even come close to as good as that.I had received this item with a broken horn, and an unglued wing. It was packaged very well, without even a scratch on the box. They had shipped it to me that way.All in all, what a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"Due to a fire, I lost this CD (but the booklet somehow survived). I didn't think that I could find it again. Through your site not only did I find it, but several other vendors had it as well. The CD that I purchased must be an import, and the booklet is different from the one that I had before. The CD that I got is from a different label than the RCA label. There are color pictures of them and a story behind this historical recording. It's also interesting that the CD says \\"George\\" Ruffin and not \\"David\\". I'll keep it for that reason alone. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cost is outrageous","review":"My chinchilla loves marble to sit on when it is warm - remember ideal temperatures are 60-80 degrees Farenheit for Chinchillas. The idea is great but you can go to a home supply store and buy a few tiles of marble for a fraction of this cost. Having an entire tile for them to sit on makes it ideal for two chinchillas. You can also place some marble where they jump if you happen to have some wire cage flooring as repeated jumping can injure the pads on their feet. Marble is usually easy to clean but be sure to replace them if their urine etches away at it.This is a great product for convenience but way overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea is good, the cost outrageous","review":"I saw these and thought they were a good idea, so I went to the local hardware store, found two damaged granite tiles which the hardware store cut in half for me and marked down because they were damaged. I ended up with four chin chillers for less than $2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Multiple Chinchillas","review":"I purchased one of these online from Petsmart.com and I received it with one corner broken off so they sent me a replacement for no extra cost! So, now I have two and can rotate them out every so often(I place them in the refrigerator for a couple hours and they end up extra chilly)... I would rate them four stars because it's a GREAT product but in the end it IS just a piece of ganite... My chins sit on it occasionally but not a whole lot to make it worth this price. It did make me feel better to have this in their cage when our power went out for a few hours. Definitely a must have for all chin owners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Product, but Amazon is terrible...","review":"I just want to start out by saying the only reason this is getting a bad review is to deter you from buying it on this site. Amazon is the worst about sending items completely unprotected and causing them to be broken when they arrive. This item was shipped in a box far too big for it and the only thing protecting it was a single piece of bubble packaging on the TOP of the item, not on the bottom where it would need the cushion. I will say that my chin loves this thing, sleeps on it constantly. But it is very brittle granite. Not nearly worth the price. We have a big cage with 4 levels, so I've decided to put another one of these on the second level as well, HOWEVER, I am using one of those granite cutting boards instead. Its all the same to them really. They just like anything that keeps them cold. So go buy a small granite cutting board for 5 bucks and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"chin-chiller is too cool","review":"when i first opened up the chin-chiller i was a bit skeptical and disappointed. it literally is just a granite slab. i gave it to my chin not expecting much of a reaction, but was overjoyed to see him use it almost all of the time! he now sleeps on it, sits and just hangs out on it, and everything! my room gets really warm since i don't use central ac and now he seems so much happier since he has a place to chill out. great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Instructive, Delightful","review":"Interesting and captivating to watch some of the world best professional ballet dancers rehearsing for this classic fairy tale. I also enjoyed the instructional component.

Overall, an outstanding performance at rehearsal level. Delightful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"If nothing else, this video helps one to appeciate the hard work and dedication that goes into good ballet. This is not good ballet at any point.This video was an exercise in frustration. The viewer has no idea as to the training level of the participants and, therefore, cannot make a fair assessment of the proficiency. It occurred to me that the dancers were not acting in concert or taking responsibility for mistakes individually. There was no energy or interest by either dancer. I got the impression that neither wanted to be there. Even the teacher seemed detached, leaving a desire to hear what corrections were being made.The technical aspects of this video were lacking: light, sound, and editing.May I suggest the intruction video titled Yvette Chauvire, France's Prima Ballerina Absoluta. Would-be dancers can see what the relationship of teacher and dancer should be. The respect for experience and fame is obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Beauty rehearsal","review":"Awful.

The One true God of Judaism is a product of an evolutionary process consisting in the absorption of Canaanite gods Baal, El, & Asherah.I disagree with an earlier review, which found the academic gestures of \\"The Faces of God\\" overdone. They're part of the appeal of Rabinowitz's discipline. There's poetry in his scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing","review":"I read this book for a mythology class.

The new glasses are noticeably thinner glass (on the sides) and lighter weight, and I was somewhat disappointed at first. However, after using them for awhile, alongside my older, heavier glasses, I have decided that only I would know the difference, and most people would appreciate the beautiful designs etched on the glasses and completely different on each glass, and not the weight or thickness.I also received the first order with all but one glass shattered, but I called Amazon and was cheerfully sent a new set overnight at no cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look nice - very thin!","review":"I really liked the look of these glasses when I received them. They have a nice weight to them (weighted bottom)but I was surprised at how VERY thin the sides were. Unfortunately, upon first use, I now have a large crack on the side of one of the glasses from filling it with ice from my run of the mill freezer door ice dispenser. As thin as they are, I should have known better and not filled the glass directly from the ice dispenser, but lesson learned. I will be more careful with my 3 remaining glasses, but am very disappointed that the first one broke so easily. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really fragile","review":"I could not get these glasses shipped to me because they were always received broken.

I heard about FIRST DEGREE BURN through an ad last year in Firehouse magazine. A number of ff's have raved about it on various fire and ems websites. So I found a copy and checked it out. The research is absolutely bulletproof. So's the plot. And the dialogue, while a bit raw, is totally realistic. I figured the author, Lance had to be on the job, but I checked his sitexc and found out that he's an ex lawyer and ABC news reporter who once did an investigation on arson. Anyway, this book moves like a Seagrave pumper screaming through town. It's a total page turner. Don't be put off by some of the trash reviews it got here at Amazon. Whoever these guys are they don't know sh__ about firefighting. This is a great book. I hear it's almost out of print. If you find it, buy it. FIRST DEGREE BURN is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"When it comes to music, my penchant is for compelling structure and memorable melody.

Out of the Argento/Morriconne collection, main titles compilations, and miscellaneous other soundtracks this one ranks among Wolf at a groveling beautiful suspensful mediocrity.

The best, most useful parts of the book are transcribed conversations with real Rastafari people, when he or his wife don't interupt them with inane, well-meant comments. His interviews are poor journalism full of leading questions and unecessary commentary that distracts from the message of JAH's people. His insistance that old Hippies are American Rasta is disingenuous, simplistic and self-decieving. If you truly feel drawn to the way of the Rastafari, look deeper than this book. Also the 40 photos touted on the cover are mostly his vacation photos, including one of a deserted motel pool.

He doesn't usually like old movies but this one is so inspiring. We watched it on the 4th of July."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best !","review":"From Little Caesar to George M. Cohan. Winning an Academy Award for Best Actor, Cagney is wonderful. One of the best American movies ever made. Great for family viewing, including young children. And for young children, don't forget to let them see Errol Flynn in Robin Hood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yankee Doodle Dandy","review":"In my opinion this was James Cagney's best role as an actor, and that is saying something thinking about all the classic movies he stared in. This movie not only showed what a great actor Cagney was but he sings and dances into your heart as George M. Cohan. Absolutely a truly great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride of a nation","review":"Cagney at his best capturing the spirit of national pride for which the US is famous. His singing isn't really singing but it tug s at your heart. Cagney may be better known for his gangster portrayals in films but this film shows his true brilliance as a stage actor and a vaudeville performer.The extras with this DVD are well the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yankee Dood Dandy","review":"Yankee Doodle Dandy has got to be one of the greatest acting, dancing, performing jobs that Jimmy Cagney ever had.

CAGNEY AT HIS BEST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cagney Like You Never Thought You'd See Him","review":"James Cagney IS this film. Yes, the songs are entertaining and the story is well told (which is surprising to hear from someone like me who does not like musicals). But from the moment he comes on camera, he takes control of the film. The word dynamic is usually used to describe this performance, and that's because it's the perfect word. Cagney sings, he dances, he jokes, and he delivers dramatically, too. Surprisingly, he was a great dancer, with a sort of stiff legged kind of style I've never seen before, but it works. The movie is very patriotic, and sometimes it seems to be too much, but you don't really pay attention to that because Cagney fills the screen. What a star performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite musical","review":"My mother bought me a copy of this fantastic movie when I was nine. I watched it over and over for a solid week! Filled with the patriotic songs of George M. Cohan, the lengendary song and dance man, this is American film making at its best. Cagney's exuberant puppety dancing style is a joy to behold. A classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yankee Doodle Dandy DVD","review":"A classic and could watch it every once and a while; great entertainment from wonderful stars! Cagney at his best and having the second disc with the history of the production and stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Dandy","review":"What's to say, they don't make movies like this anymore because there incapable of it. There are no Cagneys left,Bogart and Becall are long gone.Gable, Stewart, the Duke are all gone. As are the people who made them great, television today is without talent for the most part and certainly without ethics, Hollywood garbage is on television, and only occassionally do they put out a movie that touches the heart with class,excitment,and humor all into one movie. Yankee Doodle Danydy is perhaps one of the greatest movies about the American sprit and people ever made, and by Americas greatest actor. I first watched this movie when I was twelve, I'm 58 today and it still holds the same magic for me after all these years. I would hope we are all Yankee Doodle Dandy's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yankee Doodle Dandy (Two-Disc Special Edition)","review":"There is nothing like James Cagney singing and dancing his way across the screen!

For God's sakes keep away - life is too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Moly...stick to porn, Toby!","review":"Possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Shot directly onto video, it's like watching a porn flick without the porn, with a cringe value of ten. A talentless cast portraying totally unbelievable charcacters, ridiculous plot, zero production values. Twenty minutes into it and I was ready to switch it off, which I did. I decided to wait until the next day to view the balance of it, to give the filmmaker the benfeit of the doubt, and still had to switch it off after another grueling twenty minutes. Worse than Chinese water torture!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Father Knows...Not Much","review":"\\"Father Knows\\" is--simply put--awful. Toby Ross, former adult film director, takes a stab at mainstream and misses the mark by a very wide margin. Supposedly about relationships (I guess; I couldn't really tell), the characters are as cardboard as they come--along with the acting. If ANYONE can believe the \\"friend\\" could channel Zelda Reubenstein, then they could also believe that I'm Brad Pitt's body double. Characters come and go, have little substance to them, and add nothing to this movie. Poignant, heart-tugging: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?Although listed as 74 minutes long, you'll swear you've just sat through a double feature. This movie is unrated and has some nudity and language...and that's about all it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Bad acting, writing, and film quality. Watch the movie Shelter*****, Latter Days*****; The Trip****; Boy Culture****; Rock Haven****; even Coffee Date***. These directors, producers, and Actors have brains, and it shows in their work.

Not for the serious home decorator. Designs are almost childish. I should have spent my money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and uninteresting","review":"This book was originally published in 1975 and I think it shows. I realize it's a product of its time but some of the racism and sexism is a bit jarring (for instance, a detective says that \\"all Chinese look the same to a Dutchman\\" and, later on, two of them muse that a girl who'd been molested had it coming as she was wearing short shorts). Such comments are dropped casually, not as though the author intended to show flaws in his characters.The story itself plods along with very few surprises and I didn't find it particularly rich in \\"Dutchness,\\" either. I can appreciate a good, slow story, don't get me wrong. This one is not even so much slow as it is simply boring. By the way, someone should have told him that when it comes to hanging people, the past tense is \\"hanged,\\" not \\"hung.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start to a Great Series","review":"A thoroughly engaging and well-written mystery. The first in a series of mysteries pairing Amsterdam detectives Grijpstra & DeGier, this novel enchants and hooks the reader from the very beginning. The story is first class and will be enjoyed by lovers of the genre, but it's the interaction and dialogue between the two protagonists that makes this book such a gem. At times philosophers and often humorous, these characters are a welcome addition to the readers' life and the good news is: there's more where this comes from. Check it (them) out and you won't be disappointed. Highly Recommended for those who enjoy mysteries and top-quality literature in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atypical For A Mystery","review":"I picked up this novel because I was reminiscing about Amsterdam, rather than out of a desire to read a mystery. It was exactly what I was looking for. Van De Wetering's descriptions of the city are crisp and well defined and his characters are intriguing and convincingly written. It was a good mystery as well. The motivations of all the characters seemed true enough, and for this, the novel could just as well be classified as literature. The translation maintains European syntax, so the Dutch character of work is not lost. It was a fun little novel, and great mind candy. The next day I bought two more of the series. If you need something, quick, light and exotic to read this is a good one.

But it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disappointment","review":"Maeve Binchy is one of my favorite authors as her writing is beautiful and evocative of Irish country life with its charm and sense of community. Her characters are well developed and this book was no exception. However, I agree with those readers who were upset by the unrelenting series of depressing episodes and the ending which left us in the air with no happy endings. If I had known it would have such a miserable ending, I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly Summer by Maeve Binchy","review":"This is probably the best book by this author! Typically set in a small Irish village in the 1960\\"s, it completely absorbs you into the lives of several families, until you think you know them in person! I just could not stop reading it, and finished it in 2 days!It's somewhat romantic, but TOTALLY in a class of its own. I would recomend it to anyone, especially those [like me] who were around the same age as the children in the book [not the youngest - Declan!]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all engaging","review":"To sum up in one word - disappointed. This is by far Binchy's weakest work - yet the one that is most raved about. Too many characters, too much tragedy and not enough HOPE. For a really good read, immerse yourslf in 'Circle Of Friends' or 'Light A Penny Candle'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stay awake for this one","review":"I've read and enjoyed \\"Tara Road,\\" \\"The Lilac Bus,\\" and \\"Dublin Four\\" so I was looking forward to \\"Firefly Summer.\\" What a disappointment. It drags on and on, and her 1960's American children are using phrases that may have been common to Irish kids, but when the Americans used them (the brother wanted to compliment his sister by \\"marking her card.\\" What???), it made the whole story seem unfathomable and unbelievable for me. It ruined the whole thing. Now, at Chapter 10, I could care less what happens to these people. I don't have to worry about not being able to put this one down, it usually falls out of my hands as I'm dozing off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Home to Ireland","review":"This was my 1st Maeve Binchy novel and I am ready for more. She has the ability to create characters that come alive and interweave with each other, making you want to know more about each of them.This story made me long for simpler times and living, even as the hardships and tragedies unfold. As an American with Irish roots, I can certainly relate to Patrick's dream of coming home to Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying tragedy--needs a sequel badly","review":"A slow read with an unsatisfying ending--not recommended. This feels like a draft rather than a finished work.After 600+ pages, the plot has wound itself into a corner and is crying out for serious editing and revision. As it stands, it would take at least another 100 or so pages to satisfactorily wind up the loose ends. Rather than undertake the major editorial surgery of excising a pointless tragedy, thereby freeing up those 100 pages, the author just blows everything away. Three pages of denouement is woefully insufficient. It's hard to believe that a (competent?) editor went along with this.The well drawn characters, positive balance between the generation, insightful cultural portrayals are delightful but don't begin to rescue the book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story of the ironies of life.","review":"The story like all Maeve Binch books was well written and gave a picture of a loving and inspirational town. The town goes through ups and downs. there are the characters you can't get enough of and the characters you feel you've wasted too much of your reading time on. I felt that there had to be more, some of the characters were left hanging without there situation being resolved. As the reader I want to be able to have the whole picture, I want my favourite characters to have a happy ending or an ending at all would suit me. The irony of the story touched me, and made me realize whatever your dreams are they're not always dreams that can be lived out. Although the downs out weighed the ups (so much tragedy, not enoough happiness) you had a feeling that this is what real life is like. Always thinking that your life has had not enough good things to over power the bad, is the impression the book gives"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Wonderful story!

Then the rest of the book involved one disaster after another. Half as many problems would have been more than enough. Very depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"Binchy starts off by giving us a detailed view of Fernscourt and the first few chapters give us a good discription of the characters living in the quite Irish village so that when the drama begins you actually feel like your part of the village yourself.This book is about the Ryan family who own one of the three pubs in the town. On the arrival of the American family the O'Neils, the towns opinion is divided in two when Patrick ONeil gives his plans to build a hotel in the town, with one half believing the town will profit and the other believing it will put them out of business. The arrival of Patrick O Neil and his children Grace and Kerry cause a lot of changes in the village and there energy certainly brings the village to life.Theres quite a few suprises in this one and a really unexpected twist at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming novel of summer innocence, with dark elements","review":"This is another extremely readable Binchy, set in a small Irish country town in the 1950s. The quiet life of this sleepy town, and those who live in it, is disrupted when Patrick O'Neill comes to live there, buying the local Big House.

But I don't think I've ever been more annoyed with a book in my life. A gazillion pages and it just stops??!! No resolution of any conflict, no hope for any character's future, no explanations, no warmth, no love, no satisfaction. Just overwhelming, blanket distress for each and every character. I am mad at myself for holding out hope, as this novel dragged on and on and on, that I would be rewarded for my nights and nights and nights of reading. I nearly threw it across the room when I read the last line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloom and Doom in Ireland","review":"I read and loved Tara Road last year, so I was looking forward to another of Binchy's works. Unfortunately for me I chose this one. It started off fairly interesting, with the story of the Ryan family, and their quiet life in rural Ireland during 1962. Along comes Patrick O'Neill, a wealthy Irish American with great plans for a hotel in the area, where his family once lived. The impact of this man, his plans, and his family's interaction with the families of the town was a promising story. Yet one tragedy after another, with no happy end in sight just dragged this book down. Over six hundred pages long, it was ultimately a very unsatisfying read. I haven't given up on Binchy though, I have Circle of Friends and Scarlet Feather in my never ending To Be Read pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Abrams what happened!","review":"A Book on the antiques field that proclaims on its back cover \\"be an expert in 5 minutes\\" (only), has a long way to go to impress me, it has to be said.

The photos are the same old Christie image collection that might work for an auction catalogue but are dangerously out of context in the hands of an academic. The Images duplicate many of the cataloging errors of the worst type by a junior at Christies-one caption -Car ornaments, perfume bottles and an ink well.All in all I was sad that Harry N Abrams whose son was a client of mine, who once quoted his father as saying \\"you should get a hernia taking one of my books off the shelf!\\" Has, as a first step into a book on this great artist , chosen to produce this diminutive disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Yo y'all gotta buy this book!

I found the witticisms to be to hard to swallow and the writing seemed choppy. i couldn't get lost in this book because i kept having to re-read sections that i didn't even have an interest in because i found my thoughts drifting away.In the first chapter the narrator describes her ex husband's ability to work a room full of people with a mixture of metaphors and descriptions that i found dull and within the next few chapters, when the writing didn't recover, i gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"\\"The Best Awful\\" is wonderful, a compelling work whose humor belies a heartrending truth. In dealing with mental illness, Fisher doesn't sanitize insanity, but gives us a hard, unsparing look at what happens when a mind is lost, or rather, when it's found on an out-of-this-world plane. She takes us along a harrowing trip, harnessed to fast, furious, and funny prose. The strange thing is, it's a curl-up-under-the-covers read, a safe haven, where not only do you appreciate your own boring \\"normalcy,\\" you develop a compassion you never knew you had. While Suzanne Vale's pain is so real, her rantings so over-the-detailed-top, it's her humanity that's still front and center -- an amoral ethicist pontificating on what it means to live a large life made larger by turning small. You have to read it to get that line! A beautifully done job. Fisher is a celebrity who truly deserves to be celebrated. And no, I'm not a friend, and until now, I wasn't a thumbs-up-to-the-sky fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant, funny look at bipolar disorder...very readable!","review":"I have read all four of Carrie Fisher's novels, and this one is my second favorite, after the charming, hilarious \\"Delusions of Grandma.\\" This novel includes many colorful central and secondary characters, but none as vibrant as Suzanne Vale, the bipolar heroine.\\"The Best Awful\\" takes the reader on a roller-coster ride from the stability of everyday \\"sane\\" life through the perils of meltdown...and all the way to the loony bin and out again. Laced with Fisher's winning humor and alarming literacy, this novel is a winner from beginning to end. The ride will keep you laughing and leave you a little sad, but ultimately \\"The Best Awful\\" serves as a satifying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny but scatterbrained","review":"The main character is bipolar, with a short attention span when manic. I felt this book was the same way. It is entertaining and with many colorful characters, Suzanne Vale (narrator and protagonist) is very witty and has a fantastic way with words. But the events in this book do not flow naturally, instead there seems to be one disconnected crisis after another, as if a stand-up comic ran out of material but kept going on and on until she filled 270 pages. Even the ending seems an unrealistic, forced resolution. But it does offer insights into bipolar disorder, celebrity life, and the realities of a mental institution. It is hilarious writing and has stretches (the last 100 pages) where excitement built up. But with Ms. Fisher's obvious talent, it could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Awful Awful","review":"Coping with manic depression personally, I returned this to my library perhaps half read.......I just couldn't subject myself to finishing this book, or perhaps, manic induced journal entries is more accurate. I think so, I have plenty of them to refer to of my own.....Knowing what manic episodes are and how they affect me I felt my 'mental' ''illness', when it occurs, was totally incited by reading this book, which I am sure was not Carrie's intentions.I am sure her intention was making tons of money by having it published which I assume she accomplished. Bully for her as she needs it for her shock treatments and meds, none of which I can afford. Perhaps I am better off.....For me, Carrie at her Best, was the clip of her on you-tube speaking at George Lucas' AFI Life Achievement Award. Pants Peeing HILARIOUS..... THAT IS MEDICINE we manics need, not this awful awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book","review":"But I didn't. The best(?) parts are the passages where Fisher describes her altar ego's crackup/meltdown/breakdown. But I have to agree with an earlier reviewer who said that if she had not been who she is this would never have seen the light of day. I can't believe there was an editor on this thing: it's disjointed, confused, rambling, and generally, overall, not very well done. Yet, there are lines in this book that are sheer poetry, but you've got to make your way through so much junk to get to them that it's hardly worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST AWFUL","review":"Carrie Fisher's new book is, in one word, awful. I couldn't even get past the first forty or so pages. It's not even a beach read. This woman only adds to the stigma of mental illness. Doesn't she get it? Mental illness is not chic.A big zero.Don't waste your money. Donate it to a charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Carrie Fisher's Best Awful is not a book that would ever be published if it were not for her fame. I am a big fan of hers as an actress, and I can certainly respect the need to write as a form of therapy for one's life, but this book is not well written. Mostly it is long lists of disconnected thoughts. At first I thought that she was trying to make the reader feel as if they were in a manic episode, and she succeeded at that, but as it continued throughout the 200 plus pages, it grew tiresome. I was in no way attached to the protagonist's problems, or the outcome. There were a few very funny things in the book, but all in all not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"the awfulest awful!","review":"This novel is a self indulgent rambling mess about a self indulgent rambling mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stigma Goes Hollywood","review":"Reading the book, you can see how we are, for good or bad, a product of our upbringing & environment. Suzanne Vale is dealing w/pretentious hollywood execs, personal issues w/a mother who is stuck living in her past stardome years,a husband who is not what he seems and a daughter who, bless her heart, probably is \\"holding it down\\" better than all of them.Carrie Fisher has that quick wit and imagination that brings what would otherwise be a mundane memoir to the status of a modern day made for TV Hollywood hit. She give you permission to laugh about something that is gradually becoming \\"alright\\" to talk about; the actual consequences of the highs & lows of bi-polar illness...with Hollywood in all it's tragedy & humor.To know this book is real makes it even more appaudable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting ...","review":"I purchased this CD a while ago.

The elements of be-bop are apparent, yet do not override Bill's sound. The fusion elements are not subtle, but they are not overpowering either. This CD has really grown on me over the year or so that I have owned it. I would suggest it to modern instrumental jazz lovers with a lust for intellegent writing and playing.

If the notes seem to \\"bend\\" and not be true, adjust your lips and don't force air into it so hard. It's a pitch pipe, folks, not a harmonica. Don't expect it to be something other than what it is.I bought the F-F for practicing the National Anthem, and it works a charm. The case has a sturdy seal, so I can carry it round in my purse and not fear it will jostle open and become crammed with whatever funk is reproducing in the depths of my bag. Sounds ridiculous, but my purse compost has inadvertantly gummed up a lot of my electronics, so it's actually a really useful thing to have a case that seals tightly.And I love that it's tuned to the A-440 and not the A-444.

Unfortunately the automatic humidistat is flawed, we returned it and got a new one and it still has the same problem. When it reaches the desired humidity it shuts off - but then if it instantly ducks below that number it instantly turns back on - and off - and on...you get the picture. Imagine having a machine in your room that turns on and off 10+ times a minute - not conducive for sleep.Other than this fatal flaw it works great. It humidifies better than any of our other humidifiers, its quiet and easy to clean. If the above mentioned feature worked this would be a kick butt humidifier - but it doesn't. For the record, we have a Honeywell humidifier of the same size and with an automatic humidistat that doesn't have the same problem - we believe it's because the humidistat is more accurate and it has a built in 5% tolerance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great product, despite Consumer Reports review","review":"I agree with other reviewers about humidistat cycling on and off. I ended up not using the auto feature.

It's easy enough to clean and handles hard water well. However, it is as loud as a box fan and it leaves a puddle underneath itself. In addition, filters for this model are somewhat hard to find.
