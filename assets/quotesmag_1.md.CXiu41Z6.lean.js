In fact, I'm not so sure this should even be categorized as horror. Maybe it's a little bit horror, a little bit dark comedy and a little bit tragedy. Never heard of it? Me either until a few weeks ago. It came highly recommended and I'm here to do the same.Suffice it to say it's one of those movies with lesser known actors that achieves a very satisfying texture and feel that is unique unto itself. Watching a film and feeling like you haven't already seen it or at least parts of it in other films is a rarity. But May is one of those films. \\"May\\" affords the viewer a bizarre, yet sympathetic trip inside the life of a hopeless social handicapper and provides a few nervous laughs along the way. There are many exceptional individual performances to savor as well, a rarity in the horror genre. Give this one a chance. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be horrible","review":"Horrible, just horrible. I rented this because it was mentioned in the same sentence as \\"Donnie Darko.\\" What a disappointment. The characters actions/reactions make little sense and the actors obviously have a hard time with the material. May is so over-the-top with her dysfunction that she seems to have all the social skills of a 3-year-old. It made no sense for this fella to even get as far with her as he did.The nympho/lesbian co-worker provides a semi-humorous thread, but again, it is so over-the-top that it is just campy. I won't \\"spoil\\" the ending, but I will just say that it is ludicrous. The problem with over the top, for me, is that it then takes the movie out of the realm of \\"reality\\" and thus is not scary or creepy because I am no longer taking it seriously. This movie may have had tongue firmly in cheek, but regardless, just came off as very poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut it out.","review":"I'm constantly searching for little seen, original flicks that have something more to offer than typical Hollywood fare. Being a fan of horror movies (and the fact that it is a necessity to watch one every night in Oct.) I was intrigued by MAY which showed up on a pay-per-view. It started off well enough, establishing wall flower weirdo May as an off-kilter character that isn't yet psychotic enough to not pity. The story eventually slides into the blood and shock zone as May's sanity unravels and her craziness comes to the surface. The end of the film is predictable and silly while trying to be disturbing and cool. Everyone involved is doing a decent job for an independant flick, however the plot in the second half mars what could've been a creepy character study. ONE HOUR PHOTO handled the reclusive, misunderstood creep angle with a tad more originality and compassion for it's central player. MAY on the other hand is irredeemable."},{"rating":"1","title":"May: Total deception","review":"I'm a horror film fan, so based in the rating gave to this movie I rented it. Don't waste your time and money, there's no horror, is more a romantic movie with a kind of morbid end than anything else. The plot needs to be remake. However, the acting was very good, but it doesn't change anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh......","review":"A girl that takes her most prized possesion, a porcelin doll in a glass case, to her job. Unfortunately, she volunteers to teach blind 1st graders. She tells the children not to touch, but.....This is May, a little girl who grew up to be a weird woman. She is repulsive, pathetic, and psychotic.Let me put it this way, this is a long movie, too long for the anti-climax. When she makes her human doll out of human parts, cool. When she digs out her own eye for the doll, cool. When the 'doll' comes to life and moves his arm? Aw c'mon now. It would have been better if she had just died next to this lifeless, stinky thing.I would not watch it again. The chick with the great legs was hot though. You know the legs that May admired too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm....","review":"Okay, so my friend and I rented this movie tonight. I dont even know how to describe it. Some parts literally left me staring at the screen with my mouth open, either out of disgust or amazement that someone could actually think up something like that. Some parts made me squirm. These are not good qualities of the movie by the way. I do want to say though, that Angela Bettis did an EXTREME acting job. Her character was unbelievable. But, I'm glad I didn't spend $9 on that movie in the theater, because most of the time, I was laughing because it was INSANE. It's kinda scary the ideas that people come up with....whatever floats your boat I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIRTEEN meets SILENCE OF THE LAMBS","review":"Roman Polanski made a movie in the 1960's called COMPULSION (I think that was the title). Starred an absolutely gorgeous Catherine Denevue as a housewife who disintegrates into madness, told completely from her point of view.I got the same feeling watching MAY but I thought maybe it would throw a curve at the end. It didn't. If you couldn't figure out what she was going to do and how this thing would end, you really should expose yourself to more older movies.I liked the cast and I stayed with them until the horror movie mechanics kicked in. Then it lost any special feel it had.That's probably why kids really liked it: it looks like fresh ground to them. But it's not.There is nothing new under the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be NOT!","review":"This film lacked all of the attributes of a good horror film. When I wasn't laughing at the inane dialogue and story line, I was in constant battle of pushing the off button on the remote.Yes, I'm sure the sociable May would attract many potential friends. Who wouldn't want to befriend an emaciated frazzle-haired psycho with tics? Exactly......Call me crazy, but if I saw this girl on a bench I would avoid her at all costs.It also missed its ultimate objective which was to stir empathy for the lonely May. If you want to see a good film that executes this masterly, I recommend \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"moral of the story: crazy people really SHOULD be avoided?","review":"Oh brother, what a horrible movie. I will admit the acting is good, and I admit the movie looks good. But the story is pure nonsense about a girl with a lazy eye who can't function normally with anyone. She's basically crazy. The film has a slant to it that makes you feel sorry for her, or empathize with her, but her strange antics are so off-the-wall weird that you can't blame anyone wanting to avoid her. If I came across a girl that loopy, I'd stay clear myself. And hey, the movie itself, in the end, clearly gives you the impression that anyone who stayed clear of her had good judgment. Speaking of the ending, it goes so over-the-top silly that it made my eyes roll. Pure nonsense and boredom packaged as \\"horror\\"...? Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"Ok I am into these kinds of movies but this one SUCKED!! it was to blah I mean it was just horrible I would not recomend this to anyone, BUT I will say that there was like one cool scene in the movie (hint).... temples."},{"rating":"1","title":"May not","review":"Tediously slow \`horror' story of strange girl with even stranger ideas about friendship. The girl, May, has a lazy eye and as a consequence grows up friendless and weirdly introverted.I have a low tolerance for horror movies that use physical defects for effect. The title character in MAY has ambloyopia, or \`lazy eye', and that is used not only to explain her isolation as a child, but also her abnormal behavior as an adult. Hey, if you're different you're weird, and the weird are evil.So, I watched this one with a strong built in bias against it and nothing I saw caused me to change my mind. Thankfully it was not as violent as it might have been, and for an indie the acting was quite good, especially Angela Bettis in the title role. Not a movie I'd consider watching again, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross, disturbed, twisted, and sick","review":"I like Living Dead Dolls too, but this movie stunk. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the performances were very good. This is a really strange flick that really strange people, like May herself, will truly enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYbe I shoulda ignored Harry on this one...","review":"Harry being the operator of the website found on the cover of this DVD, claiming it to be one of the best films of 2002/3 whichever. This movie tries so hard, but from the cover to the tagline of the movie, combined with over-the-top forwshadowing...ugh, the ending is just so obvious. Not that it was supposed to be a mystery or anything, I dunno...I think the death of the cat was what lost me... from there I could really care less about May. She's a character which the audience feels neither pity or respect for, just disgust.Either way, nobody involved in the production of this tripe deserves your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I suspect most of the glowing reviews were written by \\"woe is me\\" high schoolers, or those who fancy themselves uniquely capable of spotting (and enjoying) an artistic or particularly insightful film. This feature is neither artistic nor insighftul. In fact, it is only unique in that it tries to shoehorn bits and pieces co-opted from Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, and Tim Burton films, into 80 minutes. It offers a poorly developed plot, an incoherent storyline, and a predictable ending. The acting is fair, but the main character is pathetic, cowardly, and mean. I think it is insulting that Lucky McKee and the producers of this movie believe that I - as a viewer - should find something unique about this film, or something about the main character that should resonate with me. One of a kind? I'm thankful for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats going on ?","review":"Can't understand all the good reviews for this movie, thought it was terrible, watched it a few years ago and seen nearly ever horror/thriller out there and even my wife put it up there at the top of the list of the worst movies I have made her sit through.Obviously I missed something with all the good reviews it has, I must have fallen asleep halfway through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Everyone...","review":"Although this movie is not for everyone, I found it extremely adorable.. Strange word, but it fits. This movie is for people who like their horror simple, and both funny and disturbing. Maybe it is just that I have some personality traits in common with May, or... perhaps that my tastes tend to lean towards the disgusting/morbid/gross but I loved this movie.. and recommended it to all of my friends, who like me loved it.. although they looked a little more sickly by the end.. I would recommend renting before buying.. or.. if you buy it and don't like it.. send it to me.. I know many people who would like it.. *LOL*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Too many holes in the entire move. Not worth the 1.99.... save your time too.

This film has superb acting, outstanding cinematography, great script and story line! Only i didn't find this as a horror film in the classic sense.

The worst movie of all time.","review":"I don't think many women will sit through this movie and feel it was a good horror movie. This movie is of a person with mental issues (who should have been institutionalized a long time ago). It lacks horror or even common sense. I seriously do not get the number of positive reviews for this movie. I started making this review 20 minutes before this half-baked production ended - which was about when the mentally unstable main character goes on a killing spree. I did not even bother with the volume towards the end. This movie is just an alltime classic hogwash - a senseless waste of time, effort and money. Worth skipping.I am actually annoyed with myself for having wasted my money on this one based on the positive reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"May will stitch you...","review":"May was born with a congenital defect and her protective mother isolates her from her peers in order to protect her from ridicule. In addition, she gives May a doll which she befriends. This doll becomes May's best friend and remains her best friend into young adulthood as she serves as an aid for a veterinarian. In the process she finds \\"Mr. Right\\", however, she lacks social skills to remain in the relationship and this leads her into a bizarre and twisted journey. May is a two-sided story that is both full of compassion, but also as dark as the most hurtful resentment. It provides an opportunity to see the ambiguity within a human being, which leads to a pretty good cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating little movie...","review":"I rented this after reading a reivew by Roger Ebert who gave May 4 out of 4 stars. I love movies that leave me stunned at the end. Angela Bettis was brilliant as was the supporting cast. The first 45 minutes of the movie were well paced for my taste letting us gradually see the changes in May and why she did the things she did. I only hope that the writer/director continues to put out unusual, interesting films with characters as well drawn as May."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would Have Given This Zero Stars If That Had Been A Choice","review":"This is among the Top Three Worst Movies I Have Ever Seen. It's just horrible. It's not scary, it's not freaky, it's not funny, it's just stupid. It's supposed to be a modern day take on the Frankenstein myth with an edge because they made the villain a skrawny freaky girl with a lazy eye. Although she is well acted, she draws no sympathy from the audience as she really doesn't have anything to work with except for an unintentionally hammy and predictable script. Some really good actors really wasted their time when they agreed to be in this movie. The only saving grace this movie has at all is that the beautiful Anna Farris looks sexier than I've ever seen her, vamping it up as a raven-tressed lesbian, but even she can't save this piece of poop from being a complete and total waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not see this movie,","review":"When I was listening to everyones top ten list, May was mentioned. I like horror flicks so I thought \\" wow, a horror flick that has plot?\\" As I watched this, i liked the character, May, who is a quiet, misunderstood girl who needs a companion. Well she starts getting freakier and sicker and by the end, it's stupid and gross. She is a terrible character, you don't like her anymore, plus, there is one scene that made me want to cut out my eyes(not that part, the other part.) don't listen to the cool art kids who say this is a great movie, go buy battle royale at ebay. That is a movie!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angela Bettis needs to be stopped!","review":"After seeing this I wanted to snatch my eyeball out of the sockett it was so stupid. I thought Angela Bettis was through torturing us after her horrible remake of \\"Carrie\\", but I guess not. If you're lonely, buy a dog, or try keeping a boyfriend and not scaring him off, but, by no means, do you begin to start killing people off and sewing their body parts together to make you a friend. This chick was seriously messed up. At any rate, I see all the rave reviews, and I don't understand it, but I guess I don't share the morbid imaginations. Afterall, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be a cult classic. I just didn't like it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"I ended up not watching the film past the first minute or so because it is not a letterboxed presentation, as it should be, instead, the film squeezes to full-frame if you do not have a 16x9 television. This creates and off-kilter, headache inducing experience. I was not able to make any adjustment to my TV or my player that would do any good.Lions Gate should recall the disc and repress it so it can be watched on either type of television."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have not seen it cuz I have a question about it.","review":"Does A POOR LITTLE KITTEN OR CAT GET KILLED BY AN ASH TRAY? IF SO I WILL NOT SEE IT BECAUSE I LOVE ANIMALS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow this is good","review":"May is number 6 on my top ten horror movies and number 8 on my top 100 movies. May is a strange and sad story of a social outcast who longs for the perfect friend. The first 20 minuets of this movie you are convinced that May is just a young girl who is very odd but certainly nota psycho. Then further into the movie you learn theirs something strange and wrong with may and it slowly starts to turn into a horror movie. The actingis superb and I highly recommend it to horror movie fans and to psychological drama fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment. Not Scary and Too Obvious","review":"Was really looking forward to this one and finally caught it thisweekend and was bummed that I didn't like it. It wasn't at all scary,some of it was even unintentionally funny, and I thought the leadperformance was self-conscious and mannered . And I don't know if the ending wassupposed to be a surprise but it sure was telegraphed way in advance. The supporting characters are all one-dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, if any, was the point?","review":"Oh, my. Another \\"everyone-was-mean-to-her-so-she-became-a scissor-wielding-psychopath-who-cuts-people-up-to-make-a-life-size-doll\\" movie. I'm so pleased I took the 98 minutes or so out of my life to watch this. Oh... and they threw in an old doll that mysteriously comes to life and carries a curse. What an original idea.The film falls somewhere between the tongue in cheek horror of John Waters and gore-fests for the sake of gore like \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\". I found myself watching, continually waiting for any kind of credible internal justification for the characters. Of course, the problem of writing characters that are cardboard cut-outs is that their best use is as recyclables in your bin.A very young Jeremy Sisto shambles his way through the role of the disdainful boyfriend, while Angela Bettis, as May, is sadly ineffective as the central character, whose descent into madness is Hollywood predictability exemplified.Don't bother. Give your dog a bath instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want May for a friend!","review":"yeah, this movie is original, touching, sweet, gory, and disturbing at once. May only sees pretty parts in people and not pretty wholes...so what to do about it? create a friend out of seperate pretty parts!Angela Bettis is fantastic in May, as well as Ana Farris. Watch this movie and be ready to see May commit the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of friendship.Too bad the soundtrack of this movie is not available, hopefully it will be some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick- I loved it.","review":"This movie wasn't scary, just really gory. And you could find humor in it as well. You can really sympathize with the character-even when she goes insane (can you blame her she had a doll as her only friend, and every person she liked started to hate her.) The ending was obvious because of the very beginning when blood was gushing out of her eye socket, but still very exciting! The main thing that really bothered me was the corny music every scene May was on the edge. All in all it's a good gory flick that kinda makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Film.","review":"\\"So many pretty parts, no pretty wholes\\" is my favorite quotation from the movie. I love this damn movie. Unforgettable and spooky, it speaks to the invisible, lonley freak in all of us. May is such an admirable killer, sweet and quiet, cute and loving...just not loved back. The music, the victims' characters throughout the movie and the ending add greatly to its artistic integrity; the ending could not have made it more of a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chilling story but dull movie","review":"I bought this movie based on its exciting trailer. But I found the movie too slow untill everything happens at the end so fast. Its hard to belive that May can really kill five people so easily in one night and carry around their body parts in one lousy cooler. The movie makes its effort to keep things real in the begining and blows it badly at the end. The movie was definately a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY ORIGINAL FILM !!!","review":"This is one of the best fLIX i have seen this year so far, and although I expected an entirely different film i am completely satisfatied the same.

Angela Bettis is both haunting and beautiful in a manner that is both very real and knowingly off center. this is not a movie for people who need a movie to spell out every detail for them - the story is moved through style. this movie looks great.May is a girl who desires to be connected to others, is open to that possibility, but has no means to that end. others use her, then shun her, then, well, i ain't gonna ruin it. perhaps think of this flick as \\"CARRIE\\" meets \\"HEATHERS\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie.","review":"excellent flick.

Scariest of all time???? U have to be kidding! Granted the movie could have been great and Angela Bettis gets 5 STARS cause she acted her (skinny little) booty off in what could have been an award winning performance in a better movie. why make a movie that could have been so deep comical and almost unbearable to watch the 1st 2 3rds of the movie?? The shocking, nauseating gore (which i loved hehehe) at the end couldnt make up for it.

However, this book shares their somewhat gruesome graphic quality (the smells sometime virtually rise off the page) - it's not for the faint of heart. More positively, \\"The Crimson Petal\\" shows that even in an age of both figurative and literal constriction, women could escape their exploiters/oppressors. Like the reviewer ..., I was somewhat frustrated by the abrupt ending of this novel, though its deliberate ambiguity may simply be reflective of the uncertainty of the times and the charcters' morality themselves. A warning: jlind's review mentions a critical plot point that occurs near the end of the book - it's better to skip reading it, if you want that point to reveal itself to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy","review":"I did not appreciate the device of being addressed by the storyteller.

This book could and should be cut in half...too many useless details that do nothing to add value. If one does persist long enough to get into the story, there are worthwhile moments...but don't do it! Not if you have a life. Anyone who tells you differently is a pretentious idiot. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed at the end of a book. Did I say ending? Whatever it was... Very phony intellectual stuff. It's like Faber got bored with his own blathering, had a deadline with the publisher and just said \\"the end\\" randomly.

The main characters are entirely unsympathetic and their actions make no sense. I found myself hoping that terrible things would befall all of them.

So be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit long winded","review":"I found this book very long winded and overly descriptive. We did it for book club and the rest of my book club gave it 7 or 8 out of ten. I gave it a 3. The medical conditions were too far fetched - surely you succumb to a brain tumor earlier than that. Surely a little girl who is emotionally and physically neglected does not turn out to be a well mannered five year old.The sex though titillating at times was also over the top. This is soft porn; not hard core but still unrealistic like most. The plot is so cumbersom that confusion is often the reason you re read a paragraph or read on to try to work it out. No character is particularly likable or real. If it wasn't for book club I would have stopped after the first two chapters. I read on hoping it got better, it didn't. In the end it was a challenge I set myself to keep reading. I would recommend wasting your time on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope the TV show is better","review":"Not impressed. Am half way through and waiting for it to make sense. Seems well researched but extremely depressing. Saw the previews for the television show based on the book. THAT looked interesting. Still, maybe the last half of the book will begin to make some sense. If you like graphic descriptions of abject poverty, Victorian London and sex you might enjoy this. I paid for this thing, guess I'll see it through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"Although this book is sexually graphic, i loved the realism of the period piece. The point of view, that of a narrator leading the reader into the story by literally introducing characters and places, keeps it interesting. The characters are the most fascinating people. I saw the movie on TV and wanted to read the book, which did not disappoint me at all. A book to cozy up to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crimson Petal and The White","review":"A gritty Dickens Era novel, showing a slice of life seen from a side, now sypathetically, but also realistically portrayed. And I think this was a major oversight, thankfully corrected.

A must read, for anyone interested in Dickens era London."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"this book was mildly interesting. It was hard to really connect with any of the characters and the plot seemed to drag out. Not something I would recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"long read to poor ending","review":"THis is a long read, and while it was midly interesting , it looks like the author got writer's block about three quarters of the way through. The ending was very weak and dissatisfying after so much effert plowing through the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but very long","review":"I had read \\"Under the skin\\" which was fantastic, and was looking forward to this novel by Michael Faber, which is nothing like his first novel. I found this started off well, but started to drag a bit towards the end - I just wanted him to get on with it. Overall, a good read, but don't expect anything close to \\"under the skin\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad read, but an awful ending","review":"I wasn't offended by the graphic sex or language- I just didn't like it. After I invested hundreds of pages in getting to know and trying to like these characters, the ending was truly awful- sensational, unrealistic, a cliff-hanger in which none of the possible outcomes is worth hoping for. The novel does a great job of showing the seamy underbelly of Victorian society, and the dirty little secrets of \\"nice\\" gentlemen, but is ultimately unfair to William (who is absolutely right to finally, reluctantly decide to have his wife institutionalized- she's a danger to herself and others)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, i stayed up way too late reading it","review":"I loved this book. The opening pages are wonderful and very clever. The story shows the overlap in life of many many characters and how lust, greed, selfishness can change lives as well as the power that trust and love have in someone's life. I was disappointed in the ending, after 894 pages of exquisite, sometimes painful detail, the ending seemed more fitting to a short story then a full-length novel. I drifted off to sleep 'completing' the stories of the character in my mind. Perhaps he's setting the stage for a sequel, but I wanted to know more about what happened to the memorable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining, beautifully written!","review":"This book was years in the making, and the effort is an awesome achievement. The story is set in the Victorian era, and every detail takes the reader back in time. You can actually imagine the sights, sounds, and smells through Michael Faber's writing. The colorful character's descriptions and thoughts are so vividly detailed, he has created such an enjoyable read. He covers everything from high society and their lifestyle, to the very bottom wrungs of the poor, all through the eyes of a prostitute and kept woman named Sugar. Once you start, it is hard to put down. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not done with the book yet, but had to write a rewview","review":"I dont even care how the book ends, this has been a very enjoyable read so far. It is not only entertaining, but informative. You really feel like you are in the 19th c."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vivid detail does not make a story","review":"There is no doubt that the author of this book will make you feel as if you are walking the streets of Victorian London. Every last smell, sound and visual image will flash before your eyes (this includes everything you never wanted to know about 19th century excretement, skin diseases, sewage, and contraceptive methods). The characters are enticing enough, and I found it easy to stay with the book waiting for all the details to come together to form a plot. It never really happened. It seems as if the author spent all available resources on researching and then showing off what he had learned about London society but never mapped out the course of the story. There is more fun to be had in the world of Dickens."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing...","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I was hooked from the first few pages. I couldn't put it down. In fact, I stayed up very late one night to finish it because I just couldn't go to sleep without finding out what happened. Boy was that a mistake. How disappointing. I feel so cheated by the ending. It was so abrupt, I checked my book to make sure there were no pages missing. I am not a person who needs a neat and tidy ending, but come on! ANY ending would have been nice. Did his printer cartridge run out of ink or something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst book I've ever read.","review":"Not only does this book have a shaky, at best, storyline, the author changes tone several times throughout the book making it seem as though it were written by several different authors. Don't waste your time on the 900 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about it before beginning","review":"Lured by the settting--promises of a novel about Victorian England and a saucy theme--a prostitiute's life, I tried not to let the autor's annoying first person intrussions at the beginning of the book dissuade me as his writing and descriptions are very good. The book's plot draws you in. But halfway through, it lost me, although I still wanted to know what happened to the main character, so skipping some pages, I continued. After reading 894 pages, a reader deserves to know what happens, yet Mr. Faber doesn't know how to end this book and leaves the ending inconclusive. I would have thrown the weighty volume at his head had he been near!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I love this book! It's just beautifully written and Sugar will remain with you long after you've finished this novel. I have to admit, when I started reading the first couple of pages, I was not interested. I am so glad that I continued! Mr. Faber lets you know that Sugar is not a beauty, but it is this distinguishing characteristic that makes her so special. A must read you will not regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding novel with a few shortcomings","review":"This is a great read, the writing itself is fantastic, Faber's style alone kept the pages turning, particularly since I barely have the patience for 500+ page novels. The only real complaint that I do have--and the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars--is the ending; I like others felt cheated after having read the minute details of these characters' daily lives through 800 pages only to be left hanging so abruptly--never realizing the fates of the three primary characters: Sugar, Sophie, and William. It was somewhat anti-climactic but overall I was most thoroughly impressed with the writing style and the close attention paid to detail; you can't walk away without sensing or even knowing that Faber strove for nothing short of perfection in every paragraph, sentence, and word between the covers of The Crimson Petal and the White.If this were a movie a sequel would be expected, I can only hope for the same here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End","review":"Gotta love the girl: Sugar's as nice a prostitute as we can hope to know. She's cultured---in her way---and smart. Reared by a madam of a mother, Sugar can still play Mom to her \\"patron's\\" little daughter. Sugar's story is absorbing, truly a \\"can't put it down\\" read. But, I must say, The Crimson Petal and the White offers a very unsatisfying conclusion.Readers who finish: What do YOU think happens?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Neo-Victorian Crock","review":"The novel begins well, but by page 400 I had gotten sick of waiting for the story to get moving. The author just keeps hitting the reader over the head with the same information. By time I reached page 400, I looked back and realized that any proper Victorian novelist, or actually any proper novelist, would have accomplished in approximately 100 pages what it takes Faber over 400 pages to accomplish. I can't fault Mr. Faber on ambition, just on execution.Read some Dickens or some Trollope instead. They're faster, funnier, and far more interesting, to say nothing of being far less BORING, than Mr. Faber."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending ruined it.","review":"Like some of the reviewers below I found the book held my attention, but was unworthy of it. Crimson is rich in detail, but lacking in character development. The ending, if you could even call it that, was awful. There is no conclusion. It was as if the author simply stopped writing--literally.I would not recommend this book, even to fans of the genre, unless you don't mind being left hanging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't take it too seriously","review":"A very fun read but I wouldn't classify it as serious literature. If you try to read it that way you'll be disappointed. This would make a great vacation book or a great gift for the woman who reads everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suggestions for Readers","review":"This book is seriously overrated. It is way too long and the writing style is incredibly contrived and annoying for the reader.What the book is hailed for is its thorough description of the era. I agree that is well done but one does not need 800 pages to do that. I do not mind long books (in fact love them) if there is something (anything!) to hold my interest.Suggestions: 1) a book about a similar subject and time and much more interesting: Slammerkin by Emma Donoghue.2) a book with the same contrived writing style on the same subject and era, try The Dress Lodger by Sheri Holman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I read this author's Under the Skin last year and was blown away by the force and elasticity of the prose. What a writer! I recommended it to at least 10 people in my neighborhood. Now I have finished The Crimson Petal and the White and I can honestly state that it is the best novel I have read since Middlemarch - I couldn't stop reading at night, consequently I am suffering from acute sleep deprivation. I urge readers to buy this book quick before it sells out and ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much spunk","review":"I hunkered down to read this blimp of a book with great expectations {(no)pun intended}. However, so many words and then pages turned out to be gratuitous. Somewhere in the process of putting so much down, the art of the thing was lost. The story and the characters became secondary to the graphics of bodily functions...Victorians went out of their way to create an illusion that such biological processes did not exist. It is like Faber is saying, \\"Look, here I have a Victorian who ejaculates...And another who menustrates. This one has phlegm. Can you believe it?\\" Victorians would have been shocked, scandalized, revolted. The only problem is that his audience is not a Victorian audience. These details are repeated and emphasized far too much. I had to call it quits at page 500 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crimson Petal and the WHite","review":"Really great read. Take it to the beach and sip it as you would your favorite summer drink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on pages, short on story and content","review":"I took this novel on vacation so that I would have the time to read it from beginning to end. I should have had a back up read as well. I was initially interested in the narration of the first 100 or so pages. The narrator plays with and entices the reader; it was interesting. This made up for what was lacking in content. After that, all that remained was a rather boring, uninteresting, verbos accounts that concludes abruptly. I do not understand the hype surrounding this novel.Personally, I did not even think it was that \\"sexual\\" of a novel. Especially for have prostitutes as the protagonists! I would not recommend this work to any lover of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete disappointment","review":"This book was a complete disappointment. The first few chapters were great, with an intriguing way of narrating this book the author makes the reader experience the characters life. However, this style is abandoned, and instead the author adopts the use of coarse language, which adds nothing to the essence of the book. Additionally by the end of the book it is completely obvious what is going to happen. I think the excerpt has all that the book has to offer - don't spend money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Based upon the early word of mouth, I couldn't wait to read this book. Boy was I disappointed. The narrative style at the beginning of this book is awful. The beginning of the book has a narrator (that disappears in later chapters) that says things like, \\"Look, there is person x enjoying a roll, but he is of no consequence, instead let us follow person y. See her walk down the street. Look, she is entering a building. Does she live here?\\". Infuriating. Thankfully, the narrator goes away. Be warned though, the awful writing style continues. I can't say enough bad things about this book. I've sold my copy of this book, and I feel bad for inflicting its bulk on someone else. Run away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my time back please","review":"I spend hours and hours winding my way through this loooong book hoping I would (a) learn more about the characters, (b) learn more about Victorian London, or (c) be excited about a thrilling ending. Well, expect (d) none of the above. After over 800 pages the book just simply ends. No warning, no thought, nothing. Ding, book over. I screamed out loud. I have never invested that much time in a book to be so disappointed. Please, Mr. Faber, don't torture us with a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Long and Unexciting","review":"I am not attempting to be a literary critic, only to give my impression of this book. I found it to be long, tedious, and unexciting. I don't feel I ever got to know the characters, felt any compassion for any of them, and was left wondering why I had gone on with the book as long as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have insomnia, try reading this","review":"I fell asleep trying to read this. An incredible amount of descriptive detail. Too much. I do not need an entire paragraph to tell me how uncomfortable a woman looks in her corset. I also do not need to know a person's entire life story if they are never appearing in the book again after page 30. I fell asleep everytime I picked it up. Thank goodness I did not take it to the tub with me. I would have drowned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded","review":"It goes on repetitiously for hundreds of pages with the same old same old -- crazy Agnes, religious zealot Henry and Mrs. Fox, Sugar spying, on and on ad nauseum. When it finally starts getting interesting, things start happening, it ends before anything does. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you feel","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Very well written, keeps your interest and makes you feel what the characters feel. A great read, I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, intriguing and highly entertaining","review":"Although a long book, I couldn't put it down. I was immediately involved with all the characters and couldn't wait to find out what happened to them. And there's the rub. Obviously, the author is trying to avoid traditional narrative styles by doing something a little different. But I ultimately found this incredibly unsatisfying. He builds up interest and suspense in a certain character's story, and then then it's dropped, one way or another. You never find out what really happened in many key story developments. This happens so often that it's clearly purposeful, although I'm not sure what the point is. I almost wasn't sure whether he just couldn't decide what to do with his characters (especially that totally unsatisfying ending). Of course, all of this IS like real life, but this is a novel I'm reading for pleasure. In any case, definitely NOT boring (to me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO BORING","review":"Where is the story? The plot? The emotional depth? The ending? If you want to know how the street stank in London during this time period, read this book, because Faber describes every little detail of the scenary, fashion, etc. He is obviously quite knowledgeable, but as for a story, I tortured myself for nothing. I kept thinking \\"but, it has to get better.\\" No such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads well, but empty","review":"This book has no point. It's like watching a soap opera where the characters are not doing anything interesing. It reads well, moves well, but you get absolutely nothing from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleeeeeaaaaah!","review":"Worst. Book. Ever. The writing style is overly florid and most of the characters are just, well, jerks. The ending is ridiculous.And yet, I couldn't put it down, because I kept hoping it would get better. So that's why it gets one star, for the author's ability to trick me into thinking that this book was worth a week of my time.I can't believe how many \\"best of\\" lists this has been on...probably people who are secretly fond of the great works of Fabio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than impressed","review":"This book was really disappointing. The beginning of the book made me feel like the ghost of Christmas past and the end left me wondering if there was a sequel or was a missing the final chapter. I never even came to like the characters or understand them. Overall it felt like I wasted my time reading this book hoping it would get better as I moved along. It never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Balzac.","review":"I bought this book because, frankly, I wondered if it contained any clues to the ambiguous ending of the TV drama.I'll never know because the author's mock-19th century style irritated me so much I never finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Boring boring very very boring is the only way to describe this book. It repeats itself and drives me to sleep, which is quite a good thing as I only read in bed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Detail got in the way of the story","review":"Obviously a talented write, Michel Faber could have produced the classic that some reviewers have claimed, but he did not. It doesn't seem like he had an idea where he was going with this tedious tale. Faber repeats the error of some big book authors by letting his research get in the way of the story.The ending seems like he just lost interest; I certainly did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most marvelous journey!","review":"The early pages are written as well as any novel as your lone narrator takes you by his (or her) hand to visit a century past, a culture long gone, and human intolerance revisited. Michel Faber has presented a most fascinating glimpse at the morals and social constants of the late 1800s London. I am sure the level of detail, minuet character study, and the ugly work of the working girl will stay with me for some time. A most marvelous journey that I must remark reminded me of Memoirs of a Geisha. It's a long book, but never boring, and the craftsmanship and weaving of the characters is remarkable. It takes you to place, an era, a class, and a culture, which you feel and touch but have never experienced. Is that not what a good Novel is to do? Enjoy and give your time over to that lone narrator who will guide you so gently into the William Rackham household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I wasted so much time reading this book!","review":"This book was so long but the author left us high and dry at the end - there was no ending. I'm angry that I spent all those hours reading this book and not have a conclusion. I will never read another book by this author for fear he would do this to me again. I had a lot of time invested in his characters and I (as a reader and paying customer) deserve to know what happened to them.I cannot believe all the reviews that gave this book so many stars. It deserved to get \\"zero\\" but that was not a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much spunk","review":"Entirely too much repetitive spewing of spunk. I am calling it quits at page 500 or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of precious time","review":"Having read a review on the book stating that the work could be likened to a modern-day Charles Dickens I was intrigued. I was sadly disappointed and should have chucked the book in the middle as there was no plot and no redeeming social value as far as I could see...what was the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What are those positive reviews all about?!!","review":"I bought this book based on all the wonderful review \\"blurbs\\" - from the NYT, to Publisher's Review, and even more low-brow People Mag etc.I looked forward to reading it over a long weekend -800 plus pages! yay!However, I could not \\"get into\\" this book at all. I finally gave up at the 100 or so page mark. Characters not likeable or interesting, no compelling story line, frankly a chore to read.After having \\"quit this book\\", I decided to check the real people reviews on Amazon and see if others had the same negative response (as compared to the professional reviewers on staff at mags/newspapers) and I see real people had a much more mixed response.In particular, I saw lots of complaints about the ending (which wasn't one?!). Am I glad I gave up at the hundred page mark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Novel","review":"I must have missed something with this book, before I purchased it I read the reviews and they had 4 stars. I found the author to be arrogant to his readers. I found the writing to be wordy, it took forever to get through it. I skipped alot of pages just because they were degrading to women. You can't be in favor of womens rights and make it through this book. I would not purchase another novel by this author. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely engrossing right to the end.","review":"I read a lot of books, and often I find myself thinking of things like what the cat's up to when really I should be paying attention to the words that are fleeing past my eyes. With this novel, Michel Faber has made me focus on every word. It is the most beautifully written novel I've read in a very long time, and my significant other can tell you how much of it I felt obliged to read aloud, just to share the beauty of the writing. The story is so deftly told that I felt as if I knew everyone involved, as if I really cared what happened. I was telling a friend about it just today, and it occured to me that the indignation I felt about some of the injustices in this book was just as real as if it had been a true story. I don't recall ever feeling as drawn in to a plot as I was with this superb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew-I did it!","review":"Well, I finally did it-I finished this book! It wasn't a bad book-just LONG! I'm not one for 800 page books but this book had a very enjoyable plot about a prostitute's life back in the 19th century. The way this book described every detail was amazing-I was able to get vivid pictures of the characters and places-I felt like I was actually brought in to the storyline! When I say that this book is descriptive, it's not too be taken as a negative thing-yes, there's much more description than dialogue but you read it and find yourself just wanting to read more. I must say, however, that I don't know how some of you read this book over a weekend. I had to keep putting it down but when I was reading it, I found it enjoyable. I would get this book if you're up for a challenging, enjoyable and a different kind of read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"top ten worst books","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I have read in years. One keeps plodding along reading this very long book, thinking it has got to get better. Unfortunately, it does not. One finally gets to the end, is left very dissatisfied, and winds up thinking what a waste of my time this was."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book to anyone.","review":"This book disappointed me in several ways:1. Misleading. I don't believe the description on the book jacket accurately described the book - Sugar did not ascent through society, she went from prositute to nanny.2. Very inconsistent style. It felt like this book was written by 2 different people. The intimate style in which the author addresses the reader directly seems to disappear after the first few chapters and then reappears at the very end.3. Disappointing. After reading over 900 pages, I felt the story ended too abruptly, I actually checked to see if there were pages missing out of my book. When I realized that I wasn't missing any pages, I checked to see if the author had passed away and if somebody else \\"wrapped it up\\" for him.Overall, I have never been so disappointed with a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected story that will stay with you","review":"I read this novel several years ago (the first time of three) and it is one of the novels I frequently think about. The stories off all the characters - from the wealthy businessman, to his sick wife, to his manipulative mistress - all drew me in, and stayed with me long after I closed the book. With a unique twist on the romantic tradition, this story is both blindingly stark, and also a very compelling portrayal of survival."},{"rating":"1","title":"falling apart at the seams","review":"un-opened, the book looked perfect, but once i did EVERY SINGLE PAGE fell off.really bummed out what is a great read content-wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"Faber's The Crimson Petal and the White is a fascinating read into the life in Victorian England. IT is told through the eyes of a minor character and tells the story of Sugar, a prosititute with aspirations to be more than that. She latches on to a perfume factory owner who is spineless and a bit insecure, though money transforms him into a different character. Sugar is his governess, mistress and business confidant. From there, the story unfolds as William changes and leaves Sugar behind.Quite honestly, I wasn't all that excited to sit down and read this book as it is 800+ pages. However, I found the narrative style and pace engrossing. It certainly wasn't one of those books that I couldn't put down, but it grabbed my attention nonetheless. I would reccommend this as a book to read, and intersting look into human characters and motivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best books I have ever read!","review":"I loved this magnificent work! I have read thousands of books in my lifetime, and many more than once...but this is the only book I have ever read all the way through and then couldn't resist reading again a short week later. I am a writer, and I know a little bit about the craft...but this book goes far beyond that. I am dazzeled by Faber's talent, his mastery of description, his exquisite tapestry of life in the late 1800's. Bravo, Maestro! This book is a writer's delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I read it, but...","review":"... there are other books I would recommend before this one. On a good note, the author did a wonderful job at setting the time and place, and the descriptions and writing were masterful. I was eager to read this each night to see what would happen to the characters. The problem was that nothing really ever did. I neither liked nor disliked the characters, nor felt they were good or bad people. I just felt sorry for them all. In the end, I'm glad I read it, but this one will sit on my bookshelf rather than being passed around to family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"a whole lot of nothing","review":"I was so excited to begin this book! I was intrigued from the very beginning by the young prostitute's story and was looking forward to some sort of satisfying ending, whether for good or ill. However, 800-odd pages later, the story just ends, and in the most uninteresting way. I felt quite cheated. It was as if the author just decided, \\"I'm done. I'm tired of thinking up new things for her to do, and besides, I'm out of paper.\\"Save yourself the trouble and the time unless you like endings that aren't really endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Is the Ending?","review":"I went into this book with high expectations and found it an easy read. Having said that, the ending is totally unsatisfying. In fact, I felt there was really no ending and perhaps the author was setting us up to \\"have to\\" buy the sequel to find out how the story turns out. I have firm beliefs about \\"series\\" books: Each book must stand on its own. As I used to tell my kids when they wrote stories in grade school, \\"Each story has to have a beginning, middle and an end.\\" This book got stuck in the middle.By the way, in view of Sugar's musings in the book she is writing about her life as a prostitute in 1870's London, I had anticipated a far different ending--and a resolution to her relationship with Rackham.The book is over 800 pages and I would not recommend wasting time reading it only to be dissatisfied with the way it doesn't turn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Excellent Read","review":"The author really knows how to spin a story that deals with the reality of the Victorian Era \\"Unfortunate\\" and the mores or the lack there of the Victorian Gentleman and the ignorance \\"Well Brought Up Ladies\\" were brought up with.There is one fault and that a lack of point of view. Sometimes there is a definite POV, and other times you are sort of foundering to find the voice of the story teller. It is dense reading, so I recommend peace and quiet when you read it and I have to warn you, though you may be reading Crimson Petal and the White for less than prurient reasons, the sex is very clinical and unappealing and really just a means to an end, but at least it exists and is not couched in symbolic or metaphoric terms.It also ends a little abruptly, he needed maybe two more chapters to really get it wrapped up......"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was terriby disappointed. Found it too wordy and without any excitement.The main characters were despicable and yet boring- can't figure out how that happened...all in all a waste of time and money. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Every Minute","review":"This is not a quick read. It's a settle in and enjoy this book as a companion for...about a season, preferably fall or winter so you can curl up by a fire and have some hot chocolate. Make it an experience. This book got me through some tough times in life, I escaped to Faber's world and loved every minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painstakingly ponderous, disappointing","review":"Reasons I didn't like this book: 1)Painfully long and often boring -- should have been cut in half by an editor; 2)The woman bashing got tedious after awhile (even if the author was trying to make a point); 3)The conclusion is a big disppointment -- the book jacket leads you to believe far more is going to happen in the story.Still, the book is cleverly written and some of the prose is quite beautiful. Perhaps because I read it while in Europe I got sucked in by the book at times and felt like I was living in 1870s London."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading all of the other customer reviews on this book, I thought it would be a book I would really enjoy, but after trying to plod through it for three weeks, I couldn't think of any reason to continue. I didn't care about the characters. The story didn't seem to have any point and wasn't very interesting. The sex scenes were not at all erotic. I was so bored by it, I finally gave up, which I rarely do with a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to this book. It sounded like something I would love. Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the first 10 chapters (they are pretty short) As a reader you move from character to character to make your way through the story. Problem was just as I started to get involved with each character the story would move on to another. I found myself not caring and stopped reading the book. Maybe I gave up too soon, but I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a highly under-rated and under-read novel","review":"I LOVED this book. It is the best novel I have read in years. The level of detail is enthralling, nearly every character deeply compelling. Michel Faber's prose is elegant without being flowery. I can open up this book to any page and be sucked in to this rich story, fascinated by the fears of the lowest servant the fantasies of a deranged wife. The beginning is awkward, but makes sense one you get into it. The ending is hard to read, but only because it is so tragic- we have come to care for Sugar so much that...well, I won't spoil the ending;-) I recommend it to every literate person I come across. I love, love, love, love this book. I love it. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"This book has one of the best opening chapters of any book I've read lately. It also has one of the worst endings of any book I've ever read, period. Don't get me wrong: I love historic fiction, I enjoy so-called \\"slice of life\\" books. I even like books that leave a million questions unanswered. While Sugar is a great character, I grew very tired of and frustrated with everyone in the Rackham household, except Sophie.

I want my money back, and my time it took to read this book. Comparing him to Dickens is so misleading to true fans of literature.The book started out interesting enought to keep me going though it bogged down in the middle. The characters never developed, we got page after page of their same behavior without new insight. Henry burns to death in the middle of the book just when I was beginning to see him as the savior who would somehow tie all the characters' narratives together. That was just one example of disappointment in this pathetic book. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant summer read","review":"This book promises so much more than it delivers. I was thoroughly captivated by the first quarter of the novel. The characters were intriguing, some of the passages were brilliantly written, and Faber seemed to be having fun commeting on the high and low ends of London society.Then the book turned into a domestic drama about life in a great house. The characters turned static, and nothing much seems to happen. It's still an easy and fun read - great for the beach, or a plane ride - but the promise of the early chapters remained unfulfilled.The blurb - which was full of cliches about \\"Sugar's rise through society\\" and the \\"lovable, maddening characters she meets\\" - is completely off. Sugar never really does rise very far, nor does she meet many people. This isn't a complaint; the blurb made the book sound horrible. I just need to point out that it is completley innacurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed book club","review":"This book is a 300 page work painfully dragged out to 898 pages. The author's narrative technique of making comments directly to the reader didn't work for me -- it was just annoying. In my opinion, the book doesn't really get going until about the last 200 pages. Also, I didn't really find any of the main characters to be very likable so it was hard to get involved in the story. Although one can sympathize with Sugar for the way she was brought up, many of her later problems seemed to be brought on herself by her own greed, shallowness and insecurities. Even when she is in a comparatively better sitution she never helps any of her old acquaintances even though it is in her power to do so. Although some liked it better than others, everyone in our book club agreed that this was a bit of a disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex and the City--The Prequel","review":"I was soooo disappointed by this book. It changes voices, reaches no satisfying conclusion, and seems to rely on sexual titilation to carry the reader through. It may have worked with real Victorians, but sex isn't novel anymore. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a good plot","review":"It is obvious that the author didn't know how to end the story that would not seem fatuous.

The income from the same book with a better ending would have been more than double. Every reader tells his friend, \\"Great book, except for the ending.\\" In the case of readers who pride themselves on \\"liking\\" the ending (nothing there to like), they say \\"I loved the book, though many are not sophisticated enough to like the ending.\\" (Again, what's to like? The ending is not there.) In both cases most people they are talking to do not buy the book. First wave only, maybe part of a second wave. There could have been a year's worth of sales here.Best advice: Don't reveal the ending! It'll spoil it for others! (Huh!

But it was boring. I learned nothing I didn't know from other novels with equal \\"color\\" tidbits, and the heroine and her sex life were so boring as to literally put me to sleep.This from someone who reads 10-12 books per week, and who has read and re-read \\"Scarlet Women\\", \\"Alienist\\", and every Anne Perry novel about a million times.Anyway, save your money...or at least wait for paperback.

The author reminded me of a teenage boy trying to find all the metaphors and words he could for penis and semen. I'm sorry-this book is a waste of time and money. The plot had promise but the author ruined it by his continuous and tiring use of offensive and unnecessarily pornographic lanquage. Ernest Hemingway was given a lesson in this by Gertrude Stein when she told him that some of his work was \\"inaccrochable\\"-it sometimes doesn't matter what truth there is in the language if it is in such poor taste that noone can discuss it or display it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I didn't really know what to expect when I picked this jewel up...I don't even know where I got the idea to read it, but I regret the day that decision was made. Although many reviewers have similar comments, I'll say it again: THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME!!!The writing is horrible. The way Faber \\"sneaks\\" the word \\"pregnant\\" into sentences before we find out Sugar is having William's child actually made me roll my eyes in disgust. Was that supposed to be subtle? The only reason I finished reading \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" was because it was a good way to put myself to sleep at night. I guess I'll have to wait for the sequel before I get another good nights sleep.Bad writing aside, the characters were all boring. I felt nothing towards a single one of them.

The characters are very shallow, unbelievable, and in some cases utterly unnecessary and inaccessible. ... Morever, the non-ending of this book, particulary the coy last paragraph, is not only ridiculous, but also another literary device to give the book an air of being \\"Literature.\\" It seems that if the writer had indeed spent ten years researcing this book, he could have come up with a more in depth analysis of class than this book provides. This book has many pretensions, which seems to be the plague of many modern fiction writers. Too much emphasis on placed on imitating great authors of the past in order to become the great writer of the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was disappointing","review":"I read this book about 3/4 way through and then it just got boring and I couldnt even finish it up.

Keep your wits about you; you will need them.\\" The opening lines warn the reader well. I certainly needed my wits and perseverence as well to get through the 898 pages of this book. I feel misled by the customer and book reviews for this novel as I found most of the characters unappealing and the plot aimless after the first half of the book. The time period and the raw, graphic description of the life and times in the sordid sections of Victorian London is compelling. However, except for Sugar, the Rackham characters (family, servents, etc.) are extremely weak and unappealing. If they are indeed representative of the norm for that time, it is a miracle England survived to the 21st century as a superpower. For a far shorter (and less painful) depiction of similar time and circumstances I would suggest the Dress Lodger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book got such rave reviews and sounded so intriguing, I immediately picked it up. I couldn't even finish it. I'm so glad to see other reviews that matched how I felt about the book.The first chapters suck you in and Faber's descriptions are brilliant. But nothing ever happens! Filthy details does not a story make. (Not a book for the easily offended.) It just drags on and on. I flipped ahead to see if it got any more exciting and when it was obvious that it never did, I gave up. There's too many other books to read--and better historical fiction--to waste your time with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"Despite its most un-memorable title, \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" is that rare thing, a really good novel. Interesting characters, good story, absorbing period setting. And the narrative style is most unusual--the narrator addresses you as if you were watching the scene with him. This is probably the best novel I've read all year.

And after a while the 'sex' scenes and the way he wrote those parts got to be a little old and tasteless. I got to a point where i skipped most of those parts in the book. I just wasn't in the mood for it after a while. I got a little more than halfway through the book and wanted to stop reading it but I have already invested the time in reading as much as I did and didn't want to put it down. I wanted to know what would happen between the mother and the daughter and William Rackman. This book wasn't horrible but I wouldn't read it again. If someone offers you this book read it, it will keep you busy.

Aside from the gratuitous crassness, it was way too long and detailed. Yes, they say the author researched it a lot. Well, good for him, but it could have been about half as long. Also, I didn't really like any of the characters until the very end. Just not a good book, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was not impressed with this book....It took forever for the story to unfold....I would not recommend it as something worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but disappointing","review":"The idea of having the reader be a part of the story was a clever contrivance for this novel. Unfortunately for me, it was the only thing that kept me interested enough to finish this book.

Not a good buy for me, should have used Prime Lending Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good!","review":"I loved this book! it was so good i just couldn't put it down. i suppose the ending could be disappointing, but it wasn't surprising. the book begins just picking up on the caracters in the middle of life, and just drops them off the same way.

Two hundred pages into it and I was still ready to throw it in the bin (notwithstanding the author's teasing remarks along the way that it will get more interesting). Honestly, it doesn't get that much more interesting. The characters are not likable so you don't really care what happens to them. However, I did finish it but did not feel satsified with the conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please.....","review":"If you see it in the bookstore, just walk the other way. I kept reading on and on, thinking surely this will get better. It doesn't. It's a mediocre story desperately in need of editing, filled with unlikeable characters. The ending was abrupt & unfulfilling. Wasn't worth all the time I unfortunately spent with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I also took several months to finish this novel after having a hard time even getting through the first chapter. I felt that the graphic depiction of a Victorian prostitute's life was the only hook in the whole book, and that got old fast. There was no satisfying character or plot development and the ending was disappointing. It portrays men as pigs with no redeeming qualities and women as their helpless victims. I would not recommend wasting time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book took ten years to write...","review":"...and will probably take me ten years to read. All the gushing critics seem to have loads of time on their hands to dredge through this impossibly large novel. Faber's spot on in the lushness of his language and descriptions, but somewhere along the way his editor decided to be mesmerized by his prose and forgot to do his job--moving the story along. The novel has more Hardy overtones than Dickens to me, but Hardy wrote in the 19th century, and loved to languish over characters and eccentricities of speech, and yet managed to invest in the reader a love or hate of his characters--and that kept the story moving.Here there is no movement in the plot, a sad commentary on what passes for \\"literary fiction\\" these days. He could have cut the novel in half, kept a lot of description, jogged along with the storyline...and maybe I would have finished it before writing this review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond words","review":"When I purchased this book, I had good expectations, although I had been forewarned about the ending. Well I never got there!Very seldom do I not finish a book. I must have put this one aside 4 or 5 times in favour of other books, and finally never did bother to pick it up again. I was simply bored beyond words. I was unable to warm up to any of the characters. I had little interest in finding out what happened to any of them. I should have been patient and picked it up in a library instead of paying so much for it. It is not a book I will be keeping in my home library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent book. At first I was thrown by the character p.o.v. Michael Faber does- thinking that this was cheapening, but it turns out to be a wonderful book. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the book reading public","review":"How does a book like this get selected for publication?The characters are unidimensional. The plot is so trite as to be inconsequential.The only apparent possible appeal is the very frank graphic descriptions of sex and various revolting aspects of life and hygeine in 19th century England. The prurient parts will probably appeal to some pubescent adolescents but have no allure for a mature adult.It is admirable to attempt to write a long Victorian novel in the present day if it is a good novel. Some years ago \\"The Quincunx\\" was a successful example. This one isn't.How a major publisher invests in trash like this and hypes it with numerous print and radio ads is frankly revolting.I only gave it a one star rating because there is no selection for zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Crimson Petal and The White","review":"First of all, despite it's multi-layered entendre--flowers, colors, etc.--the title is terrible.That said, the book is a tremendous disappointment. It's promising start, with it's perspective and intricate sensory detail, quickly vanishes. We are left with endless repetition; boring, and often repulsive, sexual scenes; and a host of characters who are cliches.This is a long, long book. It has no ending. It just stops. The editing is atrocious (Was there any editing?)The idea that the author has set us up for a sequel is enough to make one relinquish one's lunch in the most Faberesque manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to Save Others","review":"I know there are hundreds of reviews already written for this book. The chances of you actually seeing my review are pretty slim but I feel, dear reader, that I must warn you. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! What an irritating, boring waste of time! How I wish I had read reviews here rather than depending upon the ravings of an employee of Barnes and Noble! Like other reviewers, I debated listing my book for sale but will not be party to subjecting any other poor unsuspecting soul to this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Disappointing","review":"The problem with this book is that it takes you on a wild ride and then ends nowhere almost as if the author ran out of energy and imagination. The blurbs at the back will tell you that this is an updated version of a Victorian novel. No, Victorian publisher would have permitted a loose plot structure like this with so many loose ends at the end - it reads like a serial novel whose author died before finishing the story.A compelling read - but ultimately a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"PHEW!","review":"Well-written junk.

I feel like I was reading a different bookj---one with, yes, fascinating details of daily life I had not known before, but not much else. An editor was much needed for this book----as it appears to be unedited. Repetitive, slow, and dreadly uninteresting at times, the book needs a good 300 pages cut from it. The slash and burn would not be difficult as the author drones on and one.I won't. But I also will not recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Dickens","review":"I read a glowing review of this book in the San Francisco Chronicle and I was looking forward to reading it and discussing it with a couple of reading groups I belong to. The book arrived and I started it. When I am more interested in the scenery while commuting to work than reading, the book is doomed. My interest in this book was nil after 2 chapters. I found it absolutely disgusting and after 250 pages and the final chapter, I stopped reading it. This book is a waste of money. Someone compared it to Dickens' writing. In the days that Dickens wrote, he was paid by the word so his books were lengthy and he tended to have wandering descriptions. I have read Dickens and enjoyed his books. I did not like anything about this book. The finale was a terrible cheat for the reader. I'll never read anything by this author again. I would give it a zero star but that did not exist so it gets a 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one.","review":"I am an avid reader who has NEVER stopped reading a book prior to finishing it. This book was the exception. I had to seriously work to get through the first 182 pages before I finally gave up. The sexually explicit graphic nature of this text was offensive and not entirely necessary. In addition, it was difficult to read due to the excessive descriptions of every little detail.I made this purchase based on a number of editorial reviews and thoroughly regret it. My advice: don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Energy","review":"Having read the rave editorial reviews this book seemed like a good read. (that'll teach me!) In the end I suffered through the first 70 pages. I kept asking myself what is he writing here? Character's stripped bare of any interest, meandering plot development, an endless barrage of language. Like McDonalds food, you're thinking you eating food but in the end what you get evaporates and toxic to the body at that. Pass on this book, there's so many good ones out there, especially for women readers (Philippa Gregory's \\"The Other Boelyn Girl\\", \\"The Glass Oracle\\" by Judith Merkle Riley\\", \\"The Dark Queen\\" by Susan Carroll)- not particulary in this order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but long.","review":"I have to say I got this book because it was on sale and at the time I was doing a good deal of traveling and so needed something to read. The book is huge, pages upon pages. But I wouldn't let that put you off. If you like a fast placed plot then maybe this isn't the book for you. However if you like to feel drawn into a book and taken along the long and twisting path never quite sure what is going to happen then I would recommend it. I enjoyed watching the characters unwind in front of me and having the time to fully understand their personalities. I found it a good traveling book because I could but it down and then pick it up at a later date and be reabsorbed straight back in. Overall I would recommend it but make sure you have plenty of time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really excited to read this, but . . .","review":"I was excited to read this, because I thought the description looked so good, but it wasn't anything great. The ending didn't bother me - it was the tedium. The plot was quite repetitive. I got tired of everyone, instead of being eager to read the next scene. It's not worth the 800 page investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable heroine, superb novel","review":"My expectations were high for this book -- a bad sign, given the disappointment that often comes as a result. But I was certainly not let down. This is a fascinating novel, with an unforgettable heroine -- an almost preternaturally intelligent prostitute caught up in the class snobbery, hypocrisy, prudery and misogyny of late-Victorian England. Each character is etched with such care that you find yourself loathing some of them while pitying them as well -- for Faber brilliantly shows how most are decent people who are simply prisoners of their time. We see how difficult it is to battle social mores and expectations, even when they are destroying us. Some have commented on the rather abrupt ending, but I felt it was perfect. Faber had done such a superb job of defining his characters that we know their unwritten fates as well as if we were to read another 800 pages. My highest recommendation -- a marvelous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An omniscient view","review":"This is a wonderful novel--clever, funny, realistic. The author writes from a position of omniscience, bringing the delighted reader along for the experience. The author gets inside the minds of the characters, and the reader nods his/her head at the realistic depiction of the \\"mind's eye\\" of each character. I, for one, was sorry for the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing read!","review":"Not \\"lofty\\" literature by any means, but a really engrossing and lively read. Faber tells a good story and provides vivid details of daily life in Victorian England."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crimson Petal and the White","review":"If you like Victoriana, read this book. I read all the reviews and didn't think I would like it. Then one review sent me to the computer and Amazon.com. I read the first page and I was hooked; it's been a long, long time since a book did that for me. It is a book for long, cold winter evenings, but I couldn't wait. Over 800 pages and I finished it in less than a week. (I love retirement.) I won't say the ending disappointed me, but I'm not a very imaginative person. That's why I read novels. But again, READ THIS BOOK! And if anyone can recommend good Victorian novels for me, please do so. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"This is a well-written book that hooked me from the beginning with its intial character portraits and fascinating depiction of Victorian London- the rich and the seamy sides. Despite its length, I could not put it down. The book moves on towards a sad conclusion as the relationship between Sugar and her rescuer evolves but I completely agree with another reviewer who described the ending as \\"the author simply stopped writing\\". I have never felt so let down or disappointed in a novel. The ending is not a tease; it does not leave the reader to conjecture what might be- it just ends. A neat, tidy ending would not strengthen this book but weaken it- but this ending undoes all the work of the previous hundreds of pages. I am surprised it is so well reviewed as a result. I cannot recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope....... didn't like it.","review":"Having just (finally) set aside this novel, what leaps to mind is that there is a very fine line between being eloquent and being verbose. This author crosses the line far too often. The book is roughly twice as long as it needed to be... that's 400 pages too long by my account.It soon became evident that the primary characters were all motivated by either the love of, or hatred for, sex. This was the driving force which propelled their generally miserable lives.There was nothing lyrical or engaging about the sex; it was ever-present and almost always lugubrious.Obviously I wouldn't recommend the book. There are those who purport to have enjoyed it. Good for them but I cannot think why. All the men or women are corrupt in some fashion. It became preposterous and tiresome. Predicatable ending too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I reading the same book as the other reviewers?","review":"I just finished this book and while I agree that this book is rich in detail and language of London, it does not adequately capture the class struggle of 1800's London, the demeaning treatment of women and the potential problems with family relationships. I only wonder what personal female relationship problems the author had over the several years it took to write this book. It starts out as a Victorian \\"Pretty Woman\\", then moves to a weak imitation of \\"Upstairs/Downstairs\\" and finally leaves the reader wondering if there is a subsequent novel in the works. How disappointing, don't bother to spend your money or your time on this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crimson","review":"I loved this book! I saw it first on the Gilmore girls show and bought it to see what it was about. Very good read and beautiful paper! It is the best quality paper back I have seen! Pretty heavy but great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating......","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this great big book. The author has an unusual style, sometimes speaking directly to the reader. The detailed descriptions of Victorian England were so realistic, I felt as if I were really there. The characters were complicated and fascinating. The story of Sugar, the prostitute was surprisingly unpredictable.The only negative for ME, was the ending. The author leaves so much unanswered. Maybe he's planning a sequel??"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much spunk","review":"I hunkered down to read this blimp of a book with great expectations {(no)pun intended}. However, so many words and then pages turned out to be gratuitous. Somewhere in the process of putting so much down, the art of the thing was lost. The story and the characters became secondary to the graphics of bodily functions - of spunk, mucous, urine, feces, bile. Victorians went out of their way to create an illusion that such biological processes did not exist. It is like Faber is saying, \\"Look, here I have a Victorian who ejaculates. Here, is one who takes a pooh. And another who menustrates. This one has phlegm. Can you believe it?\\" Victorians would have been shocked, scandalized, revolted. The only problem is that his audience is not a Victorian audience. These details are repeated and emphasized far too much. I had to call it quits at page 500 or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unfinished Book","review":"I am an avid reader. Rarely do I leave a book unfinished. But I must admit, I threw in the towel on this one half the way through. I found myself putting it down and not wanting to pick it up again. The descriptions in the book are extremely detailed - possibly too much so. After a while it all became boring. There seemed no end to the gloom and doom. Regardless of whether the character was depraved or deprived or successful and rich, they all seemed unhappy and frustratingly stifled. I kept looking for some relief. And, maybe it was to come in the second half of the book, but I just couldn't plod through it to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 5 books I have ever read","review":"I really could not put this book down. In fact, I gave it to my husband and he gave it to his boss, who then gave it to his wife and we were all mesmerized. It is well written, incredibly entertaining, and when I finished reading it felt very satisfied. Its one of those books that I needed a \\"moment\\" after finishing.

It ruined the whole book. The author should be ashamed of himself. He's a much better storyteller than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that it is the best book that I have ever read.","review":"In these years of so poorly written books comes along a piece of litterature that is in the same ball park as Goethe or Emile Zola.The author's style is so clear and perfect that it compares with the great authors of the past.What makes him special is that he is never boring and always succeds to make the reader look forward to the next sentence.The story is excellent and the end is very clear to those who have read carefully the last three chapters.This book is art and not an author's effort to make a quick buck.Read it and you will have moments of quiet happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but ultimately fails","review":"I found this book to be engrossing, and at times extremely entertaining, but in the end, it fails due to its shoddy ending. It is a shame, as until that point, the book is extremely well written, with a riveting story set amidst a highly detailed and fascinating backdrop of Victorian England that makes one feel as if one is almost reading a historic novel. Then comes the ending, which leaves the reader completely dissatisfied, wondering why one has wasted so much time on such a long novel.Had Faber given as much effort to the final part of the book as he did to the rest, \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" would merit four or five stars.

I wish I had not spent so much time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters with no motivation","review":"The reason you keep reading this novel is because you keep looking for the meat. You get no real sense of any of the characters, why they are doing what they are doing, etc. An event takes place, or a new feeling is expressed, and you've had no inkling, and cannot figure out why this character did or felt what they did. Scenes do not build. We start over with each character with each scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately seeking an editor...","review":"I read the glowing professional reviews and thought this book had promise. OMG! The prose was often good, but buried in daily tedium that didn't advance the story and page after chapter of repetitive musings of characters that weren't interesting. The protagonist, Sugar and her sugardaddy, William, were only given sketchy backstories. Did the editor fall asleep reading this? The ending? I guess the author got as tired of the story as I did and decided to end it by leaving the characters, pretty much in mid-step with nothing resolved, nothing learned... I could almost see him muttering, 'how clever!' No, just irritating, dude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this when I first got it, but it didn't last long...","review":"I loved this case and the different options for using it when I first got it. Although the description claims that you have to install the belt clip and it's ratchet to the holder, to my disappointment, I found that it came pre-installed. This made it very bulky, hanging about an inch away from your body. Once I got the ratcheting off the back of the holder, I was able to connect the case to a lanyard via the small hoop in the back... making it super easy to carry around this summer at fairs and outings, etc. It has kept my phone safe while looking chic and that I loved. However, it's been just over a month, and the front cover has already broken. The side latches that hug the phone simply cracked and there is no way to repair it. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Feel Great Right Out of the Package","review":"It is probably my fault because the title does say \\"sateen,\\" but as a fan of crisp sheets I do not enjoy using this very limp bedding. It feels and looks very cheap. If you are looking for the kind of bedding you find in good hotels, this is definitely not it. It covers a comforter that is over a sheet and hidden under another comforter or I would replace it. I have never used the shams. They are not appealing. I've read that the advertised thread counts (1000?! in this case) are fictitious and somewhat irrelevant. After seeing this bedding and comparing it to other bedding I have, I can believe that. On the positive side, it hasn't torn or sustained any other damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST of CLASSIC Waylon","review":"This is a classic country CD; if you love classic country, you'll love this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I was not feeling this.","review":"I was just disappointed with this entire cd.

Now I feel like someone who would have been offered Nokia shares ten years ago and wd have turned the offer down: cheated, gutted, angry for having lived all along without Jay Jay's soothing voice. It's such a strange and warm and delicate sound that comes from Johanson's emaciated body, with a bit of Scott Walker in it and undeniably clever arrangements: strings and beats and godknowswhat, that locate this album in time (it couldn't possibly have been there before Portishead and the other Bristol sound pioneers) but just fail to make it sound \\"dated\\".

His response was, \\"return it, it's not worth arguing over\\". I thought this to be curt and uncalled for, as there was no argument. It had been misrepresented and I requested a refund.

With reference to the other review, the company also told me that Amazon, and several other on-line stores were not included in the warranty because they could not guarantee how the product would be treated before purchase. Based on this, I disassembled mine.The HD controller is good, as I had a spare 80GB 1.8\\" HD laying around and it works with the new drive.

This third volume is entirely modern bands of the 1990s, imitating the early music with a glibness and slickness that I found quite irritating. The simplicity and sincerity of the early recordings has been replaced with a smug modern sensibility. If you love early swing and R&B, you may find this CD offensive.

It is just one , big, hot-air- filled polemic denouncing Israel and Judaism. This is bereft of all insight and discussion of actual archeology and its practices.It could be argued that this is a study not of archeology, but of a history of archeology. But using that pious fraud Said as a model makes this without value as well.I was shocked and distraught over the action of the Muslim Waqf in its destructive \\"remodeling\\" lf the Temple Mount/Al Aqsa Mosque from 1996-2000.

She even goes as far as to defend the torching and destruction of Joseph's Tomb by the Palestinians.

This alone should disqualify her as a scholar to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should never have been published","review":"This is a book which should never have been published.This work is an effort to completely erase the historical connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel.

Luckily the DS itself is well-made and as near as we can tell thus far, no damage was done.The final problem was with the headphones.

It's an awful screen protector that actually fell off the first day I got it. The headphones have no bass, don't go loud, and are uncomfortable. They broke after a week. So my advice is to get the car charger seperate, as well as some great headphones from Bose, Sony, Phillps, whatever. And as for the screen protectors, get one that costs about seven bucks, as they are expensive, but will do a great job in protecting your screem from light, and making the life of it longer.Not reccomended.

Director... Photographer... Philosopher... Fraked if I know. This whole movie goes by talking about how great he is then how he lost it. What did he do that was so great? Dunno. What did he do that was so bad? Dunno. What does he do? He, look at that, a resounding DUNNO!The movie starts off with David (Max Beesley) talking into the camera about this thing that he knows that will blow your mind. Of course he takes forever to get to the point and it utterly bores. Just because you have a quick talking Brit that has spikey hair talking into the camera doesn't mean an audience will be drawn in. He's not that charismatic and what he has to say, frankly, is not all that mind-blowing.\\"Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noel Coward without Noel","review":"Coward was not only a clever chap with lyrics (\\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\") and now and then with a hauntingly beautiful melody (\\"Some Day I'll Find You\\"), but he was also a masterful interpreter of his own songs. On this Newport offering, we must be content with Richard Conrad, a pleasant singer who makes this Coward-sans-Coward concert very easy to take. Running a little short at 52:04 minutes, this CD gives us 17 tracks of vintage and not so vintage Coward that is a wonderful salute to the man by \\"the acclaimed Coward stylist...in celebration of Sir Noel's 100th birthday\\" (as the liner notes say). With a capable piano accompaniment, Conrad's delivery is well sung (perhaps a bit too well, compared with Coward's famous non-singer delivery); but as with most offerings of this kind, do not attempt the whole disc at one hearing. Perhaps someone will put out a \\"Sons of Gilbert\\" program with Coward, Porter, Wodehouse, and Larry Hart lyrics.

After robbing an armed vehicle using a bazooka, wearing a suit with a red carnation, Jimmy Cobb (Lee Marvin) hides out in a barn at a farmhouse owned by oversexed siblings who abuse their help. He ditches the money in the wheat field, but it is quickly removed by a boy who enjoys whiskey, cigarettes, and the local cat house where his aunt works. Everyone is after the money they think is buried in the field.The film has lost something over time. My bad transferred to DVD copy made watching a film that lacked some entertainment value more difficult. The film claims it was made in 1984, but it has the feel of a 1970's sex comedy.

Also notable is the theme for \\"Arthur 2,\\" \\"If I Ever Had to Choose,\\" performed by Chris deBurgh, which was written for the horrible sequel to the Dudley Moore-Liza Minnelli hit. The song was overshadowed right from the get-go by the Christopher Cross classic \\"The Best You Can Do,\\" but it's a soulful, memorable song that seems to improve with each listen, featuring one of those patented Bacharach \\"hooks\\" that sits in your head for hours (or days!) afterwards.

The authors get points for bringing a lot of issues & concerns with eBusiness together. They lose more points in originality, continuity, and foresight which all seem to be non-existent. The book is a decent primer for eBusiness if you lack general knowledge, but fails to provide any indepth knowledge or principles for true value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explaining the backend and the infrastructure","review":"Very good book putting the backend and the infrastructure in context. A more general view of the Internet would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating the App. Infrastructure is the core problem....","review":"This book makes excellent points about the importance of thinking about application frameworks, not isolated apps. The thing that I learned from this book was that large companies need to make their investments in app. frameworks -- integrated set of interlocking applications -- very carefully. This is especially true for companies moving to e-business.The book does have its flaws. But, all in all as a first book on e-business application infrastructure it is an excellent one. It tells the story extremely well and is a handy reference.I hope that the authors are going to put out a second edition soon. A lot has changed in the last year since the book has been published. It would be good if the authors updated the book and added more chapters like Application Service Providers (ASP) and also a chapter on implementation issues/challenges. They can title the next edition \\"e-business 2.0\\" :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent E-Business overview","review":"If you are looking for an excellent overview of E-business, this is the book for you. It is only superficially about e-commerce. If you are not familiar with the acronyms of E-Business, CRM, ERP, SCM, etc... This book will explain those in detail and how they effect your company in terms of business and the new realm of doing business electronically.Extensive lists of questions and review points are an added bonus to get you thinking about what E-Business means to you and your company."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding contribution","review":"A great book with real life examples. The first book on Ecommerce which provides a integrated perspective and how CRM, Supply chain, ERP etc are slowly merging towards Ecommerce and how they fit together. I have read more than 15 Ecommerce books and nothing comes closer to this. A MUST MUST READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plug for ERP","review":"The book really only make one real point. Companies need to integrate their computer systems seamlessly and completely into their business to be able to succeed in the new economy. Thats all it says. The rest is a summary of ERP, CRM and other conventional solutions (such as system integration with your business partners) with constant plugs for SAP. It is a useful guide for large, lumbering giants who have a million different and incompatible computer systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Hat on the New World","review":"After a promising first few chapters on gearing your business to the e-commerce, the roadmap for success becomes a maze of disaster. It strikes me as similar to early maps of the earth - when the world was flat.The book loses its vision and becomes bogged down in process and planning. Such a subjective approach not only fails to deliver a clear map for planning but also fails to allow for further change in an ever-changing environment.Publications on e are becoming common as muck. Whilst starting well, this falls somewhere between vision and process without reconciling the two. A must for second-rate managers. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book... if you work in a company!","review":"This book is useful for beginners if you work in a large company where buzzwords like CRM, ERP, SCM, e-procurement, business intelligence, EAI etc. are being thrown around constantly by consultants. Also, it is common that many managers use these terms without understanding what these mean. This book explains these terms in the context of business using a rather good integrated framework that seems to be referenced extensively by IBM Global Services. If you are an expert, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it purports to be","review":"This book is supposed to address implementation of e-business. Instead, it goes over the standard concepts and ideas. Most people are getting beyond this book. I have purchased three books that claim to focus on implementation. This is the worse. There are no specific guidelines. There are only the normal examples that have been hashed over for years. The best book is dynamic e-bus implementation management. It at least has specific ideas and deals with many real life issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book by any standards","review":"An excellent guide for managers who wish to take their companies into the new millennium on a winning note. It's a pity most companies have not realized the importance e-business into the 21st century.

I've only gotten through the first 3 chapters and already I've run into a multitude of terms that are not explained at all. My class uses this book for its text and I have to answer discussion questions about brand-intensive vs. capital intensive, disaggregation and reaggregation (Dictionary.com didn't even have 'reaggregation' in its database), etc. It sure would be nice to include a glossary of terms used. I'm really dreading the rest of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great, but make sure you get a slightly wider one","review":"This is a great glass slide, but the ring size seems to be smaller than announced.

If you put it all the way on your finger it goes over your knuckle and you cant bend your finger. However, if you put it on half way so you can bend your finger (obviously you need to bend your finger to play) it with fall off sooner or later and does not feel like you have full control. But like I said if your hands are like Hendrix then this is the slide for you. Good price though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great...","review":"I purchased this as my first guitar slide. I loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. I almost cut myself! I will never buy a glass slide again, I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it. The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. I would not suggest this to anyone. The metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. There's a reason ALL pros use metal! The review below is wrong. Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger, all the way to the tip. You don't bend your finger to play slide. You retune your guitar to an open tuning. Just thought I would point that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound... VERY TINY STORAGE","review":"I was happy to find an MP3 shower radio.

Not because it wouldn't fit, or that the USB device itself is physically unique, it isn't. The softare however and the storage format of the Pavit is. You have to install the Pavit software to transfer mp3's from your computer to the Pavit format.

Reception and sound are fair, not good. Biggest disappointments are the draining of the batteries (with short use...only when I'm showering or using lavatory in morning may last one week) and flash drive is too small (5 mp3 songs?) and difficult to setup. The controls are difficult to operate...tiny and not very sensitive.The case/housing for the radio is beautiful and better looking than the online photo.

This thing is worthless. The portion you fit between your legs isn't long enough to securely hold itself no matter how hard you squeeze your legs together.

I used it for about an hour and threw it across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"This lap attachment needs a serious redesign...","review":"The lap attachment would have been incredibly useful if the base (the part that you squeeze between your legs) would have been longer.

The bottom of the unit where it connects to the steering wheel has uneven hard plastic pieces that irritate the thighs after using the system for a while.

It is the closest thing I've been able to find to a true Third Man soundtrack. Not only does it contain all of the music from the film (as far as I can tell) it also features some of his other work. This particular CD is amongst my very favorites: Both for the quality and amount of music (25 tracks!) and it goes without saying, for the talent and of Kara's playing.

The quality is great and brings the visual depictions of the movie back to life. The entire CD is devoted to the rather eclectic stringed instrument, the Zither, played by Anton Karas. The insert gives a nice biography of Karas, the movie and its stars, and how the theme music was joined to the optics of the movie, even how and where it was actually recorded, and why the recording arrangement suited the artist, due to his diminutive height. The CD plays several reincarnations of the theme plus some other arrangements I hadn't heard before. The entire recording has 25 separate songs, and for those who want to remember the movie without watching it again, this is a wonderful way to experience it while even driving. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anton Karas, Third Man music","review":"The Third Man is one of my all time favorite films. The music has always left me with the flavor of the film, the setting and the story. I don't remember the year when I first saw the film, but it was a nearly new film at the time. I remember the Third Man Theme from 1949 when it became popular. In my opinion, this is the best recording of the film music. While the CD is in monaural sound, and the actual recording is not as perfect as it could be in today's world, it does a near perfect job of putting me right smack dab in the middle of the story as if I was seeing it for the first time.

I found it interesting though it was a bit hard to determine which character was saying what. So I bought this dvd. The screenplay was worst than the audio book script. You could follow who was saying what but chunks of the story were missing. I expected a Cliff Note compression of the book and audio book, not a total gutting of them. Basically it's a \\"Straight to Video\\", Soap Opera-ish B-movie. With all of the cable channels out there I can't think of one that would pay money to air this.

This band sounds like they were attempting to copy Queen, the Scorpions, etc. The drumming is boring and basic, the guitar sounds like every band from the 80's: carpal tunnel inducing generic shred. The lyrics sound like they were written using \\"Formulaic Lyrics That Sound Like They Mean Something 101\\".

I grew up in the era when this disk saw heavy radio play, and even at that tender age I was fortunate to realize what drivel this was.

The band's sound became more commercial with more keyboards and predictable drumming , but they still had guitar great John Norum in the band! The three singles/videos were for the title track, Carrie (ballad), and Rock The Night (good solo). But I also like Cherokee (good riff & great solo!), Ninja (good pre-chorus), Time Has Come (good verse), Heart Of Stone (another good verse & solo), and Love Chaser (more great guitar from Norum). Unfortunately (or fortunately?) Norum soon left the band and started a fairly successful solo career, later rejoining the band for last year's heavy Start From The Dark.

The ballad Carrie is a classic 80s ballad. Songs also off the album worth mentioning are, Cherokee and Rock the Night. Both strong singles. Sometimes compared to Bon Jovi the only resemblance is the hair. You could go and get Europes greatest hits CD but as far as I am concerned this is it.

So what do you know, I found this movie and I absolutely loved it. It sent chills down my spine during the moments that her alters came to be. I do not know the name of the actress but I think she portrayed the character perfectly. Other reviews might state that you won't understand it unless you've read the book but I disagree.

People from East Chicago Indiana, remember the groups that sang by Sardi's on Main and 139th. Acappella music was not meant to be sung with musical instruments, and revolves around pure vocal harmony. It seems the group has transformed over the years, and my opinion is they should go back to the pure sound of Acappellic music. There are few good tracts on this cd, but I'd personally save my money on this one. The ducktails of EC are washing their hairout after they listen to this album. The Ghost's of Main Street and Euclid Ave are heading for the Steel Mills just to be alone, so they could harmonize in the locker rooms and showers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracklisting","review":"01.

I also truly enjoy the songs \\"Talk About It\\", \\"I can/ Beleive\\", \\"Baby Girl\\", and \\"Black Light\\" on the more upbeat side. But my favorite song is \\"When I Call On Jesus\\", a slow song.

My Personal favs are Call On Jesus, Baby Girl, Sometimes, Let Me go, Come to me, and When Heaven calls. The whole album is great I have only had it for 24 hours and it is truly amazing. I'm not a big goer for Black Light. Maybe If I was African American I would Love it (No offense to African Americans I like the song it has a very good message.)

The book is incredibly bland, and while it goes through the life span in order, it seems to jump around from different people's theories too much. Better if all of Piaget's ideas were presented together for a certain topic, etc.. On top of that, I believe that the method of citing the sources, while it works for research papers, seemed out of place in this setting. Numbered footnotes would have worked better. The method of citation used made it seem choppy, as all of a sudden you'd see a last name and a year in the middle of the text. This could be done more effectively, because the current method definitely broke up the text significantly. Hopefully, some of these changes will be implemented in a future edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hafix: The Scent of Life CD","review":"I was disappointed in this CD. I'd hoped for a series of gentle readings of Hafiz's wonderful poetry, something to listen to at night or during meditation. Unfortunately, the accompanying music is loud and shrill and dominates. This is more a CD of eastern music with snatches of Hafiz in between than the other way round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy this CD for what it is","review":"I find this CD enjoyable, but you have to take it for what it is, not for what it is not. It is primarily Indian music interspersed with short readings of the poetry of Hafiz. Nataraja Kallio has a very smooth voice, which is appropriate for this poetry.In addition to this mostly musical CD, I would enjoy a CD that consists of poems of Hafiz read one after another with little or no music. I encourage the Sounds True company to produce such a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's fela?","review":"Fela fans will probably recognize this format of release - two songs that use the collective improvisitory facility of his entire brilliant band to draw them out.However, the first song doesn't even sound like Fela is on it! There are actually a number of records bearing his name that he is absent from. Few of them live up to the name.The second song, though, sounds like a standard, relentless Fela-style groove, complete with horn assault, but I wouldn't call it his best work.This release is part of the reason the box set came out - there are so many average Fela records - and they wanted to put the best versions of the best songs on one record.Not a bad idea, but why only two discs?Anyway, We'd probably all be better off with copies of Original Sufferhead, Black Man's Cry (both on shanachie,) or the box set!May he never be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPPY SHOPPER","review":"SHOPPING ON AMAZON.COM IS A PLEASURE.

Not that it's always an easy task grasping the multitude of relationships between the ideas that he outlines as constituting our notions of modern selfhood. But since such an undertaking is expressed so eloquently and thoroughly in this sprawling tome, \\"Sources of the Self\\" seems more than worth the trouble.

I just use it for a weekly show, and I found the table-top stand awkward to position easily in front of my computer screen, and still see the screen. Also I think they might have provided some clearer directions on how to set the whole thing up. I ended up using a floor stand to which I also clamp the pop filter, and since I leave it all set up from one show to the next, the suitcase isn't really useful to me.

At least it's easy to follow.But as for the story, it's nothing great. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's nothing notably special. It sports an okay concept but it doesn't really feel... Silent Hillish at all.So far, these comics have been seriously breaking from the original source material. I don't understand why they felt the need to do that, but these stories absolutely don't work with the original games or the movie. I could live with that if these stories presented something worthwhile, but so far Dying Inside, Among the Damned, Paint it Black, and The Grinning Man haven't been much to write home about."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for toddlers, no dangers for traditional values","review":"My 18-month old loves this book.

There's NO discernible fragrance AT ALL. Patchouli has a pretty strong odor so if there was any in here it should hit your nose the minute you walk in the bathroom (the other one does).

If somebody made this stuff up, you wouldn't believe it!The book is extremely well written. But it is Leonie Freida's ability to convey the flow of events that makes this book a \\"story\\" more than a recitation of facts, as so many history books are.

Payne and Downes are an awesome combo and album after album have proved to be the best at what they do - writing great meaningful, sweeping, and powerul music. Buy the rest of their albums since (especially 'Aura') and you won't be dissapointed. Aqua is a must have album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asia? In name only.","review":"Though the album may claim to be from \\"Asia\\", the resemblance is in name only. Yes, Geoff Downes is still plugging away on the keyboards, but he's the only original member of the group who performs on all the tracks. Former mates Carl Palmer and Steve Howe make brief appearances on the album (\\"courtesy\\" of other record labels, no less), but their work is minimal, serving only to bridge the old with the new. That this is now Geoff's band is apparent from the first listen - heavy on keyboards, light on substance. New lead singer John Payne also fails to impress, offering little more than some hair-band shrieking to the already substandard material. The original Asia had a less-than-vaunted reputation with the critics to begin with; this album will give them no reason to change their opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you dehydrated?","review":"The title of this record is appropriate. \\"Aqua\\" contains some of the most watered-down music ever recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I give this Asia album 2 stars because of the groups usual high quality musicianship. Outside of that, the lyrics are forgetable and John Paynes lyrics aren't close to the caliber of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Payne era begins.","review":"\\"Aqua\\" (1992) Did not chart.John Payne's version of Asia began with, Carl Palmer on drums, Geoff Downes keyboards, Steve Howe guitar on 6 tracks, and Al Pitrelli (current member of Trans-Siberian Orchestra). \\"Who Will Stop The Rain?\\", got plenty of airplay here in '92. Other tunes of note, \\"Love Under Fire\\" written by Greg Lake and \\"Crime Of The Heart\\". This album sounds like a hair band and that's a shame. This would be the last album I would buy until their 2006 live album by the original group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade B+","review":"Jeff Payne's first cd as vocalist and bassist, may also be the new lineup's best. It's close between this cd and their next one, ARIA. The group, even though they changed singers, still keep much of their signature sound, and Payne, who is not a carbon copy of old singer Wetton, still has the Asia delivery to his songs, of course it helps that rest of Asia is still intact. After this cd only Downes will be an orginal member. WHO CAN STOP THE RAIN, VOICE OF REASON, & DON'T CALL ME, are the closest to the orginal Asia, and are the best songs on the cd. LITTLE RICH BOY, is my least liked song on this cd. Group doesn't stray far from the old grounds, even with a new singer. Not a bad release from the reformed Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Asia","review":"Yes, this is the first album without John Wetton and the some of the music is really good, example \\"Aqua I\\", \\"II\\" and \\"Who will stop the rain\\", but it lacks in the orignal Asia sound that made them one of a kind. This will be a interesting to see how the future music will be on the new sound with the old name."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad gasket","review":"We bought this blender a few years ago, but just recently started using it regularly to blend nutritional smoothies. Although it blends things very well and fast; for the cost of this product, I expected it to last a lot longer. The gasket around the bearing simply shredded and is not available to replace unless you purchase a new carafe altogether for $60! Not happy after spending nearly $500 on the blender to begin with. I thought the entire product was guaranteed for life, but not the case...just the blade & bearing itself is covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about a real teen pregnancy.","review":"It's unfortunate that stories like this one are no longer \\"acceptable\\" in today's conservative social climate. This is another \\"teen pregnancy\\" story, one that does not automatically assume that all teen mothers keep their babies - in fact, when this was written about 25 years ago teens actually had a choice about this matter, without fear of censure from intolerant religious groups. This story is handled sensitively and from the viewpoint of a very innocent girl. Her choice is hard, but it's one she must make to insure that her future life will be a better one. I wish this book was available to all girls today. It is important for every woman to know that she still has a choice about her own life and future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This classic is forgettable","review":"Even though the selections on this cd seemed to be from stellar orchestras and conductors, I was underwhelmed with each piece. A lack of vibrancy and resonance resulted in a very boring listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"for my $ the best around","review":"the best around the way these two compliment each other with their styles and drop tight lyrics and all these playahatas need to stop cause this is some good stuff, and they didnt sell out cause i dont see them anywhere i cant find them where they at they not on tv not on mtv or bet so what is the deal.

Instead, they take the easy road and rhyme about the same stuff everyone else does--and with little creativity. I've got mad ho's, I've got mad money, so forth, and so on. That stuff is tired, and something I wouldn't expect from an MC as talented and versatile as Words. And what's worse is the beats aren't really that tight, so you can't really get into it musically. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRIFIC ALBUM","review":"after hearing these cats on the lyricist lounge album and various other joints i thought they were an up and coming duo.But then MTV got a hold of them.Apparently the Lyricist Lounge show although short-lived was enough to poison these unfortunate artists.'The EP'paints these guys as some kind of wannabe neo-thugs which is not why i enjoyed their earlier work.The beats are incredibly ordinary and that I-95 joint is one of the most tragic horrendous attempts at music i have ever encountered. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cmon Wordsworth, you could do better than this.","review":"First of all get rid of Punch and get yourself a producer. I would of gave this album a Zero if I could.

Now i'm looking for more Boo-Yaa funk and i can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This collection rocks the house!","review":"If you like great Southern fried music, pick this one up. Here, you have a sampling of every CDB album on Epic Records. I will caution you, though, that this music is addictive. This won't be the last CDB music you'll ever buy. I am a fanatic, so I have to have almost everything that Charlie ever recorded. This began when I seriously started to absorb this set. It's definitely worth the money. This also makes for a great autograph item, if you ever get a chance to meet Charlie. He's a good guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compilation","review":"Charlie at his best. Many of his greats including \\"Saddle Tramp\\" and \\"Orange Blossom Special\\" are in this boxset. Definitely a must have for a serious music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly great music","review":"Not being a big country fan, I found much of the music and lyrics to be very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book was unlike any other mystery book that I have read. The story of a women that leaves her town and ends up at castle with a mystery to solve. The ending is shocking and you probably wouldn't guess who it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just call it ROCK","review":"There is a good reason for the CINDERELLA reference to the band's sound...The guitarist was a founding member of Cinderella, but before the band was signed, they had to disown Mr Mike. Jeff LaBar was a friend of studio exec, and a fitting replacement. No major loss or gain either way.Guitarist Mike simply reformed another band; banged out his steady, consistent, balls-on hard rocking style; not to mention finding a comparable singer to Mr Kiefer...The result is the music world did not suffer. We, the fans, got two fantastic rocking outfits producing music during the only period where good, consistent music was released.Grunge may have killed AOR radioplay, but the majority of these bands continued on (and several still do).Britny Fox, hair band or otherwise, still belted out fantastic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Fox - 'The Best Of .....' (Sony)","review":"I don't care WHAT anyone says, Britny Fox IS in fact like a Cinderella wanna be. That's isn't necessarily a bad thing, for I saw the band twice back in the day and always wanted to check them out again. This 'Best Of' compilation looks to be pulled from their first two albums, that were good '80's metal. Tunes I liked the best were \\"Girlschool\\" (love the old Mtv video), \\"Long Way To Love\\" (reminds me SO much of Aerosmith), \\"In Motion\\", a cover of Slade's \\"Gudbye T' Jane\\" and \\"Standing In The Shadows\\". A couple of live tunes were tagged on to lure both old and new fans, I'm sure. A should-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great cd","review":"A great cd for your glam rock collection. If you want to get back to head banging an eargasms buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their music didn't age well","review":"I was a fan of Britny Fox back in their early years (when Dizzy Dean was the vocalist), but listening to this stuff now-almost 20 years later-gives me a headache. These guys were nothing more than the poor man's Cinderella - except that Cinderella had some really cool songs that I can STILL listen to. Sorry, but this collection is for the die-hard Britny Fox fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinderella ...","review":"Can you imagine anyone making money by being a Cinderella ... band? Well Britney Fox did it! They play, look, and perform just like Cinderella. If you had never heard either band and you listened to a tape of alternating songs, you WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. Besides I think they had the same taylors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Compilation from a Two Trick Pony","review":"The few people who still care about Britny Fox probably remember them as that band with the guys who weren't good enough to play in Cinderella, used frilly shirts and had a video on MTV with catholic school girls. That's kind of a shame, really, because much like Cinderella, they had a knack for putting out great AC/DC inspired hair metal party anthems every now and then, albeit they lacked the former's rootsy blues touch, gift for melody and songwriting talent. Although in my oppinion Britny Fox only released two really whorthwile songs during their less than illustrious career, Girlschool and Long Way to Love, the rest of the material presented on this disk is OK. If 80's hard rock's your cup of tea, you might like this, but be forewarned that even in their heyday, this was a mediocre, third tier hair metal band at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and new","review":"This is a fantastic album of new and refreshing music written and performed by two exceptional musicians. It gives breath to many traditional forms of music, not least of them, those with a very French Cafe feel to them. I first heard the album being played in a Cafe in northern France, it was perfect and lively and a refreshing change from the usual drudge. Congratulations!Whenever I,m feeling down, this is what I play.If you like this album, look out for anything by Gina Griffin, Sam Burns, Chris or \\"Phil & Gille\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Addition","review":"This is great value for the supreme performance. Multiple speeds and mulitple attachments. Easy to clean.I've been making fruit smoothies for 3 months now and the performance is still top notch. I use frozen berries and they get pulvarized.I was surprised at the size of the chopper bowl - it's only about 25% smaller than that of a my food processor. I've put my food processor away given the performance of this blender with the chopper bowl attachment. I've pulvarized cookies for cheesecake crust, nuts & cold chocolate chips.The whisk attachment I've used only once and feel like the unit has too much power for the whisk attachment. I've yet to install the organizing rack - it would only help with storing 2 of the 4 components.This is an excellent housewarming gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"This immersion blender is powerful, but has some flaws. First, you have to depress the button constantly for the blender to work, this can be akward and tedious when you're blending an entire pot of soup. This is pretty much what I hate the most about this. Second, the mini food processor is pretty shoddy. The first one that came with my blender was cracked, the company I bought it from had awesome customer service and sent me a new one right away withoug my needing to return the first one. After 2 uses (making salad dressing, nothing too complicated) the second one has cracks in the bottom where oil leaks out. I had an old Braun one that worked well for 10 years. . .I wish I could have found that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I saw it on an infomercial and decided to get it. It is too heavy, extremely difficult to screw the attachments on or off, and not so good. Over time the plastic valve where the parts screw wore off, so now I can't use it at all. Also, the metal blade bent while blending cooked vegetables in a ...soup!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Wanted to Love This","review":"I bought this after careful research because I needed something really powerful that would last and do the simple jobs well. It's a great little appliance until (very quickly) it starts to fall apart. The plastic housing just doesn't stand up to basic use. The clips that hold the motor/wand to the attachments broke off almost immediately and now I have to hold the attachments to the wand while using it. The gasket in the blender head came loose, and that can't be used because the plate behind the blade wobbles all around, the blended food gets behind it and into the mechanism, and it sprays food all around the kitchen. The motor is a joy, just the power I wanted, but no good at all if the rest of the appliance falls apart. I'm going back to my local discount store and buying a crummy one that holds up lots better and is cheap to replace if it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"more than I expected...or needed","review":"This thing could launch a rocket! quite heavy and long and just way powerful. I've used it a few times - find myself reluctant to pull it out bcz it's just so unweildy. Must admit it sure does a job on blending soup! It's so powerful, tho, that while it's on, the blade gets suctioned on the bottom of the pan. I ONCE tried to pull it up while it was running and it flew off whirling carrot soup all over the kitchen. considering I only use this kind of thing 6 or 8 times a year, if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't shop for power and wattage - I'd go for something more manageable and less likely to be found in a NASA lab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aviod","review":"I loved the original Defender of the Crown that came out 20 years ago for the Amiga. The whole point of the original was to make you feel like you were in a movie. It was ahead of it's time with great graphics, sound and story line. The remake of this title has none of this.If you are like me and wanted this title to relive the past, forget it. It s a poor copy of the original. The game play is horrible, there is no story line, the sound and graphics are sub-par. You would think with 20 years of new technology that they would be able to produce a game at least equal to the original? Who ever brought back the Cinemaware name has no clue what made their game great in the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amusing distraction","review":"This game is pretty short and goofy, to be sure. Winning overall hasn't been too tough, as the AI seems to pull punches a lot. Multiple difficulty levels would probably have been a good idea.But it's kinda fun. It's basically a series of mini-games which involve reflexes, coordination, or quick thinking tacked on to a simple strategy game of troops and resources.If I had paid real money for it I'd probably be disappointed, but as I picked if up for chunk change it's been a fun few hours. I never saw the original in its heyday, so I had no particular expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galen Finds New Faith -- and a Home","review":"The author took the account of David's victory over Goliath from I Samuel 17 and wrote a story about two boys who could have watched the battle.

To find a modern and interest-grabbing book which will whet their appetites for British Lit is a difficult task. I believe this book will do it with its fast-moving, physical plot encompassed in solid prose, idiomatic phrasing and cultural enticement.

As one reviewer said, The Death of an Irish Sea Wolf is so much more than a mystery story - it's poetry, history, adventure, and description- such marvelous description that I wish I could take off tomorrow for Ireland!

This is a movie that is a good introduction to the Holocaust for 12-14 year olds. Do you really want a 12 year old to watch the Pianist or Schindler's List????The plot is lacking, and the acting could be improved. But this was a made for TV movie, and for what it is, it is great.

It didn't really stick to the book and I have to admit the acting was a little cheesy, and it seemed to me kinda hard to understand if you hadn't read the book... but overall I was really pleased with this book.I would recommend the book to anyone who saw this movie... it's definatly better (as the books usually are). The ending was very sad but deeply moving, it almost made me cry (I'm not big a movie cryer person). This movie was just very sad, though I think they were too soft with creating a relization of the Holocaust. Brittany Murphy, playing as Hannah's cousin Rivkah, was fantastic and thought-prevoking. Definatly the #1 acting in this movie.Overall I have to say this movie was excellent and I would recommend to all. It's really a good movie if you like historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"We did a novel study on this book in our reading class, and our teacher got this movie for us to watch. What a disappointment! It is nothing like the book. Hannah is about 7 years older than she is in the book, they never even mention the Hannah/Chaya connection, and almost all of the main characters aren't even mentioned or have the major roles that they have in the book. If you are looking for a good movie adaptation of a good book, don't even bother with this movie.

WW and Holocaust I can only say - pop history. I hate, when filmmakers don't tell the whole truth or manipulate it. This movie is full of mistakes - right from beginning. October 1941 - surprise, surprise - Germans interrupt a wedding! But in the Fall 1941 Jews have been treated as animals in 2 years already and at least in a year they lived in ghettos. Deportation - discussion with Germans? Absurd! No selection before departure and after arrival? No way. KZ prizoners look quite healthy and fed up. And where are all this people stuffed together in KZ camps? No money for actors?A romantic story with a tiny relation to the hell of Shoa.If you want to see a movie closer to reality of Jews destiny see Spielbergs Schindlers List, see Polanskis The Pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable!","review":"I find the movie to follow the book very well.

I ended up using it as a teaching lesson and helping my students learn to compare and contrast. However I really expected more from the movie. It was such a great opportunity for the film makers to help teenagers of today make a real world connection to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Instead they changed the plot around only keeping the main idea of the book, cut essential characters, changed the main characters age and her relationship with a significant minor character, added a poor sub plot of a love interest, and the list goes on. The book itself is so powerful that I can not see how the author was not repulsed by the drastic changes made to such a well thought out and organized novel.

Prometheous, The First, Death in the Family, Mystery Man, Stop the Presses, The Psychic, The Harder they Fall, Dark side, Deep Shock, Kindered Spirits and a few more. Instead of releasing these in seasons, they are releasing theme discs. The search for a cure, Jack McGee files, The Legend of the Hulk, Powers of the Hulk and more. Sadly there is no extras, but the commentary over the pilot and Married made up for this.

No need for an AC adaptor and xtra wires. The fans are not noisy at all. They are quieter than my Targus USB-Chill Hub. Eforcity and Amazon offer great customer service. Add all this to the price and it's a no brainer, you'd think I work them. Only negatives are cheaper materials and structure as far as ports lining up perfectly may lead to loss of functionality and long term durability.

Although not literature, it borrows heavily from Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice storyline. The refreshing thing about is that her characters actually do have clever things to say; unlike most romance novels where everyone is talking about how clever they are when in reality they are boring paste. And I am sick to death of \\"spirited\\" heroines who are just bitchy. And I am tired of men who are \\"amused\\" and raise an eyebrow instead of having anything decent to say. I liked how Lillian really did seem to have a lot of spunk. The friendships, particularly between the ladies, felt genuine. Kleypas pays a lot of attention to historical detail and is one of the few romance novelists to get those details correct. All in all, very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Pear in a Bottle","review":"There is a reason why \\"It Happened One Autumn\\" has so many good reviews and here is another,I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!Lillian and Marcus are a perfect match, maintaining a superb romantic battle throughout the entire story.

I wasn't crazy about Lillian, the heroine in this book, but I decided to give it a try. I still didn't like her very much as a heroine, nothing to do with Anabelle in the first book. It just didn't convince me as settled on that era, too much sex and a weak story for my taste. Don't get me wrong, steamy scenes like what Simon and Anabelle had on the first book are very good, but in this one, well, the last one I didn't even read it, it was kind of boring at that point.So, if you're looking for hot sex scenes, they by all means buy it. If you prefer a good romance novel, find another one. This will not do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Westliff's i.e. Marsdens","review":"I loved this story and all the books of the Wallflower Series.

My only regret is that Olivia and Gideon Shaw don't have their own book; they obviously married later-as they're mentioned in the Wallflower series \\"It Happened One Autumn.\\" I hope there is a book out there for them and I've somehow missed it because I don't know which romance I like better the in this book Aline and McKenna's (whom were the featured characters, or Livia and Shaw)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallflower Book 2 - But Good On Its Own","review":"Who can resist a dashing hero that can't help but feel captivated by the not-so-perfect heroine?

She was very entertaining, not following the rules, even questioning them out loud in front of everyone. She was fun.

The glimps into St. Vincent was interesting. Much harder than youd think, his book should be exciting. Glad they got rid of his mother though, she made you want to wack her with her own cane.

The book was very much a light-hearted romp as opposed to an angst-filled drama. I was actually a little off-put at first...but as the two main characters developed I found that I really liked them. Lillian and Marcus were one of those opposites attract couples. They were hilarious and endearing. Also, Ms Kleypas has the uncanny ability to write facinating 2nd characters that I just desparately want to know more about! The villain in this story turns out to be the Hero in the next one.

How many of us can relate? To be attracted to someone against your so-called \\"better judgment\\" rang so true for a good number of us on this earth. Aside from the physical attraction, these guys came to understand one another. So what was once physical took on an emotional turn and came to fruition when Lillian was abducted.Sometimes you don't realize what you have until its gone or in this case...almost gone. Now can you relate?Lisa Kleypas has really out done herself with this one! She has even given us a tantalizing morsel of what's to come in the third installment.

Interestingly enough the other album was from a woman as well (Queen Mother Rage). Nevertheless this album was a strong debut for Isis despite the incessant interjections by Professor X. The beats were good but utilized a large number of house and Afro-pean rythms to help it along. Not that you noticed any of this once Isis (Lin Que) started to rhyme. Also the African movement was central to her theme so it worked rather well. It really was a shame that her career never blossomed. Other than a quick cd5 that followed a few years later Isis faded to obscurity far before her time. This CD is a true gem of 90's rap if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"My 7 year old daughter and I enjoyed this.

Okay that was the wish list - but I doubt it is all possible for $100. So, how does it sound? I have it hooked up to a 7.1 set of Bose speakers, and the 120W per channel delivers the punch.

You simply can't resist the deft touch on tracks like 'You Can't Take That' however and only she could get away with the wishy washy girl/wishy washy world line in the high camp 'Go Away', which transforms itself from tragic to triumphant after a couple of gin and tonics. At least the girl know how to have a laugh. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated actors show their range","review":"This film can't be categorized and that's a good thing. The tone of the movie stands on the line between parady/satire and drama. Of course the subject of murder is serious and we shouldn't take it lightly. Brosnan plays a hit man who starts to feel remorse and longs for human connection. Kinnear plays a 'normal' businessman with real life worries and a life that Brosnan's character is drawn to. The question is, who will pulled into whose life. Much of the film covers both characters everday life events so we know a lot of who the are and what they do. In spite of the subject matter it isn't a flashy movie but much is done with subtlety. This movie deserved much more praise and exposure than what it got. Hopefully many have found it on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredictably Entertaining","review":"Pierce Brosnan is the burned out hit man who meets Greg Kinnear as a straight lace yet down on his luck salesman. They meet at a bar in Mexico where the real adventure begins with the strangest friendship that is somewhat believable considering where they both were in their lives. It is sort of black comedy about doing the right thing. And there is an interesting twist in the movie. They both do a superb job of acting that is what drives this movie. This character driven movie does have some strong sexual content."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie.","review":"Im really suprised that this has not become an underground classic. In ways it reminds me of the Big Lebowski. The movie is everything I thought it would not be. It is not in anyway shape or form a Bond knock off. The one liners in this movie are hilarious. Pierce is in top form. Really didnt realize how capable of an actor he is. Enough talk. If your a fan of dark comedy's with great dialogue. I suggest it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boots, speedos, sunglasses, and a beer","review":"This is a great character comedy, with a dash of sex and violence. Pierce Brosnan is able to cut loose in this film, and creates a wonderfully bizarre character. He comes accross as a combination of conniving lecherous Beetlejuice from that picture, and a burnt out gone to seed third rate Bond. He manages to be repulsive and sympathetic at the same time. It is a great role, and he plays it to the hilt. The scenes shot in Mexico are vibrant and colorful. I would have liked a little more meat to the final job, possibly some more hurdles for the Greg Kinnear character to have to jump, helping Brosnan and cementing his new found confidence in himself. This is an enjoyable romp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tea: After one sip, I think I'll pass.","review":"Overall this was a total miss for me, story wise.The story follows a hit man (Brosnan) who ends meeting and soon befriending an \\"average joe\\". A while later, the hitman shows up on the door, of the average joe and his wife, asking for a favor.Obviously, the acting was great, great actors. However, the story was lacking for me. It didn't \\"hook me\\" into it, whether it was the hitman's character not being strong enough or the plot not being strong enoug, it's a toss up. The story and the main character have to grab me, have to make me want to know how it ends, what happens. That's the whole point of writing movies. You create a great character and then put them in the middle of a fire (so to speak) and push them to their limits.This was ho-hum for me in both areas.So, no, I won't be buying this for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoah, a real movie with characters!","review":"Totally shocked to watch a movie and like it this much.

The plot was ludicrous and contrived, the comedy was forced, the viewer couldn't care less about the outcome.

The movie overall, spare some crude language that I wasn't real keen on, was a good watch. I'd recommend at least renting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty offbeat and funny","review":"I really liked this film and didn't expect too much when I purchased it. I like Peirce Brosnan and enjoyed this role more than even his Bond roles. Just such a bizarre character that you can't help but like him. The Anti-James Bond, but yet still somehow cool. Won't give the rest away, but a nice offbeat surprise. Probably not for everyone, but I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never gets off the ground","review":"I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. With two very good actors I figured it shouldn't be a waste of time and it wasn't. But it was slow moving in parts, Pierce Brosnan's character is a quirky lounge lizard that happens to be an assasin and it was hard to picture (accept?) Brosnan in that roll. It is a 180 degree departure from his Bond character and when you think of Bond these days, tag he's it. Greg Kinnear is solid as usual although his character just seems to tag along for the ride.

Sybil Danning plays her stepmother & Anthony Fransciosa play her dad. Also known as Bad Blood & Daughter Of Death, and directed by Paul Nicolas (Chained Heat, The Naked Cage) this is far less exploitive than you might think, sort of an '80's \\"Bad Seed\\".

And the level of detail in the book includes not just macro-management, but tweaking as well.

I fell instantly in love when I saw that he was able to transform the hustler's creed into a work of art. I love words and all of his were perfect, he was gritty by the English language.Although THE FAMILY: A PHILADELPHIA MOB STORY is short, it depicts a friendship that was formed to give the men work. It was a rise to the top, filled with gang rivals, knowledge, sex, greed and of course the take down of an empire.THE FAMILY: A PHILADELPHIA MOB STORY This book is a realization filled with knowledge.

His attacks are not based on fact and cites distant history as reason for current problems with the global economy. Instead of focusing on how we can bring about change and make life better for those living on less than a dollar a day, he is more concerned with making America look bad. It is funny that he makes his money on the heals of global capitalism (the very capitalism that he denounces) in Washington, DC (the city that represents Western imperialism and evil according to the Prof).

Being gay, knowing it can't change, but having to hide it and have to live alone forever to fit in with your faith.. that's awful, and this book simply makes it more awful, because it's written by a self-hating gay.

There are no beatiful images of nature created through metaphor or simile; no philisophical or metaphysical discoveries made during his experiences.

They work well only when aligned in one direction; all the vehicles facing up or all facing down when stacking all 5. If you have a combination of up and down they won't line up and fall over easily. Forget about trying to stack them on their sides because the plastic is too slippery. These may work out better once my son is older and understands that they should face one direction, but at 14 months he's still having trouble. Regular wooden blocks work better for him to stack.

Benford does away with tired old notions about life in general and intelligent life specifically, which in most SF consists of either a) biological life; b) some form of artificial intelligence, or c) a type of ill (or non-) defined divinity. The book ponders the meaning and place of electromagnetics and chemistry; of concepts of \\"big\\" and \\"small\\"; of the relative importance for living entities to be solid, concrete, mortal and defined.

Anyone buying this scannner for scanning slides and negatives will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"I have own two visioneer scanners, they work for a short period of time them start having trouble with them. Contacting Visioneer is a wate of time, they will try anything to get out of fxing your scanner, which is guarantee for ome year. I will not buy another one, and sugest that you do the same. HP makes a scanner that has a year guarantee and they will replace their scanner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not locked damnit","review":"This scanner worked extremely well for about a year (interesting that's when the warrenty craps out). I then get the Lock error refered to above. It appears that the main bulb is burned out. I was acctually pertty impressed with there tech support. I got hold of a real person in less than 30 seconds. They offered to send be a new one If I could prove I bought it in the last year.Sigh"},{"rating":"1","title":"When it Works, It's Works; When it Dosen't.....","review":"I bought this scanner almost a year ago with a new computer. The person who installed it (someone who worked in a computer repair store for 10+ years), had a hard time getting it to work properly at first. When it was working, I was able to scan just about anyghing with no problem and decent quality. Color and B&W; pictures came out decent, although the white tended to have a pale blue tinge to it. If used for B&W; text, I had to increase the resolution in order to have unbroken italic writing.My main problem is that I had kept getting a TWAIN device error which forced me to either restart the program, computer, or reinstall the software on several occasions. The last straw was yesterday when I reinstalled the software TWICE TO THE EXACT LETTER of the provided instructions, and the instrument refused to work AT ALL.In conclusion, I suggest getting another scanner, like I'm going to do this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this scanner","review":"This scanner had the \\"Twain\\" problem which could not be resolved. Also I ran into the \\"unlock the scanner\\" problem, when the transport lock on the bottom of the scanner was not locked. Just broken. Customer service was no help, costs $2/minute. Won't buy Visioneer again after reading reviews of other models having the same problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"This is a must-have for dog owners and fanciers alike!

If you love or like dogs, this is a book you NEED to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Once You Get Past the Cuteness","review":"Someone gave me this book and I was prepared to dislike it after a few paragraphs. The authors have gone all cutesy and talk about selecting your \\"model\\", checking the \\"parts list\\", performing \\"basic maintenance\\" and other computer / machine metaphors. Once I stopped gagging, though, I discovered there's a lot of interesting information. I especially liked the section on how dogs relate to human speech. The quality of the paper is exceptionally high - very thick pages that seem to be highly water resistant (though I didn't test this out, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no! Annoying Schtick! Too short to be thorough!","review":"A friend gave me this book when I first adopted my dog--the info isn't bad, but the computer manual gimmicky presentation and format were just too cutesy & annoying--certainly too short to be definitive or the last book you'll need as some reviewers said! (Maybe if you really don't like to read much!) What it did inspire me to do is immediately start a search for more serious and detailed books . . .

Now I know why it was [inexpensive]."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite French revolution video!","review":"I am a world history teacher and I love this video.

Its cheaper for the EXACT SAME VIDEO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edit if you are using this for high school.","review":"Last year I showed this video to my eleventh grade World History classes. For the most part, my students enjoyed this documentary, which focuses on Robespierre.If you decide to use this video for class you might want to fast forward through a few minutes. There's a section that discusses the king's problems in the bedroom and how the common folk circulated nasty pamplets to embellish on the royal couple's supposed escapades in the bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone, boring","review":"We watched this as a family, with a 10yo and 13yo who know a reasonable amount about about the French Revolution. We weren't surprised to find sex and blood, but it was rather overdone. We had to fast forward past a few spots, which we expected, but overall, none of us were engaged and we didn't learn anything new that we can remember. In fact, all four of us felt a little dirty at the end, mostly because we all thought we'd wasted our time.The pacing was slow, the shots were repeated over and over, and what \\"acting\\" there was seemed self-conscious. For example, the blood dripping from the basket under the guillotine was maybe moderately effective the first couple of times, but then became just annoying. It grossed out my kids, and didn't add to the meaning or feeling of horror because of its overuse.I know that any French Revolution video worth its salt must contain ickiness to be real, but this one tried too hard and failed miserably at our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I had no problems with the product. The delivery was on time, the bottle was intact, the dropper worked, and the extract was effective for the anti-inflammatory needs I had for it.

If I see a sale, I will buy several bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a delightful suprise","review":"This CD has 5 of the nicest tunes I've heard in a long time - and two that especially stand out.

I really like the sleek glossy look that goes around the phone. Suprisingly enough after 7 months of use it doesn't have any major scratches on its surface.I have NEVER lost a call or had no service wherever I have gone while using this phone. It is amazing since I always used to have a terrible time trying to find a spot where my older phones would get one bar of service.I do have a complaint though, the screen on the inside of the phone is tiny. If your eyes are bad then I would recommend a phone with a larger screen. Other than that I praise this phone, especially since I didn't have to pay anything for it with my plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wasn't good enough","review":"The characters were poorly written, and Simone never spends enough time or thought with any other character to make it believeable or to make us care. (including her husband, as they fall instantly in love, they move away, he gets shot.) I've read other books with quick pacing, but here everything is just too convienient, there is no real struggle, and I couldn't believe any of it.There are also weird devices like her grandmother having spirits of her past (dead) loves hiding in her armpit, cleavage ect. who talk to her, or sing loudly and distract her thoughts. What was that about? I found it extremely annoying and distracting.It was ultimately a dissapointment, because the setting deserved a better story. Can't say I'll be looking for any more of Ms. Mossanen's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical and exotic but confusing","review":"I just finished this book and was glad to be done with it. While the locales were exotic and intriguing enough to keep me reading, the writing was uneven at best, almost as thought it was a bad translation or something. Im not sure a better editor could have helped it. The author jumped from locale to locale in a jilting way and most of the relationships were never believable. It is my understanding that her first novel 'Harem' was critically acclaimed but having read this one first I won't bother with Harem."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I ever read","review":"I don't know where to start and I don't have time to do an editor's job--although she should have hired a couple of them. Reads like a bad self-published vanity book written by a woman who makes love with the lights off. The characters are never developed, there is no ending and most of the references in French are incorrect. Olfactory references grossly overused in comparison to other senses. The author should keep her nails well manicured and off the keyboard. I gave it one star because this feature will not allow the reviewer to give ZERO STAR... LOUSY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Offbeat and fun!","review":"This CD is a lot of fun-the lyrics are fresh and original and the songs are SO catchy! You'll find yourself constantly humming the tune to \\"Mistress Veronica\\", which by the way is about a dominatrix! \\"Missing\\" is my personal favorite-a beautiful song with chilling lyrics.

Runs well add a timer to the unit is perfect works for days without touching the sprinkler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watering Beast","review":"I love this beast. It weighs a ton and runs like a little train along the \\"track\\" -- that is the hose line that you lay down for it to follow. The first day I spent an hour just watching it water my lawn. Perfect. We've had a long dry spell this year. I have one of the few green lawns in town. A well made and useful tool. That said it is most efficient for a medium sized to larger lawn. The spray is adjustable for small lawns but the water distribution is better over a bigger area and while the machine tracks along very well it doesn't do sharp turns. I recommend it to anyone with enough space and who is sick of dragging hoses and sprayers to a new section every hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Built thing I've ever purchased.","review":"I was looking for an inexpensive/portable sprinkler system and had not even considered a sprinkler of this type as I wasn't even aware that they existed. I was hesitant to spend $229 on what initially seemed like a goofy idea of a product but the reviews convinced me to take the plunge. This is by far the best well built thing I've ever purchased. There isn't one part of it that I look at and think 'that'll probably break soon'. Was it worth the $229? Considering that they can't keep them in stock and more might be available in spring of 2013 (according to the manufacturers website) I would say so. I guess I was lucky that they had some in stock when I got the urge to look into this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking cast Iron sprinkler","review":"Ive been wanting one of these for so long, I looked at the cheaper built ones, all or part plastic and doomed to break after the first one of two seasons of use. I bought this one and have used it several times due to our drought situation down here in the south. This sprinkler is awesome. I lay out the hose in the morning and turn it on. You set the amount of water you want to put out and it does the rest. My yard is pretty and green now. The sprinkler is well built, solid metal with replaceable parts. Just remember to pick it up by the handle and not by the sprinkler bars. Its very heavy and not apt to be knocked over by any animals or children.

I've had no problem hooking anything up to it (and I'm pretty bad with electronics). The remote took me a few minutes to figure out, but now I'm good to go! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants just a regular good old tv.The only thing I wish was different is that it had more space on the top to put my cable box, because I like to have that on the top of the TV but the top isn't big enough to hold it. But even with that, the price more than makes up for it!I'm also so glad amazon.com was selling this, because I knew I wanted my TV to be delivered, and everywhere else was charging almost as much as the TV for shipping fees! Amazon provided the best shipping fees, even over Target and Walmart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painting the Sunset","review":"This legend is based on how the Great Plain Indians were given the colors of the sunset by one of the talented Indians. This book shows how Little Gopher, the Indian that painted the colors of the sunset for his People, remained true to his destiny. Even though he felt like he didn't have a special gift, Little Gopher continued to stay dedicated, until he was guided in the right direction by an old grandfather and young maiden in his Dream-Vision. The overall theme of this legend is that perseverance pays off in the end.This book could be used by teachers to introduce the lesson of how those who are dedicated to a dream or goal can succeed in the end. The plot of the story can be used to demonstrate and teach students how to do story maps. Also, other activities this book can be used for in the classroom are for Literature Circles and Idea Circles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Native American Legend","review":"The legend of the origin of the beautiful Texas flower called the Indian Paintbrush.

I will never forget seeing him in concert. He was a mystic, totally captivating. I remember his long hair flowing as he whirled and danced. I remember thinking that he reminded me of a Jesus Christ like figure. Added to that, the most sensual music and beautiful lyrics that you will ever here and you have some \\"Beautiful News\\"!,a Jimmie Spheeris experience! You become a fan. I will never forget this gentle soul. Though, my girlfriend loves his music, trying to describe him to her just doesn't do him any real justice. I was wondering if, maybe, there were videos made of his concerts???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I was lucky enough to see him live in Oklahoma City in the early 70's. He was an unknown at the time, but after that concert everyone looked at each other and said \\"Who was that?\\" I being a guitar player myself, appreciated his complex style and melodic sounds. He could make that Martin guitar transform into a journey of acoustic bliss. I have several copies of 'Isle of View' on vinyl and 1 copy on CD. I figure it should last me a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercurial","review":"Songwriting doesn't get much better than \\"I Am The Mercury\\", whose arrangement is nothing less than pure genius. Beautifully dynamic and emotionally cathartic, it could deservedly be considered Spheeris's signature tune. And while none of the other songs on Spheeris's debut quite reach the lofty heights of that song's climactic coda, every one of them is at least very, very good. \\"For Roach\\" ambles along like a lazily-told story, and \\"Come Back\\" is a quietly seductive plea to a lost lover. And \\"Monte Luna\\", a piano-based tribute, is just plain lovely - - and has a very pretty flute outro. Only \\"Seven Virgins\\" breaks the album's predominantly introspective flow, but it's probably someone else's favorite so I won't complain about its archetypal corniness. As acoustic-based albums go, you can't go wrong with ISLE OF VIEW. You can even smile at the punny title if you want. Me, I just wish they hadn't blown up the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat yourself","review":"If you're not familiar with the late, great Jimmy Spheeris, treat yourself.

It's a great song, so check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This tape is Dino-dynamite!","review":"In that magical phase of a child's fascination with dinosaurs, this tape is a perfect companion for any child who owns a collection of plastic paleolithic behemoths.

That makes this video unique in this regard as previous releases have been the 54 minute TV version. Although not quite as good as some of the other Republic video releases in this series, the picture quality is above average with very good sound quality.

Why? Because this Superman...1. Is so stiff, it doesnt bend at the elbows and knees2. Feels like the glued hard-rubber cape might fall off3. Gets \\"bald\\" as the paint on its head and boots gets easily scratched away when it hits other toys4. Is top-heavy and has a hard time standing on its ownSadly, I think that its only redeeming factor is its very good likeness to the cartoon. Little kids tend to play rough, specially when superheroes battle it out with supervillains. Perhaps this toy was meant to be displayed only, and not actively played by little hands?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?","review":"I am glad JLA:TAS finally got a line. I was dissapointed at the fact that there were no villans. Also what in the heck is the deal with these stands. I don't care what the letters spell. Why are the figures in a 4.5\\" scale? Not even the first toy biz Marvel SuperHeroes were that small. To quote The Hurricane: \\"Wassup wit dat?\\" The figures themselves look like they came right from an old N64 game.

Most of what it says is reasonable, but it doesn't say enough to be worth buying.One piece of advice they give is to use anecdotes and stories, but they don't come close to following that advice. It's rare for them to put more than two sentences together into something paragraph-like.I'm not sure who this book is aimed at, but their advice to \\"avoid questions that pry into personal matters\\" implies their goals have little to do with what I wanted advice about (creating close personal friendships).The one good aspect of the book is that it won't take much of your time - if you spend more than an hour reading it, you're doing something wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great product.

I am very pleased..ONLY ONE PROBLEM: my tripod arrived with a broken crank for raising or lowering the head of the tripod, I am hoping to get this replaced!?

The first story \\"Night Vision\\" is about a boy, Brett, who moves and doesn't know anyone. He meets a special girl one night. She is severally sensitive to the sun's light. Brett wants her to feel like a regular girl.The second story is called \\"Bobby's Girl.\\" It's about a girl who is faced with a hard decision. She's in love with some brothers. What will happen when one of the brothers comes down with a disease and what if he's the one she's in love with, although she's dating his brother?The third and last story is \\"Laura's Heart.\\" It's about a girl who has a bad heart. She could easily die. But when she meets this guy she starts to feel better and be happy. But what will happen when her parents don't allow them to see each other?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.....","review":"What can I say? Some people are fine reading another romance from Lurlene McDaniel, and some are not. I am annoyed that this has been the deal for too long. I think that there should be a different genre . . . not romance. Readers get tired of the same old thing over and over. McDaniel needs to face reality and learn what customers want: VARIETY! The stories themselves were also poor. Brett's summer fling with Shayla, a girl with a genetic disease proved a yawnfest, Dana's love for two brothers proved annoying and Laura's secret romance with Ramon proved to be boring.

Written by authors Beirne Lay and Sy Bartlett, both original staff officers of the 8th Air Force, this novel draws heavily from actual experiences of airmen in battle and their commanders on the ground. This is \\"must reading\\" for any serious aviation enthusiast or historian, as the book weaves a spell-binding and realistic tale of drama, action, and human suffering.

Judgments are pronounced and sweeping generalizations issued without factual support. For example, persons who decide to leave an abusive relationship are determined to live their lives in guilt, and are condescendingly referred to as having done what they needed to do to survive. Apparently staying in the abusive relationship, armed with positive affirmations and deep breathing, is the nobler course. It is unfortunate that this topic has been neglected by the social services community. It would be very helpful to see a peer reviewed work, but this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Outstanding","review":"This CD contains an outstanding collection of classical music over the course of two-three years.

The flow from one song to the next is dynamic by way of it flows with the pace. John Williams and Hans Zimmer performs strong heavy pieces while Renee Fleming, Yo-Yo-Ma and many other provides smooth sound to the ears.

After all, I have used many traditional iron-on transfers created by ink-jet printers. I thought these would be good, too.They did not work.Printing was fine, trimming was fine, separating the adhesive backing from the art work was a disaster. The process bordered on stripping wall paper and we had similar results. The art work tore, the backing paper would start to peel, and then it would come apart and stick to the art work. We searched in vain for a good way to get the two pieces apart and finally, the only satisfying option was wadding up the three (YES THREE) pages and dropping them unceremoniously in the trash.Perhaps in a few more years, Avery will fix this product.

The shirt color bleeds through any light colored part of the design making the end product look washed-out and dingy. I've talked to Avery about the problem but they offer no solution other than sending me more paper to offset the paper I've used. I have tried every trick I know of to get it right: Shortening ironing time, less pressure, washing or not washing the shirts first but every result is the same. Avery products work great on light colored fabrics but are terrible on dark colors. A red shirt with any white in the design and you wind up with a pink design and so on and so on. Perhaps other brands won't have this problem but I have not checked them out.

Her music does not strike me and my friends as real. We find her music lolly pop like and repetitive, especially the one where she goes on and on with \\"I found another lover now its time to let you go\\" over and over again.

Having chosen a Renaissance monk as his voice, however, he should have made some effort to identify, authenticate, justify that personality and worldview. The reader needn't be an antiquarian nor a theologian to be irritated by this supposedly dedicated Christian scholar being so entirely self-referencing and self-absorbed. So much Asian mysticism and 20th century psychobabble are anachronistic.

I typically would not bother to give a book a bad review, but in this case I felt like I had been tricked into reading it. If you liked \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\", or if you have an interest in aboriginal cultures, you might buy into this book. I myself had to laugh at the feeble ironies and trite philosophizing wrapped up in cloying prose. Cowan has a few favorite \\"serious fiction\\" words that he uses over and over again, adding to the dizzying repetitiousness of these loosely connected stories. Cowan's ironic insistence that he is telling a \\"true story\\" is pointless and serves only to obscure whatever fact is present. I will say that premise here is quite interesting, but in it's execution Cowan swings big and misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Pretentious","review":"Not my cup of tea.

It sounds wonderful, it could have been wonderful. But James Cowan made this book as dull as he possibly could have. The chapters were only loosely strung together and Fra Mauro's mind wanders so far from his original thoughts I had a hard time following his train of thought. Maybe it's because I am only 14 years old that this book didn't work for me, but I don't think If I tried to read this book again in 20 years it would make any difference.

First of all, the red is amazing. Gorgeous! The best red I've seen, I love it. My hair is dark brown, and the red showed up nicely.That's the good news. The bad is that the red washed out within two washes. And, this was the most difficult dye I ever worked with. It stained my ceramic tiles, the grout, my face, my arms and nails, my floor. It ruined my bathroom carpet. I use dye all the time, and yes, it splatters, but always if I wipe it quickly, it is fine.

And I was not disappointed. Some of the songs immediately spoke to me, while in the past it has taken awhile to get into her music. This album is different than anything I've ever heard from K before--I would describe it as very dreamlike, ethereal, hazy, mellow, and most importantly--beautiful... Highlight tracks for me are \\"Echo\\", \\"A Cleaner Light\\", \\"Cathedral Heat\\", \\"Costa Rica\\", \\"Husk\\", and \\"Spring\\"... The wonders she has created on this album just make me that much anxious for the next one... Hopefully it will not be a long wait for more of this genius' work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music with color and texture","review":"With \\"Sky Motel\\", Kristin Hersh explores further musical territory while incorporating elements of her work in Throwing Muses as well as her solo outings.Beyond a pleasing sound to my ear, music that can create visual images excites me. On \\"Sky Motel\\" each song has a distinct \\"look and feel\\" to it, vivid with colors (complemented by the gorgeous package design from v23) from the dark murkiness of \\"Caffeine\\" to the brightness of \\"A Cleaner Light\\" to the coolness of \\"Faith.\\"Definitely a summertime record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paint a Vulgar Picture","review":"On their hands a dead star...At the record company meeting, 4AD decided to raid the Red House Painters back catalog, 4 years after unceremoniously dropping the band. As much as this practice irritates me, both in this case and in general, at least they do us the courtesy of assembling a fine collection of Mark Kozelek and company's best work. Since domestic versions of the band's albums are all out of print, what choice do you have anyway?What this collection does not seem to capture is the sheer sprawl of a Red House Painters record. This is a band that, for better or worse, revels in making 70+ minute albums, and 10+ minute songs. Although most of the band's best songs are here, this is not an RHP album. This is a 2 CD mix tape, albeit a good one. As much as it bothers me, I'll probably buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so disappointed by this album.","review":"Kristin, why are you tormenting me so?

It has changed my mind about purchasing some items on line. I ordered some Roper boots from Bargain Outfitters. They came in a timely manner, when I tried them on they did not fit me. I decided to send them back immediately and because there was no address other than the one on the box and it was the same on the paper insert that was given to me, that is where I sent it back. I sent it UPS ground and it was delivered the next day. That was 3 weeks ago. I am still waiting for my refund because they are busy and can't get around to finding this box and refunding my money.

It does what it is supposed to do, which is to keep the MacBook cool. However, I feel like a fool for paying so much money for it, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I like this product over the others because of the soft cushion to rest your wrist on. I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey But Very Good","review":"I shouldn't complain about the price because I picked up mine on ebay for $20. I've had other laptop holders that were a lot cheaper. If you can pick it up cheaply like I did, it is a very good laptop stand. It does the job and the removable cushion is a nice feature. It does have a tendency to slide downwards when you remove the cushion so the cushion may be less removable than you at first think it is. It does remove the heat from your lap though which is the main reason you get one of these. It is very good for using your laptop in bed or while curled up on a sofa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"Although the iLap looks bulky from the pictures, and I wasn't sure how comfortable this would actually be on my lap, I'm glad to report that I'm happy with my purchase.

The problem of the book is that it does not give a depth coverage. Good for inspiration and faith perhaps but not for understanding. The section on the benefits of tithing was trusting to the point of being ritualistic. It seemed to me that if one were to wear a bangle, the prosperity results would be the same except that the Bible said to tithe. Yes and for good reasons that are not covered here. Thus, title is misleading in that very few \\"secrets\\" are given in this small book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Sure There Is Really A Secret","review":"The book insists there is a secret to finding and accquiring prosperity.

She also has a sassy side. \\"Five Minutes\\", another winner, shows she can take or leave a man and stand on her own. Other favorites are \\"Out Of Your Shoes\\", \\"Trainwreck Of Emotion\\", and \\"He Talks To Me\\". Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Singer","review":"Lorrie Morgan is a fine country singer. Her voice is full of the emotion of the songs that she sings. You can hear the pain, the longing, the joy. On this album, she even tackles a Lennon-McCartney song 'Eight Days a Week' and turns it into a country tinged rocker, with some great help from Vince Gill on guitar. I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Brown Whatever...","review":"John Paul, a morph of Brian Wilson, Niel Sedaka and Andy Williams, has created a turgid aural hypnosonic psychoromp into easy listening Satanic snorkle smurf rock revealed through a dream vision by the Dark One himself.

Its pure brilliance lies in its unabashed banal crooning of down's syndrome inducing glib gabba-gabba hey hoo doo hit lyrics and slurpy syrupy swooning synthethic beats and solos. It all just fills my soul to the rim. I will never forget \\"The Moon is God's Flashlight,\\" because I'm so attracted to it. Bong along with the antichrist and you too will go Coco-Loco.

Really excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pras puts together one slammin disc","review":"Pras has proven his place in the Fugees with his new cd Ghetto Supastar. Now we realize all of the parts each Fugee played in the Score, because it was irrecognizable before the solo records. Wyclef is the original, all world reggae star. Lauryn is the heart and soul of the group. Pras is the part that makes it so enjoyable- the hip-hop part of the group. He proves that he is as good on his own as Wyclef and Lauryn. I must admit that I was a little dissapointed with the record, because I think that he should have included some slow reggae-flavored tracks. However, it is still a good cd and it proves that Pras is a valid member of the Fugees. I dont know how you cant like this cd, with tracks like riprock 2 and blue angels. It seems like every track has an awesome beat, and i will be listening to this cd until the fugees reunion cd comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"whack as hell","review":"pras got called out in wyclef's 'where fugees at\\" about how he barely did any producing on the first fugees record but took all of the production credits. this cd is worth as much as an old aol disc...nada!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An opus for the talentless","review":"Quite simply this is the worst album I have ever encountered.

In case you are one of those Ghetto Superstar nuts... just buy the bullworth soundtrack it has the same joint.

The only new songs I somewhat enjoy on this album are \\"Blue Angels\\" and \\"Lowriders\\"(even though it has a horrible chorus). The rest of the the songs are average and below(mostly below).

Lauryn is the only one that has been able to make a good solo album. (a great one actually!) I am still wondering who likes that Ghetto Superstar song!

Last week I had to borrow her car and this cd was playing on her stereo. I started laughing and couldn't stop while it played. The songs sounded like the versions you would hear a... bad band playing at a Caribean themed bar at a Holiday Inn. Have some respect would you? Buffett is awesome.

So, I take it to the ASC. More than 2 weeks later, I'm told the panel is bad and they'll have to send it to the Funai Corporation and its going to take a month or more to get a new one back.

Its for everyone not just people of color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"I actually got this movie when it came out and I paid like $20 something for it. When I watched it I was very disappointed. I really got it to see all the good actors in it. It goes to show just because there is good actors in a movie doesn't mean it will be a good script or movie because of that fact. I thought it would be more in-depth with the characters but it wasn't. You have Tracy Morgan as a struggling comedian who is a promiscuous person who brings no real depth to the story, although he was funny. Then you have the sexy Allen Payne who plays a pretty boy who sleeps with a lot of women but no depth. See where I'm going here? Out of the whole movie I only believed Erika Alexander's character. It just looks like a movie that was put together without much thought to a real plot. I didn't get it, not one of the best movies, needless to say I took the movie back and got a credit for the amount I paid for it. I gave it 2 stars because sexy Allen Payne was in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Geographer, Mediocre Book","review":"There is no doubt that Mercator was a great geographer. Among his achievements were: the projection bearing his name, the first modern Atlas, and even the naming of North America. He played an important role in the amazing successes and adventures of the Age of Discovery. He truly was an amazing man.Having said this, I found Crane's book to be lacking. I thought that the book was well researched and well grounded, but the delivery was poor. When buying a popular history book, in addition to the facts I expect a gripping story, masterfully told. However, Crane's writing style is dry and while the book is filled with names, dates, facts and figures the story telling is simply not there. Crane often gets bogged down in minute details that are distracting, dry and are simply not important to the story he is trying to tell.In short, this may be a good history book, but it is not a book that I would recommend for the typical reader of POPULAR history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic John Denver","review":"This CD reminds me of a Celtic John Denver.

For adults it was a total disaster! Someone should have fired the costume designer, one character looked like she ws wearing a bath mat for a cape! A scene of the flying monkey's attacking New York, that could have been the hilight of the movie, got ruined with a dragon flying around. A dragon? In OZ? Oh and TOTO is a german shepard. Hello? A good idea, that went totally wrong! Save you're money and don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of your Time and your Money!","review":"This movie had potential, until you watch it. The story line has too many holes, the acting is B rated at best, all of the large named actors have small parts. There are terrible action sequences, and the make up or special effects are not great. The Wicked Witch of course had the best make up, and the Tin Man was the best special effect, but that left a lot to be desired on the rest of this film. It seemed like a hodge podge of a production. Do yourself a favor and walk away before you spend your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching it was a prison sentence","review":"The box art looks good. All downhill from there. Glad I only rented it. Someone else commented that they liked Tin Man, another reinterpretation of Oz. I liked it too so I'm not shooting down all of these type of Oz movies.None of the characters were very sympathetic which can be blamed on the script.

Choose your criteria and they will all come up bad.Really poor acting consistent with the junky TV series, shorts and D-level movies that fill out the actors other film credits.Disjointed, jump around editing and directing producing a story that seemed like a bunch of half hour TV series patched together.Writing and script of a modern day Dorothy showing up at a farm house with a magical key to save Oz from the bad witches was a boring and too frequently copied plot line found in many fantasy movies. Dialogue was written by the students in a high school drama class.A couple of cheap CGI effects of swirling air to represent Dorothy escaping Oz and of a tornado and some '60s era zapping effect from the witch's wand - that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Take On The Wizard of Oz","review":"I rented this a while back, not expecting much, but there wasn't much on the shelf so I thought i'd take a chance on it, seeing as I'm such a HUGE Wizard of Oz fan.

I found \\"The Dark Clue\\" a bitter disappointment in its final chapters after enjoying so much all other parts of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Clue is definitely worth reading","review":"When I purchased The Dark Clue I had no idea that I had picked up a book that would entertain, intrigue, and educate me. Through letters and diary entries I was taken back to Victorian England and introduced to Walter Hartwright and Marian Halcombe, a brother and sister-in-law team searching for the \\"real\\" story of the renowned, reclusive landscape artist J.M.W. Turner. Through their research in writing Turner's biography I met wonderful characters that took me punting on the Thames, hiding around the corners in the backstreets of London's slums, and visiting the finest homes of the elite all the while feeling that the \\"truth\\" of Turner's life was just at hand. As the character's obsessions grew to find the truth, so did mine with an ending so surprising but so fitting of the bizzare life of Turner.I say this is the best reading we can hope for... fiction combined with real historical characters and education combined with great entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Blot","review":"This is a blot on the literary landscape in general, and the fiction of Wilkie Collins in particular.If you enjoy seeing characters you liked in previous books SLIMED, then by all means ... forge ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great course","review":"I am amazed at the level of material presented in just the first year of this course.

But after that shock was gone, I have to admit I am very impressed with his skills at recording and sounding like Cher. Personally, I could tell right away that it wasn't Cher and don't see how anyone couldn't tell, but the song remixes are wonderfully done, especially Bang Bang and Turn Back Time. Enjoy the cd but remember that this isn't really Cher, just a very good imitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a passable impersonation of the Real Thing!","review":"Jimmy James who performs here as \\"Dark Lady\\" is one of the world's most famous Cher impersonators, who has to perform as Cher on stage all the time, so it isn't surprising that he does a great job here of sounding like the original. As remakes go, these are quite good and have a very modern dancefloor feel. Better than I would have expected and no one in a dance club would have a problem with these tracks except maybe hardcore Cher fans who can only accept the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a mans world?!","review":"I thought when looking at this album that someone had done some remixes of cher's best songs, however what i got was something different. I should have looked more closely and not rushed so much when i was buying, as this is not cher but a man trying to sound and look like cher. It isnt done too badly but I felt disapointed as i was hoping that \\"dark lady\\" was just remixing and not re-recording some classic hits which in my opinion should not be touched. It has quite a trance feel to it and sounded ok but in my opinion why bother?! To everyone who wants to listen to the real cher and cher remixes, either buy the individual maxi singles or a real treat is either the new \\"gold collection\\" or the \\"best of\\" australian import which are both 2 cd collections.

For instance, on one of my HD local channels I get this funny looking stripe at the very top of the picture. It almost looks like a scrambled picture or something. Also, according to the TV documentation, the set supports up to 1080i. However the only setting on my cable box that is compatible is 480p. Now if I only had the slightest clue what those meant.

The DVD runs about an hour in length and features Kylie sometimes singing, sometimes lip synching (and sometimes forgeting to), and bucking across the stage in truly atrocious outfits (it was 1990) during her first ever world tour. The backstage antics (of which there are plenty) are cute and slightly reminescent of an article in 'Smash Hits'. The actual concert feature modest production values and Kylie is backed by cheesy dancers with jazz hands permantly splayed, but Kylie, as always, is adorable and having a great time right along with the audience. Watch this DVD, then pop in 'On a Night Like This-Live in Sydney' followed by 'Kylie Fever 2002' just to see how far the impossible princess of pop has come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best landscape photographer in the world","review":"This is the book for people who didn't think that they liked landscape photography. MacKenzie takes you through a voyage to the abandoned worlds of farms, schools and other building in the middle of the nowhere lands of midwestern America. Here we find that ruined farmhouse, strangely sculpted by the winds and snow of many winters, but not depicted as some quaint, picturesque image, but as a stark vision in long Puritan panoramic views that work to make the landscapes appear as through they are suspended in time, a strange reminder of once active places, now abandoned and ruined, but notheless spectacular in their setting. This is the photographer that will make you throw away your Nan Goldins and your Cindy Shermans and discover what is it that makes photography the newest vibrant member of the visual fine arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very first album!","review":"This is actually a re-release of the first ever Golden Earring(s) album, released somewhere in 1964/65.Although I actually don't enjoy this vintage Earring stuff that much I can really recommend it to any Earring completist. My favourite periods of Earring music are early seventies, late seventies/early 80s and all of their 90s output up til now.The sound on this first album is similar to the first British Invasion bands, including Beatles, Searchers and Hollies.The bonus tracks are a mix of early singles & b-sides but very representative for that period of time.The line up of the group already included George Kooymans and Rinus Gerritsen. Lead singer Frans Krassenburg left early 1967 and was replaced by Barry Hay and Cesar Zuiderwijk joined the Earring in 1970."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Anderson's BEST...","review":"This album, in my humble opinion is one of the best country albums ever recorded.

We bought this item for my MIL who lives with us. Attaching the wheels and glides was a breeze - it took no time at all. What I discovered is that it made the walker quite a bit taller. Whereas she had the walker on the lowest possible setting in the front and back, I have now had to raise the back up 3 notches (sorry, I don't have an exact measurement) to compensate for the wheel height. It seems like it will still be OK but if you are like me and not considering this already let this be a warning.

Since it was billed as being part of past combined purchases which included pill crushers, I figured it would be appropriate for my application. Unfortunately, the coarse surface of both the Mortar and the Pestle would have made it impossible to recover all the crushed medication. This would certainly have affected the accuracy of the dosing; maybe a little, maybe a lot, no way of telling. While this product might be useful in the kitchen, I would certainly not recommend it for crushing medication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mortar & Pestle for a Child","review":"I grind various size pills daily from 1/2 baby aspirin to large, hard caplets. I have used the standard marbel mortar & pestle for 10+ years but it can hurt your hands with the large pills and the small pills get lost in the bottom. I read all the reviews & selected these to grind the small pills. The pestles are too small for any of the mortar sizes. The large pestle might work in the smallest mortar but even that combination did not power the small pills well enough or without effort. This product increased my work effort. Maybe it could be used for a child trying help in the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken and no refund","review":"I am a pharmacist and was very much looking forward to having a nice mortar and pestle to display.

The price was right (11.99) and the product seems great so far. We have used them for grinding spices and they are easy to work with. I like the \\"rough\\" bottom of the mortar and pestle as it helps with \\"crushing\\" the spices. These also nestle and the pestles fit inverted into the small one.

Unfortunately, I read the Karla trilogy first, and this book goes downhill from that great experience. The book is too long, plots, sub-plots and anything else just goes from one thought and page to the next. There are times when I wasn't sure who was speaking: Rick, Magnus or Tom. I gave up on this halfway through, and probably won't finish it. Here is a suggestion to the author: Why not have one dynamic Smiley novel with all of the remaining characters (Guillam, Esterhas, Control) in one grand espionage masterpiece? This was the only LeCarre novel I did not enjoy. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"Ok, I am only about 60% through the book at this point, but it has very little to do with spying or espionage and lots of very long and boring stretches about periphery characters with farcical names like Makepeace Watermaster that have nothing to do with the plot.

He transformed fiction with a focus on the shadowy world of espionage from the James Bond fantasies into a much fuller and realistic form of literature. I believe THE PERFECT SPY is his best book. Magnus Pym, a British agent, has vanished, and the search for the man ranges throughout America and Europe. The most fascinating element of this novel concerns the exploration of Pym's personal past. This book is excellent. It is John Le Carre at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious with no excitement","review":"Slow and plodding book with no excitement.

I was looking for a good story, but there's not much of a plot. As previous reviewers have indicated, the focus of this book is the character development.Indeed, the author does a great job of building his characters. The audio version is narrated by the author. His voice characterations are spectacular.Had I been familiar with the author's writing style or knew what I was getting in to, I may have enjoyed it more. I guess I was looking for a good tale -- a bit of \\"narcotic\\" literature.If you're looking for a good story, go elsewhere.

The Honorary Consul would be my favorite, but all the Smiley series are great. This book was a complete disappointment. Le Carre teases you with a little plot, then goes back to the main character's autobiography, which after a 100 or so pages becomes sooooo boring. God I had to struggle to plow through this (It's nearly 500 pages).People who say this is \\" his masterpiece \\" must have read a different book than the one I read.

It is that kind of book. In fact the first few chapters (which seem to garner the most complaints) seem purposely dense, just to slow the reader down. The writing is thick with shifting tense, ambguity, dead-end content, and a cast of bit players who do not all contribute to the larger story. Le Carre owes as much to Dickens as he does to his own life experiences.For the determined and patient reader this is as good as the genre gets, but it rises above the genre as a character study of a man who has taken a lifetime to find himself. The lead character, Magnus Pym, who is not entirely a protagonist, spends all of his childhood and most of his adulthood trying on different versions of himself, modeled after his miscreant father Rick, Rick's ever-changing retinue of hangers-on, and countless other influences. It is a fascinating journey for Pym and for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've enjoyed some other Le Carre books (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Smiley series, etc.), so I thought I knew what I was getting into with this book. But I didn't. It was incredibly boring. To call it a spy novel is beyond a stretch, it's more of a character study as another reviewer posted. At least the other Le Carre books I've read have good climaxes with nice twists in the end. Not this one. His writing style really began to grate on me after a while. There's no doubt that he can turn a phrase, but the florid language became incredibly tedious. If the hallmarks of good writing are brevity and clarity then he failed on both accounts, but especially the former."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toes","review":"Tor Seidler writes another touching and realistic book about the relationship between human and animal.Toes shows more humanity than many humans in the way he cares for his frustrated \\"new\\" owner, the classical violinist.

My daughters, who are 8 and 6 (and advanced readers, as well as cat lovers) loved this book, and so did I. No, Toes's abilities are not realistic, yet neither is the book a magical fantasy. It's more the sort of story one would make up about a beloved cat. I cried at the end, when Toes is dying, but it's important for children to learn that death is an inevitable part of life. Toes's death is sad, but his life and what he does for his friend, the musician, mean that his memory will live on. I would especially recommend this book for families where a beloved pet (or family member, for that matter) is growing old. Its lesson might help provide comfort when a child has to deal with grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for children or adults!!!","review":"*******SPOILER ALERT**********This is not a book for people that like cats or other animals.

Though the book reads easily, I found it to be rather forced at times and somewhat choppy in the story telling. I also found that the authors spent more time celebrating the way THEY overcame the adversity rather than their daughter. Additionally, I did not deeply feel the pain and the anguish that made the rising spirit all the more meaningful. It is an interesting account of the ways in which CF is now being treated and the ways in which everyday people can contribute to the fight. However, if you found this book interesting or want to learn more about the impact of this devestating illness, I beg you to read Frank Deford's \\"Alex:The Life of A Child\\". I find that once you've been touched by the spirit of Alex Deford, much else will pale in comparision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharing in \\"the Spirit of Lo\\"","review":"I loved this book!

I would recommend this book to anyone who cares about me - my husband's family, my parents, my sister, my mentor, friends, my psychologist, and any new CF families I come into contact with. I think this book is an invaluable asset to those in our ranks and those who join us daily. One of the biggest encouragements is that Lo is still here. I have read many inspirational tributes to people who are gone. It lifts my spirit to know that Lo is still on her journey. Thank you for your reflection, insight, love, commitment and talent.

We were not entirely blindsided by my daughter's diagnosis, as it is now part of the maternal screening but it still took time to come to an understanding of what we are up against. I felt that Terry and Don did a great job in expressing how isolating and exhausting dealing with CF can be, not only for the patient but for the entire family. Hours of daily therapy, hundreds of pills and medications not to mention regular visits to doctors, and all of this done with a child that does't \\"look\\" sick. I recommend The Spirit of Lo to all.

So when I saw him on Leeza's talk show recently, I came to Amazon and bought both his book and CD. Haven't had time to read the book yet, but he certainly still has that great voice. I would have liked it better though, if he'd left out the kid's voices talking in the background during some of the songs. It's very distracting when you're trying to concentrate on the music. Easy to be Hard is still my favorite song. I wish Pieces of April had been on it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chucky doesn't cut it by himself.","review":"He has a good voice and it's great he beat the drug addiction, but this CD is awful.

I tried to listen to this no less than 5 times and no dice. Here is a man who blew 15 millon dollars, and now he has blown this CD. Far from his days of being captured Live At The Forum, and twice removed from the group. Chuck wants to sing---go touring with Danny and Cory, saw them two years ago and they bought down the house.

But I'm still a big fan.I didn't care for the gay danceclub version of Joy to the World, but I do like his new re-do of \\"Never Been to Spain\\". And \\"Easy to be Hard\\".I will continue to buy & support Chuck's efforts.

The images are deeply powerful as well as beautiful. I can relate to the idea of water representing the emotional body, as well as fire the energetic body, the air the spirit body, and vegetables and flowers the material realm. The Vision Quest Tarot booklet makes this deck different than other tarots. The definitions are very precise and accurate. I too, like a previous reviewer, usually do one reading about once or twice a year; it is that good. The cards are surrounded by a white framed border. I am ordering another deck to write key words around the frame of the cards for easy and instant interpretation when I read for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drumline DVD Purchase","review":"The DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition.

This movie has potentially done more damage to band people than the american pie quip. Anyone who is in marching band will tell you this is crap. Seriously, I marched snare in my drumline and this is the most pathetic and unrealistic representation you are ever likely to see. Most marching drummers would put it down just by looking at it. Why? On the front, Nick Cannon is carrying nylon tipped drum-set sticks. Look at what happens in the movie; a solo-stealing, lying, freshman who can't even read music makes a college snareline, even though he constantly argues with center snare. At training; the members run marathons around the stands with their instruments( Wow, aside from broken instruments, what on earth would that accomplish??) And yes, anyone who needs to hire a rapper for their marching show has the worst band ever created. It's unbelievable people actually took this seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp wonderfull real life story and film .....","review":"Unfortunately, today, one must go off the beaten track to get away from ninjas... witches ... cops ... lawyers etc etc kind of movie where you pretty well know what the ending is before it starts AND the only lesson you'll remember is 'darn that was expensive ' should have watched TV at home ....Drumline is a story about a talented young man who has been told to make the most of his talent no matter what .. what they didn't tell him is that one has to work your talent inside a complex society .. no good if you are the best drummer in the word if you don't have a great band to play with ....Although I would lave to have ssen more of the drumline sequences at games the movie has just enough on it's sound track to make it very memorable ...This may not be the greatest movie I ever saw and it may not be an epic BUT this movie is fun .. remember that .. a fun movie WOW ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"Amazing movie, especially if you are also a band geek :) its all about drumline (duh) and also all other sections of the bandHighly recommended to anyone! 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"i love this movie, but my only problem with it is that it was not the \\"Special Edition\\". but all in all, i still love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the language!","review":"The movies has no problems regarding shipping.

Oh well though it was a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Stopping Band Scenes!","review":"I am ordered a second copy of this DVD for my best friend who runs an orphanage in Mozambique. Many of the kids in the orphanage are musically talented and I know they will enjoy this glimpse at a uniquely American tradition that this movie depicts so well. I could watch the competitive drum scenes over and over. This movie is a little hokey at times but it is a must see for any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blu-Ray Special Edition","review":"Drumline is one of my favorite movies. I love music and bands and it has both. Anyway, the special edition blu-ray is ok. They just added the deleted scenes back in the movie. I have been the movie a few times already and it was a little different seeing them back in. I guess that is why it is a special edition. At least at the end (sorry if you haven't seen it), when aj and free say the bands will perform 2 drum battles, the special edition shows 3, kinda confusing, oh well, they were still good anyway. I recommend. The blu-ray edition brings out the picture and sound even more like any blu-ray would."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EVER","review":"THIS MOVIE DOSNT GET ANY BETTER NO MOVIES GET ANY BETTER THIS MOVIE GETS YOUIN A GOOD MOOD.

From a musical standpoint a mediocre high school marching band could play tighter and harder material.b) The moral seems to be that if you're cocky enough and stubborn enough you'll eventually get what you want. The main character in this movie never grows as a person and never learns anything. He just keeps whining until he finally gets his way.If you want to see good drumming and teamwork find a Drum Corps International show near you and hang out in the parking lot while they warm up."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIRTY playing!","review":"I liked this movie... until I really learned how to drum.The playing isn't clean, the focus is not on drumline but on snare line (ok, ok, I play tenors so I'm biased), and there is virtually no story. If you are impressed by this, go watch some DCI and WGI videos so you can see that this movie is laughable. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it at least HAS drums in it and it beats watching other really, really boring movies; also, I am ashamed to admit that I was entertained by it for a little while, until I learned more. But don't try to watch this specifically to learn how to drum/march/be in band... go get a pad and sticks and a decent teacher and some DCI/WGI vids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"A friend recommended this movie to me and after watching it 3 times I can see why we both love this film. I was mesmerised by the drumline scences- I live in Europe and we don't have black colleges and marching bands as a part of our culture but this movie crosses cultural boundaries. Good plot, nice romance without being to sugary only disapponted by the ending (not really) I didn't want it to end so I watched it all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"There was a lot of lagging in this movie.

I have seen it 3 times already an I never get tired of the end battle drums, that's my favorite part. I recommend this movie to anyone, it is very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cute Little Inspirational Movie","review":"I do totally agree that its about time somebody made a movie about marching band. All these cheesy teen movies about high school football stars drive me insane. There was some good stuff in it.... while I didn't feel it was all completely realistic, that didn't necessarily take anything away from the movie. although I must say, if you found this movie to be the least bit interesting or entertaining, you should definitely check out Drum Corps International (DCI). If your not into paying 98 bucks for the finals dvd, PBS is broadcasting a show about finals in most states right now, and it should be in the rest by thanksgiving. That is some incredible stuff that anyone can enjoy if you take the time to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a very entertaining movie","review":"This movie wasn't bad. I figured that they would do a terrible job of portraying a college marching band, but they did a good job. The movie showed the flashier side of being in the band. They didn't show much of the painstaking practices that a marching band goes through. but, then again, who would want to sit around and let them practice? The drumline sounded excellent(I should know, i'm on a drumline) and did some pretty good visuals and choreography. Overall I would reccomend this movie to anyone, wheather they are/were in a band or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent popcorn movie with great band performances.","review":"As formula underdog movies go, they don't get much more charming or fun than DRUMLINE, which surprised me with its well-developed characters and grand band performances when I saw it in the theater.The film works well as a family movie, for there's little sex or violence. The music is great. (The soundtrack is excellent, if you want to pick it up.) And the message extends beyond the whole dare-to-dream \\"Rocky\\" theme. The film addresses the importance of honesty, humility, hard work and education. And it's fun.I saw this because it was filmed in my hometown. I didn't expect to be so entertained by it, though.Orlando Jones, as a dedicated band teacher who stresses education and music over showmanship and glitz, is particularly good. He proves himself to be a compelling character actor.Though DRUMLINE isn't edgy or particularly challenging, there's something to be said for the film's winning quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars because of it's predictablity","review":"DrumLineThis is not a movie I would normally choose to watch... And I'm not really a fan of marching bands and all that... But this movie was recommended to me by a co-worker, so I gave it a shot. It was very formulaic, but it was still good. Maybe it was because I knew nothing about how competitive marching bands could be, but I was actually interested throughout the whole movie. You really begin to care about the characters as they develop, and of course we are left with a happy ending.When you take a chance on a movie of a new genre, you can end up feeling as if you've wasted 2 hours of your life. This was not the case for me. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who feels like watching a \\"feel good\\" movie every now and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drumline is worth watching","review":"What an amazing video. We saw the movie on television and needed to purchase the video to see it again. The drumline is amazing! The only thing that we would have wanted to see is the entire formation on the field, rather than the chopped up segments of various groups. The movie is about atheletes, of the musical kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickolodean Star meets 7Up man meets doom","review":"Few things are more pathetic than Band Geeks Gone Wild. In this utterly forgettable piece of winsome ... , we have a two-note Nick star (think Britney Spears' little sister with less talent) who doesn't have a clue, tries to pretend third row drummers are hot instead of the pushed around pathos-inducing loser with whose girlfreinds football players screw around. The idea that this kid somehow can become a star or something original, or that an Orlando Jones character wouldn't be laughed off any field because NO ONE takes cheerleaders, dancers, or band members seriously is so so hilarious i nearly cried.Lobotomies should be required for the makers of this movie, but I don't think they make microscopes that small."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie left me speechless","review":"Have you ever wondered why there has never been a movie made about a championship high school chess team? Because no one would watch it and no one would care. I find Drumline amazing for many reasons. The first reason is that this is a feature film with a subject I could not care less about. Not only that, but when the movie was over I was even LESS interested in marching bands.Another thing I find amazing is the star of the movie Nick Cannon. How does this talented actor keep the same stupid look on his face throughout the entire movie? That is the pure skill and talent of a seasoned thesbian. I think he must be an amazing actor to portray someone who cannot act. Absolutly incredible.The grand finale of the flick has the buildup of a Rocky movie. Drumoff competitions? To each his own. I walked away from this movie with nothing. Sorry, it did nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The storyline and acting in this movie are painful, to say the least. The main character, Devon, is too annoying for words.The band directors of the dueling universities that make up this story are ridiculously melodramatic, and there is no plot line what-so-ever.I know we can expect these types of movies to stretch reality, but to show the main character begin school at oneUniversity, drop out and transfer to another University, and then return to the first university...all in one semester was absurd.Have the writers of this movie ever attended a University? Did they do any sort of research for this at all?I would not recommend purchasing or renting this movie. It is not worth the money. If you feel you must see this monstrosity,I would borrow it from a friend who was unfortunate enough to buy it, pull up the main menu, and go straight to the scenes with the band performances.The whole movie is garbage and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Well-Written Teen Movie with one glaring problem","review":"DRUMLINE is one of the few teen movies made in the past few years that seems to actually have some intelligence behind it's writing. It doesn't rely on stupid humor or obscenity. Not that I have anything against either of those, I just don't like it when that's all a movie has going for it. The characters here are all realistic; the plot's a pretty good one; the acting's pretty decent. BUT, and this is what earns only a two star rating, the main character is THE most unlikeable 'hero' I've ever seen in a movie. He really is a huge jerk, and the characters I thought were right end up 'seeing the light' and agreeing with the hero in the end. He really did not deserve a spot on the drumline, and I was glad when he got kicked off.But, really, I'm arguing semantics over a teen flick. If ya like it, I can't stop ya, you know. It's just not a movie for me. I'll just keep watching the old John Hughes movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"clicheline would have been a more accurate title.","review":"this has the stench of MTV all over it.the taget audience will gobble this up while those with a dots worth of intelligence will quickly dismiss.yeah,i guess its a harmless''feel good,raise the,Da,roof''type movie.i would like to compare this to other movies of the same genre but none are so paint by the numbers like this one.marching bands,cheerleaders,coaches,all things school related......these are topics best served for saturday afternoon viewing at 30 minute increments.g0d bless target audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is unrealistic","review":"This movie is unrealistic and dumb. I am in marching band at Aliso Niguel HS and play trumpet. Drumline never has that many people in it and they never have their own little shows. I dont care if it takes place in a college they never do that. In conclusion tyhis is unrealistic and very bad. The military drum majors are whqat really kills the film. The drum Majors dont even play drums, they play baritone. This movie sucks do not buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about trying to be cool.","review":"Don't even think about making band look as cool as playing football.

Just another mindless teen movie full of \\"popular\\" hip hop garbage. This is the kind of movie that seems to come off an assembly line, making people actually lose IQ points. If you want an intelligent teen movie get Breakfast Club. Or even the mindless American Wedding is better than this.On another note I have now been acused of \\"hating\\" because of this review. This is simply not the case. I liked a different movie that was kind of similar to this(only better), called Finding Forester. I also quite enjoy many African American musicians. And on a movie note I have given many movies with mostly white casts bad reviews such as; Charlie's Angels, The Fast an the Furious, Mission Possible 2, The Hulk, ETC.So don't try and blame the poorness on this movie on \\"hate\\" that doesn't exist.

But could this New York chamber group translate some of the most groundbreaking, demented and thoroughly noisy experimental electronica into an acoustic format? Yes, yes, yes! And wonderfully so. Even the most furiously percussive challenges are an absolute triumph. The only other musicians I could conceive of living upto this damn near impossible challenge would have been The Kronos Quartet, but even then they would have had to expand their instrumentation. If you liked the staccato sounds of Clogs on their avant-chamber masterpiece 'Stick Music', or if you enjoy the sonic persecution of Penderecki, Lygeti, or the more palatable Bartok and Hermann's 'Psycho', then this could be for you. Perhaps they will attempt the music of Autechre next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for all Richard's fans.","review":"This is really great music on this CD.

Because, while Bing wasn't their favorite, he was *A* favorite of theirs, yet they had nothing of his on CD! The variety of themes reminds us how vast Bing's repetoire was.The song selection is a perfect introduction - or re-introduction, if necessary - to Bing's Decca years. The sequencing is perfect for the casual fan, and the notes are informative and educational without a hint of preachiness.This collection is a MUST for any general music lover - it'll broaden their senses and their knowledge of America's first true entertainment superstar.

This album is the soundtrack to the DVD \\"Icky Flix\\", and is composed of mostly remade songs, with the exception of the introduction and exit music.Some of this music is a great improvement over the original music (Mom's House comes to mind), and some of it does not (Third Reich n Roll) but all of it carries a distinctive orignal flavor to it that bears the trademark of the Resident's sound.What is most surprising about this CD is the introduction of voices that have not been heard for years (Eloise), and the heavy use of guitars which works well in the entire soundtrack.While this soundtrack may not bring in any new followers, it is recommended for fans. Or, better yet, get the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good album!","review":"I've not bought new age CDs in a while, so I decided to try something different. I found out about this album by listening to internet radio (www.sky.fm) all day at the office. To me, this album doesn't have one \\"bad\\" song in it. All of them are good, but of course my favorite is \\"Celebration\\". That track is definitely \\"feel good\\" music. I mean, feel REALLY good :) Also worth mentioning: the last track, \\"Spirit Nation\\" is unexpectedly \\"upbeat\\", funky, and some parts sound like they're quasi-rapping in their native-American tongue.

The risk of serious foodborne illness is just too great. I love the taste of raw milk, and suspect it is a healthier food, but documented problems arise at even the best certified raw-milk daries. It is NOT worth the risk. Whatever the advantages of raw milk, or the controversies over milk as a food, consuming raw milk is not the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pastuerized, Homogenized Milk is bad mojo","review":"Raw milk from grass fed cows is healthful. It's that simple. Modern methods of mass producing cow's milk make it unfit for consumption. But it is wrong to think that ALL milk is bad, and the author does not make that distinction. In order to buy the \\"milk is poison, it's pus\\", etc line, you have to ignore human history and the huge number of populations that have thrived, thoughout history, not only on cow's milk, but also the milk from goats, mares, reindeer...Silly to argue otherwise, the fight should be to restore to small farmers and their customers their natural right to drink raw milk from grass fed cows. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drink unadulterated, healthy RAW milk","review":"Dr. Oski's claims are non-scientific in that he doesn't examine the effects of drinking naturally raw milk from healthy grass fed cows. If you are having gastric or other health issues you will have to do your own research outside of conventional medicine as I have had to do. After years of gastrointestinal upsets I tried raw milk, instead of pasteurized dairy products, and have found myself getting healthier with no more of the old issues. Check out Sally Fallon and other traditional foods experts and forget about this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"skewed and misleading","review":"Mr. Oski's book misses a very important point--the problem with milk and modern dairy foods is that we have processed them to death! Raw milk from a healthy, pastured cow (not grain-fed) is one of nature's perfect foods. While it is true that most of what is available in our grocery stores is poison, that is not the fault of the milk. If you want to hear the other side of this very important story, read \\"The Untold Story of Milk: Green Pastures, Contented Cows and Raw Dairy Foods,\\" by Ron Schmid, N.D. Also, check out my book review for Robert Cohen's, \\"Milk: The Deadly Poison,\\" which is also a very misleading book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Drink Soy Milk Either!","review":"Frank Oski draws attention to the very real health dangers of commercial dairy products. Unfortunately, he does consumers a grave disservice by encouraging the consumption of soymilk, an alternative that is even riskier. Soymilk was rarely drunk in Asia prior to the 20th century and like other modern, nonfermented soy products has been linked to digestive distress, thyroid damage, cognitive decline, ADD/ADHD, immune system breakdown, infertility, reproductive disorders and even heart disease and cancer. Sadly, many people have seen their health seriously deteriorate because of soy milk. Children are at such risk that in July 2005 the Israeli Health Ministry issued a health advisory warning parents that they should not feed their children soyfoods or soymilk more than once per day or a maximum of three times per week. For people who would like to explore all sides of the milk controversy, I highly recommend Ron Schmid's \\"The Untold Story of Milk\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never want dairy again...","review":"This is a well-written book with good information and extensive sources.

The whole thing would be better compiled in essay-format, since this is a pretty short book.As a vegan, I still hand this over to friends and family when they ask me what I'm doing about my calcium intake, and it usually keeps them quiet.This is a good referance to have, but you'll probably find the same information in any \\"Complete Vegan Guide\\" dairy-chapter. Buy it if you have the extra six bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is out!","review":"I found this book to be extremely informative. The information will definitely make you think twice before you consume any dairy products. The only negative to the book is that a list of alternative substitutes to dairy wasn't really listed except for soy which has it's own drawbacks. It's important to get Vit.D and calcium in your diet but no list was provided thus I was left hanging. Otherwise, the book was very informative and easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and clear","review":"This is a very good option for those who want to know about the dangers of milk. It is clear even for those who aren't familiarized with scientific language, because it uses our day-by-bay language (I can say that, I'm foreign). The chapters are the right size and the reading doesn't bother. It may seem like a too thin book, but it's not, it's full of information. Frank A. Oski really has experience with problems envolving milk. This is an upadated version with an appendix in the end (this may seem a little complicate to read by those who aren't doctors). This book really worked for me, because I drank lots of milk by the time I read it and I decided to make an experince: I moderated on milk for some weeks and I noticed improvement on my digestal functions.

But it cannot poach eggs--water all over the counter, & one of the eggs ran out of the tray & into the bottom where it cooked hard to the heating element.

The first thing that happened is the non-stick coating on the pan started delaminating. Then, every time you would cook a batch of eggs, water would mysteriously run all over the counter. It turns out that the plastic drip ring around the lid (that is supposed to keep the steam condensate inside the unit) loses adhesion with the metal lid because it is only secured with three little dabs of glue, and allows water to bypass the drip ring. One would think that the manufacturer could have figured out that plastic has a different expansion rate than metal, and that they should have had an actual continuous gasket instead of a plastic ring with three globs of glue to hold it on.I've orderd the Oster instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"My wife bought one of these about two months ago. We should have returned it, but we had disposed of the box in the interim.The design is very poor, in my opinion. Water spills out on the counter while it is cooking -- because the plastic lip inside the lid doesn't seal adequately, and condensed steam runs down the inside of the lid and out on the counter. Plus, the design of the plastic lip traps water, so you can never get the lid completely dry.There is no auto-off feature. When it decides it's finished -- based on the setting for cook-time length -- it beeps at you, but doesn't shut itself off. If you happen to be in another room, or don't hear the beeping, it will boil off the remaining water and -- probably -- melt the plastic rack and eventually burn itself out.We had anOster 4716 Egg Cookerfor about a year before it burned itself out, but I'd definitely recommend one of those over this Chef's Choice item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egg cooker without shut off","review":"The egg cooker works fine, though it isn't very sophisticated. It doesn't shut off by itself the beeper is annoying loud (wakes up the whole house in the morning).

But I bought this because i like to make devilled eggs, and boiling a dozen eggs at a time is a bit of a hassle. This machine does the job and is very easy to work with. I usually pull the eggs out and run them under cold water as soon as they're done, and i get really great results.. very bright yolks, whites are cooked, and really easy to clean up.Like others have stated the top can get a little hot, because of the steam, so just be careful with the cover, plus there is a bad sulfer smell to boiled eggs, that's just the way it is. :PIf you only need to boil 1 or 2 eggs, you are probably better off boiling it in a pot you already own. but if you need to make alot of eggs, this thing will do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beeper doesn't work right","review":"The unit functions properly as far as cooking.

I used an Oster egg cooker for many years and finally had to throw it out after the paint started peeling off. Then I bought a Cuisinart; the base on that warped after 3 uses. Then I bought this thinking it was the best I could get. I was so disgusted I donated it to charity and started using the old fashioned method of boling eggs in a pan.

While comparisons to Tortoise might be begged, Tristeza delivers a more guitar-based product, full of interlocking arpeggios and restful melodic themes that would seem at home on a Japancakes record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monopoly Two - Should I bother?","review":"Is the new version of Monopoly worth it? In a word, Yes! Though I do miss the animations that were in the original Monopoly, this version not only has the new player pieces, but comes with 10 different city boards and allows you to make your own as well! The interface is user friendly and I would recommend this to any board game fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointing","review":"Graphics are an improvement over the previous Hasbro version of Monopoly, but the special features are annoying. Seriously, how many times do you want to hear \\"Mr. Monopoly\\" exclaim, \\"Eighter from Decateur!\\" or \\"Show me the money, Sack!\\"? Not to mention the annoying animated tokens or the dizzying 3D \\"camera work.\\"Trades are confusing, and the computer opponents play the game like crazed lunatics. Wait until one gets a monopoly and starts building houses. The turn will take forever, as the elated opponent gleefully mortages everything in sight in a frantic attempt to add another building.I've had two versions of Monopoly for the computer and have been disappointed with both. On the other hand, a $20.00 Super Nintendo cartridge of the game generated hours of fun. The graphics were simpler and the options were fewer, but maybe that's why I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring along your Vivarin and your reading glasses!","review":"I guess I should not have expected the computer version of Monopoly to be any more exciting than the board game. It is, after all, Monopoly! But at least in the board game, you are moving more muscles than your index finger! I played this game at a relative's house, and I am very glad I did so. I now know not to buy it. Not only is it very slow, but also it is very hard to see. I needed a magnifying glass to view some of the graphics. I do suggest this game for chronic insomniacs--within thirty minutes, you will be out like a light!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GREAT","review":"I agree with all the other review, I would have liked to seen the orginal PC version, to see the actual propertys.My bug was that the opening sequence seemed to run in ultra slow motion; I called Hasbro on this and they gave me a bunch of gobbledy-gook, too. If this happens to you, hit the spacebar or escape key until you get to the main menu. Then you'll be OK and enjoy.About the game play, it is really good translation from the original.

Not a difficult game to master. Plus, there's a tons of secrets that give the game great replayability value. You won't really find a game that is as well planned by the software designers as this one. A great addition to any PSone collection, this game greatly boosts the Castlevania reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand the test of time","review":"Although I can see why this game is such a classic, many of its elements simply don't stand the test of time. For example, I've heard people gush over the music, which I personally find underwhelming by today's high standards. Also the lack of direction can prove incredibly frustrating when you get lost. However, I should admit that I don't particularly enjoy non-linear sidescrollers, as I'm also not a fan of the 2D Metroid games."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbelievably overhyped game","review":"I find it amazing that people believe this is one of the best games of all time. I've also heard people say that if you're not absolutely glued to your controller playing it for 100 hours straight, then you're not a \\"true\\" gamer. Give me a break! As 2D games go, Castlevania: SOTN is a very good looking and sounding game. I'll give it that. But the game, even with all its graphic splendor, is just not that much fun after the first few hours. It's just incredibly repetitive. Run into a room, kill some baddies, repeat. And the voice acting can be best described as \\"laughably lame.\\" THIS is a classic? I had TONS more fun with Diablo. I'm not going to trash anyone who wants to spend dozens of hours playing this game, but I think your time is much better spent on one of the many incredible RPG's available on the Playstation, like Final Fantasy VII or VIII.

But don't get too carried away, boils and ghouls!BLEH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The First of the downward spiral of the castlevania series.","review":"Well I guess I must be the only person who thought this game was bad. I personally thought Super Castlevania 4 was the best game in the series. Symphony of the Night didn't seem like a Castlevania game to me. Every castlevania game after this one was terrible. Castlevania is one of those games that needed to stick to its roots. Castlevania 4 was the peak in the series with controls, sound, and enjoyment then they wanted to try something new. Big mistake. Why couldn't they make a game that built upon Castlevania 4. It will always be a mystery to me why SoTN was so well received."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is a must have...........","review":"When i played this game i thought it would be like the other castlevania\`s but i was wrong.....this game has so much variety and quests to get things and 4 different endings the gameplay is great and so isnt the graphics.

No need for the price gouging any more!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love Castlevania and this is the best 2D Castlevania ever made. Unfortunately I didn't buy a copy 10 years ago so I guess I'll have to download it on Xbox Live Arcade since price gouging has come to the PlayStation version, I traded in my old PlayStation and I heard that it isn't compatible with the PS2s backwards compatability mode (a shame).If it was less than $15 I would definitely pick up the PlayStation version and a used PlayStation, but $60 is outrageous when it is available for less than 1/6 that price on Xbox Live Arcade!! Classic all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best game for the Playstation!","review":"I think that this is the best game ever. The replay value is amazing due to the multiple endings. Most people would play this game more than once. Looking for all of the easter eggs and glitches will keep you busy fo a while. Especially the *keep your equipment at the beginning of the game* easter egg. Not to mention the hundreds of weapons. They also have 140 enemies, all of which can be killed with all of Alucard's spells. The only problem with this game is that it is now hard to find. Especially if you want the original version (not the greatest hits). If you have never played this game........BUY IT! This game is too good for a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"This is still the best 2D castlevania ever, it's story is great and so is the gameplay! but when playstation games go into the greatest hits, they have to sell for $19.99, and amazon is selling it for 47 bucks. so if you want the game, buy it at some other website."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greats, one last time!","review":"It's nice that all these great games for the original Playstation are being rereleased, especially for Castlevania fans. That's because Symphony of the Night, not only one of the best Castlevania games but also arguably one of the best for the PSX is one of the games being rereleased. Look up any review for the game from websites and magazines and you'll see nothing but praise for this classic. At [amt] from Amazon, how can you lose. Get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick[in']","review":"Ok, I'm going to keep this short and sweet. This game is NOT for those reared on the likes of Final Fantasy VIII and Metal Gear Solid. The graphics, while good, are almost exclusively 2D, the voice acting is pathetic, the few instances of CG are boring at best, and the story is almost nonexistant. If this fails to bother you, go out and get the ... game. It has an insane amount of hidden moves and secrets, a gigantic, Metroid-ish level setup, some great RPG-style gameplay features, and one of the best soundtracks in a video game to date. And most importantly of all, every second of this game is incredibley fun. And in the end, that's why we play video games in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Castlevania","review":"There have been a few new Castlevania titles that have come out since the original series on NES and SNES, but the best one is definitely this game. It sticks with the original gameplay that the series started out with. It's story stays with the basics of any Castlevania game. You are a vampire hunter who must hunt down and slay Dracula by adventuring through his castle. The things I like most about the game, is the character you take control of. You are Alucard, half vampire, half human. You can use many vampire powers that you've never been able to use before. And it mixes a little bit of RPG flavor into the game by letting you use equiping options like shields, weapons, armor, and relics. The story line is also very cool. You learn the story of the connection between Alucard and Dracula(who strangly has Alucard's name backwards), and many other characters that you interact with throughout the game. I'd say it is definitely a must-have for the Playstation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. He loves the Castlevania games in general, and he loves this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"off the hook","review":"whooooooo! I haven't given that many albums a four star rating so far, but this one easily deserves it. Chicka woo and hold your head up struck me as the two standout tracks, while i aint havin that and magnum force held the disc together. i probably would have given this disc a five-star, but there are two or three songs that really kill the momentum of the cd in my opinion. Like the song featuring the dogg pound for example. It sounds like every other dogg pound song that has come out recently, pure garbage. aside from that and a couple other bruises this album is outstanding. be sure to check out ogc, the fab five and anything w/ the name boot camp clik on it.

For example, she found the green-faced morning sickness picture disturbing and the tea-cup / hiccough rhyme perplexing (as I did).

Its feel so good not to have to giggle wires to make the light come on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful and encouraging book","review":"As someone who is deeply troubled by the political and religious polarization in this country, I found Henry Brinton's book to be a breath of fresh air. By providing the readers a helpful framework to view the dichotomy, Pastor Brinton is able to show us that different perspectives are not necessarily different \\"sides\\", but are all valid and vital parts of Christianity. Whether you are a \\"covenant keeper\\" or a \\"liberation seeker\\", this book will enable you to feel not only that your belief is an important part of Christianity, but also that the beliefs of the \\"other side\\" are just as essential. The lines that separate us are not as distinct as we may believe and Pastor Brinton provides us with many ways to recognize this and to work together for the common good. Reading this book made me feel hopeful and optimistic that we can indeed do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on the mark.","review":"I found the book to be factual and right on the mark with its enlightening analysis of what sometimes lies behind the conflicts that arise in churches today. The author does an excellent job of not taking sides, but portrays the positive and negative aspects of both points of view. I believe his goal is to show that by better understanding the other person's point of view, we can find somewhere in the middle that is in balance for us both. It is worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Christmastime\\" is here again.","review":"Michael W. Smith returns with another Christmas recording called \\"Christmastime.\\" Following up from 1989's \\"Christmas\\" project, this one is different in a way that setthis album from his last. I was getting used to his classical side of \\"Christmas\\"with his songs like \\"All Is Well\\" (which by the way is my favorite track when sitting inthe dark), \\"Lux Venit\\" and his\\"Memoirs\\" trilogy. \\"Chritmastime\\" does have someof the \\"classical\\" elements from his \\"Christmas\\" album, but this time with standards in toe. \\"The Happiest Christmas,\\" \\"Kay Thompson'sJingle Bells\\" and \\"ChristmasWaltz\\" with Sandi Patty are the best tunes to ever come from Smitty. I like the titlesong, plus his cover of the Chris Rice song \\"Welcome To Our World\\" (Amy Grant covers it on her latest Christmas recording \\"A Christmas To Remember\\"). Now I guess I can get used to this project, because \\"Christmastime\\" is here again courtesy of Smitty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Love it!","review":"I purchased this CD last year and just about wore it out! I love the classic songs on here, mixed with some new ones. The rendition of \\"Jingle Bells\\" just plain tickles me (as well as my son...as soon as he hears that first whinny of a horse he just laughs and laughs...buy the CD and you'll see what I mean!) I also love \\"Christmastime\\" and my all-time favorite is MWS's instrumental piece \\"Hope of Israel\\". It is absolutely beautiful and really stirs my soul. Get this album and give yourself a wonderful Christmas present! You'll be so glad that you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it weren't for...","review":"The stars are for Kay Thompson, she has a beautiful voice, an obvious gift. If not for this album I wouldn't have known about her. As for M.W. Smith for over a decade now I can't get over the fact that his voice resembles Looney Toon's Elmer Fudd - it is comical. It's hard to dismiss the similarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Hurrah From a Marvellous band","review":"If you talk about disco music, Chic is certainly the first choice, as the best band from that era. This live album, recorded in Japan em 1996, is a proof that Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards are strong players on stage, too. With brilliant guests like Slash, Steve Winwood and Sisters Sledge, it's a astonishing album, from beggining to the end. Disco sucks? Oh, come on..... Chic for ever!!!! And rest in peace, dearly Bernard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!!!","review":"I'm a person who always felt that an artist or group should always do, at lease, one live recording in their career. It documents the relationship between them and their fans. Plus it shows how talented they really are.With this live album, Chic does this extremely well. Particularly in regards to the sad passing of the great Bernard Edwards (bass-player and co-founder & writer of the band) that came shortly after the concert that is featured in this recording.It's a great album, a classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"R.I.P BERNARD EDWARDS","review":"CHIC THrowsDOwn Here.In The Tradition Of Great Bands Back In The Day Chic Has Command Of The Stage.They Are More than A Disco Band Or Groove Band.Their Music Has Been Very Important.The In The Pocket Grooves Of Nile Rodgers&The Late Great Bernard Edwards Set The PAce Here as they did on All OF Their Classics&Productions.It's Even Better LIVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not necessary.","review":"I understand the significance of this performance (the late Bernard Edwards' finale), however, this recording is average at best. First, we could have done WITHOUT Sister Sledge, Slash, and the Rapper's Delight rendition. They detracted from Chic's mystique. The CD loses its focus and seems to just 'ramble'. I was incredibly disappointed with this entire release. If you want Chic, get one of their \\"Best Of\\" CD's and you'll go home happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"Although this tape includes a valuable message for people with learning disabilities it is far too expensive for a 30 minute tape of talking heads.

It's morning music such as this that has earned Susan all the much deserved praise over the years. Also, the remake of Herb Alpert's \\"Rise\\" by UpTempo! is wonderful. If you like the dance music heard at Circuit Parties, buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now That's How You Tear the Roof Off The Bar!","review":"\\"The Nighthawks Live\\" was released in 1997 as a double-EP combining both \\"Live at the Psychedelly\\" in Bethesda, MD 1976 and \\"Live from The El Macombo\\" in Toronto, Canada in 1977. The disc shows the Hawks in prime form, bringing bar-band 12-bar to the two packed clubs. Their version of Little Feat's \\"Tripe Face Boogie\\" is done with scalpel-thin precision, and Jan Zukowski's bass track is near-unbelievable. Mark Wenner's harp does the ghost of Little Walter justice as they cover Muddy Waters' \\"19 Years Old\\". The lightning take of \\"Shake Your Moneymaker\\" tears through a hill-country take of the classic tune with a gratuitous harmonica for all. Never truly appreciated for their work in the 1970's as blues-revisionists, the group has stayed together and has recently released a DVD with Howlin' Wolf guitarist Hubert Sumlin.

The 7.5's were a little tight at my big toe, but they stretched out quickly and fit much better regarding the length of the foot. Soft, high quality leather and nice slick soles for sliding on the dance floor. A word of warning - these are not very good for use in snowy weather because of the leather sole.

I found the rest of the soundtrack painful to listen to. However, it was well worth the cost for track 8, Enter You, sung by Tori Spelling.

There's some great dance tracks on here, most notably the hard-to-find \\"Dreamweaver\\" cut by Erin Hamilton (one of the most fun dance songs to come out in some time) and the classic \\"I Am Woman\\" remix.

I wanted to learn about the history of children's literature but I just couldn't get past the many, many, many list of children's books that litter the text.

There are only two Full fights on Disc 1. Only small fragments of the fights. Some fights only last for seconds, and even when a round starts at minute 3 it keeps on jumping wildly. Its unbelievable how they could do this. So basically disc 1 is garbage. Only disc 2 features twenty full fights, but jones epic battles are completely crippled.A huge step back to previous edtions. Do not buy this compilation. They have mutilated all those glorious fights. I am really angry. I wanted to relieve all those awesome moments, this is a clear rip-off. What were they thinking???????????? Sorry for too fast dooming this Compilation but still what the hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Huge Disappointment!","review":"Unfortunately, the UFC has swung and completely missed on this one. We get less fights in their entirety than last year. This is very disappointing given that an avid UFC fan can only get these fights on blu ray through this Best of disk. It is a shame the UFC has changed course on what was always a great annual Best of release just to, for what I can only assume, is to get more sales out of the event DVDs. I, for one, am not biting on the event DVDs after wasting my hard earned money on this DVD set.

With each and every picture shown of these streamers it shows what appears to be about one inch in length or so of what I assumed to be what one would lace up over their existing handle grip, thus securing the streamers to the handlebars. Not to be. You receive the six individual streamers, about 6-8 inches in length each with some little plastic thing that is supposed to be inserted in the existing hole in the end of your handlegrips. This is for $9.29. What I found out via e-mail from the company is they do have \\"other\\" streamers that they sell for $25.00 should one expect to receive actual streamers like it shows in the pictures.

What makes this different from \\"Bridges Over Madison County\\" or any number of other moving tales of love is that this one is told from the perspective of a dying woman, looking back over her very recent past. Through her pain and her drugs, she is somehow able to remember vividly some very heart warming facts about the one and only time she ever loved, and was loved in return.

Look for more, intentionally put there, soaring dramatic melodies that haunt you like Canto Della Terra, Sogno, Un Canto, and Mai Piu Cosi Lontano. I was disappointed in the female duets, one with Celine Dion (what the ___? their voices sound horrible together-it only exacurbates Celine's vocal honking that drives me nuts) and the one with Dluce Pontes isn't bad vocally-I don't care for this wierdo style it's in though. On the other hand, the duet with EROS melts butta! yummy! There are a few pieces in here by the author of \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" and also a piece or two by Mariconni (The Mission, Gabriel's Oboe). Overall, a nice collection of music-if you dig Romanza-you'll have no issues with this one. It's great and his voice sounds rested and full. AND there are full English translation to each lyric!

Not recommended at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a couple of goodies...","review":"First of all, Mr. Bocelli has a very good tenor voice. I wouldn't compare him to God like some have, but it's very nice. The only songs I cared for on this album were \\"The Prayer\\" and \\"Sogno.\\" But even they aren't timeless classics. I think Celine Dion ruins the song with her accent on the English and the Itallian. She was just a marketing ploy to get people to buy the song. He should have been paired with a better singer on it. \\"Sogno\\" was pretty in places, but nothing I'd write home about. The rest of the CD was just boring, poorly written songs that will be forgotten in one year, tops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bocelli meets Yanni?","review":"Andrea Bocelli is an amazing singer, but what's with the ethereal, new-agey music?

Truly, truly, truly a joy to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you God for Andrea& thank you Andrea for Sogno","review":"Fabulous album! I can't leave home without it! I listen to it over and over when at home and when driving. I love all his albums but Sogno is absolutely wonderful. Andrea's voice is magical.

If there was a 10 star rating, Sogno would deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTERR","review":"I am a newer fan to Andrea Boccelli having accidentally discovered him through a friend of mine returning from Italy. Ever since I heard his Romanza CD, I've been hooked. If I thought I played the other CD too much, well, that's nothing compared to how often I play his new CD Sogno. All the songs capture your heart and haunt you even when you're not hearing them. I play Sogno everyday before I go to work, and when I drive home, then I take the CD out and play it at home. I would have to say that my favorite would be nel cuare lei with Eroz Ramazzotti. I can't get enough of them singing that song. I also love the meaning of the song from a woman's point of view. These songs are delicate and simply beautiful and Andrea really just keeps getting better with every CD. I can't wait to see him in concert and I'm not a really big opera fan but he has made me one.Laura McCabe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Molto buono","review":"This CD is an excellent follow-on to Romanza.

The nay-sayers are, of course, right: he has a voice that could never be taken seriously in an opeara house, as his disasterous Detroit debut last year painfully showed. But when amplified, filtered and electronically enhanced, it sounds rather uplifting. I sincerely hope that those listeners who like this will listen to real opera singers (who are NOT amplified, except in some kind of extravaganza like a Three Tenors exhibition); they will be blown away by what a truly great operatic voice is like. I promise you, it's very different. But why not enjoy this, if it gives pleasure?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"My wife and I love Bocelli. In fact, Con Te Partiro is \\"our song.\\" We even danced it at our wedding. But _Sogno_ is a complete disappointment. Supposedly, this is popular music. After all, Celine Dion sings with Andrea on one track. But these compositions all lack a vitally important ingredient, known in the pop industry as \\"the hook.\\" There are no hooks in any of these songs. In fact, most operatic arias have more and better hooks than these songs. They simply meander all over the place, with very little rhyme or reason. Sogno makes nice background dinner music, but that's about it. We were going to go see Bocelli in concert for the second time, the next time he passes through America. But if this is what he's going to sing...forget it! The cover says it all...it's a shot of Andrea praying that no one will notice that these songs aren't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme A Break!","review":"As a voice teacher and Musician in New York City, I can say in all honesty that Bocelli is the worst singer, with the exception maybe of Bob Dylan that I have ever heard. His voice may have some potential, but he definitely sounds like he needs training. Every other note is off key, and his sound is akin to some animal noises that sheep herders frequently hear. But it doesn't surprise me that he is popular. We are in the age of mediocrity. Most people are so used to listening to junk that they can't tell when they hear something really good. To Compare Bocelli to Pavarotti is like comparing a primitive cave painting to a Rembrandt, or comparing Springsteen to Sinatra! So I say to everyone who thinks this is great music, GET YOUR EARS TUNED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first audio!Who needs sight?","review":"Every sound on this album is perfection. Andrea's voice is beautiful soft, loud, staccato... and no-one can sustain a note longer. Particularly addictive to the ear are \\"Sogno\\" (Dream)&\\"Come Un Fiume Tu\\". The orchestral accompaniments are also very dynamic. \\"A Mio Padre\\", Andrea's appology to his father is very touching and what a joy to discover that his speaking voice is every bit as beautiful as his singing. I had the good fortune to attend his concert in Phoenix on 4-14-99. This beautiful gentlemen is a phenomenon.Everyone's loves this voice. It requires no gimmicks to rivet your attention. Get this album, and all his others now. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"beauty of voice that comes across to all music lovers","review":"God gives spirit to music, and a voice to an angel.

I thought I was in love with Luciano until I discovered Bocelli. Now I am hopelessly in love with a man that sings directly to me....every word and phrase becomes a part of me. His music starts at 8a.m. and ceases at 12p.m. Sogno is the most beautiful piece of music sung by the most spiritual human being I have ever had the good fortune to hear and to ingest into the depths of my soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP!","review":"The only thing I have to say when it comes to this man's singing is pure torture. I glad I never bought one of his CD's. He sings through his nose; he's constantly straining for notes. (I have been in choir since kindergarten. I play an instrument in the concert band, I know when somebody sounds bad.) I have nothing good to say about this CD, and I'm intensely sorry for Celine Dion who had to sing 'The Prayer' with him. (Josh Groban would have been a much better candidate.) His diction is poor, and his vowel formation thoroughly atrocious.

Effortlessly emotional is what one tries to avoid... Luciano Pavarotti is still \\"the most gifted singer on the planet,\\" as ANY comparison of the operatic works of the two tenors will reveal. What Bocelli excels at right now is the popular song, which he does beautifully. He WILL improve, as well. For now, please, he is still \\"just\\" great."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fresh approach to a wide pallette","review":"It is the voice of everyman with great moments of refined musicianship. This was my first exposure to Bocelli..It shan't be my last. There are surprising moments that are worth the whole trip. His talents combined with his guests on this cd make for a rich adventure. If his duet with Celine Dion doesn't raise a hair or two on the neck..check your equipment. Sogno is a joy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"How does he do it?","review":"As Bocelli's first \\"pop\\" release after Romanza, Sogno had a tough act to follow. But this artist's amazing way with a song raises the standard even higher. Such tenderness, such fun, such passion! From the haunting to the exotic, Sogno is a \\"dream\\" come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"would strongly advice people to get this cd","review":"I'm a new listener to opera and I usually don't like opera, but since I started listening to Andrea Bocelli, I have been able to admire opera more. Reasons why I like Bocelli, is that he has a different sound and he doesn't have that \\" operatic voice \\" that we all know. I feel that this is good that he has his own style, because with this he makes it more easier for young listeners such as myself to enjoy and be more understanding in grasping the idea of opera. I just want to conclude by saying that if you want to listen to beautiful music, but hate that old type of style of singing, then I stongly suggest that you start listening to Andrea Bocelli and you might surprise yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrea Bocelli has done it again!!","review":"Andrea Bocelli always puts his heart into each song and this evident when you listen to this CD. His duet with Celine Dion was absolutely beautiful..the other artists on this CD were also a compliment to his beautiful voice.. I would reccomend this CD to anyone who loves a voice that is unique, colorful, and heavenly...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of Bocelli's voice","review":"I'm a great fan of Bocelli and was sorely disappointed in this CD. \\"I Love Rossini\\" is the only piece worthy of AB. The rest is \\"Yawnie\\"/Julio Iglesio-style elevator music, with a loud orchestra droning and monotonous in the background...sounds like the hum and buzz built into movie \\"surround sound\\" effects. For the most part, Bocelli's voice stays in the dark, lower range like Rembrandt's low-key paintings. His power seems stifled and slowed, wavering with the effort of restraint. If it weren't for #11, I'd send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best tenor...WHAT?","review":"This is almost scary, this cd ranks number \\"9\\" among ALL of amazon.com's music sales. And, WHAT? 175 reviews in a matter of about a month? The last MOST reviewed classical cd was 9 reviews for Maria Callas's Tosca. In a way, he is good for the operatic world because he has converted many non-classical listeners to opera. But at the expense of lowering the standard of the art of bel canto. I just have to put in my two cents worth here. But at the rate that these reviews are flying in, my review would be lost in a matter of days. He has a good voice, nothing special. He is certainly no Pavorotti. His legions of fans probably are so blinded by love for him that they all close their ears to any other singer. I just don't get it, talk about mediocre of a tenor. I bet he needs a microphone to be heard! I dare not leave my email for fear of being attacked by hate mail!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Someone wrote that he's in the same league as Pavarotti...please...don't be silly.

Like \\"The Prayer\\", were he duets with Celine Dion(although it is more popish) and \\"Nel cuore lei\\", with Eros Ramazotti.

Bravo Andrea your a marvelous talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love Andrea Bocelli's effortless vocals...He can sing opera or pop music with such range that leaves you wanting more...SOGNO is evident of his talents as was Romanza...to listen to his renditions of CANTO DELLA TERRA, SOGNO, A VOLTE IL CUORE, TREMO E T'AMO not to mention all the others, gives the listener a soothing sense and high emotions...I love every song on this CD.

Bocelli's voice is pure and the duets are a welcome addition to the CD. His voice is soothing and lovely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One-star because there was no 'negative # star' choice","review":"Romanza was excellent. Sogno is a great disappointment. Bocelli's voice is fantastic, no doubt, but the choice of songs for this album was bland. Many of them, especially the duet with Celine Dion, sounded to me as if they came straight out of one of those awful Disney animated movies. Slow, sappy.... BORING. How are his other albums? Like I said before, I really enjoyed Romanza"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL FANTASTIC SPIRITUAL EVEN","review":"I am a relative newcomer to this wonderful man's music. I was raised with Opera. But this CD is even better than I had ever dreamed a pop album could ever be. His voice has a spiritual quality that sends shivers up my spine and I am 57 years old. My husband is just as crazy about this offering as am I We especially like his duets with Dulce Pontes and Eros Ramazzotti. It shows his ability to sing whatever he wants to, in any style. Everyone can not sound like Pavorotti, nor do they need to. Personally I like Bocelli much better. \\"Sogno\\" is a beautifully written piece with wonderful words. The only cut we didn't like was \\"The Prayer\\".We are so 'over' Celine Dion. Now I have every singe CD with the exception of Aria. Keep up the good work, Andrea, we love you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A just-ok pop singer in operatic drag.","review":"This album was quite disappointing. A few songs are tolerable, but the pop nature of the production and Mr. Bocelli's surprisingly limited vocal ability were shocking. I admit to being taken in by the many favorable reviews offered up by customers who bought the album. My expectations were high, but the album fails to deliver. It's quite pop in musical nature and not to my taste. In addition, there is a giant chasm between the vocal ability of the major operatic tenors and Mr. Bocelli (I say this with all due respect). I should have been more suspicious of all those ooey-gooey reviews and skipped buying this one. Listeners who prefer strong voices and serious music might consider doing the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one word... Bravo...!","review":"Having been hooked upon first listen to Romanza, Songo is just that much more incredible. Andrea has the voice to propel any listener into a state of total paradise. BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO."},{"rating":"2","title":"This recording is lyrical and beautiful.","review":"Bocelli's distinctive voice transcends his previous mainly classical selections into a range of more seductive Italian love songs in this newest release. It would make a wonderful gift for almost any music lover. It is my favorite of all his recordings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS VOICE MAKES MY HEART SING","review":"LISTENING TO ANDREA SING SOME OF THESE SONGS BRING ME TO TEARS ,THAT WONDERFUL FEELING DEEP WITHIN YOURSELF,YOUR SOUL LISTING TO THAT WONDERFUL VOICE,THERE IS STILL BEAUTY IN THIS TROUBLED WORLD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sogno","review":"Awesome CD, listening to this CD on my Minidisc staring in awe at the mountains in Marocco...worth every penny and then some.Why is it that there are so many people reviewing this CD and complaining about Andrea not being even near Pavarotti? Does it matter if he is not a Pavarotti? People buy his music and love it,the people have spoken.Please stop this cultural snobbism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired of all the comparisons!","review":"It is too bad that narrow-minded individuals feel the need to attack Mr. Bocelli in his time of well-deserved popularity. He never claimed to be the next Pavarotti nor does he want to be. As a matter of fact, Mr. Pavorotti was completely impressed after hearing a demo of Andrea and could not believe that he was singing in small piano bars instead of to thousands of people. I guess the fact that people feel the need to compare Mr. Bocelli to Mr. Pavorotti is compliment enough. I'd like to hear some of these \\"arm-chair critics\\" try to sing. Mr. Bocelli shows on \\"Sogno\\" that the quality of his voice is matched by its diversity. He brings the same energy and richness to these pop selections that he did to arias on previous albums. This album is sure to continue the flood of new opera fans as people previously unexposed to opera like what they hear and test the waters of other artists as well. A definite must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sogno........it really is a Dream","review":"One of Andrea Bocelli's best CD's ever. Sogno is a Dream. I would highly recommend it.........L.L./Bocelli Fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Words cannot describe...!","review":"I was not a tremendous fan of classical music until I heard this voice...what a gorgeous voice, the most beautiful I have ever heard! First time I heard this particular CD I cried, it was sooooo beautiful! Out of this world. There is something extra more than just a polished singer/tenor, a quality of passion and beauty beyond, that can't be described. There is something that takes you into the music and lifts you higher, makes you soar!May he continue to produce such beauty.Jane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some excellent tracks, brought down by filler material","review":"First, why would anyone claim that Bocelli has vocal limitations? Because he isn't bludgeoning our ears with stupid songs, which is the reason that we turned off opera in the first place? I would say that this guy has the best voice in the world. If Pavarotti was singing this album, I wouldn't have bought it.This is a good album, although not up there with Romanza. The title track and Canto Della Terra are excellent songs. My favorite, Tremo E T'Amo is Bocelli's best song ever (in my humble opinion)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bocelli is Awesome","review":"What's not to love. His angelic voice makes you want to go to Tuscany and just soak up more of his wonderfulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Of A Crossover","review":"From his PBS special to his Bellagio commercial and appearances on the Golden Globes and Academy Awards, this lone tenor has quickly done what it took all Three Tenors years to do before: achieve huge crossover pop success.Sogno continues in the romantic vein of his previous recordings, highlighting his soaring voice against airy arrangements of strings and synthesizers.Cynics will call this soppy mush, but the English translations demonstrate what fans already know--these are songs of passionate love, pointless love, love as big as the ocean!Among the best are \\"Tremo E T'Amo,\\" a tale of doomed passion, and \\"Canto Della Terra,\\" written by the folks behind his hit \\"Time to Say Goodbye.\\" His duet with Celine Dion, \\"The Prayer,\\" will get attention, but \\"'O Mare E Tu,\\" his spicy collaboration with Dulce Pontes, is also a swoon-worthy combination.Passion so evoked, even non-Opera lovers like Bocelli."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like rap music and i enjoy this CD","review":"i am an 18 year old lover of the hip hop/rap/dance/pop scene and even i like this CD. i now own this CD as well as Romanza. Bocelli's voice just catches your attention even if your not listening. i highly recomend this CD (even if your not a hip hop fan) :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally soothing for the soul","review":"Words can hardly describe the calm his music brings to myself and my 6 year old daughter while it plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"I first heard track one of this great CD on a concert on television. What moved me most was the haunting melody and the sounds from the futuristic looking musical instruments. I bought the album thinking that perhaps there would be only one or at the most two tracks which I would like, but I have to admit it is the first CD I have bought in a long time that I can honestly say that I like them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANDREA BOCELLI HERALDS THE ITALIAN NEW WAVE","review":"Bocelli brings us the ancient warmth of the Italian heart with this collection of magnificent songs! A masterpiece, this is a true joy that will thrill the soul for years to come. The beauty of the arrangements, the supremely vibrant dynamics of this beautiful singer, herald, along with Bernini, a new wave of Euro-Italian culture that brings true Romance and joy back to fore. Buy this for your children and grandchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice.","review":"After purchasing Romanza, I decided that to add another Bocelli cd to my collection. This is simply Bocelli at his best due to the fact that he gives a powerful and stunning performance, espeically when singing the sorrowful \\"Sogno.\\" What a treat to own this cd, so don't miss out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent/Motto Bene","review":"The voice is glorious, rich, robust; yet sensual. The words are romantic, compelling...the music divine. No matter when or where I play this CD everyone falls in love with it. You can't ask for much more from Andrea, but with each successive CD he records, he brings new people to his throng of fans. Love him--he's inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a moving recording!","review":"When I first heard Romanza I was at a friend's house and I just stopped what I was doing and had to listen. This new album, Songo, is just as riveting. I don't know of anyone who can just let this play in the background without asking who it is. You won't be sorry with your purchase of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but the signal is bad","review":"I bought this card in replace my laptop wifi card.This card works well with adapters B and G, I haven't tested yet on N adapter but the signal is bad.With this card I think you get what you paid, as I mentioned before, It works but not as you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination Overdose","review":"Really awesome album.

I selected this product to create custom stickers, hoping that the stickers could also be removed easily. I am happy to report that this paper appears to work as described. I had no problems printing to this paper and then sticking and un-sticking the creations.Avery has some suggested crafts on its website, but nothing appealing to my children. But there are many ideas on the web. Another possibility is to let them design something on the computer or on paper and then scan it and print it out. I can imagine many other uses for this sticker paper. If they were less expensive, I would use them with my Amazon seller account and just print, stick, and ship. They would also make excellent labels for homebrewing.It would be nice to have a choice of colors, glossy and luster finishes, and finer scoring on the back for smaller stickers. I just wish there were more sheets in the pack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Idea!","review":"Basically you buy a pack of 15 sticker sheets. The sheets are uncut and 8.5 by 11. They fit into any printer and you can download templates or use your own. You can print any kind of sticker, graphic, picture, text from Word--anything goes, then you cut out your graphic in the shape you want and you have a custom sticker. The possibilities are endless.The Sticker Project Paper would be especially fun with kids, allowing them to pick a graphic then print them a sticker. They can print one sticker or a page of stickers. I love easy projects like this for kids. I would recommend this product and especially use it this time of year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple fun idea","review":"The project paper kit is simply 8.5 x 11 inch sheets of paper with a sticky back. They are whole sheets that you put into your printer and create whatever sort of sticker you want. After creating and printing, you just cut out the sticker you created. There is no template or special software needed as it's just normal paper with glue underneath. I used \\"Drawing\\" from OpenOffice to create my stickers, and it worked fine.It's a good concept, and cheap and easy way to organize your stuff in a funner way. The stickers are pretty sticky, but don't feel like they will permanently stick. I have been able to apply and remove stickers from plastic jars with ease.I recommend this kit if you are into crafts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"This is basically a giant blank sticker sheet which permits you to print any shape that you like; you just need to cut it out yourself. The fact that it's repositionable is a gigantic plus. The software is fun too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Advertising","review":"I was looking for an easy-to-remove but sturdy sticker to use in my mate's vending machine business when I found Avery's Sticker Project Paper. Previously, we'd used rectangular or circular stickers that left no room for creativity, so our attempts to draw the eye looked like pre-made \\"New!\\" stickers you see in grocery stores. Ho-hum.With these full-sized sheets, I'm able to create my own shapes and sizes. Avery.com supplies free templates, or you can use your own art. I'm very pleased with the quality and the ease of repositioning and removal. People are noticing, and that's good for business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't get wet","review":"I use these sticker papers and wrap them around glass mason jars to decorate homemade cookies. It's so convenient to print and go, but don't get this wet. The ink will run if wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would've been better off buying photo paper and using glue","review":"There is no gloss on this paper at all so it doesn't even look like a cheap sticker. The slits on the back of the paper to make it easier to remove are actually deep creases that show through the front of the paper. This makes full page printing useless. All the sheets in the pack had these deep creases. So I don't know if I just received a defective pack or if this is how all the Avery Sticker sheets are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for customized projects","review":"These stickers work great for making stickers in your own personalized shapes that you cannot get from the standard rectangular size. I make labels for jars of goodies I give to people on special occasions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"My interest in making stickers led me to buying this product. I visited Avery.com and read the user reviews prior to using to avoid making a mistake that would waste my ink. Printer ink is expensive. The \\"stickers\\" which I just purchased do not stick. Sure they take the ink okay, but I could have saved myself the money & printed the image on a piece of paper if I wanted to tape the image to my scrapbook. It's not like I was using this product on an unrecommended surface. A scrapbook is the featured image on the product. Within 2 hours it curled up and fell off. Maybe I just bought a bad batch. This is possible, but I'm a broke college student and the price of this product (not including the cost of the ink I just wasted) equates to almost 1.5 hours at my job. Never ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best quality","review":"This paper just wasn't as good as I'd expected it to be. It never held vibrant colors well, and I tried on multiple printers. The colors just seemed dull on this paper.

We love Doris Roberts as Raymond's mother, and thought it would be fun to see her in a different sort of role. Unfortunately the story was way too choppy and many elements just didn't make sense at all. The acting was average-to-mediocre and it seems the director just didn't pull the characters or their parts together very well. Honestly this film had the look and feel of older movies when the arts of acting and movie-making just weren't as advanced as we've grown accustomed to in the 21st century.The film does get a few points for a redeeming message of forgiveness, coupled with not allowing the past, whatever it may be, to interrupt the present and future.

You can fit exactly two controllers into the case; you can fit quite a few games in the provided holder, but this is very risky because the sleeves are too loose and the games can easily slip out and get scratched. You could potentially fit another controller or some games in cases in the top compartment, that is if the power brick didn't take up over 60% of the space. The package says it was designed to work with either the 360 or the original Xbox console, and while it can at least accommodate the console itself, it's clear that this was designed with the original box in mind, because it's intensely inconvenient to use with the 360.

They don't really do much, they just have a few blah rock riffs and a bit of dissonant noisyness, but they don't really demonstrate any interesting or good ideas, and the ideas they have really don't go anywhere or warrant the amount of repetition they get. I wanted to like this band but I guess it's not going to happen. I thought the rest of the album would at least be semi interesting, but these songs are bitterly disappointing. They mostly revolve around powerchords and single notes with a bit of noisyness. They don't have any focussed or interesting chord arrangements. The whole thing just feels like a lazy jam session."},{"rating":"2","title":"An examination into Mythopoeic truth","review":"The collection of essays in this book are by far brilliant examinations with fit evidence. It is great for the reader interested in Ancient religions of Egypt and Mesopotamia, it provides fundamental views on ancient mans perspective of the world, gods, and himself from myth. This is not a text book, nor a history book but it does provide adequate literary evidence and footnotes. I wish I had read this before studying ancient philosophy, it would have greatly helped my understanding of the mind of these ancients. It's amazing to read about the development of mans theories through mythopoeic tales. Well worth it for the Philosophy-, religion- or ancient studies - student. Or if you really enjoy myths, find out how man came about with these stories. Covers Egyptian, Babylonian and Assyrian (in some detail) and Mesopotamian thought and myth."},{"rating":"1","title":"smelly","review":"This cream is a very good product that helps heal skin, IF you want to smell like a Bento Box Lunch!

Overall, I thought it was an above average production, and enjoyed many parts of it very much. I appreciated the picturesque atmosphere and beauty of the film - it definitely captures the whimsical nature of the book. Also, all of the actors and actresses did a great job! Quilp in particular was super duper creepy.I was disappointed at the emission of some of the smaller plot lines featuring Kit and Dick. In my opinion, there could have been a few less shots of Nell and Grandfather rambling contentedly about the countryside, and a few more of the entertaining instances with these two delightful characters.All in all, I think that the minor complaints I do have are with the way the story was adapted, not with the way the adaptation was carried out. Nicely made and all in all an enjoyable experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Dickens fans","review":"Excellent movie. No frills like 5.1 surround sound.

Even though I believe that their previous work on Great Expectations (1989) was far better, I was happy to see the same fine quality and acting as portrayed by Peter Ustinov, Adam Blackwood, and Tom Courtenay. The young and yet unknown actors also did a fine job. Blackwood did as wonderfully here as he did in the same filming of Great Expectations. Ustinov was like we've never seen him and Courtenay was marvelous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Really done well movie.

Some of his stories are a bit grim for me, but I thought why not see a film version.

I watched it several times, played it for friends, and enjoyed it thoroughly. I never read the book, but I suspect this is a good adaptation. It's long enough to contain a lot of detail and subplot. I especially like Tom Courtenay's over-the-top portrayal of the villain Quilp. Peter Ustinov, Edward Fox (in a small role as Ustinov's brother), and the girl who plays Little Nell are also very good. Many small roles are memorably acted. If you like Dickens and period pieces, it's a very good show.I then purchased this movie on DVD to keep it in my collection, and I was very disappointed. The video quality is far inferior to that of the earlier VHS tape. Having experienced the VHS version, I consider the DVD version unwatchable. Basically, they took a long movie and squeezed it onto a single disc. A pity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This was a very good depiction of the old days. While we're not familiar with Dicken's book \\"The Old Curiosity Shop\\", we arethoroughly pleased with this version. The acting, the characters, the scenery, seemed so authentic with the time period. Nell,for instance, just seemed to have that victorian appearance: with the small mouth, large eyes, very meek and quiet like. We donot know how it was done to make the streets of victorian London and vicinity look so life like and real, but it was done verynicely. There are a few scenes of fighting, but otherwise this production is good for the entire family. We thought it waswonderful!

Looking through the book I was pleased with the amount of information on each page. The purchase decision was easy.I like the step by step format of the book, the marketing plan guide, the chapter on public relations and I particularly like the second chapter of 101 tips and the way it is organized. The cartoons at the start of each chapter are also a nice touch. I have looked through many marketing books at the book store in the past but this is the first one I have purchased. I doubt I'll ever need to read another one. +dana+"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Fuss Toner","review":"It's a toner cartridge for a color laser printer. Each color has it's own toner cartridge no need to use powders to fill baskets, etc. Just slide the old one out and the new one in. However, as you can imagine this adds to the cost of the maintenance cycle and since they made them all the same size you had to pay for color in the same size as the black toner making them very expensive to change out.

This is a milestone in all of music. Everlast has single-handedly created a new style of bluesy hip hop.This is one of the few cd's you can play all the way through over and over and never get bored. Everlast was a hip hop master and now with the Whitey Ford project he is a GENIUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everlast brings a new fresh sound to the music industry","review":"Everlast makes a great return to the music scene with his new solo album \\"Whitey Ford Sings the Blues\\". Overall the album works great with his singing (and still some rapping), real instrumentals, and the back beat sound that has a reminiscence of his House of Pain days. The album shows how Everlast has matured not only as a musician, but also as a person. His songs are based on or filled with similarities to real life experiences that he has faced and needed to deal with over the last couple of years. Even the CD insert that he wrote tells about his issues in life that he has gone through. Through his music he you feel his message and it lives up to a \\"Blues\\" standard. No matter what type of music you prefer, this CD is a definite to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for track 5","review":"Man \\"Get Down' is my favorite song now.

The rough gargle I hear coming out of this guy's throat is enough to drive me away from the album all by itself. The bland guitar playing and dull-witted lyrics don't help much either. House of Pain man or not, this dosen't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Former House of Pain member Everlast mixes a couple of styles in his second solo album, joining rock, hip hop, folk, spoken-word and blues. The result is a professional, well-crafted record with some consistent songs but never really rises above average, been-there-done-that material. There are some fine moments here like \\"Ends\\", \\"Get Down\\" and \\"What It\`s Like\\", while most of the other songs are merely listenable/ forgettable and the record has more hip hop than it really needs. It\`s a bit too long, either, becoming unappealing halfway through. Probably this is one of those \\"for fans only\\" albums. I guess I\`m not included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by \\"what it's like\\"","review":"I bought this a few months back based on hearing \\"What It's Like\\" on the rock stations.

If that's your thing, get it. It's not mine and I felt tricked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy Album","review":"Don't waste your time or your mind listening to this album...one song is cool - but even that is filled with expletives...this guy's a moron loser and i regret buying it...thank God i didn't pay much for it...and thank the Lord that I was able to trade it in at a local store."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Boy Rapper At His Worst","review":"I bought this disc for \\"What It's Like\\" and \\"Ends\\".

I have had the CD for over a month and the only two songs I listen to are the above mentioned tracks. Granted, I am not much of a present day rap fan. Today's rap artists rely more on production work and four letter words than substance. Gone are the days of true talent in the rap world. If I may steal a quote from a musician friend of mine, \\"No matter how much you polish a turd, it is still a turd\\". I gave Everlast two stars for the two tracks that I mentioned above.

IS a bad album , and i dont like it , he is a washed up rap star, trying to be a folk singer, Vanilla Ice tried it, and it diddnt work! So why would everlast try it? This album is a waste of money, he has to get washed up rappers like Prince Paul to be on this piece of junk, if you like MTV and you like alternative rap albums, than buy this album.

This got alot of attention for the song \\"What it's Like\\", partly because of the mix of rap and acoustic guitar, but also because it was pretty deep lyrically. Even though a few tracks are like that one, especially \\"Ends\\", the majority of the disc is still \\"House Of Pain\\" type rap, which for me is a win-win situation. Other phat tracks are \\"Get Down\\", \\"Today (watch me shine)\\", \\"Funky Beat\\", and the rockin' \\"Hot To Death\\". I also think the intro is cool, and a nice nod to the \\"Fat Boys\\". Overall it's an impressive mix of songs.

I felt compelled to buy the CD.It sounded like it was going to be something different. It turns out that it really isn't. It's mostly a catchy rap album infused with a few folksy-blues tunes like ENDS, WHAT IT'S LIKE & TODAY(WATCH ME SHINE).But it's far from a disappointment. EVERLAST includes the obligatory less than 1 minute intros every couple of songs that are so poipular on rap albums, but what follows is accessible, thoughtful rap, disproving the cliche that all rap is meaningless noise. I personally would have liked EVERLAST to have delved a little deeper into the blues, but from where I stand this is a very worthwhile CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"I was so excited and pumped to get this album but when I did I was very dissapointed.

Fortunatley, Everlast survived the cardiac scare and forged a new path combining hip-hop and blues. No, this isn't the first time rap has been forged with other musical styles but it IS the most engaging combination to date. Not that you would want to, but if you stripped away the dope beats, these songs are arresting blues in the tradition of John Lee Hooker. Astoundingly, Everlast manages to keep it fresh revelling in his hip-hop roots. Keep up the good work Everlast - the world could use more records like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!

It doesn't really take any chances. Everlast doesn't blend folk, rock, and rap, but rather he raps over folk and rock rythyms. Other than \\"What it's Like,\\" this CD is predictable hip hop. It would have been fresh ten years ago, but now it's nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work of genius- Brave, innovative, with lots of funk","review":"Each track is unique, as is the style Whitey Ford possesses. Delivered cooly from the commanding deep voice of Whitey, are lyrics that are often beautiful and prophetic. This album is varied in its tracks, but consistent in its delivery of rap-spun beat with definite influences of the blues. Yes, there are explicit lyrics and references to matters that are not child-appropriate. However, the use of these words and ideas are not gratuituos by any means, and quite honestly, seem to be part of its entire brillance. . . completely righteous beat delivered by an unlikely musician in an ecclectic package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome rap/rock combo","review":"I don't know how, but everlast manages to pull off the rap/rock combo like nobody else.

House of Pain was one of my favorites and Everclear was the only white rapper with talent. He may still have some but does not show it in this album. When I first heard \\"What it's like\\" I thought that he may have changed his style for the better. And when I saw that he had named his album \\"Whitey Ford Sings the Blues\\" I was even more drawn for my love of good blues music. This album offers none of the above. Everclear just could'nt keep away from the popular rap stylings of modern day and dissapointed me to no end.

There is a small sector of this genre that I do like. Will Smith from Men in Black is one. A brief bridge in Overkill by Jimmy Buffet is another. After reading the reviews of this I was really anticipating to find more that I would enjoy. What I heard was not unlike being stuck in a large bowl of oatmeal without milk, butter, sugar, and fruit. It was amorphous and rapidly irritating, sticking to my chin much more than my heart. I would strongly urge all those who have an interest in exploring this genre, to engage in auditory exploration before financial divestiture. Thanx! P.S. Whitey should have kept his job as a starter for the NY Yankees. A terrific southpaw!!!

But when I got around to buying the album, I was a little disappointed. The three songs I downloaded were the best ones on the CD. Aside from the singer sounding like he's just singing because no one else wanted to, and showing a total lack of emotion, the music is just mundane. One song blends into another and before you know it, your wondering what happened to the CD. It's not that bad a CD, but I haven't found myself playing it anywhere lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing record","review":"I bought 'Dream To Make Believe' on a whim. I had heard of Armor For Sleep through the internet and magazines, but i had no idea what their sound was like. This cd is incredible. There's so much energy and emotion. When i listen to the songs, they take me to another world. Yeah, that's corny to say, but it's true. I just feel so great listening to their music. I don't really have a favorite track. All of the songs are beautiful in their own way, even the 45 second instrumental. This is indie rock in it's finest form. If you like Coheed And Cambria, Breaking Pangaea, or any other amazing indie bands, you need to pick up this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the last Review","review":"Dude, I agree that this is a great album, but what are you smoking?

The lyrics are horrible. The subject matter as well is very typical teen angsty. I find the verse of Kind of Perfect to be possibly the biggest adulteration of the metaphor...ever. However, I have found tracks 2-4 to be bearable. I just don't see this as anything special. I think if they dropped the lead singer Armor for Sleep would have a much brighter (in both senses of term) future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Dreams","review":"Full of great melodies, lyrics about sleeping/dreaming (my favoritepast time activities), and Ben Jorgenson's voice. Heavily influencedby the third wave emo sound (Sunny Day Real Estate for instance). I believe this album out does What to do When You are Dead, in almost every way (though I still love the new album). The songs are more meaningful, and Ben's voice works perfectly with the tone and mood of the album. The highlights of the album are Armor For Sleep/Dream to Make Believe, Wanderers Guild, My Town (I used to love to run through my town and scare kids), and Slip Like Space.(edited in 2008) Please vote below if you like the review."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARMOR FOR SLEEP - DREAM TO MAKE BELIEVE","review":"I just got this album yesterday, and I haven't stopped listening to it for one second yet. This is an amazing piece of work here. Every song is so emotionally powerful. I love the guys voice, and the guitars, and everything else. Man, I get all pumped up even when I talk about them. I haven't heard an album this good since Emery's \\"The Weak's End\\" or Funeral For A Friend's \\"Casually Dressed...\\".

When the cleaning cycle is completed, I then remove the video head cleaner and reinsert the tape that was visibly bad. There is little, if any, improvement. Shortly thereafter, I insert a new tape that I recorded on.

She even traded in the trusty mop handle she had been using (and I hated). The stick has a rubber tip on the bottom which greatly reduces the risk of slipping. The handle is a nice, molded grip. The top segment can be raised and locked into place. This joint stays locked, creating a taller stick. However, the one flaw I found was the lock on the bottom segment. It will not stay locked. Any pressure and the segment slides (telescopes) back into the larger segment. Very risky for an old woman, so we don't use this lock.

Yuli and Lena, or whatever their names are, have no talent whatsoever. They're worse than Aaron Carter when he was nine years old. Please do not waste your money. You can listen to this song all you want on the radio, there's no point in buying it. Hasn't it annoyed you already? I'm pretty sure that T.a.T.u will definitely not be around for a while.

These sound great and I am real happy with them. Great sound at a reasonable price.I added these as rear surround speakers for my 7.1 system and they sound great. My only quibble is with the \\"Integrated keyhole slot wall mounting brackets\\". These are simply an extension to the speaker back that has a hole in it for hanging from a nail or screw (like a cheap wall clock). They do have the standard threaded hole for use with regular satellite speaker wall brackets (which I purchased separately). They're still a great deal but I really wouldn't plan on mounting these with the \\"integrated bracket\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"polk audio","review":"Great speakers lots of full rich sound.

I read it for my own enjoyment, but it would also be very useful in a homeschool setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"tragic tale","review":"The tale is tragic but heartwarming. I had never heard of the Bhopal gas tragedy, and it was interesting and sad to learn about it through fiction. The book is easy to read, enjoyable, and paints a picture of life in India for one woman. I recommend it as a quick and fun read, but not one that will change your perspective on life. The author did move me to tears, so for this, I give her four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I loved this book from beginning to end. I was so engulfed in it I couldn't put the book down. I read this book and \\"The Mango Season\\" and I have to say Amulya Malladi has what it takes to keep you interested. It was a pleasure to read both books written by her. Anjali is such a strong character as well as her husband Sandeep. I am just waiting for the next book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, wonderful!","review":"I read this book because I loved Amulya Malladi's second book, \\"The Mango Season.\\" And \\"A Breath of Fresh Air\\" was absolutely fabulous. I didn't even know about the Union Carbide gas leak that happened in India until I read this book. But this book is not just about that gas leak, it is about an Indian woman who survives the gas leak and makes a life for herself. I think Amulya Malladi's greatest asset is her ability to write about strong and real women. The women she writes about maybe Indian but their emotions, their struggles and their joys are something shared universally by women all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok to Good, short easy read","review":"If you're interested in a short, quick/easy read with insight into the conflict of modern Indian women, then this book is for you.I was only slightly intersted in the topic but purchased the book based upon the glowing reviews and because I enjoy reading an author's first work. I thought it was sad, but interesting, and thought the author did a good job portraying the conflicts experienced by modern Indian women, in terms of tradition, expectations, family and cultural influences.While I thought the characters were well developed and enjoyed how the novel was written through differen vantage points in terms of time and characters, I thought the storyline itself was a too underdeveloped and finished the book wanting something more and feeling unfulfilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN","review":"Beautifully written in simple english, this book definitely touches one's heart. Did not get a chance to read her second book yet but I am sure I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"This got published?","review":"The book starts off with an interesting premise, but the execution is horrible. The writing is pathetic and i can say with a fair amount of certainty, that my 10 year old son can make better sentences. The characters are as flat as pancakes and as interesting as navel lint. There is no development to the story and the initial villian undergoes a change of heart without thought, provocation or incident (much to the story's convenience). The story is obviously written with western audiences in mind as no one in India greets anyone with a \\"how are you doing.\\" Innumerable discrepancies like this, play havoc with ones acceptance of the story. Ms Malladi's use of the Bhopal gas tragedy as a background is probably the only reason this terrible project saw the light of day, otherwise it would have remained, as it probably should have,a figment of her imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not a \\"5\\"!","review":"My friends and I who love India share a lot of novels set there. I read the wonderful reviews of A Breath of Fresh Air and can't believe I just read the same book. My copy will be passed along to the Goodwill! I would be embarrassed to loan this to my friends. The book is written from the point of view of three characters, yetthe \\"voice\\" remains the same. It repeats the same issues over and over. The plot was a great idea. The book lacks depth and development."},{"rating":"1","title":".....","review":"I got this item to use during a road trip from TX to MS with my 1 y/o twins.

Our daughter can put her books on it or her magna-doodle. The cup holder is in a good spot that she can reach and she likes putting snacks in the other holder. My only change would be a way to keep the strap in place when it is released. If I don't hold onto the strap as I unhook, it slips behind the seat and is tough to reach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with a Britax Roundabout","review":"I really want to like this product--it's a great idea, useful and decently made, easy to clean, good size...but it just did not fit my daughter's car seat. She's 3 years old in a Britax Roundabout, I've had the Taby Tray for over a year and have tried several different configurations to get it to stay up. But since the car seat does not have armrests, the tray leans forward and down so everything spills off. The one thing I haven't tried is installing a pole from the van floor to the bottom of the tray to keep it from tipping forward. I ended up giving up and instead purchased a \\"Go Anywhere Table and Footrest\\" from onestepahead.com. That tray is smaller, but it has a post that adjusts vertically and can tilt so nothing falls off.The Taby Tray would probably work well for a car seat that has arm rests, like the example pictured, but did not work with the kind of car seat we have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - did not fit","review":"This is a wonderful idea, but it did not fit our Brittax Blvd. car seat. The tray tilted to far forward and down. I tried to install it many different ways, it just would not work.

We have a Brittax Roundabout, and it works just fine ... snug fit with no tipping. I put the under-seat strap way back, towards the back of the seat rather than directly under the middle of the Brittax, which makes the difference for us. I love the simple design of having a clip on each side, so that if I have to remove the tray completely, the strap underneath doesn't have to be removed. Most of my daughter's sippy cups fit in the cup holder. She eats her snacks there, plays with cars (which don't fall off due to the rim), draws & writes at her table. We think it has been a great addition to our daily errands & our 3-hour trips to Grandma & Granddad's house. And at such a low price, we feel we've already gotten our money's worth, as it's still in pretty much like-new condition. We've recommended it to other parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide to herbs","review":"This is a really great book for discovering many common and uncommon herbs and there uses.

As someone who is serious about using herbs medicinally, I do not trust this text."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good experience","review":"Considering I was very excited to get this book I didn't care for the wait. It took longer than most orders I make to get to my house. But it was still within the limits of the estimated time given. The book itself was in excellent condition and I love this book.

The renditions of the core works of this repertoire (the Berg op. 1, Schoenberg op. 11, etc.) are riddled with wrong notes and poorly played. The early works are rarely, if ever, recorded but I do not think they are performed in a manner worth hearing here, either. When it comes to the Schoenberg, go with Gould (His Berg and Webern are also great, but they have been paired by Sony with other things that are not so great). There are many outstanding recordings of the Berg. You could throw a rock in a classical CD store (if they still existed) and you could find a better one that the one found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prevail large washcloths make for a great cleanup","review":"My mother had these washcloths available to her at a nursing home/rehab center on a recent stay; when she moved in with us I needed to have them available in the house and in larger quantities than other products available in stores locally.

If you know anything about Bible, it is a true fact that Paul talks about this in Ephesians and also mentions forgiving a slave in the book of Philemon. Ms. Dodds is an excellent writer and is addressing essential and pertinent data for today. Our God being the same yesterday, today, and forever let's know that nothing has changed. I have copies of two of her books, with one being sold out, and I must say that they are very interesting. Subsequently, a must have for your library.

The second track on the CD \\"Freedom\\" is mellow and smooth, setting the laid back, but powerful tone for the rest of the CD. The title track, \\"What's Golden\\" takes you back to the old school, and gets you rapping right along with the boys.

This group of hungry emcees do not waste much time, tearing into their rhymes with a love for the syllable and usually enduring samples, forgetting to act cool and simply being it by selflessly honing delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BOMB!","review":"Now that Jurassic5 has been around for a while, I thought maybe, just maybe, the new album would be a disappointment,but hey, guess if I was wrong. So incredibly wrong. I guess I was so a little bit eager. THIS ALBUM IS THE BOMB! You have maybe already heard the hit \\"What's golden\\" on MTV, but then you gotta hear the rest of it. \\"High fidelity\\" swings the melody, \\"Thin line\\" featuring Nelly Furtado mix up really well, I just can't get enough of that song. Or \\"A day at the races\\" featuring hip-hop legendary Big Daddy Kane makes you go wild! Or.. nah, you just gotta have this album. It's a must have!

Their latest LP Power in Numbers is hot. It is similar to their old stuff but with some updates on their formula. They collaborate with some artists like Nelly Furtado, Big Daddy Kane and JuJu of the Beatnuts. Thin Line featuring Nelly Furtado shows a little more of the depth of J5 than they have shown in the past. The production of the whole album is tight and lyrics are as good as ever. Check this album. Support real hip hop, not garbage that's on the radio.-BP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, addictive and infectiously groovy","review":"For fans of Jurassic 5, this album is another home run. And for the uninitiated, get this album and get exposed. J5 has evolved - moving beyond the retro, old-school grooves of Quality Control and their EP. They've added a new DJ (Cut Chemist) and have a newer edge to their beats.There is the first single \\"What's Golden\\" - but it isn't the best song on this album by far. \\"Thin Line\\" with help from Nelly Furtado, \\"Remember His Name\\", \\"Hey\\", \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Acetate Prophets\\" are excellent tracks - each showing a different aspect of J5.If you are into hip-hop, this is a can't miss album. Even if you only like hip-hop a little bit, it is worth giving this album a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Times As Good As Quality Control","review":"This album is unbelievably ill from start to finish. J5 adds a little bit of jazz to their roster of sounds with Cut Chemist and Nu Marc makin' every beat sizzle.

Just check out \\"A Day At The Races\\" to see how all of them have improved though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album and even a better deal.","review":"I just picked up this CD today and have enjoyed it on the first listen. Everyone has already hear What's Golden on MTV or in the Sprite commercial. Other than that, the songs that stuck out immediatley are If You Only Knew, High Fidelity, and Thin Line. It's also a pretty good deal if you can pick up the release with the DVD. Overall, it doesn't seem as good as Quality Control, but that was a near perfect 5 star album. It has a different sound that you really need to hear for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album from some REAL hip hop artists","review":"This album is a serious head nodder... watch out you might break yo neck. The beats are extremely phat thanks to hot DJ's Numark and the amazing Cut Chemist. And Jurassic 5's 4 MC's have grown, shown, and proved. I've only listened to Power in Numbers a few times so far, but I'm already loving it. \\"I Am Somebody\\" is the jam, the first single off the album \\"What's Golden\\" is gonna blow up and \\"pump you for your chart spaces\\".

I had marked my calender and waited months to pick this cd up. When I got it, I was happy but not quite excited. After listening a while, Ive discovered this record well and after a while I may develop a new taste for it.It is definately a different feel for Jurassic 5. They sound a little darker and a little more like the Dilated Peoples or Swollen Members. But they still keep it a little more upbeat with Whats Golden and a few others in the beginning. The last track Acetate Prophets, is a track in the feel of Lesson 6 or Swing Set. Lesson 6 is my favorite and this is definately not as good. I also think that J5 relys a little to much on flute samples, at least to much for my taste. But all in all if you like J5, then youll like Power in Numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"J5 dont dissapoint!","review":"i got this cd because 2000's quality control became my favorite cd when i got it.right now, i cant say that power in numbers tops quality control, but it is still an incredible album. i know that it will grow on me after a few more listens.incredible beats, more meaningful lyrics than quality control, and great harmonizing.the dvd is also great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jurassic[6]?","review":"Music is my life!

So I had to go online and find out. Turns out its by Jurassic 5! I'm real glad I was listening to the radio at that time. I only gave the CD 4 stars because it wasn't the BEST. The beats were awesome! Thanks to the two DJs backing Jurassic 5. The rhymes were pretty good. If you like old school, good old fashioned rappers, then I'd say get this CD. They aren't all bout sex, drugs, and money. They about giving a good message. One thing I don't get is the group is called Jurassic 5....but on the back of the CD case, they show [6] people.

I don't care if this cd sales 1 copy or a million, its awesome in my opinion. The first song \\"Freedom\\" is so real, its crazy. The entire album offers hot beats and tight lyrics. J5 is definetly branching out on this album. The only reason I rated it 4 1/2 is because I feel Quality Control was a better album. But this one is awesome too.

Although a good introduction to hip hop for the rock listener, there are more authentic groups out there. Cut Chemist and Nu-Mark do a great job as DJs, and I suggest checking out their solo work (as well as the original 1997 Jurassic 5 EP), but the rest is a bit generic. I'd look to such artists as El-P, Aesop Rock, or the classic Tribe Called Quest for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Power","review":"Until now have I discovered the only rap group to my liking. Jurassic 5 blends real instruments with hip-hop beats to create an unforgettable and excellent vibe. Never have I listened to a rap CD this much. J5 really has substance in this album and alot of power in their lyrcis which are mostly driven by politics and society as we know it today. Althought I don't know much about the group and its members this an excellent album producing true and genuine hip-hop which definatly doesn't lack ceativity and originality.

It is organized by the right and left bank which is so broad as to be of little use. Occassionally, it will mention a street and rattle off the names of some stores on that street. Fewer adjectives and more hard information would have helped. A large amount of space is given to big name stores and famous designers that nobody needs a special guide to find. It mentions Limoges twice but gives no further information about where one can find Limoges. It didn't mention Gien, a famous French pottery which is now sold in Neiman Marcus. Other guides were much more useful than this book in helping locate clothing stores that would appeal to a teenage girl.

Mike Edwards is the uncrowned musical genius of the 90's, and this CD is his crowning achievement.

I would definitely order from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Ashes","review":"This is one of the better movies I have ever seen that deals with true life accountants of the inmates in Auschwitz during the WW II. Christine Lahiti was excellent in her part as Dr. Gisella Perl."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Million Stars***************************************************************************************************************","review":"Christine Lahti's acting as Dr. Perl is the finest acting I have witnessed in my life. Thanks to the uncanny acting ability of all the cast and flawless production and typescript, one tumbles into the cummulative anguished soul and stays speechless and awestruck throughout. This film so aptly corners every conceievable theme of humanity I am awestruck as to how it all was accomplished. Lahti's acting defies Hollywood skillsets - there is a power within her coiling and striking each nano second throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, lesser-known holocaust movie","review":"This movie is definately among my most favorite holocaust based films, and I've seen quite a few. The movie continuously transitions between Dr. Perls childhood, her role in the holocaust, and the aftermath when she is a refugee. Dr. Perl has passed the medical tests with flying colors and has proved her leadership and talent as a doctor. However her license is being withheld because her morals are unknown. She worked side by side with nazi's and unknowingly sent women to their death. Dr. Perl secretly performed hundreds of abortions with her barehands. Jewish expectant mothers were the very first to be exterminated. By taking life away from unborn babies, there was hope for life for the mother as well as future babies. However, the hospital frowns that she took part in such evil, even though it was against her will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Movie!","review":"A touching and powerful movie based on the true story of a doctor's plight in the Auschwitz death camp. You can almost feel this woman's terror and despair as she and her family were herded to the Nazi death camps. Once there, the doctor had to witness innumerable atrocities that would haunt her forever. Only her will to survive, and her desire to help other women kept her alive. And yet, even though she had courageously made it through the nightmare and ultimately found her freedom in America, she had to go through yet another ordeal when a government panel all but accused her of wrongdoing at Auschwitz and tried to ban her from practicing medicine in the United States.This is a must see movie that will stay with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETING","review":"This film is heart-wrenching. Powerful perfomances bring the horrors of Dr. Mengele's medical experimentation at Auschwitz to light. Extremely graphic, not for the faint-hearted. Dr. Gisella Perl's story is incredible. How does one ever recover?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Instrumental album in a long while","review":"I haven't heard a great instrumental album along these lines since Trans Am's \\"Surrender To the Night\\". Hard driving drumming over nice loops and synth hooks. Almost old-school in it's apporach to the synths, but with actual drumming laid down on top of it. Sounds like background music for a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent overview of the situation of the Balkans","review":"This book is about human tragedy, beliefs, pride, inat, history, religion, local culture, and foreign intervention and domination of a native population. It forces all Southern Slavs to look at themselves first as fellow Southern Slavs, and then to identify themselves by religion and politics. The novleist expresses it beautifully through dramatic incidents, which form a background to the present day political situation in the former Yugoslavia. The novel captivates the reader from beginning to the end. KNIFE tells us that history should not be concealed from the general public. Had the issues expressed in this novel been resolved immediately after World War II, the present Balkan situation would not have occurred. The media and US politicians could not have revised the history of the Southern Slavs. After all, Christianity, Islam, Fascism and Communism are foreign influences over which Southern Slavs fought, unfortunately with a knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning novel","review":"Vuk Draskovic, a gifted writer, eloquently reveals the emotional and mental anguish that comes with the gruesome violence in the Balkans over the centuries. Dismissed as too nationalistic by some, the novelist is stunning in his brilliant ability to make the reader feel the anguish and uncertainty of the characters. One comes away from the novel clearly seeing the cause of the Muslim/Christian conflict in the former Yugoslavia and the dangers of political polarization. A cautionary tale for these times of increasing political polarization in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Knife","review":"Vuk Draskovic is an amazing writer of great power. Knife is his most controversial novel, almost banned when it was first published in the early '80s.This is a story about the search for some of the most fundamental of life's questions: who am I? What am I? etc. Draskovic creates believable characters; you will laugh, hate, love, and cry along with them. It shows better than most books I've read that nothing is black and white, it shows in the most realistic way, contradictory feelings and conflicts that cannot be resolved.Loosely based on historical facts, Knife also gives an opportunity to examine the history of the conflicts in the Balkans. Book goes beyond this, though, and talks about universal themes as any other classic. This could have been set in England, Ireland, Spain, anywhere in the world and it would still be as powerful and gripping.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what I expected","review":"This book does not give much information.I thought it was advice by Dr Budwig..since that is the way it is described.

It covers over 90% of the covered exam topics, and well.I only found a few areas where this book lacks, such as there is almost no coverage of ODBC errors. It is also weak on analyzing contents of scripts and ODBC format files such as HTX, IDC, and IDQ's. Some exam questions may ask about, for example, the contents of HTX files, and if so this book doesn't help much in that area. But I can easily forgive this because this is really a topic for a full length study guide, the contents of scripts are a bit deep for an exam review book.4 stars.

Space Quest used to be my favorite computer game. Over time and three upgrades, it finally didn't work at all. It's not like I didn't keep buying it every time they repackaged it. Surely the CD Rom versions must be updated. But no, the word \\"classic\\" on the package is apparently meant as a synonym for incompatible.Sierra apparently named their \\"help\\" line on Opposite Day. They know these games won't play and that's as helpful as they get. They could adopt the strategy of another software company and make you keep buying upgrades. Sierra's tactic instead is simply to improve the packaging and not the product.

I hope I'm as vital when I'm Van's age as he is.Trying to be as objective as I can, this is Van's best album since (at least) Avalon Sunset and maybe since St. Domenic. In spite of what some of the reviewers below have said, I like the organ and his harmonica is the best it's been in years. And what a band!!

Van shares with us rhythm and blues, skiffle, folk ballads, and a touch or rock and roll. The album of 10 songs reminds me of his 1973 album \\"Hard Nose the Highway\\" with his references to the seasons and everything they portend in both a literal and philosophical sense.

Also love When the Leaves Come Falling Down, Golden Autumn Day, Precious Time.I will say that the first time I heard the album, I was not thrilled.

Not that you would expect it, Van has lost none of the Magic in putting together a string of numbers that are uniquely different in their own way, but each possess the Van Morrison mastery.

There are significantly fewer horn charts here (oh, where have you gone Pee Wee Ellis?), but Brian Kennedy is barely present (thankfully). The tunes are finely crafted, and Van's voice is as stunning as ever (why should it surprise anyone that this album charted so well?). Taking his cue from early Rock and Roll, Rhythm and Blues, and even Jazz (it wouldn't be difficult to imagine Diana Krall covering \\"When The Leaves Come Falling Down\\"), Van seems to be starting over in some way. Certainly, the pair of albums which proceed Back on Top show Van mining his past. This is, undoubtedly, necessary for any artist, but it makes me hope he'll find his inner Soul Man again and we will someday be treated with another Caledonia Soul Orchestra. By most standards, this is a superb album, but we ask more of Van. For Morrison, this is good, not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine piece of work","review":"This effort is better than Van's last couple of albums in the fact it's mixed better and it doesn't sound like he is trying too hard to make a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I loved this CD!

But after a little while, the game began to grow old. It just seemed like I was doing the same things over and over and over each and every day. I will not, however, trash the game in its entirety. Especially with City of Villains coming around the corner. CoV is the thing needed to boost CoH and to get some interesting gameplay. So I suggest you get your copy of CoH, learn it, and dig in to your foxhole and prepare for CoV"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Product was in condition just as explained in the add and works perfectly.

Its simple yet engaging prose written from a baby's point-of-view keeps a wee one listening as mommy or daddy read along. And best of all, its depictions span a wide range of breastfeeding mothers, their babies, children and in a way that normalizes breastfeeding and reinforces the concept that breast really is best for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful photos and charming text","review":"This book will warm the hearts of breastfeeding families everywhere, and perhaps win over some undecided parents-to-be (or some not-so-supportive relatives). The photos are beautiful and natural, and depict breastfeeding in various settings and situations. The text has a great message. Together, the text and photos will have nursing families nodding and smiling at the familiar scenes. The families in the photos are ethnically diverse, and the little nurslings range from very young to toddlerhood or older. There are a couple of tandem nursing scenes. All in all, this is a welcome addition to the limited number of books available that portray breastfeeding as a normal and positive part of life. It's suitable for children of any age (my 7-year-old son enjoyed it), and adults will find it appealing and affirming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Breastfeeding Book for Tots","review":"This book is stellar.

Since he loved it so much, I bought this book for him for Christmas so he could get ready for the coming years and he immediately read the whole thing. He doesn't have much experience with kids so it's great for him to have something to read, and something that's written in a way he finds entertaining. It's hilarious when it talks about your \\"model\\" and explains differences between models, but even with the comedy thrown in, the things the book teaches are very helpful. I would definitely reccommend this for dads, and for any new parent because it's a great tool and teaches a lot of things that aren't always talked about in other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute gift","review":"Cute gift.

It has a dream cast of the indefatigable Domingo as Don Alvaro, Milnes as a menacing Don Carlo, and the angelic Leontyne Price as Donna Leonora. It's a palpably taut climax scene,with glorious singing throughout. Perhaps the best over-all version of this operatic war-horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed Annoying","review":"I remember buying this LP as a young man, my first \\"Forze\\". I'd known the opera as a boy and loved it. However, when I put this version on the turntable, I thought I'd bought the wrong work. I never listened to this annoyingly disjointed rendering again.A few weeks later, I bought the strikingly brilliant Price, Tucker, Merrill \\"Forze\\" with Shippers conducting (1965?) and have never had need of any other. That's the version to get. That, and the Callas version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price is passed her prime","review":"I think people should be warned that even though this is a splendid recording in other ways, especially a golden performance from Placido Domingo, Leontyne Price, at 50 years old, is a bit passed her prime here. Her Pace, pace, mio Dio at the end is good (except for sharping the high pianissimo) but her voice in the rest of the opera seemed somewhat fragile, and she struggled with many of her high notes.

They seem to have unlearned the dynamics of uniquely coordinated riffs and time signature trickery that were in abundance on that disc. Oh well.

It shows great talent, is tuneful, one can actually understand the lyrics, and it addresses social issues. Not the typical stuff that is played these days on the airwaves of popular music. I feel fortunate that the rest of the world has not discovered what Hornsby fans already know. This allows us to enjoy his music live in small intimate theaters where the joy and passion of his music is best experienced. He is a consummate musician who can play virtually any style with ease and continues to challenge himself and the musicians that he surrounds himself with. \\"Spirit Trail\\" is yet another classic in the Bruce Hornsby canon.

I actually purchased a new computer with tons of memory to run this game and I still wasen't satisfied with the game's performance. Yes the graphics are great, but the purpose of the simulation (the dropping of bombs on a target) is impossible. In many cases the key commands simply don't work and the instruction manual is grossly inadequate. For example: During the bomb run, in order to adjust the Norden bombsight the keyboard command \\"shift+K\\" is to be pressed. Unfortunately the command has no effect and the player after flying all accross Europe ends up dropping his bombs in a cornfield.The absence of accuracy means the player can never hit the target or advance in the game. Another manuver involving the bombsight refers to the joystick, yet there is no instruction given as to calibrating or energizing the joystick.

After I rushed home, installed it and tried out the difficut training missions it still looked pretty good. Then when I actually began a campaign I discovered the fatal flaw of this game - it is boring. You have two choices, you can micromanage the bomber (too complex for anything but gunnery) or you can sit back and watch as the computer plays for you - although you will have to wait long periods of time for anything to happen even if you 'time skip'. My final verdict is that this was a great idea, but poorly executed. The designers were so excited to try to recreate the experience of crewing a B-17 that they forgot to make the game enjoyable. Also, the realism they try to present through the complexity of anything but shooting the guns is mocked by an extremely unrealistic flight model. My next hope is Europa Universalis..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW","review":"This game was by far the very worst game that i have ever seen. it was unbelieveable how stupid it looked. graphics were horrible, it was boring, all of the enemy planes and attack tactics were the same, and i cant stand how slow it ran, even though my computer is fully loaded with speed, graphics cards, sound cards, and lots of ram, memory, and free space.

My PC is above the recommended requirements but every time the game crashes once the game loads. The help line have proved to be as much use as a chocolate teapot. My advice is to wait until you here that the problem has been resolved through a patch.

The denouement of this version of the opera is peerless in dvd format.The quality and matching of voices is also unmatched on any other current dvds of this opera.

This is a MAJOR problem, not a slight one. The problem is with the original master tapes, not the CD remastering. And no, you can not adjust your treble, bass or volume to fix this, as one reviewer suggested. It was recorded with major distortion, period.

The good thing about these stroies is that they are not read or performed by a single reader, rather, there are different narrators and readers wonderfully acting out the characters of the stories. Another good point about this collection is that it is not like other dramatized version of audiobooks, which tend to stretch and simplified the plot in order to enhance dramatic effect. Audiodrama 101Vol II, while retaining every word and sentence of the original stories, has added suitable yet controlled sound effect.

(4 stars, remember he's not Bowie.)The concert camera coverage is good.The band is tight, and the recording is well-balanced.The mix of concert footage and behind the scenes stuff is ok...but I would have prefered them seperated.

I was impulse buying I guess. The only thing I heard about her was that she was teh opening act for BSB's so I figured why not. What a nice surprise this album turned out to be. Krystal has a great voice and has put together an edgier more daring pop album. Standout tracks include Supergirl and My Religion, funky tracks that really showcases her wonderful vocals. She has original songs and an original style that make her standout from the rest of the pop princesses.

There's not any word in the dictionary that describes the true talent of Crystal Harris (Yes, I Think it's a \\"C\\" She changes all C's to k's!) Songs like \\"My Religion\\" change music.

Krystals debut cd \\"Me and My Piano\\" is a clean breath of air. Her voice is amaizing and so real. As are her songs with lyrics that seem to touch your soul and reach out to every emotion. I can only hope that she is appreciated in her times and not rejected or written off as \\"just another female singer\\" because she is so much more then that.

Straight from Indiana, USA, this young lady claims to be the one who's gonna save our ears. With an angel's voice and funky stile, Krystal came to move on the showbizz. Playing lots of instruments, she learned to play the piano at the age of 3 and started to sing in the churches when she was 2. On her debult album, Me and my piano, you can find pop, steping through soul, gospel and even rock. The critics couldn't be better, and the number of fans of this Supergirl rises everyday.

I saw her in concert and she was amazing and I knew I had to get her CD. She isnt just another Britney or Christina. She's something different and I think she is much more talented. She writes her own songs and plays all different instruments. This is a remarkable album especially for her debut album. I can't wait to see what else she has for the world and I can't wait to see her grow as an artist in the music business.

I'll tell you one thing, KRYSTAL CAN'T. with her ugly spiked hair, you could mistake her for a teenage boy( don't be suprised if you see a girl ask her out!)she thinks that she really famous, but i think she's going through some mental problems. like on the disney comersial, she's all\\" like before i became a famous popstar, life was totaly different\\". see, what did i tell you? if you know what's good for you, you would go withen ten miles of anything that realated with her.

It was cute and sweet and had a great message. Girls these days are really taught that how they look is the most important thing. This movie tells them that their true beauty is on the inside. I loved that it quoted the verse from Proverbs 31. \\"Favour is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman that fears the Lord, she shall be praised\\" Okay, they didn't use King James, but it is the same verse. It was cute how it combined all the princess stories.

A few years ago, the producers sold rights to one of the networks. This latest one is a product of the 'after' effects of that relationship. The story line is much darker than you would normally expect from veggie tales. You really don't get the message about true beauty at all because most of the talk and action is done between the queen and the mirror who wants to 'finish' the local maiden. My almost 4 year old was scared and also the other day said, \\"I don't feel pretty\\" - she's never said anything like that in her life. I asked her why she was saying that and she said because of the queen in veggie tales. I promptly through the thing in the trash - don't buy this - it's just confusing and not a good wholesome presentation of true beauty. Shame on veggie tales!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always pleased with Veggie Tales","review":"You just can't go wrong with Veggie Tales. They have wonderful stories with great morals.

Not so with Sweetpea Beauty! This one is cute, touching, values-based, and appeals to your little princesses and princes alike! The messages in both Snooderella and Sweetpea Beauty are perfect, not commercial like \\"Pistachio.\\" My childcare kids and own boys enjoy this. They seem to like Sweetpea Beauty more than Snooderella, perhaps because of its length, but I LOVE the message in Snooderella and the rhyme scheme. I'm a fan of the original \\"Snoodle's Tale,\\" too. Sweetpea Beauty is better than the more recent Veggie releases, one that you can add to your collection knowing that you'll actually watch it again and again. I have to admit that I find myself singing the silly song frequently with my kids, a strange habit of which I am not ashamed. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetpea is sweet!","review":"My 3 year old grand daughter loves this dvd and finds all the Veggie Tales dvds so entertaining.

I now set the alarm an hour before we want to get up just so it goes off at the correct time. Every morning I have to reset the time also.

Unfortunately I didn't keep all original manufacture packaging and materials which Price Twin requires for returns, so I am stuck with it.

The first problem I have is the LCD is WAY too bright, even on the dimmest setting. And forget about the projection, unless you're looking for a reading lamp. I turned off the projector and cover the clock with a shirt so that I can sleep. Now I've found that the \\"atomic\\" clock likes to reset itself in the middle of the night, waking me up an hour early OR going off at midnight. For these reasons, it's useless as an alarm clock and now it will be a nice nightlight/CD player for my son's room. On the bright side, the CD player is pretty good, for an alarm clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bright at night even on low setting, projected image very sharp and clear.","review":"I enjoy the nature sounds of this model. I replaced one by the same manufacturer that quit after many years of satisfaction. I thought this one couldn't be as bright as the other reviewers mentioned. Believe them. It is. Also the speakers are barely adequate for playing a music CD. The best feature is the projection image which is sharp and clear. The nature sounds are very pleasing. I find the sound of running water helps me fall asleep. The projected image all by itself lights up my room so the brightness of the digital display is quite intrusive. I find myself covering the clock face with a book at night because it is so bright. If Homedics had included a feature to completly turn the clock dislay off as they have the projection feature, it would go a long way towards making this model as good as it's predecessor.

I think it is a great product because it is as everything you need in one product for a great price. The light is a bit bright but for a childs room it is perfect. The atomic clock only resets to the pacific time zone when the power goes out. Then you just have to push a button to get it back to the correct time zone. I have had a number on the light that shines to the ceiling go out, but I am not very concerned about the time on the ceiling that much since I can just look at it to see the time. I think it is worth buying again."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"The Homedics alarm clock is a piece of junk and needs to be re-designed. I ordered one just before Christmas and Chumbadeals, the company I purchased it through (they have been great by the way!) has had to send me 2 replacements, the last of which is yet to arrive. The first one did not project the time as it was suppossed to and the next one projected the time but it would not show the first digit if it was later than 10:00! It also didn't keep time right. You can set the time zone of the atomic clock with some limitations, but it was 6 time zones fast! You couldn't adjust it to correct that problem. Don't buy one of these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice bright nightlight...","review":"This is my 4th one, the first three had various problems within 30 days of purchase.

Which is funny when you realize just how much light the display puts out.The projected display is a very nice option for those of use who cannot see our clocks without glasses at night time.

The women are too beautiful, the lesbian stuff doesn't wash and the gun business is just phony. If you want to see a brilliant example of different stories colliding in an exciting way see GO."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALL ASLEEP or GET A HEADACHE","review":"A little hype for nothing. Many of the lines in this movie are directly taken from other groundbreaking artists -- most obviously Chekhov -- regarding new artistic forms. While the attempt at artistic form was made...the story really lacks anything worthwhile. Enter the world of Figgis and you'll need some heavy duty aspirin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept poorly executed.","review":"Don't buy this. Rent it with NetFlix instead.While the concept is very interesting, the execution is poor. I keep having a hard time hearing the different dialog in the movie... Also, the character are all stereotypical \\"LA entertainment crowd\\" which, personally, I am not interested in their story/life..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run Lola Run, in slomo and on four screens... well not quite","review":"This movie uses an idea which if not new, has at least not been fully utilised before. The screen is split into four parts, each one in a different place in the same city, four stories happen at the same time, with characters moving from one screen to another. Surprisingly it isn't as confusing as one would think. Usually only one or two screens have important action going on at the same time. Half comedy, half drama, this movie should not be missed. Oh yeah another cool thing about this movie is that it was recorded in four long takes, it wasn't shot in a million different parts. The story is rather complex so I won't go into it, but it does involve a jealous lesbian lover, an independant movie studio and the world's worst hip hop artist. P.S. Can't remember all the actors but the cast is pretty decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the most irritating movie ever made.","review":"Sure, it's very innovative: 4 screens all at once, no editing, and one take. Unfortunately, not all original ideas should see the light of day. This movie has basically no story, it is just a 90 minute long take of 4 different cameras. THAT'S ALL. There is not a compelling enough storyline to keep a sane viewer engaged. Thankfully the volume is brought up on the important shot that the director wants us to watch, but that doesn't save this mess. I don't understand what people see in this movie besides it's originality. Just because an idea is new, does not mean it's a good one.This is just one big mess, and one of the most ANNOYING AND FRUSTRATING MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Indie Film - Loved It.","review":"Time Code is an excellent example of what film can and should be. It's definitely an experiment that the affordability of digital video allows. Shot on a Sony digitial video camera, Mike Figgis has woven a great story. The screen is split into four separate quardants, four intertwining, and simultaneous, storylines. I defy you to follow a single set of characters. Figgis uses sound to draw you through the story, raising and lowering the levels of different quads he'd like you to be looking at. It's excellent filmmaking. It is a challenging watch, but not as hard to follow as you might think. This excellent DVD version has an entire other \\"version 1\\" of the film which even features different actors. It's great fun. Highly recommended to the Indie Film Fan. Best regards, turtlex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"Although I agree with one of the reviewers here that \\"Go\\" is a more interesting example of stories colliding in an exciting way, that reviewer missed the real attraction of this film, especially from a designer/photographer's perspective. What makes this film more than worth watching is Figgis' use of sound. The DVD's special features give great insight into how this was created, but the short of it is Figgis wrote the screenplay on sheet music paper, in sheet music format, rather than a traditional book-like screenplay. This allows him to create an incredible soundscape that leads you through the film, tells you what to pay attention to, and carries the timing perfectly. I was reminded of a video installation at this past year's Whitney Biennial, where you were moving through rooms of wall-size video, all different, but with sound moving you along. At any rate a worthy watch for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been the greatest movie of all time...","review":"... if only it had a plot.I give it one star because I admire Figgis' innovation and risk taking. Otherwise I would have to delve into the negatives.Overindulgent is a word that comes to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"Of all the thousands of movies I've watched over the years, this is by far the worst piece of crap I have ever seen.

It seems as if the author has visited Mexico and wants to record her reactions to it rather than create artistically structured fiction. Characters are unconvincing, sentences are long and unstructured, and the narrative style shows little skill. A forgetable novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Novel","review":"Interesting topic. Fantastic setting, but the author didn't seem to do anything with the picture she painted. I picked up the book while living abroad in Mexico and had just finished a trip to the high desert country where this novel takes place.

Tony Sirico from the Sopranos and Frank Vincent from Casino and Goodfellas are great.The story begins in New York, then takes you down to Miami as mob capo Vinnie Marscone (Joe Marino) tries to find the mob's missing million dollars worth of Cuban Cigars. Only to find out that the FBI, cigar smugglers, and the Miami mob are all after the missing cigars. Penthouse Pet, Amy Lynn Baxter has a cameo in this film that's worth seeing, also there is a cigar sniffing ex-Customs dog named Bruno that cracked me up. This movie I would put in the same genre as Get Shorty and Midnight Run. Also if you are a fan of the Sopranos you should really enjoy this film. It's a funny and fast moving adventure comedy with alot of crazy charactors. Too many to mention.I could see this movie becoming a cult classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies like this give indie films a bad name","review":"Poor quality in story line and acting.

The title track is a song about vulnerability while Guys do it all the time is an amusing look at different attitudes regarding men and women. Other favorites of mine include Maybe he'll notice her now and A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do, although every song here is a gem.The first nine tracks are (as far as I know) all originals, but the album closes with an oldie, Breaking it, which first appeared on a Claire Lynch album in the early eighties. Claire wasn't very enthusiastic about that album, but some great singers have covered songs from it.Mindy has recorded some great music on her (so far) three subsequent albums, but none of those albums come close to matching the overall brilliance of this debut album. This is what I call quality contemporary country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"This girl has got an amazing voice. This is evident on tracks like \\"Tell Me Something I Don't Know\\" and \\"Have A Nice Day\\". The songs on this CD are all great, but my favorite has got to be \\"Guys Do It All The Time\\". I never liked country music until I heard this song. Then I bought this CD-and now I listen to country all the time. Mindy is a wonderful artists and has a skill for interpreting songs. There are so many emotions on this CD-songs that make you feel sad (\\"Maybe He'll Notice Her Now\\" and \\"Breakin' It\\") and songs that make you want to get up and dance (\\"It Ain't A Party\\" and \\"A Girl's Gotta Do What A Girl's Gotta Do). Mindy chooses songs that her audience can relate to. If you've never heard Mindy McCready sing, I strongly recommend listening to this album. All her CD's are great-but this one is a classic.

The authors statement of when people talk about slavery in the south in its \\"mild form\\" they should really be referred to as \\"servants\\". That is not history but pandering to the worst prejudices that still exist in the South.

It reminds me of Saturday nights during my youth when we would gather at a neighbor's home and listen to locals play tunes like those on this CD on the fiddle, guitar and haromnica. However, the quality of the recording on tracks 1, 3, 7, 8 & 17 is the reason for my two-star rating. These tracks give out a very annoying hum that seriously alters the listening quality. Music on the other tracks, while delightful in itself to those of us with a heritage in in early Mississippi music, was statisfactory and about as good as could be expected in view of the fact that it was originally recorded in the 1920s & 30s. Other than the annoying hum, I thoroughly enjoy the CD but the hum is a serious defect."},{"rating":"2","title":"never had a problen","review":"Screen arrived on time in g0od condition, easily installed and has been working well since it arrived in my country Trinidad.

Amazon customer service was great about sending another screen, but I fear that the manufacturing weakness will make any further shipments a waste of time. Elitescreens customer service is disorganised and not helpfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!!!","review":"Against my better judgement, I went with this model -- despite its scathing reviews. As soon as I opened it, I knew I was in for it. I could hear a ball bearing rolling around loose in the internal canister of the spool. I held it up, and the screen rolled right out with absolutely no tension whatsoever. Needless to say, it did not roll back up. I took off the end cap, and noticed right away that the plastic clutch drive was broken in half. I put the cap back on and called amazon. Fortunately, I ordered through Amazon -- as the gave no hassle whatsoever. I just packed it back up, and put it on my porch for UPS. They're sending me one more. If it works, cool.

However, I have installed it and the screen appears to offer great value given the price. Given its size and weight, it was surprisingly easy to install from the ceiling by myself. Indeed, accurately measuring the mount points was actually the most challenging part of the installation. The pull and retraction action is very smooth. The screen surface is not fancy, but should work well in low and no light conditions. The screen looses a point for some minor ripples along the bottom of the viewable surface, edge curling, and the chemical smell mentioned by other reviewers.

These unfortunately did not line up with my wall studs. I was able to come up with a solution, but it took some additional time that could have otherwise been avoided.After 2 months, I noticed that the screen did not raise/lower evenly. It was also not hanging down evenly.

The box arrived slightly damaged (FedEx again) but I did not have the courage to return the unit and was able to mount it this way.This is a relatively wide screen (110 inches between the mounting brackets) and it has a tendency to bend a bit due to its weight. Things get better when it is unrolled.IMHO, it is a much better deal than a motorized screen, much cheaper for the same exact screen. The black contour allows for a sharper image cut with the videoprojector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed.","review":"We were very sad to open our package to a broken screen holder.

This screen can't cost more than a few bucks to make. Not only that, but my dealer (The Nerds) sent me the wrong size. I guess at The Nerds 78 = 84. I am going to go back to my original plan and get a good screen from Da-Lite instead.Since the end cap on this screen was broken and I could see the insides, this screen appears to be designed to last for a few gentle pull downs and gentle retractions, that's it. I would suggest if you purchase one of these Elite screens after mounting you pull it down and leave it down forever because repeated up and down will surely kill this cheap plastic screen in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"The was screen was partially ripped at the bottom, on its arrival.

My excitement quickly disappeared when after only a few uses, the corners are tearing away from the pull-down bar. The screen material is stapled to two small, thin wooden strips on the bottom edge. A metal tube with an open slit (and the pull handle) fits over this. However, the staples are ripping right through the fabric at both corners. So far we have close to 1/4 of the material on each side ripped away. Very weird since the pull handle is in the middle and there it is not ripping (yet). Hopefully we will be able to fix this ... not quite sure what to use to attach the fabric to the wooden strips, but will figure something out. Very disappointing. Unfortunately, there were no other reviews for this product when I bought it. I would not buy this product again. This is in a business setting and did not get installed right away which is why we didn't attempt any return through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spring mechanism broken out of the box!","review":"Brought the box in and when I truned it upright to walk through my hallway I could hear loose parts falling inside the screen housing. Openned box, read instructions and cautiously pulled screen out. The screen came out very easily as if it was not even spring loaded. I was not surprised though, because it would not go back in. Removed the end cap to find the end cap retainer block was in pieces (this is what holds the load on the spring). The plastic is of very poor quality. It is not able to withstand the loads that the spring has on it. So, I am stuck with a screen that will not go up. I would highly recommend another manufacturer. As for me, I will not purchase any other product from Elite."},{"rating":"1","title":"the product dimensions are wrong","review":"If the maximum product dimension is 73.5 inches why is it listed as 84\\"??

The mechanism seems jammed or low functioning. Much effort has to be taken to \\"pull down\\" the screen causing a loud clicking or banging sound as the screen rotates. To retract I must manually press my fingers into the roller frame work and work the \\"roll\\" in circles to get the screen to retract a few inches at a time. Returning is costly. I plan on making due until it completely breaks and I will by another model from another company.

Once you get past that you get what you pay for.

Just forget about retracting it, as the mechanism is so frail that it only retracted 6 times, then would no longer go up, and fell out of the case after hanging down a few hours. It is held onto the roller by sticky tape only. Elite said they'd replace it, but want me to pay for shipping and the charge would be more than I paid for the product!

She played a knockout set, and even though we are serious jazzers - it takes a really good female vocalist to satisfy us these days for some reason.The arrangements are witty, sultry and they swing hard. Paula's band is tight. Pick up this and her second disc. This disc is worth the price for her interpretation of Fly Me To the Moon alone.

A great resource to go to when you get a nagging question, or have a concern. Try not to let people talk you out of trying the diet, as you WILL see changes in the health of your pet; many veterinarians that I have spoken with are not particularly supportive. My 2 y/o Lab has a softer coat, clearer eyes, and better muscle tone since I have started him on the diet.

I was looking for something much more basic in the how to and where to get it. I wanted to know more about chicken necks and turkey necks and not the vitamin or nutrient components of them.

I guess because it says \\"All Star\\" in the title, I assumed it would have more actors/Sesame Street characters in it. The Special \\"All Star\\" guests were only on 6 of the letters (Sheryl Crow, Melissa Etheridge, Norah Jones, Larry King, Martie Maguire, Natalie Pasdar and Emily Robinson- I don't know who the last 3 even are). The Sesame Street Characters were on about 5 of the letters and some with hte actors. My kids had no interest and both love watching Sesame Street videos all the time. My 16 month old loves watching the \\"Sing Yourself Silly\\" DVD over and over. I think this DVD was thrown together and didn't have much thought put into it at all.

While Elmo is a wonderful addition to the cast of characters, Sesame Street was thriving long before the red monster arrived and the older, classic characters taught a whole generation of children, the very ones who are parents now.

Our baby is 22 months, and she can't yet sing the alphabet song because she just doesn't have the language to string through all of the letters. But she is able to identify 13 letters when they are shown to her, and I think this video has a lot to do with it! I know Kindergarteners who don't know 13 letters.

I understand that Kraus is a wonderful Duke and Nucci a top-notch Rigoletto. The problem is not with the singers. The problem is that the makers of this DVD/video should never have tried to sell it commercially. The production values are terrible.The sound quality is about a C- and the lighting is a solid F. For example, the scene in Act I where Rigoletto meets Sparafucile is all but completely dark. For a few moments I thought my TV tube was broken.Even when you can see what is going on, it is very poorly lit. There are other Rigoletto DVD's (e.g. one with Placido Domingo as the Duke) that are professionally produced. This one is an insult to the Maestro, Guiseppe Verdi who would hire Sparafucile to deal with whoever was responsible for selling this for 20 scudi.

The information contained in this book gives a solid base of information on which to grow. The book is, at times (often), difficult to read. It can seem long and read boringly.

It is a very well written book. The only thing I would wish for would be to use a more current text. So much information changes in the world of education. A book that is even two years old is out dated in this day and age. The other book on thematic teaching is alright and most likely great for K-12 teachers, but does not seem to be very useful to me at the college level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative but a Challenge to Read","review":"This text provides a wealth of knowledge on curriculum development, evaluation, and improvement.

I learned so much from watching this video. It also enabled both myself and my husband to bond and play with our Son. Rather than reading every month what our Son should be doing developmentally, we were able to watch his progression with each milestone. The exercises in the video allow you to relax about your baby's development and just enjoy playing with them. Before you know it they have achieved the milestone. The hints and advise in the video and the insert provided are very helpful. I would recommend this video and its predecessor Playtime for Newborns to any new parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for SHANNON LEE","review":"Sure the movie's a stinker but Shannon Lee looks great and has some moves.

Poor production quality, weak action scenes, and bad acting make this film not even worth a rental. It is a waste of two hours and of one's hard-earned money. I rented when it first came out on VHS once because it credited Koichi Sakamoto as the action coordinator. And being the co-founder of Alpha Stunts, you would think he knew better than to work on this film's action choreography without his stunt team.

I am not one to read textbooks or non-fiction but I find this writing style very easy to read and I am able to easily apply the concepts. If you have never developed e-Learning but are studying the topic in school, this book may come across as dry and hard to read.

I'm a little disappointed that a book about instruction techniques isn't better written and a setting a good example of it's content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Boring and Academic","review":"I found this book boring and not all that practical.

Fans of the books will especially appreciate it - they will remember the books they read by presenting the best moments from all of the books. But even for those fans who don't buy the books regularly - this book will show you the highlights of Pocket's 20 years in the Star Trek book business. You'll read the best excerpts from the best books. This book will help put the right books in your hands, so that you can continue to read about the hundreds of Star Trek missions that you can't see on TV. Reading this book is like reliving Star Trek's greatest moments. Pick up a copy of this book -- you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"From looking at the cover, you would think that each of the shows would have about the same material included. Only 4 Voyager novels are excerpted, with only 6 Deep Space Nine novels. The main original series characters each get a chapter devoted to them. Picard is the only not-TOS character to get a chapter. It would be a bit NICE if the book had more balanced excerpts. Don't waste your money if you aren't an original series fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent selections from novels but not balanced","review":"Although I agree with the previous reviewer that Mary Taylor knows her Star Trek and has chosen excellent examples from the writing, and has also set up excellent chapters & topics, I have one complaint which makes this a 4 star rather than 5 star book. It is weighted too heavily on the Original Series. Of course I expected more original series than Voyager, I had thought there would be a better balance. I faithfully watched every episode & every movie, but, to be honest, I now prefer the later series. The Next Generation, with 7 years of shows & 2 1/2 movies, is now the flagship of Star Trek. Voyager, of course, is the only show still in production. There should have been more from Voyager & Deep Space Nine & less of The Original Series, at least in my opinion. But it is, of course, enjoyable. My favorite excerpt is from Q in Law. Hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A re-hash of stuff I already have read!","review":"I have read and bought every Star Trek book on the market. I was excited when I heard about this book, and bought it sight unseen. I was so disappointed when I got it!

For those who are serious about building a business in today's global, electronic marketplace, it's absolutely essential the name of your business be strong,well-protected and NOT THE LEGAL PROPERTY OF SOMEONE ELSE.

However, I am launching an online business soon and have been reading a few books on the best way to do so. This was the best book that I have chosen yet. I would give it way more than five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro for those new to trademarks","review":"If you're new to trademarks this book is a great single resource to get up to speed. If you have a small business, the book itself may suffice. If you are going to engage an attorney this book will save you time and money by getting you up to speed.

After the poppiness of their debut album, Schubert Dip, EMF responded with the heavier, moodier Stigma, as they wanted to be taken seriously as rock artists. Unfortunately that plan backfired as Stigma didn't perform well. Cha Cha Cha returns the band to the poppier sound. They still tried experimenting with their sound, resulting in some thrash, acoustic, and light techno, but they definitely realized that they were more successful with the breezy pop formula. They show more confidence in their songwriting skills here, however, and the content reaches much deeper than the \\"luvvy duvvy\\" Schubert Dip. EMF may not be everyone's cup of tea, but they were a seriously talented group of musicians. This is their final album, and that is very unfortunate for us, because they were just starting to realize how far they could go with their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"First time ever ordering from amazon and well the product dose even work. there are some items that are great and this is not one of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase things that are cheap.","review":"I purchased two of these chargers & neither one worked.

The seedless orange is enjoyed immediately without any hesitation, but it's not quite as sweet as the natural one...that was Parliament.

The main character is eccentric, but not in a remotely charming way.

There is the occasional gem of a poingnant, fascinating thought or two, but these are scattered throughout pages of grey.

Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"audiobook","review":"Received in a timely manner. In good shape as promised. Audio book is terrible. Boring. Narration is monotone. don't get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lengthy, boring descriptions about nothing in particular...","review":"Reading \\"Morgan's Passing\\" is like listening to your maiden aunt drone on about people from her past -- people you don't know, don't care about, and who don't seem to grow on you as their story unfolds. The title itself is like an afterthought, tacked onto the final chapter before the author decides to quit. Anne Tyler has written undisputed classics, but this one lacks her trademark zip and humor. But perhaps even geniuses need to have a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dimensional","review":"It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters. Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while). There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had. The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actions without consequences","review":"Morgan spends his life pretending he is somebody else. . .doctor, inventor, whatever. He leaves his wife of thirty years and seven kids to break up the marriage of a young couple and their kid. No comment is made as to how this affects the children--the creep is presented as a funny charmer. If you think divorce and abandonment is a joke you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffably Disinteresting","review":"I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (\`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got through it - somehow","review":"The Accidental Tourist is MUCH better than this. Tyler has talent; how she ever told this tale is beyond me. Morgan is not a hero; he's a bumbling, eccentric and selfish man who doesn't have a clue. It would have been far more interesting if she had told the tale from the wife's point of view. To have this much home-wrecking in one book, and so little emotional fall-out is unbelievable. I think Tyler can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too slight for the emotional baggage","review":"Sorry to rain on everyone's parade, but I found this story too light-weight to work for me.This is a very short book -- 58 small pages with double-spaced text; you can read it in 30 minutes -- and its delicacy is undeniable, the language expertly handled ... but I didn't feel I got that strong a sense of the characters, and its Hallmark-card fable quality just didn't do it for me.It's not that I don't like Gallico; I've loved _The Man Who Was Magic_ (Amazon doesn't even LIST it, in or out of print!), and have just finished _Mrs. 'Arris Goes To Paris_ (for which I will shortly compose a rave review). But this one did not do the job. Too allusive, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgetable","review":"This book is one of my most favorites. The story is incredibley touching.

During the lunch break they played a reading of the Snow Goose by Ruth Cracknell. And as I kept dipping down in the hills past Whittlesea I would keep losing reception, reconnectig again on the rise.In the end I stopped my car on a hill looking out over Bass Strait just to listen.It is a beautiful story, one that should be read out loud, respectfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"saw it at the IMAX theater in Raleigh","review":"Excellent production! I saw this at the IMAX theater in Raleigh, NC.A unique back and forth between research, on site locations where Vincent painted, and acting of various scenes. The close-ups of brushstrokes are so vivid you can feel them in your mind. And then to have the painting(s) at the same geographic sites in France gives a sense of what Vincent was feeling when he created some of his masterpieces.My only wish was that the film was longer, but IMAX films tend to be short."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, boring,,,truly awful","review":"Yes, there are some nice lingering shots over the beautiful works of Van Gogh. But from start to finish this film is a big dud, a pretentious bore, with a meaningless focus on the film director and some research woman. The asinine voice of Van Gogh speaking from ...well, where is he speaking from..looks on as the director makes this film. It was a dumb way to frame the movie and it just doesn't work. There are a handful of interesting points about the paintings. I wish I could give this negative stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinky","review":"One of the kinkier offerings by elite German power metallers Helloween, and their first for Nuclear Blast. Overall, a good album that should please long time fans of the group. Key tracks are: Mr. Torture, Mirror Mirror and Salvation. A typical Helloween album, I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album!","review":"When someone mentioned power metal, three bands come out of my mind: Helloween, Accept and Scanner. These bands are the purveyors of aggro-melodic music. But Helloween sticks out like a sore thumb. Many bands have attempted or imitate thier style, but in a long run, they became boring. I've been a Helloween fan since Kai was still singing for them. OK, no more comparison who's the better singer. I could never imagine Mike Kiske singing on this album. Andi Deris is a perfect replacement, he may not have the same range as Kiske, but he gave the vocal part a new direction. The Dark Ride itself is a marvelous concotction of aggro-melodic and darker tones mixed into one album. I do think this surpasses \\"Time of the Oath\\" in a million ways. Mature songwriting, excellent showcase of talent. A must-buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Ride","review":"'The Dark Ride' takes a turn from the 'happy' music they played on earlier albums, But it is a definate good turn. With songs like \\"If I Could Fly\\",\\"Escalation 666\\",and \\"Mirror Mirror\\" makes this album an instant classic.Andi Deris singing in this album is simply amazing. Just because it has lower record sales than others, Dosent mean its not good, And it dosent mean you shouldnt buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 3 and a half stars","review":"this is good. It is much heavier than old helloween, as most reviewers pointed out, and i think it is a change for the better. Some songs do chug away at the power chords too much (song 4 (i think) being the prime example of this) The best part IS the guitar riffs at 2:25 of track 10, it is great! We want more of this! though it doesn't compare to yngwie, as another reviewer said, it is very clean and interesting, one of the more catchy riffs i've heard helloween, or any other band for that matter do. Once i heard it i immediately picked up my guitar and didn't listen to another song until i figured it out. good stuff. It is not 5 star material though because there is some filler. Some songs just seem to be there, not really grabbing your attention as you wait for the next brilliant moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER AVERAGE RELEASE","review":"It seems to me that Kai Hansen's Gamma Ray and Michael Weikath's Helloween are on a race to see who release the most predictable albuns... The well went dry a long time ago for Helloween, but they still must pay their bills... so they keep releasing this weak \\"metal\\" albuns, utterly boring. OF course Grapow and KUsch are great musicians. But Deris voice is horrible, Weikath's mechanical playing is atrocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"another religion-oriented album by this long time metal band","review":"well, the bad news is that Helloween is still on the preachy religion kick that they had emphasised on Better Than Raw, the good news is that Helloween is still greatly talented instrumentally. While in this Andi Deris era of Helloween, the great music they put out on Master of the Rings and Time of the Oath has disappeared for the past three albums (Better Than Raw, Metal Jukebox, and The Dark Ride). There are some cool instrumental moments on this album, such a very fast drums, stacatto guitars and Andi Deris doing a Grave Digger vocal impression on one song. There are still a couple of good songs on this album, and if you're a really a fanatic you can pick it up, but while I respect that some members of the band are religious, they really should lay off on shoving it down our thrats on every single song, and so with the lyrical content, and the somewhat weak melodies, I cannot honestly recommend it as a solid album here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker and better than ever","review":"In my opinion the best helloween album released up to date. Mr. torture, We damn the night, I live for your pain, Salvation, The dark ride (great power metal masterpieces, typical from helloween), Inmortal (one of the two ballads on the CD) are the best this CD has to offer and some of the best the band has to offer as well. Helloween's sound changes with Andy Deris takeover on vocals. And he does kinda great job: their sound is now more darker and more powerful than before. Either buy or download it. If you liked Keeper of the seven keys, The time of the oath, Walls of Jericho or Master of the Rings, you are gonna love The Dark Ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but great","review":"A strong recording with a symphonic Rhapsody element in it.The songs have a heavier gritter darker edge than the usual Helloween material.To me, in order to stop going stale, Helloween needed to make a different sounding recording, much like they did with Pink Bubbles go ApeThere is not much difference between the songs ala Better than Raw.Never the less, if the line up had of remained intact, I am sure both of the quality elements in the Dark Ride and Better than Raw would have turned up, producing something amazing.Out of 10 it gets 9 for a heavy metal recording, but 7/10 for a Helloween recordingBy the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD.

(The Capitol Hill Hyatt where we stayed had free maps that were okay, but not as detailed and as easy to follow as the Streetwise map.) We walked about 5 miles one day with the map as our guide and not once were we the least bit confused about where we were or how to get to where we wanted to go next. When out alone walking with the map in my back pocket, usually for walks of a mile or more, then too it was the perfect guide, including at night (I carry a tinyFenix LED Flashlight).I grew up in NYC and got spoiled by the relatively easy to follow layout; you got your numbered avenues and streets.

The playful \\"Only a Whisper\\" and dancy \\"The Other Side of This Kiss\\" add to the album's spirit as \\"The Fine Art of Holding a Woman\\" adds to its raw emotion. I can not stress enough what a fabulous album this is. One listen to \\"Long, Long Time\\" was enough to bring me to tears. \\"You'll Never Know\\" is a classic I'll-never-get-over-you song, while \\"Cross Against the Moon\\" speaks of rebellion rising in a pastor's daughter.

(And studying logic, I've seen my fair share.) If you want to learn formalized elementary logic, I would suggest going with one of the classics. This piece of junk, written by Richard Jeffrey, had me reeling in pain from page one to the index. His examples are boring and silly, his writing is pretentious and haughty, his problems are mindnumbing and from another era. The whole time you read this book, you wish you were sitting in the dentist's chair getting your wisdom teeth out, because that would be a less painful experience. The way that Jeffrey goes about solving problems is archaeic ... I wonder if Jeffrey has ever read a real logic book in his life. His examples leave you constantly asking \\"What?\\".

The book itself reads as if it was not fully finished. Characters appear, are described and given backstory, and then don't have any real role. (e.g. Jim who is followed for several chapters but who's only real role in the book is to bring the protagonist and the department head together for the fizzle of a confrontation at close).

The melodies & hooks are memorable after the first listen and deep enough to discover nuances with each play. What is most impressive is Jim's ability to match his vocal style to the material. He can sound like Marty Stuart on one song, Randy Travis the next and then swing over to George Jones.

PLEASE, I'm begging you to ignore these other reviews and understand this movie sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY! Bat-tub","review":"Thats what my 3yr old son says at least onec a day. My 4yr old daughter then starts dancing. I can't thank Mr. Lithgow enough for remembering these songs from his and MY! childhood(but I'm only 31). Triplets is great but my mom and I are still trying to remember the movie it was in. And after having this CD for a month I still cry when I sing \\"Inchworm\\" it is truely my favorite song in the world. You know a CD is wonderful when you wakeup and go to sleep singing lyrics over and over. It is kind of frightening that the songs are for kids but I guess thats part of being a Mom and a lover of weird music. If your kids don't love this CD you can send me the extra copies. I have a feeling that I'll be listening to this music when my kids are in college! MOMS-Its great for houswork."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing next to a sandwich","review":"I bought this for my wife to play for my 6 month while driving in the minivan. Next thing I know is that I can (and do!) sing along to every song. I am 31 and this is my favorite album (next to my Lyle Lovett cd's). I have given this cd as a gift to all of child bearing friends (I'm up to four copies)! You can't not love this cd. Every song is a favorite of mine. Cheers to John Lithgow!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stop, please!","review":"These songs have too many words and John Lithgow\\"s voice goes a mile a minute. He sounds like Ethel Merman in a hurry.

The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults. But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old. I wouldn't bring this CD into your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment","review":"I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD. We were barely able to make it through one listening. This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music. The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling. It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent lyrics to sing along with children","review":"We bought this CD for our baby and really appreciate the selection of songs. Unlike so much repetitive, annoying children's fare, this CD is interesting to adults as well as children. John Lithgow is always funny, and this display of his talent is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun cd for all ages!","review":"The whole family loves this cd. The songs are cute, and cleverly performed. Lithgow is so silly, now all we need is a video to go with these songs!Also, if your small children like this cd, check out the book 'A You're Adorable' by Martha Alexander. The illustrations correspond to the cute song, one of our favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD John Lithgow Singin' in the Bathtub","review":"Excellent service, very quick response, item in A-1 condition. Very pleased and will purchase again from this vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"We can't sit still when this CD is playing!","review":"Lithgow uses fun voice inflections and timing to make each song fun. The prose is intelligent, and the beat keeps you moving. The alphabet song and The Codfish Ball are our favorites to sing together, but his rendition of Swinging on a Star really sticks with you. We highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny..entertaining for the whole family","review":"Our 14 month old loves this CD. She giggles at the rooster song. John Lithgow is full of expression and is really fun to listen to. My husband and I enjoy it as much as our daughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy all his CDs","review":"Everybody in my family really enjoy to listen to both of John's CDs, and we are looking forward to buy more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all!!","review":"A friend recommended this album and I bought it for my \\"kid's stuff\\" collection. My frequent visiting nieces and nephews constantly request \\"Singing in the Bathtub\\". They sing and dance to the lively tunes and giggle at the funny lyrics along with their silly Aunt. Their favorite and mine is \\"I had a Rooster.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and fun -- enjoyable for the entire family","review":"I bought this CD for my 18-month old son as a way to introduce him to \\"fun\\" music beyond the simplistic Sesame Street tunes. Not only is it clear from my son's laughter and attention to the songs on the CD that he enjoys it -- my husband and I also enjoy it. The lyrics are very entertaining and the musical accompanients are simple enough to appeal to kids, but rich and textured enough to appeal to moms and dads as well. It is a great mix of old familiar songs (\\"A -You're Adorable\\") and new nonsense songs (\\"From the Andes to the Indies in his Undies\\") This CD has appeal for all ages -- from babies to grandparents, a great way to make music fun for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lithgow's best work yet!","review":"I bought this CD a week ago, and I've made nearly everyone I know listen to it. My heavy-metal guitarist friend was most reluctant to humor me, but even he couldn't resist the innocently twisted lyrics of songs like \\"You Gotta Have Skin\\" and \\"From the Indies to the Andes in his Undies.\\" This is by far one of the best kid's albums ever (and I buy way too many for a childless 20-something.) I hope this is only the first of many children's albums by Lithgow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get This One","review":"This album is great--tuneful, full of verve, entertaining for children AND adults. My favorites--Codfish Ball and Nobody Loves Like Your M-O-MM-Y. I walked around singing Codfish Ball for days. The lyrics for it and all the rest are printed inside on the liner notes. Get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singalong fun","review":"I bought this CD to teach myself the words to \\"A... You're Adorable.\\" I wasn't expecting too much from the rest of the disc. But I got sucked in. This is a great disc full of fun songs. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the song about the triplets is annoying; I always fast-forward through it. But the other songs are fabulous. The Hippopotamus song along is worth the price of the full disc: \\"Mud, mud, glorious mud!\\"Lithgow isn't a virtuoso singer. If you're looking for an album with vocal excellence, try Perry Como (whose \\"A... You're Adorable\\" put me to sleep).But Lithgow brings a lot of verve to these songs. And it's a great selection of fun children's songs that aren't mind-numbingly insipid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singin' in the Bathtub","review":"I dont see what people like about this CD.

In fact, even if it cost 50% more, it would still be my first choice as a starter set for my 7 year old son. The clubs are perfect length and weight for a 50 inch tall seven year old.

This is the perfect size for my 16 month old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great buy","review":"I dont really like this item because of the stopper inside. The piece that's supposed to allow liquid through when your child sucks on the cup is too firm and my 1 year old cannot get anything to come out.

You'll find some chuckles, but this isn't a very strong comedy. It's main problem is that it's so short. 84 minutes is less than a half of an hour. This gives less time for jokes or explainations. The movie is also very, very corny and cheap. Nit-pickers will probably hate this movie. But, If you do like buddy movies (Leathal Weapon, 48 hours), then this will be enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see it again!","review":"I've always enjoyed FEDS, and now I can watch it anytime.

So is \\"Kings in Grass Castles,\\" a brilliantly well-acted, stunningly photographed study of the westward movement of white settlers into the aboriginal lands in the 19th century. All the main characters are a marvelously charismatic lot of Irish peasants who brought their wits and charm to the new lands. The dynamics of the native population in conflict with the new settlers is at times tragic, but the film makers bring enormous compassion and intelligence to the subject. It is a drama, not a sentimental tirade against whites, nor a reactionary celebration of the civilized against the savage. It is a human drama, well told, against the background of the seemingly endless Australian landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Quality","review":"After purchasing items from Amazon in the past and always being satisfied with my purchases I have got to say that my latest purchase I never thought I would be able to get but as usual Amazon came to the rescue with the DVDs of Kings in Grass Castles absolutely brilliant film just another amazing Amazon Quality purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"i'd read anything by horowitz","review":"this was my second read. he finds the thread in everyday, modern life that connects us to the epics. i can't wait to see what he (and we) will discover next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems well made","review":"The loops at either end are nicely stiched and not riveted -- having had rivets rip out in a flash I strongly prefer the stitching.The leather is a substantial 0.154\\" thick (a little more than the thickness of two US nickel coins).Initially the black leather lead is quite stiff. Although I rubbed it down with a bit of neatsfoot oil, I think the leather would have losened up anyway.I use the lead for obedience work on a headstrong 88 pound male Doberman. The lead is easy to handle (once the stiffness works out) and more than up to the task of stopping even an energetic beast his size.I can't say enough about the merits of a thin lead like this when handling a dog. I can easly hold all but the necessary 8\\" to 12\\" when heeling the dog and yet quickly go to 6' long when working on stays, recalls or jumping.It remains to be seen how this lead holds up on the long term, but at the moment I'm optimistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumps in logic","review":"The author, like many writings on religion, seems to use ceratin passages to back up her own opinion and discount passages that don't suit her agenda. I admit my own biases come into play here as well. I found some definite leaps in judgment. For example, when discussing choice, she uses the fact that God had plans for Jeremiah before he was born to assert that God chooses to create every person (though she begins the chapter talking about how God us gave free will- which should logically extend to the will to have sex). Not only does she therefore allege that we are all equal in stature to Jeremiah such that text that refers specifically to him should apply to us all, but she is basically saying that God plans rapes and other situations where pregnancy may result. To quote Dr. Paul D. Simmons, \\"To argue that God either causes or permits rape and incest and consequent pregnancy, or that God causes every hideous anomaly, is to say blaspemous and heretical things about God.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't give up just yet...","review":"So I first listened to Cadallaca thinking I would hear Corin's loud, gorgous voice yelling back at me, unfortunately (well, it's not awful or anything but I like Corin's voice) Sarah does most of the vocals. I really didn't like this group to start with but I warmed up to them soon enough. I definately wouldn't call this album ground-breaking, or even amazing. But it's a good addition to your collection. Admittedly I still prefere Bikini Kill, Heavens to Betsy (Corin's former group, and wow do we miss them), Excuse 17, Third Sex, Longstocking etc. Cadallaca is definately worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst CD ever made","review":"When a band can't really play or sing they should try to bring something else to the table: imagination, passion, interesting sounds, good lyrics or a sense of humor. Cadallaca has brought nothing. Introducing Cadallaca is without doubt the worst CD I have ever purchased. They are a total disgrace and an embarrasment to female musicians who have a tough enough time breaking into the guitar rock world without groups like this perpetuating stereotypes of girls not being able to play and getting by on their looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"these guys own!

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic resource","review":"Truth be told, I first borrowed this book from the library, then renewed it, so I see that I will want to have my own copy on hand as reference. It is clear, easy to use, and thorough. There is a ton of information on how to find and use material that is copyright free, making it immensely useful for many types of writers and artists. This is not about profiting off the work of others. Many creative individuals enjoy dipping back into the past in order to create new works, make commentary, or utilize unique visual material.

This has led to me always buying exclusive licenses or nonexclusive licenses for virtually every graphic that I use but this adds a ton of costs to any production project.This work opens up the public domain to me so that I have a thorough understanding of what's legal to use from public domain information and what is not. I love this work, it's written clearly and plainly and with it really helps me understand this important realm (public domain).It really helps me respect the rights of others while at the same time allowing me to open up the world to low cost content options."},{"rating":"2","title":"a comprehensive resource","review":"This isn't light reading or the type of book you take to the beach (ok, I actually would do that but I'm kind of funny that way!) However, for a digital designer like myself it is a valuable resource. I create digital kits used for digital scrapbooking and I'm always on the lookout for images and fonts that are ok to use in commercial works. The copyright laws can be extremely confusing but this book made them much more accessible.I really like the book. It is overwhelming to try and read and understand all of it but I am sure that is more due to the actual subject matter rather than how the book is written. It is well compiled and very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comprehensive guide to public domain","review":"This book is an incredible source of information for determining the copyright status of all sorts of media. It covers more traditional things like books and films in addition to modern multimedia like databases and computer software.Often times, determining whether a piece of work is in the public domain isn't as simple as it may seem. For example, something that is in the public domain may contain copyrighted material borrowed from other sources.

Dave Rubin shows enormous patience in coaxing Honeyboy to break down his style.The sound quality is excellent, although sound levels are un-even, at times. The playing was amplified yet the vocal appears not to have been.

Is this really the same person that directed A Time To Kill, The Client, Falling Down, Flatliners and St. Elmo's Fire? According to the record books, it is the same person, but I don't understand how one person who has made so many good ones can make one this horrifically bad. Granted, every good director is entitled to a bad movie or two, but this is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's right down there with Minority Report. Colin Farrell has been a terrible actor from Day 1, and I was aware of that going into it, but Katie Holmes and Forest Whitaker are underrated, especially Whitaker's performance in 1994's Blown Away. The movie is too short, only 81 minutes. All you see is a guy that answers a phone and gets forced into humiliating acts, and coming clean to his wife. It's beyond stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Build Up - Disapointing Ending.","review":"Colin Farrel portrays a smaller-then-he-thinks publicist in this 80 minute 'thriller'. Although I have given this film 2 stars, I will say that the first 40 minutes of Phone Booth were actually quite gripping up until even Kiefer Sutherland's voice acting started to annoy me. And what made the film even more of a time waster was its rather stupid ending, making the whole film pointless as it really is a poor excuse threatening to kill a guy to, in effect, 'teach him a lesson'.Not that the acting was bad or charatcers annoying, its the screenplay that was poorly written, especially for Kiefer Sutherland. Attempting to make him out to be this psychopath, towards the end, you actually think it is in fact a comedian (a bad one at that) whose aquired a rifle and is having fun toying with this guy in a phone box.For Colin Farrel fans, you may as well see this, but for those who hate anti-climax's, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable movie","review":"I'm not sure why this movie got such good reviews.

But the movie made money at the theater.I wouldn't recommend it because I'm sure you;ve seen something similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 of 5","review":"It's dialogue between a guy in a phone booth and his potential murderer that holds this movie together. The guy; a publicist who deceives people for a living; has a wife and a secret girlfriend whose lives are also on the line. At-least that's what the guy on the line tells him. He also says that if he leaves the booth, he'll shoot him from one of the windows in one of the buildings hovering above. To show he's really there, he takes a shot at a toy robot just outside the booth.It's a clever and captivating concept, and the plot, which seems to run in real time, sticks with it all the way to the end. Almost every scene takes place at the phone booth with a frequent array of shaky zoom shots and split screening for visual stimulation. But the gunman's motive is weak; he claims to be motivated by morality; and he doesn't really demand anything in exchange for his victim's life. So the mind game he plays starts to get a little redundant after a while.marcellee.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Film!","review":"I really loved this movie. I had expected very little except filthy language because of the poor reviews listed. Sometimes I wished I had believed the reviews and stayed away, but this was one time I was pleasantly surprised. From the opening shot, I was drawn in and followed each scene with the highest interest. I enjoyed the characters, and felt I knew enough about them to get the most from this film. Under the circumstances, I thought the main character's bad language fit the pressure of his situation, and was not excessive.The pace was quick, and I enjoyed it. Even though the story takes place mostly in the phone booth, the story was more exciting and involving than many movies with multiple changes of place.Take a chance and see this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was different......","review":"I liked 'Phone Booth' but anyone could of played Colin Farells part. Although he does do a great job. The movie was some-what of a thriller, not really suspenseful, but very entertaining! A movie worth watching, just too much vulgar language for my tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tearjerker","review":"Perhaps that isn't the first word that comes to mind as you saw previews for this movie. It looks innovative, suspenseful & dramatic, but a tearjerker? Well, I lost it. This movie does take place in a phone booth and it does have action and drama and suspense but above all it has heart. And the cast. Colin Farrell rocks. The dude carries this movie. The message of the movie is also awesome and the it gives you some thought provoking stuff to talk about after the movie. See it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A forgettable movie","review":"Hardly worth a rental. I wouldn't own it or watch it again. It had a made for TV feel to it. It was very farfetched.

The whole time through the movie he was standing in the PHONE BOOTH. That was so stupid.

I selected this movie to allow my 3, 5, and 9 year old children to have a cultural awareness of the hubbub of New york City life. It was but a learning experience, which turned it not something far more.This film is an outrage. Earplugs were neccessary to shelter my babies' ears from the vulgar dialects. Slanderous, primitive, adn vile, this movie fails to meet the standard levels of human decency. I regret showing it to my children, who now know a variety of curse words, but it is not my fault! It's the movies'!HMPH!(ha just kidding. That was just a joke. I'm no mother! Ha ha! I got you real good! No, but seriously, this movie is awful. The cursing was unneccessary and the acting adn story were of failing proportions. Pick another one.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What could have been?","review":"As with many other films, Phone Booth fell short on its potential. Instead of expanding the horizons of the movie, the director(Joel Schumacher)decided to cut the film in half. Don't get me wrong, I was on pins and needles waiting to see what was going to happen next. But at the conclusion of the movie, I looked at my watch and noticed that it was only 88 minutes long. Katie Holmes' character was a waste at best. I kept waiting to see why the hell she was in the movie at all. However the two main stars ( Colin Farrell and Keifer Sutherland) were superb. Keifer had me forget about his day job ( the hero on 24). He was back to his evil ways, just where he is at his best. Colin Farrell seems to be getting stronger as an actor but he needs to do a movie that will let him spread his wings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy little thriller","review":"Joel Schumacher has directed some real stinkers (Batman & Robin) as well as some minor classics (Falling Down). Phone Booth falls into the latter category and is well worth getting.OK the plot is very sparse, but what there is is well scripted by Larry Cohen. The film is short (81m) and packs a big punch in that time. The best thing about it is \\"the caller\\". Unlike all other sinister phone call films I have seen, the callers voice is crystal clear and this adds another dimension (even if it is a bit unreal).The confessional aspect of the film didn't quite work for me, and there were parts of the final 1/3 of the film that I found a bit contrived. However, the final couple of minutes were a brilliant surprise, especially if you haven't worked out who the actor is playing the caller! You might want to rent it first in case its not your sort of film, but I recommend it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I was surprised this movie is as good as it is:) Colin Farrell does a great job and it is nice change to see a movie that is all dialouge instead of relying so much on special effects. 4 1/2 stars. Katie Holmes seems to be trying to imitate Britney Spears voice which I find her really irritating but other than that...don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use this Phonebooth","review":"I rented this movie with a bunch of diffrent and mixed reviews.One person told me it [was bad].The other person told me it was great.The other person said she would rather be in a wheel chair the rest of her life than see this movie again.I say This movie was terrific.Colin Farrell gives an electrifying performance asStu Shepard a publicist who is a typical lyer.He is married to a woman named Kelly and has a girlfriend who he calls from thePhonebooth each morning.One day he walks into the phonebooth to call her and he hangs up after talking to her.The phoen begins to ring.He picks it up and begins to talk to a sniper played byKiefer Sutherland (who isn't seen until the end).When a strip club manager is shot by the sniper the cops believe its him.One of the cops played by Forest Whitaker figures out whats goin on.But I don't want to give the movie away.My suggestion to you see this movie.You will be in for a wild ride"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone Booth - Enticing Idea Falls Short, Rings Hollow","review":"This film has a good cast, solid performances, and an interesting idea to launch the story. Unfortunately, the plot is thin, too short (less than 90 minutes for a live action movie!), and depends mostly upon the verbal dialogue of a character who is not on screen until the last moments of the film. It also has a somewhat dark ending which may disappoint many viewers (though I think the ending is actually creative by not having a feel good resolution). The film can make the viewer begin to think about the topic of integrity and self-honesty, although it is hard to do so when the character who invites the topic is a meticulous serial killer. The DVD has a wide screen version on one side and the TV screen version on the other, with limited bonus features. This is a movie to see on video or TV - if you watched it in the theater you may feel short-changed and peeved at the director for leaving you hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a long 80 minutes","review":"I started watching this film and feel asleep about one third of the way through. Had heard it was good so re-wound the tape again and started all over. Hated all the crude and vulgar language which added nothing to the film. Got a little past the part that I had watched the first time. Guess what - woke up when the ending credits were showing. What a waste of time, not only once but a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phone Booth's sound is JUST FINE!","review":"This is to Jerry from NJ who put up a review on 7-17-03, who is obviously not educated on dvd.When you play dvd's it's always best to select your audio choice. In this case, 5.1 is always the best default to choose, unless you have DTS. But that's another story.The 5.1 allows for the sound to be split into 5 seperate sound channels. When you are watching the film and the split screen conversations happen, those other audio tracks are going to your other speakers! If you aren't hearing them, it's not the dvd's fault. More likely your home theater, or lack thereof, isn't set up correctly. Best way to test a disc? Take it to an electronics store and demo it. 99 out of 100 times you'll find that your equipment is faulty or not able to play the disc, or you were a bonehead and didn't set up your theater right.Next time don't be so quit to point the finger at the dvd. Rather, ask around, and educate yourself. You'll end up happier about the product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Hang Up this Nauseating Farce","review":"There's about 15 minutes worth of script here.

It plays like a vulgar movie length episode of the Twilight Zone. Colin Farrell turns in the performance of his life as the sleazy PR guy. On the other hand, Kiefer Sutherland fails to be a menacing enough phone caller and that dampens the fear factor in this flick.Given the profound lack of originality in Hollywood, any time a half way original movie such as Phone Booth comes our way, you simply have to at least consider giving it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good","review":"**THIS IS ONLY FOR THE DVD**The extras are not too good, but it is a great movie.*Commentary by Joel Schumacher*Original Theatrical TrailerI dont recommend this DVD, it is recommended if the price is under $10.00, or if you like this movie alot.

I was PLEASANTLY surprised to see that this setting couldn't have been more perfect for the plot. I haven't enjoyed a thriller in a long time but this turned that all around. A word to the wise though: this movie, as you probably already know, is rated \\"R\\", and it's for a good reason, besides violence. There is EXTREME language throughout the entire movie. It would definately not be suitable for younger viewers, not only because of language, but for sexual content as well. Don't get me wrong though, since it was a VERY GREAT movie with an even BETTER PLOT. I highly advise that you see this movie (if you can tune out the profanity and don't mind hearing about explicit sexual references)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone Booth","review":"Phone booth was a complete disappointment. I am 14 years old, and I tried to watch this film with my father. We made it about a quarter of the way through the film and then we had to turn it off. The language is atrocious. The rating is R for \\"provasive language and some violence\\", but it should say \\"extreme profanity\\". Despite this, the movie wasn't even good. A guy is stupid enough to answer a ringing phone in a booth, blah blah blah. The ending was probably okay, but because of constant cursing, I wouldn't know. So if you're looking for a family movie, Phone booth is not the right route to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"This is an awful movie. A terrible premise supported by poor dialog, a snail's-pace plot Colin's \\"acting\\" and (despite my frequent enjoyment of him) Forrest Whittaker's... poor decision making. The cinematography was actually pretty good, and IIRC this movie was one of the early ones shot in the newer higher-def format at the time (2003?).

Collin Farrell gives a good performance as the publicist Stu, director Joel Schumacher keeps things going with a tight, controlled and effective rhythm, but one feels it could have been better and gone further. Sure there are a couple of intriguing twists, the direction is top notch and the soundtrack appropriate, though it ends way too fast and would be more adequate as an episode of some tv series like \\"24\\" (it even uses some of that series\` camera techniques). It\`s entertaining to watch Stu suddently trapped in a phone booth, at times even funny, but there\`s no tension enough to make a strong, solid movie, just a nice idea that could have been better explored.

I got what I expected which was a tired, cliched, boring, half-done plot by a film industry who loves to throw together mess for money. The one thing Phone Booth has is good acting by good actors like Keifer Sutherland and Forrest Whitaker ( both who I cannot believe even thought twice about this film let alone agreed to be involved in it ). This movie tempts the audience with promise of thrills and chills but you only get 80 minutes of Colin Farrell whining like a baby and we still don't know why. Okay, the sniper picks out people he thinks should pay for their sins...we get that but the plot was pointless. Then again there wasn't really a plot at all. Skip this unless you find watching a ceiling fan rotate exciting. If you do, then this film is your speed.

Well... Perhaps that was justified. But the problem with this movie is that you don't like the main character, you don't like the villain... In fact, none of the major characters have anything that makes them remotely interesting. Colin Farrell does a poor Bronx accent and is either trying too hard or not trying hard enough... it's hard to tell at times with his performance. The ending is disappointing and extremely anticlimactic.All in all, it's not a tremendous movie and I would definitely not recommend it to my friends and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Premise, Poor Presentation","review":"Despite the critical boos, I've wanted to see \\"Phone Booth\\" since the previews first started popping up in movie theaters last fall. It looked like a truly unique film; what exciting opportunities the claustrophobia of a phone booth offered to the filmmaker who could take advantage of it. Unfortunately, the finished product offers little pay-off. The script barely scratches the surface of the situation; every character and plot twist exists simply to back the premise: a guy stuck in a phone booth, a sniper aimed at his chest. Nothing in this movie makes any sense outside the play-universe of Hollywood. The cast consists of some very talented actors, but they have little to work with. In short, \\"Phone Booth\\" is one of the more disappointing films I've seen recently, mostly for what it fails to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Thriller","review":"\\"Phone Booth\\" is a tense, psychological drama with excellent performances by Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, and Kiefer Sutherland. If you're a Kiefer Sutherland fan, you don't see him until the very end of the movie, but you hear him throughout. The man can do amazing things with his voice. The premise is rather unusual, but the actors carry it off very well, and it does keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This movie is surprisingly interesting for the most part (except some slower parts in the middle), that has an interesting plot and an even more intersting method of revealing it. Fine performances across the board. For the me, the climax of the movie is where Farrel's character must confess his sins to all the people of New York. This is was extremely (but not too much) emotional and a true testament to the unacknowledged acting talent Farrel has. I will watch this movie again just to see that part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Kid movie","review":"This movie is supposed to be another action packed thing.

The end was a wierd, artsy twist that had me scratching my head and looking panicked and confused as Colin Farell looks like through most of the movie as he saves hookers and their pimps from death and repeats kooky sentences like some modern R rated Fortune teller.

That was the high point of this film, imo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, but","review":"OK, the previews looked really cool, the premise sounded great, but there was only so far this could go and it stretched itself thin.It was entertaining enough to see once, and Colin Farrell is a decent actor, but I can't imagine seeing this twice, at least on purpose.

As for the actress...Venesa Taylor is also hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst than the first one","review":"The first movie has an excellent actress(ypu know what I mean) Venesa Talor.This second has it but only 10 minutes of the film.The best plenty of fless good girls,good bodies and nasty hunks and also the price only ($).Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful!","review":"As silly as you may expect this book to be, as a first time mom, I found it pretty darn helpful and practical. I really like the part where it tells you how to wrap the baby like a burrito, kind of like how they do it in the hospital. The nurses do it so quickly you can't really follow what they're doing, but the book actually gives you step-by-step instructions on how to do it. There's tons of great advice and tips on how to care for your newborn in the book, and you'll be laughing hysterically the whole time. Great for moms AND dads AND grandparents.** Disclaimer: If you have NO SENSE OF HUMOR, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and a breath of fresh air","review":"Although What to Expect and Dr. Sears are nice books, what was missing for me was a book with \\"just the facts\\" no discussion of parenting styles or anything along those lines, just \\"if baby is crying it may be b/c of x, y or z.\\" And this book provides that in a simple, clear and amusing way. It's what we used when we prepared to give a bath for the first time to our newborn. It's listing of games and exercises for development has been useful. And it has provided much needed laughs at times. I love the discussion of stuffed animals and how the model will not believe that stuffed are not alive until 10 or 12 years of age. I'm not giving it 5 stars b/c I wish it dealt with stuff in the same detailed way beyond 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"hysterically funny","review":"This is a good, amusing break from the super-serious tone of most of the how-to books available for new parents. Buy it AND the What to Expect books and you're all set for anything your baby throws your way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The How-to manual for babies","review":"We received this book as a gift. It is great! It combines sarcasm with useful advice for childcare. It reads a bit like an operation manual for an electronic product. I won't say it has all the information you ever needed for caring properly for your infant. What book does? However, this book is very thorough while keeping from being a bore to read. It also provides some very useful charts for feeding, sleep, bowel and bladder function.-Kiki"},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift!!","review":"give to all new parents isn't requiring twenty more words is foolish it's a quick review not a critique, really?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only suitable for gag gifts","review":"Bought and immediately returned after skimming the first few chapters. I'll give the authors credit for trying to convey actual information and not degrading the role of the father by implying they can't do anything right (as many books aimed at mothers will do), but it's just as degrading to the father to have everything about the baby referenced as a machine/computer part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the others","review":"I don't think this is nearly as good as the authors other book The Action Heros Handbook. It's okay but I have a bunch of other baby manuals that were more helpful and much funnier. I didn't like the drawings. I think it would have been better with real pictures of babies like some other baby manuals have. I was disappointed, thought it would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"owner's manual\\" humor gets old very quickly","review":"After a few pages, the joke about this being an owners manual gets really old. It's unreadable. Had to toss in the trash (I'm not even joking)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uselss waste of money","review":"Anyone with the intelligence and ability to get themselves out of bed in the morning and dress themselves is going to find this useless. It's all common sense, and really doesn't actually offer any real information. I also found the language chosen to be very annoying. Some of the illustrations are cute, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really can't stand this book!","review":"This book really bugs me. Okay, we get the \\"joke\\" -- it's a baby \\"owner's manual\\" -- hardy-har-har! So every chapter you're forced to wade through \\"baby owner\\" references and \\"baby as an appliance\\" asides and quirky stylized blueprint diagrams.There may well be good info in here, but the concept wore so thin after about three pages, I couldn't pick it up again. Let me sum it up: this book is not at all clever, funny or enjoyable. It made me throw up a bit. One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soldier Boy","review":"I dont know what the other 30 people who reviewed this book thought was so great about it. I couldnt even finish the first chapter. It was so dull, boring, and frankly a pathetic attempt to be a \\"hip writer\\". I wont lie, it had some good information, all of it common sense. I have 2 kids and I got it for the first one. It was a huge waste of money and time. I still have it, probably because I cant just throwing it away. Maybe I'll sell it on Ebay to some other pathetic fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Baby is a PERSON, Not a Thing","review":"While this book does contain good information, it's presented in a way I couldn't get past. In an attempt to read like the owner's manual for a machine, like a car or a stereo system, the book consistently refers to the baby as \\"the model\\". It was obviously meant to be cute but in my opinion it fails in that respect. I'm very much turned off by referring to babies in the same way you would refer to your washing machine. My baby is a PERSON, not a THING. To its credit, the book does explain how each baby is unique, but it does so by pointing out that \\"some models do this\\" and \\"some models do that.\\" Again, I'm turned off by referring to the baby as a \\"model\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Objectifies Babies as if they were not already....","review":"This book does not help in bonding or understanding your new baby. Our culture is very successful at objectifying babies, young children and women. And this book is written in that vain. An important part of parenting in the early days and weeks is the establishment of a connection between the parent and child. The child, willingly waits for the adult to come to them with love and understanding that says they are important and that they are wonderful yet small members of the human race. We all have yet to take a stand regarding the objectification of women and children in our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"The book is an entertaining way of looking at parenting and is fun to read since it makes the effort of putting everything into a perspective that us people who have never had children, and can appreciate a no nonsense manual such as what you get with a manual for your electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally takes the panic out of new parenting!!","review":"This book may not be clinical, but I learned a lot AND had a laugh. My husband is in IT and it put 'daddy' on a level he could understand;without boring him. Definately a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and funny! Would recommend!","review":"I got this book for my husband and we've both found it really entertaining. I have the pregnancy version of this book and really enjoyed it, so I decided to go with another in the series. Not only is this book full of useful information, but it's illustrations and phrasing are hilarious. If you lack a sense of humor or you're looking for an in-depth, step-by-step book, this isn't the one for you. The information is vast, but very simple, which we found to be better for us, as it didn't overwhelm two new parents. We found the tone to be light and funny; it is written exactly as the title claims: like a manual. It was a really nice break from the books with hundreds of pages filled with parenting techniques and what sometimes feels like an overload of information. But again, if you don't have a sense of humor or are looking for a detailed reference book, find another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and amazingly helpful.","review":"I originally bought this as a joke, but when our son was born we were surprised to find that not one question has come up that this book did not cover. I thumb through it regularly and always find some great new tip. We are buying more to give as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something great for new parents","review":"This is a great book, especially when you just need a couple of options. It's not some 200+ page book that talks all about feelings and bonding. You're a parent now - that stuff will come to you. No, this book is most useful in the middle of the night and you can't figure out why your precious little angel/devil won't go back to sleep! It gives you a baseline to start with and if you have gobs of time to read all those long books that only give you one option and drag it out to the tune of $21.95, then buy them. There is never going to be just one book but this is the one I give to all my friends when they have a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and informative","review":"I've bought this book for the last three friends of mine that have had babies and they all love it. It looks like a joke, sort of like a car or appliance manual, but it actually has a tremendous amount of practical advice for new parents. I even have another friend that's put her request in for the same thing when she gets pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute book...","review":"I bought this book for my husband...we are expecting triplets this summer and he was wanting some reading material to learn more about babies. This book has all the basics written in \\"manual\\" language...he loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Father-To-Be Perfect","review":"My husband and I received this \\"manual\\" at our Baby Shower. All of our guests wanted to take a peek & either said they wished they had received one, or said that it would be a definite purchase for anyone expecting. The way in which it is written, is simple, humorous, and straight to the point. My husband began flipping through the pages at the Baby Shower & hasn't put it down yet! He even took it to work to show \\"the guys!\\" I've heard him laugh out loud while reading it & he has even come running down the hall to proudly tell me something new he learned :-) Grandpa-To-Be has even read it & said \\"Now I get it!\\" I will definitely buy this \\"manual\\" for friends and family in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all new parents (especially for Dads)","review":"This is one of the most concise and amusing books I have ever owned. The information is incredibly useful and easy to understand. My husband is a \\"car guy\\" so finally here's a book about child care that he can relate to! This is a MUST HAVE for any new parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light, witty fun read","review":"A clever somewhat silly book that can be read as entertainment with some good tips lurking beneath. A breath of fresh air when raising baby becomes a challenge. Can be a fun shower gift. Pair it up with a serious reference book like the American Academy Pediatrics Guide or Gentle Baby Care by Pantley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I bought this for my husband before my baby was born because we weren't able to attend prenatal classes. It's a cute, funny book but that's about it. It is easy to understand but it's just the basics (diaper changing, clothes, etc) and not other more important stuff you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"Lots of reading. I think guys want pictures more. It is funny how they make everything sound like a car manual. Was kind of a waste of money since my husband will never actually read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"who says theres no owners manual","review":"A very funny and easy read. The fact that it describes the baby as \\"malfunctioning\\" is great. Plus now I get to show all my friends that I do in fact have an owners manual to my child"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh, not super impressed","review":"I think this book is for the major geek. I love the way it's laid out and the design is super cool. My husband and I just couldn't really get into it. This is our first child and we were looking more for a book with lots of useful information. This is pretty bare bones when it comes to a newborn baby. It's less informational and more, \\"this is how to keep your baby alive.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This whole CD is great!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best CD in the whole collection that I have ever purchased. I was extremely dissapointed when I bought \\"Fanmail\\" by TLC and I felt that it was a waste of money. Shanice's CD is full of great songs. Yeah, sure there are \\"slow jams\\" in the CD, but all of them are still great songs and her voice has matured along with her songs. The songs that are not slow jams are the bomb. The best four songs that I think that she has are \\"Don't Fight It\\", \\"You Need a Man\\", \\"When I Close My Eyes\\" and \\"You Can Bounce\\". I usually do not write about what I think about artist's CD's, and this is actually my first one, but I just had to let people how good this CD is. I am telling you now that if you buy this CD it will be one of the best CDs you will have ever purchased. This is a must buy for all people who like R&B and Hip-Hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shanice's LaFace debut","review":"I remember this album when I was in the 6th grade. I love her voice and it shows on this album as well. The soulful power in her voice is stronger than ever but, this time (in 1999) she is singing about relationships and real life. Other tunes deal with no-nonsense themes that were so much part of real life in the 90s'. Whether on soul-filled slow jams or infectious groove tunes that comprise this album, she was just expressing herself with power, sensitivity and assurance--stronger than ever. This album has been certified Gold. Remember, this was 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Album","review":"I wouldn't say this album is Da Bomb, but it's nice. My favorite song on it is \\"You Can Bounce\\". I think she should've realease this on as a single. N-E-Wayz, Shanice is my favorite singer, I hope she becomes more successful in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST CD THAT I HAVE.","review":"THIS IS THE BEST CD THAT I HAVE. THIS IS THE KIND OF CD YOU CAN LISTEN TO ALL DAY AND NOT GET TIRED OF IT. SHANICE A HAS GOT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. SHE HITS VERY HIGH NOTES IS HER MUSIC. HER VOICE IS JUST MESSMORIZING. IT'S A VERY GOOD CD AND I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess Who's Back?","review":"Shanice rips through the whole album. It's hard for me to just pick out one favorite. Her voice has truly matured and so has she. If you liked Shanice before, you will definitely LOVE her now. She has so much power behind her voice and the way she hits all of those high notes just blows me away. I recommend this C.D. to anyone who is looking for a bomb C.D. that they can listen to over and over and over again! I am definitely putting her C.D. with my other \\"unborrowable C.D.s!\\" Go and get it right away!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this CD is very DISSAPOINTING","review":"I HAVE always been a fan of shanice and love her style so when I bought her new cd I was very excited.Unfortunately the cd is not very good as I found just 3 OF THE SONGS REALLY WORTH LISTENING TO.Where is the shanice I knew?,come back!!I would advise anyone going out to buy this cd to be prepared for a not so great cd.WELL MAYBE IT'S JUST ME BUT I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE THIS CD VERY MUCH."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is Okay","review":"I am not sure that I am listening to the same self titled album from Shanice that all the other reviewers are commenting on, because short of the first couple of tracks and maybe even \\"You Can Bounce\\", the album really misses the well anticipated mark. For all of the talent Shanice possesses, the material is weak and non-captivating. Maybe one day she will get her talent and material to conglomerate successfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see some repitition.","review":"It looks like Shanice struggled to pull an album together. Many of her lyrics resemble her song \\"Fly Away.\\" Not to judge so harsh on lyrics, but if you listen to the album once, you will see that she struggled to have enough songs to fill the album up."},{"rating":"1","title":"with better material","review":"she has a good voice but with formula production and sound this is a waste of a real talent.she deserves better material."},{"rating":"1","title":"no comment..........","review":"I havent heard the album but I did like what Shanice did with the cover of \\"Loving You\\"....I seen her do the cover recently on Motown Live...All i gotta say is you go girl!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"Once again, Shanice has delivered a beautiful work of art on this CD...Her particularly strong ballads are Yesterday, Fly Away and A reason...And in terms of style she is able to pull off a great job on the uptempo songs (Doin' My Thang and You Need A Man) as well...She is able to effortlessly display her vocal range, thus, she has the vocal capability and maturity to be groomed for divahood...However, her agents and record label need to do a better job of promoting her...It would be a terrible shame if they did not..."},{"rating":"2","title":"*The Best*","review":"I've loved Shanice since Inner Child,I haven't heard Discovery, but I'm pretty sure it good,too.All I know is this Shanice C.D. is beautiful.I love it.Songs like Fly Away,Fall For You, and A Reason.Are the best ballads you will ever hear.I listen to this C.D. all the time.It's the best one yet.I read she is back in the studio. Can't wait for that one. Ejoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album","review":"I just came back to write a better review of this album.Shanice came back with a more maturer singing voice. On this album she shows she has matured when she was gone. I wouldn't say this album is Da Bomb, but it's nice. For some reason, the first track \\"You Need a Man\\" was released as single but never as a video. The second song on the album, \\"When I Close My Eyes\\" was Shanice's comeback. \\"Yesterday\\" is a nice ballad. \\"Wanna Hear You Say\\" has nice beat.Alot of the songs on this album resemble \\"Fly Away\\". \\"Don't Fight It\\" is tight. \\"Ain't Got No Remedy\\" is alright. shanice is doing her thang in \\"Doin' My Thang\\". \\"Fall For You\\" is a beautiful song. It reminds of of my love life. Shanice is male bashing in \\"You Can Bounce\\". \\"Somebody Else\\" is like any other R&B song. \\"A Reason\\" has a long musical intro. N-E-Wayz, Shanice is my favorite singer. I hope she becomes more successful in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Shanice- grown up and talking about the real issues","review":"I really like this CD. I had to get used to it, but once I listened to all the songs I could identify with a lot of the issues she talked about. Shanice has really grown up from \\"I love your smile\\". She is really a lady talking about the problems a woman faces in this day trying to be a woman. She is really showing the world what she is all about and I like what I am hearing. If she was getting more airplay and better promotion, I think her album would blow way up, because no mistake, it is a good CD. Teirra D. ATL, GA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Ms. Shanice!","review":"...and not a moment to soon. Shanice is back and got us bangin'. My favorite song on the the disc Yesterday is a song to which I can relate. Shanice steps right in on time giving us a female voice that proves her talent--once again. In an age where many of the females all sound the same, lack soul, and in a time where a true diva is almost nonexistant, Shanice takes the scene and shows great diva potential. The beats are hype, too. This is a good investment for anyone who likes clear cut vocals sung with feeling and enthusiasm over good music. Kudos, girl!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good CD; well worth purchasing","review":"Very good CD. The selections may be a little limiting in display the true depth of Shanice's talent, but it definitely has that \\"Babyface\\" touch. It is a good buy for anyone who is a fan of contemporary urban/R&B music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shanice Album Ever","review":"bought this CD when it first came out years ago and i'm still listening to it today. it's got many great hits. my faves include \\"Yesterday:, \\"You Need a Man\\", and my top fave \\"Fall For You\\". I always have that song on repeat because of the great lyrics and the beautiful piano playing from Babyface. that song really makes me melt. Shanice has a great voice and i wish to see more music from her. I also recommend finding an oldie she did with Kiara back in the '80s - \\"This Time\\". it came out as a single when she still used her last name Wilson, before she became really famous."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHA-\\"NICE\\" to have you back where you belong!","review":"Bought this CD when it came out and, I am proud to say, I am STILL pumping it in my car and apartment. LAFACE made a truly positive move in taking this underrated diva into a new enviroment and giving her new material to work with. This piece of pleasure is totally off the hook and, best of all, is pure Shanice. The best song on this effort is YESTERDAY. There is no one who can kick this track like her, and should be included as one of her signature songs when in concert. Thank you, Shanice, for making this musicholic a happy man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy!","review":"Wow, this gal songstress has indeed blossomed into a fine R&B power ballad recording artiste. This album is reminiscent of the quality standards found in pre-90s soul sweetheart , Karen White, of Superwoman fame(remember her?). You get drawn into an urgency and power depth of emotions in Shanice's rendition of \\"You Need A Man\\". What a trip! The rest of the album goes into the tradition of sentimental slush and does actually deliver a stellar performance if you are fans of Karen White, Monica or fazes of Mariah. You get a funky type of deliverance in \\"You Can Bounce\\" and \\"A Reason\\" will set you in the mood for Luv! It's a surprise that this album didn't become as big as some of the modern day teen \\"white-soul\\" princess like Christina Aguirala or Jessica Simpson. Shanice is a bone fide R&B princess and it's only a matter of time before she rules the airwaves. Money wise, this album is worth every dime.

Sold Out!\\" Yes, that's a REAL Nirvana video for REAL Nirvana fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Load of Krap","review":"First of all, below is my own personal opinion not affiliated with anyone or anything.This DVD does not contain any interviews from band members. I bought this because it sounded like it contained 'previously unseen' interviews from the band, but there is none. No wonder Kurt killed himself. Anyone who spoke to him once in their lifetime comes out to testify and analyze their encounters millions of years ago, probably for a sum of money. What a pity when everyone pretends to be your best friend to ride on the success wagon. It makes you hate human beings.I have to say, though, that the background music sounded pretty good (it's not Nirvana. According to the other reviewer, it's from Earwig.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginning Group","review":"This is the perfect book for the beginning group practitioner. Easy to follow and helpful for those in the mental health field."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Group with Musical Range","review":"This CD includes a musical offering with range--classical riffs and ballads. The guitar work is solid and the lead singer's voice is full with range. The ablum opens with \\"World's Edge\\" that's a synthesis of classical & theatrical rock. At times it will remind you of Guns N Roses. Ballads like \\"Those Lips, Those Eyes\\" and \\"Don't Go Away\\" offer a reminscent moment for those who enjoy lyrics. My personal favorite though is \\"Empty\\" because it just plain rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Team - Havers and Lynley","review":"Havers and Lynley are the best Detective Team out there as far as I'm concerned. They are so opposite, but they work. It's nice to see that Havers takes charge a bit in this book. This is a fine example of an English \\"cozy\\", and I liked the tight plot and the story was good too. Ms. George usually has two or three main storylines going at once, and this book is no exception with two, and she has a talent for fully developing both as she gets through her story. She's an excellent writer, and I really enjoy this series. I can't wait to read another to see how the relationship between Havers and Lynley develops. I hope to see more of the talented Miss Havers in the next books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Scottish mystery","review":"Not one of my favorites, but still I don't regret having read it. I am used to very high quality reading from Elizabeth George. Her thourough character study always amazes me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was Stolen Away for A Few Days","review":"I struggled through the first 75 pages or so of this book trying to keep track of all the characters. Then the book grabbed me. Newspapers were not read, bills not paid as I read until I finished. It was just a great story with wonderful characters. I am amazed at Elizabeth George's talent. I am very fortunate to have started reading this series after it was established so I have many more books to read.The story has been told by others. All I can say is that Lynley, Havers St James and Helen are wonderful. A closed room mystery that then becomes the uncovering of so many secrets is a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to be hooked!","review":"This is only the second Elizabeth George novel I have read, but I plan to read them all as soon as I can. She has a gift for making even the most minor characters appear multi-dimensional and interesting. You never feel that a character exists solely as a plot device. I found myself caring about every character, even the killer! Havers, Lynley, Clyde and St. James are worthy returning characters. Their relationships are complex and undoubtedly have a rich history and a promising future. I can't wait to see what develops between all of them in the next book. Payment in Blood will keep you engrossed (and guessing) until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts as a real dog","review":"Other than obnoxious rich people fighting and actors whining about a murder inconveniencing them, nothing happens in this book for at least the first two hundred pages. It's enough that I nearly tossed it to the side without finishing it, but I like DS Barbara Havers and thought I'd stick it out for her. When things finally started to pick up with the Hannah Darrow plot about halfway in, an okay read started. This isn't the strongest novel. One star for the first part, three stars for the second part, gives this cold then not quite hot book a two star total."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to get into the book","review":"It was a tedious read, and I didn't finish it. I rarely don't finish a book but I didn't finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspector Lynley bemused","review":"This is my first sampling of Ms. George's work. The mystery portion started off a bit muzzy, as the personal lives of the detectives involved sidetracked the actual detecting for a time. I must say that I found the bed hopping of almost every suspect to be a bit much to be believed (and yucky).Overall though, I enjoyed the way the resolution came about. I also admired the loyalty and firm commitment to Inspector Lynley that his friends and co-workers, Havers and St. James displayed - giving me hope that there is more to him than he appears to be in this episode. Lynley's love interest (Lady Helen) was at times disappointing and somewhat predictable. Why all the angst between these longtime companions is a puzzlement to me. Don't they talk to each other? Maybe more to explain this in the books prior to this one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature Lite","review":"Ms. George rarely, if ever, disappoints and this title is no exception. Lynley and Havers are at their contemptuous best while St. James and the ladies Helen and Deborah provide depth and nuance to this classic Brit crime novel.A fine amalgamation of detective story and literature - just what we've come to expect from the George bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theatre, mystery, and love...what more can you ask for","review":"Payment in Blood is one of my favorite Elizabeth George mysteries -- primarily because it involves the theatre world and as someone who has worked in the theatre, I enjoyed seeing her treatment of actors and directors (quite accurate in some areas).Lady Helen Clyde, with whom Lynley was somewhat in love with, is dating a member of a new theatrical production which complicates the relationship between the two. How can he proceed it this case when the result may mean breaking Lady Helen's heart?"},{"rating":"2","title":"PAYMENT is a good read","review":"I always enjoy a well written tale about \\"the yard\\". The play between the Inspector and his Sargent keeps the interest of the reader. . . even when the pace slows. Only a few authors capture the English feeling in their stories. . . Elizabeth George does very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"The title of the book suggested a promising read, but the book itself is a huge disappointment. Its deepest insight is that some rap stars are anti-social. Knew that. But more disappointing, it's silly in some of its assertions. For example, follow this logic from the book. A white woman clutches her purse tightly when a black man approaches. Because of the lessons she has learned from apartheid and lynchings, she clutches her purse in order to manipulate the black man. How's that?!? If there is a basis to believe this, the author should tell us a source.The book is not worth the read despite the promise of the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zakk Rocks!!!","review":"The solo in \\"Cry Me a River\\" is worth it alone.I like BLS, but sometimes the fact that Zakk plays most instruments means the whole cd is overdubbed and lacks true spontaneity(sp?).

A must get for any Zakk fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. Where are the hooks?","review":"Look, Zakk rocks. I've followed his entire career, so when I say Pride and Glory is weak, I mean it. The southern rock twinge is actually pretty cool and Zakk plays some nice solos on the softer tunes on CD. But it always goes back to the same thing for every artist--SONGWRITING. It's just not good here. Too many tracks sound alike and the songs are just thrown together. Track 5 is OK. Rest is mostly filler. Nothing you will remember 5 mins. after you change the CD. Sorry Zakk, but it sounds like you threw this together in 1 drinking binge weekend. Good move to kill the Pride. Now if you want good acoustic and blues from Zakk, get BOOK OF SHADOWS. It blows away this lame effort. Pride and Glory should only be purchased from the bargin bin. ROCK ON BLS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"Sorry, this cd just isn't all that and I went and bought it based on the fact that I love Book of Shadows and read the reviews. BLS earlier stuff is awesome, and I'm into skynyrd and allman bros. and other southern rock as well as heavier music so I thought I'd like this. I don't, it doesn't work. Zakk's singing on this just pushes me away, or not sure what it is but the cd sounds like he wants to be Bob Seger - which IMO is NOT a good thing. Get Book of Shadows, which is excellent, or if you want other mellow metal from Zakk - Hangover Music Vol 6 blows this one away too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birth of a new generation","review":"This Cd is among Zakk's best. It continues the Black Sabbath legacy while establishing new directions for Iommi and Rhodes' heir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone please stop mis-leading people w/ 5 stars!!!

I loved the show, I'll admit, but I expect no censorship when I buy a DVD.

There isn't much diversity in the song selection and about every song is between 4:00 and 4:30 minutes and aren't very different from each other except for maybe the first song on the cd. The songs are really stupid sounding and just are embarrassing. I'm kind of afraid to give the cd STIFF UPPER LIP a try because the song \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" sounds like some of these songs do, and believe me, I don't want that. The only really blockbuster album they ever made was BACK IN BLACK and that was a long 26 years ago.

The rest is just more idiocy... it's about time they changed the mid-tempo rock with dirty lyrics formula and tried something new.

I'm not even going to compare this to back in black or any of there earlier works. There would be no point. It is a differen't time and the band is older now. Take it for what it is... blues rock n' roll. If you listen to it and your foot doesn't move I'd dare to say you may be lacking some rythym sense.

As per normal, the much-loved (or much-hated as there is no middle ground in this debate) sleazy sex-obsessed lyrics are here in full-force (enough so to make Bon Scott smile).

The song \\"Hard As A Rock\\" is a good rocker but sounds too produced (I think their new record label wanted a hit single or something like that; as a fact, this song was on the Top 5 Mexican chart during the months of October, November, and December of that year).This CD has 4 stars; nevertheless, listen to it and buy their \\"No Bull\\" video for a maximum Ballbreaker experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST AC/DC ÁLBUM SINCE \\"FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK\\"","review":"This is the best AC/DC effort since FOr those...

Sure, Brian Johnson still sounds like he has the world's worst sore throat, and we've all heard those same three chords a million times, but nobody buys AC/DC albums for social awareness.

Sometimes a prejudice about a particular commander or ignorance about a particular manuever will spoil the whole treatise.This isn't the case with Tim Smith's definitive coverage of the Battle for Vicksburg, with emphasis on the Champion Hill Battle. He gives you the context but hones in on the Champion Hill struggle as the prelude to the inevitable surrender of Vicksburg. He is objective, articulate, descriptive, precise and interesting in the narrative but he doesn't leave you behind somewhere in the ravines and thickets east of Vicksburg either.This is a battle study. And you can use the book with current photos and historical maps to study the battle. I'm not sure that anyone could improve on this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings an Obscure Civil War Battle to Life","review":"Tim Smith managed to tell the story of the Champion Hill/Bakers Creek battle within the greater context of the Vicksburg campaign in a way that brought it to life. With just the right mix of commentary about the leaders on both sides, ample diagrams of unit dispositions and a description of the action and their ramifications, I understood what happened before visiting the area and retracing an ancester's steps. I might add that Dr. Smith was also quick to provide clarification on how to find key points on the battlefield when I contacted him through his equally helpful publisher.Were all history written so well I suspect that there would be many more of us who enjoy reading about it and visiting the places where it occurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps for a new teacher","review":"I was disappointed in this book as it was just a list of items needed in a classroom.

Thought it was important for them to see this rising composer and player. These music lovers are not really jazz followers but were almost immediatly immersed in the melodic haunting progressions. It was a great night. Next Step most nearly captures the sound and feel of this group live. Mark Turner and Kurt have great report. I love Deep Song as much, but it is a more collaborative effort with Joshua Redman and Brad Mehldau. Next Step has the full range of this musician's unique sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I purchased this CD after reading the review by Ken Micallef. His high praise for the cd intrigued me. So I went ahead and ordered it.I admit that I am not an expert on Jazz, and it is obvious that the people who perform on the Cd are very talented, but most of the tracks remind me of a band warming up before a perfomance. It sounds to me like everyone is just making a sound with no continuity to the music. For example, the sax player decides oh gee, I haven't made a sound for 20 seconds, I better make one.When the reviewer mentions other guitarts like Pat Metheny it is very deceptive because this does not sound anything like Pat Metheny.The only track I like is A Life Unfolds and even it is not one that I would press the repeat button for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued growth for a great artist.","review":"I first got into Kurt's music through finding an advanced promo copy of the Enemies of Energy. It totally knocked me out with it's compositional originality and with the very strong solo voices of the quintet. I really felt a depth and vision in this music that is all too rare among the many highly competent jazz artists that record nowadays. It's a quartet date, so Scott Kinsey's keyboard work from Enemies is no longer part of the sound, but that is not a problem. Kurt's brilliant guitar playing is more prominent that it was on Enemies, and on the title track he plays piano (also brilliantly), rather than guitar. The quartet is rounded out by Mark Turner on sax, Jeff Ballard on drums, and Ben Street on bass. All I can say to a prospective buyer of the Next Step is that it is music of a very high order, and its well worth getting into. The only other relative newcomer (as a leader)on the scene that turns me on this much is Avishai Cohen. Buy this disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I didn't think Rosenwinkel could top \\"Deep Song\\" but this album proved me wrong. This is his best album yet. Unlike \\"Heartcore\\" which is industrious but lacks good songwriting, this album is great from start to finish. And unlike \\"EC Love Affair\\" which is a bit to swingy, and at times scattered, this album has a great consistent feel that still manages to vary just enough.I absolutely love Deep Song, but I gotta admit that even despite my love of Mehldau, Grenadier, Redman, and Yahel, the reason I think this album is better is that the group chemistry is fantastic. Kurt's guitarwork is also much more aggressive on this one. I completely disagree with the negative comments in regards to the sax on this album. I think his playing fits perfectly with Kurt and the group.If you like great jazz guitar, and great tunes, this is the KR album to check out.Jeff Ballard's drumming continues to amaze me.I hope this group of musicians will tour soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to cover too much and doesn't cover enough","review":"By trying to cover 21 years of engines and the full range of sizes, this book is very short on the details.

Primarily prose, there are also poems by ee cummings and Robert Frost.

Before it teaches any signs it has a dialogue with a mother and daughter where they discuss the mothers desire that the daughter learn sign so she can speak to an uncle in a family reunion. Then they start off teaching the signs for man, woman, boy, girl, uncle, etc. I would much prefer a traditional language learning sequence where they start with simple things like \\"how are you\\" and \\"my name is\\". When they introduce the alphabet they demonstrate each sign once and go through it very quickly. I wish they wouldn't have wasted time on the imaginary dialogue between the mother and daughter and instead they could slow down on the actual instruction and demonstrate each sign 2 or 3 times before they move on to the next one.

The text is clear and concise, and it is a pretty quick read. Nevertheless, I spent a fair amount of time with it, reading some sections over several times. Despite the simplicity of the work, it is clear that Sardar is very knowledgable and has much of value to impart to Western readers. It attempts to tell the story of a perfectly reasonable religious faith that has been unfairly villified in Europe and the USA, and the culture and knowledge that grew up in the wake of Muhammad. The author's view appears to be that of an educated and fairly liberal, but still devout, Muslim.

Even the Keep The Fire Burning,best track of this album, sounds weak comparing with least impressed track of the Hi Infidelity. Production is faulty. Arrangement of songs are so random that each songs end up deadening the other. Choices of tracks are not good either. kevin Cronin's voice is mellow in nature so only by tough background music the balance can be kept. The album as a whole became unbearingly mellow for the rock fans who expect REO to rock hard.

Any collection of his poetry will contain the good and bad. Every poet has good stuff and bad stuff, and you have to write the bad stuff to get to the good stuff. Kerouac was a highly original poet, influenced by jazz improvisation. He plays with words and rhyme in ways no poet does. Scattered Poems is indeed a scattered collection with some original poems and poems from his collections that weren't published at the time but are now available in print. My favorite in the book is a biographical poem on the great French poet Rimbaud. He hits, in a poetic way, the high points of his life, and then draws an interesting comment on life. If your not a trained reader of poetry, some of his work will go by you, but with Kerouac there's always an effort to reach all readers in some of his work.

If you are a wu-tang fan but can't stand swears by this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh.... not worth it","review":"i love the wu. but this album stinks. It seems that especially with hip-hop, artists are usually better while they are hungry. Sure, there are a few tracks that are worth listening to, but the overall value of this CD ... 36 by far remains their best album, and this album just doesnt nearly live up to it. It just seems as if they didnt put that much effort into this album. Not to mention that every song seems to have some special guest. Even Snoop is on this album, and while i like Snoop, his style doesnt really go that well with the Wu's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Effort","review":"This is not the Wu's best album, but it's solid nonetheless. RZA takes on a much more minimalist and atmospheric approach to production, and songs like \\"Careful\\" might seem boring upon first listen. But any Wu fan or Hip Hop head will appreciate this album. If you're just getting into Wu-Tang, buy 36 Chambers, Forever, and 8 Diagrams first. But if you're adding to your collection, this album is worth buying for \\"I Can't Go To Sleep\\",\\" Hollow Bones,\\" and \\"Jah World\\" alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviewers are f***ing stupid (2.5 stars)","review":"\\"Clearly having learned a lesson from the ostentatious affair that was their last group effort, Wu-Tang Forever\\"What?? Do they even listen to hip-hop? That album is so much better than this, I'm glad there's 2 discs of it. Wu-Tang Forever is a straight Wu banger, The W is where things start to get weird. Why? Cause it's from late 2000, almost 2001 of course, & Wu-Forever is from '97. More or less there's your answer, & the secret to finding & obtaining only the best hip-hop. Not that there weren't some dope releases in 2000, Kweli dropped his classic album w/Hi-Tek - Train of Thought by Reflection Eternal, Afu-Ra dropped a killer album, the D.I.T.C. cd came out then I think. But a lot of rappers were starting to slow down & deteriorate by the turn of the millenium & the Wu-Tang Clan as a whole are one of them. Some of the s*** on here is really weird, & you can tell by the album cover & the guest appearances this just isn't your good ol' Wu-Tang."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Comparison","review":"to 36 Chambers, Forever, and Iron Flag, this is their worst CD. But if this is their worst CD, this is the dopest worst CD I've ever heard. Most of the beats are hot and the lyrics are on point. They colaborate with Nas, Busta Rhymes, Issac Hayes, Snoop Dogg, and Redman. They bring in some outside lyrics into the album. Not bad at all. Just a little softer than 36 Chambers and Forever, so there are some Wu fans that are going to be pissed. But I'm feeling this CD and I say it's a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 word","review":"Retire....as a group the only songs I like is Careful, and Do U really, this CD is not good at all and I dont care who gets mad for me saying that I love Wu but this S..t is dew garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ODB we missed you","review":"This album has so many mixed reviews It bascially depends on how much you like Wu-Tang whether or not your gonna be feelin this album or not. In my opinion this a solid album. There are a lot of quality songs on here like CHAMBER MUSIC, HOLLOW BONES, REDBULL feat Redman(and Method Man's verse is NASTY!!!!), I CANT GO TO SLEEP, DO YOU REALLY, GRAVEL PIT. These are songs that every WU fan should like... but me I like the whole album. The only downfall is that ODB was serving some time and could only be on one song- CONDITIONER feat SNOOP. this is another good song on the album. If you are a Wu-Tang fan you need to go and pick this up you shouldnt be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finnaly...weve been waiting","review":"I am very pleased with this the latest of Wu-Tangs records finally they have accended beyond the long song with the constant beat rapped by thousands...they mix it up a little more here and i love it.

Any true Wu fan should enjoy the album, but probably won't be blown away. The production is back to the classic Wu with Rza at the helm, which is a must. The lack of ODB is a let down, and the amount of guest appearances seems unecessary.

C'mon Rza you can do better then that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS HOT","review":"I've been reading a lot of bad reviews about this cd, but most of the people who claiming that the cd is garbage are comparing it with the first album which is unfair. The first album is a classic - so comparing any album to it would leave it with bad reviews. The production on this cd is tight. The album just flows, this is the first cd in a long time that i can listen to from biggining to end. This album is deffinately different from the rest of the nonsense that is out right now. The WU have deffinately stepped it up with this one, mixing hip-hop, soul and reggea- deffinitely check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"best hip hop album in five years!!","review":"This album is the best album by WU-TANG! and the best hip hop album since 2pac\`s all eyez on me.

Best songs are number 1,2,3,4,7,8,10,11,12, and the bonus track."},{"rating":"2","title":"MC CONDITIONER!","review":"I have to say, I expected more when I heard the Wu were droppin' their 3rd album, \\"The W.\\" Don't get me wrong this album is dope, but not their greatest. The first track, \\"Chamber Music,\\" is pretty sicc, it's a highlight on the album. Track 2, \\"Careful (click, click)\\" is a rugged, grimmy, NY street track. They came correct with this one. The third track, \\"Hollow Bones\\" is my favorite, an instant Wu classic. After that, \\"Redbull,\\" comes on, Redman does well with it and the beat is clever. After that the best track is, \\"I can't go to sleep,\\" this is a beautiful song. All the instruments playing together in harmony, it's dope. RZA is truly a genius, all production on this album is good, which is rare from producers these days. I just hope they make a 4th album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"takes a minute to appreciate","review":"the album is hot. on first listen it seemed uninspired compared to wu tang forever. i listened again, though. the beats started to meld together like seamless subpolts in a great story. they are that nice. in particular, songs 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 13 inspire. number nine--i can't go to sleep-- is soulful and reflective and strong. lyrics are good and the beats too. the last one rocks as well--plaintive, historical, and conscious. the wu is my group; them with outkast and PE. all of them angry men like fighters, but sincere, reflective, artists fighting for a cause to the backdrop of worthy, sometime turbulent beats. Give the W a few listens, and it grows on you. Very different from wu-tang forever. that one rocked you strait-away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd over all sucks!","review":"I had wu-tang forever and it was so off da hook that I listened to it like everyday. Almost every song was awsome. When I heard this cd I was surprised cuz RZA usualy produces the dopest beats but this was the main problem with the cd. The rhymes were tight but the beats sucked. The best and only good songs are Gravel Pit and Do You Really. So I am given it 1 star per good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres RZA?","review":"Wu is my all time favortie group since 36 chambers.They are the best group of MC's ever assembled other than Onyx and N.W.A but this album disappionted me.No creativity at all the two previous albums were masterpieces, works of art, but The W is by far the worst wu-tang CD ever even than a wu-tang affiliated album.Snoop has no buisness in this album niether does redman, issac hayes or nas.Wu should have made this long awaited album a 2 cd because that made me mad also that it was only 13 tracks.Bottom line is drop cappadonna and the MTV style Beats and go to what you know witch is creative beats and great lyrics.And remember MTV ruins hip hops greatestpeace,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Wutang's the w is pretty dissapointing only worth track is \\"i cant go to sleep\\".

If you are a fan of Wu-Tang (and how could you not be?) you know what you are getting. Straight grimey beats, hot lyrics, and a sh*tload of talented emcees. All of the members flow so smoothly together listening to these guys spit is really special. No one emcee is above any other, they join together to form one of the greatest, if not the greatest group of emcees in hip-hop. The few guests that include Redman, Nas, and Busta Rhymes drop some hot verses in the songs they are featured in but this album is all about the Wu, as it should be. I don't know what else to say except go and buy this album because it is a great hip-hop album and is what hip-hop is all about.My 3 Favorite Tracks:Gravel PitProtect Ya Neck (The Jump Off)Chamber Music"},{"rating":"1","title":"COME BACK OL' DIRTY!!!!!","review":"I am one of the biggest Wu-tang fans on the planet, and I have listened to everyone of their lp's, including solo efforts. So its painfully done when I admit that I was not immpressed by this effort. I know what the Wu-Tang Clan is capable of, especially Method Man and the RZA, but this was just not worth the wait. The songs sound like they were recorded in a basment somewhere with little digital sound use. I miss the off-key insight from ODB too! He was the glue of the Clan. I speak for all Wu-Tang fans when i say i miss him. However, this album was not a complete failure, the lyrics are still fresh and different from all the other \\"Bling-Bling\\" (music thats out)... in the hip-hop world. \\"The Gravel Pit\\" reminds me of the 36 chamber days. The message is still the same. My opinion on the clan is remains unchanged, but I think they could have done a little better on this effort.KOhls"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke","review":"This cd is a total waste of money..i bought this thinking i would get the usual wu tang flavour..little did i know i was buying frisbee material..what is snoop doing on this cd..thats what i'm still trying to figure out.

I think the third is my least favorite of the other three, but It's still tight. My favorite tracks are \\"Careful(Click,Click)\\" \\"Hollow Bones\\", \\"One Blood under W\\", \\"The Movement\\", and \\"Jah World\\". My least favorite track is \\"Conditioner\\". I think they needed more clan on some of the songs, and needed to be a little longer. If you are a Wu head go buy this album anyway.

This album is better listenin than Wu Tang Forever C.d.(2 disc) but it sure is an almost simular to the classic \\"36 Chamberz\\" O.G. album in 94-95 era. But overall this album is a lot more grinding songz just like the 1st album and the best track on it is \\"One Blood\\" featuring Junior Red and makes ya wata press rewind over 100 times. But the Wu is shinning one again in the 2000 era of a new century"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lean and mean is right","review":"This album is tight, and is an improvement over the underrated Wu Tang Forever. The singles are bangin, and a few of the other songs like Hollow Bones and Careful are hits too. In the end, though, this is a great *album*. You can put it in and listen the whole way through, all the songs flow into each other, and the interludes are classic. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five was Conditioner.

Sorry, but I'm not jumping on the bandwagon for this one. After listening to the entire CD, I realized what \\"The W\\" was all about - more money, plain and simple. I'd say that 2 of the tracks are decent - the rest are complete garbage. The grips on most of the songs are so annoying I'd rather listen to somebody scratch a chalkboard with their fingernails, and my favorite member of the Clan, the RZA, is hardly featured on the album at all, save for a 15 second verse in 1 song. Anyone who has enjoyed the previous albums for the Wu's dynamic rhyme style and catchy grips should not waste their money on this trash. You will be very disappointed.

Is this suppose to be a comeback? Well it didn't work. I didn't like the first single, \\"Protect Ya Neck...\\", but \\"Gravel Pit\\" is undeniably banging. There aren't enough songs. 13 songs are not enough for a regular group so why would a group with so many members have only 13? There should not have been any guest artists either. The guests(Nas, Snoop, Busta) outshined the Wu on the album. The music on the album is depressing to listen to because it is sooooo boring. This album is even worst that Wu Forever. Maybe they should keep the name, but stick to solo albums. That way they can work with better producers. Meth has felt success by working with other producers, why do they need RZA.

Sadly this movie sucked really hard.The main problem with this movie is that there is nothing likable about the main character. He's not funny (really important), he's not naive, and he's just really creepy and annoying. He doesn't have any redeeming qualities. He is essentially a really horrible stereotype of a male Japanese office worker (an old creeper pervert). What's funny is everyone else in the movie does a decent job, so whenever the main character comes on onscreen it just feels like he's interrupting everything.

Though it claims it will work up to 80' away, that must be an unobstructed path. It would work 10' away in the house, sometimes right outside the front door if you pointed exactly in the right spot. Very sporadic. If my garage door opener can work a 100' away, why can't they make lamp control work?

Unfortunately, it seems there is a quality control issue with the product. The unit I purchase never really worked even when holding the remote less than an inch from the receiver (also after replacing batteries for new ones). I guess that is why the entire line has been on clearance before.

Actually, it sounds like it is very cheap, and has little to no merit at all. The song sounds more like something Britney Spears or Beyonce' would be able to pick up in tune to a very well degree.

Lorrie delivers this song with enough emotion that it sends chills up your spine. Or the popular duet with then husband Jon Randall, on \\"By My Side\\", which is a beautiful love song. Other great songs include the lead song \\"Soldier of Love\\", which is a song which Lorrie seems to sink her teeth into. Or the beautiful title track, which deserved to be a single.

There are over 20 tracks of music for your enjoyment, so this will in your cd players for a while. Alot of it has it's own techno like feel, with a touch of classical on certain songs (\\"From seeing the rough wave\\" for example).

The book begins well with many an ironic turn of phrase and gallows humor but by the end, Mr. Engel's political bias has taken over. He seems to have a particular obsession with Fred Leuchter. How anyone could link so-called holocaust denial into a book which purports to give an overview of executioners is beyond me. The first half of the book is an entertaining read; the second half a hackneyed polemic."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 years of comedy","review":"What a great idea to compile the work of all these great comedians onto one DVD. Too bad the idea was carried out by the people who produced this DVD! The film clips (even the more recent ones!) are for the most part extremely poor quality. The film clip soundtracks are so muffled and low in volume that you have to turn up the volume to hear them and then turn the volume back down when the narator begins to speak at a much higher volume. The narrative script is relentless and comes off like an uninspired taped colege lecture. It also overwhelms and distracts from the all too brief film clips (which as I said are mostly of very poor technical quality with horribly muffled sound). The overall effect is very disappointing. I would suggest that the company that produced this DVD recall and start over or give it to a company that has more technical and creative talent. This could have been a great DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of pictures, no how-to","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Yes, the pictures are beautiful to look at, but the author does not show how to create the looks yourself. Instead, after every vague idea she lists, the book directs you to contact your wedding planner, florist, caterer, highly-paid local artist, etc. Personally, I prefer Martha Stewart because she gives directions and templates that allow you to create the beautiful things YOURSELF, without having to spend an exorbitant amount of money on a professional. I suggest you save your money on this book and just subscribe to Martha Stewart Weddings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found some of the ideas in it very useful.

It doesn't succeed. Ever since David Mamet burst onto the theater scene, a lot of playwrights, screenwriters and novelists have wasted a lot of time writing sharp, snappy dialogue (myself included). The truth is, sooner or later that dialogue has to stop being sharp and has to actually say something.

The funniest guy was Vernon who was saying his guy friend had sexual relations with Johnny Cash. A tour-de-force of bad camera work mixed with bad editing and a wooden and stilled supporting cast.

It isn't \\"clever\\" dialogue that cracks me up but rather the horrendous film making. B,G,B,&O is the type of movie I would have written when I was fifteen and thought Quinten Tarantino was the greatest film maker of all time. The fact that this is the type of stuff fifteen year old boys would make isn't as bad as the fact that fifteen year old boys could probabally make a film of the same quality as B,G,B,&O. Even though this movie is, in my opinion, one of the worst movies ever made I still have to suggest that everyone see it.

Now, anyone who knows about the punk scene in '76/'77 knows that the Damned were a laughable crew of idiots. They were never really taken seriously by other bands or fans at the time. This is very evident in their first album. The only good songs on Damned Damned Damned are New Rose (a blistering punk anthem that sounds very garage-like) and Neat Neat Neat (as close to a political statement as the Damned could get). The rest of the album flipflops between aweful Who/Stones imitations and just plain rubbish.

Mind you, I am no stranger to fine punk rock. I love the Clash, the Sex Pistols, Sham 69, Chelsea, the Partisans, the Ramones, and every other decent band (new and old) you have probably heard of.

On the other hand, this debut album, the only one by the original lineup, is an all-time peak for high-energy rock. They sound wild and almost out of control, while in fact, this is an extremely tight rock band with phenomenal playing skills. Guitarist Brian James and drummer Rat Scabies shred like nothing you've ever heard--they sound like early Who on a caffeine IV. The solid, tuneful bass playing by Captain Sensible anchors it at top speed. And singer Dave Vanian is a natural, showing strong hints of David Johansen and Bryan Ferry here (before he developed his signature baritone)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRADE \\"A\\" CLASS OF 77 BRITISH PUNK","review":"I was 15 in 1977 and it was heaven on the British music scene.I bought all the classic British albums from that year - by The Clash, Sex Pistols, Stranglers, Elvis Costello, Vibrators, Generation X, Adverts, etc., etc. EXCEPT The Damned! Thought they would sound really cheesey! But this year, my curiosity got the best of me (of course I had long ago heard New Rose, but that was all), and I bought Machine Gun Etiquette (awesome!) and DAMNED DAMNED DAMNED. The latter is a SUPERB punk album, even though it is a bit of a low-key affair (not screeching loud).The best tracks are Neat Neat Neat, Fan Club, Feel the Pain, and It's Allright. But all of it is loads of fun and ATTITUDE and has unique production values (\\"This is made to be played LOUD at low volume\\" it says on the CD artwork!
