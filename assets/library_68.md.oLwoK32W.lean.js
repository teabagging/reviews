The base was way too narrow for her to try to walk with it. She constantly tripped over the wheels and fell. It was also difficult to convert it from a riding toy to a walking toy. We would have to be extremely careful to make sure it was latched, so it wouldn't collapse with her. After a couple of weeks, I left it down in the riding position so she would quit tripping herself on it. She enjoying crawling and pushing it in front of her for a little while. She never could ride very well on it. It was too low for her to be able to push herself. Overall, I'd say spend your money on something else. The little pleasure she got out of it certainly didn't justify the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea but needs improvment","review":"The toy is great... If it had some way to make it safer.

I think it is a great toy for a 1-2 year old, but not any younger than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value and very durable","review":"My daughter is around 10 months old and this toy has really become one of her favorites. It is easily assembled, solidly constructed and very tough. A single catch converts it from a ride on to a step behind walker, and the spinning rattles and other accesories are fun as well as not easily removed. If you want a great aid to help unassisted walking this is it, and at a fraction of the cost of some other more complicated versions.

He's big for his age and when he would pull up on this toy he would always pull it over. He never hurt himself because he never pulled himself far enough off the ground to fall.

The only use we got out of it was for one of them (at about 6 mo)to sit next to it and play with it. Otherwise, they never used it. It is not ride-able at all! Not sturdy enough as a walker. Too bad, it's cute! No educational value. Not worth the money! I gave mine away for free...couldn't bring myself to sell it to anyone. I would NOT recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous on hardwood floors","review":"As a walker, this toy too slippy for hardwood floors. Every time my 12 month pre-walker pushes it, the wheels skid on the floor - they are very light plastic and they do not even roll on our floors so most times the toy slips across the floor with my son ending up belly down on the floor. I think it would work better on carpeted floors but it's too dangerous if you have wooden floors. My son has no interest in the toy anymore, doesn't even play with the attachments on the front of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"We received this toy as a gift. Actually, we received two of them! Very nice of the people who bought them for us, however, this is not a durable toy at all. It's very flimsy. My daughter fell over on it immediately. And what's with that thing sticking out of the back of it? It has \\"put an eye out\\" written all over it. It's not durable as a car and it's flimsy as a walker (there's absolutely NO resistence, so unless the child's an excellent walker already, he or she is going to fall). The plastic even feels thin. There's a little thing on it that spins and every few days or so when my daughter passes the toy, she spins it for a few seconds and then moves on. Definitely not worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this toy is not that durable not even on carpet","review":"I am sorry but I have to write a review again on this....Most parents already have the common sense to assist your child when starting out with this toy and supervise them with it....that does not need to be told. Bottom line is that this toy [stinks] in my opinion! My daughter who is 10 months old and walking along furniture and everrything was walking with this toy ( WHILE BEING SUPERVISED...THANK YOU ) and next thing we knew the walker fell sideways and landed on top of her! It rolls too too easily and we have decent carpeting here too. This purchase was a mistake! I am sorry I bought it. There are much sturdier walkers out there and also equipped with better activities than this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Recommend!","review":"Received this for our son's first Christmas from a friend (at 6 months!). A little too big, and maybe fun to sit on at that age. At 9 months he began to show interest in the toys/trunk. At 11 months I put in the walker mode (NOTE-- you don't have to be a rocket scientist to lock it in correctly-- but you do need to pay attention to it). My son immediately tried to walk off with it... The wheels need a little more rolling resistance to help from getting away from the child- No matter, my son had the death grip on it, and quickly learned to balance/pull himself along. Items on the rear that people fear they'll take an eye out-- remove them if you don't feel save about it (OR WATCH YOUR KIDS!). Not a toy to drop off and let use unsupervised. My son now at 11.5 months is about to start walking-- can walk behind this toy with 1 hand. I feel it played a major part in getting him ready to walk on his own. I would recommend with cautions listed above!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Toy","review":"My daughter has really enjoyed this walker. She really loves to ride it in the car position.

Now she really goes to town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only $19 at WalMart","review":"I love Amazon, but seriously... it's less than $[...] at WalMart and about $[...] at Target.

It ended up sitting in the corner of the room, and he would occasionally play with the gadgets on it, but he didn't trust it to support him---and I couldn't blame him. Some relatives bought him a truck style with 3 wheels and it was much more stable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im returning it!","review":"After one day of buying this toy, I noticed that when it is set up as a push toy, the wheels are too close to each other and it makes my son kick it and lean forward too much while walking. Also when in the ride on position, the handle is too close to my son, making it hard for him to use. I will be returning it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for wood floors!","review":"This toy is quite fun for my daughter but it's basically a stationary toy that I have to place against a wall so that it doesn't tip over. When the toy is pushed sideways on my wood floors, it easily slides really fast that my daughter sometimes falls flat when she's holding on to it. The wheels are so flimsy that when the toy is moving forward or backward the wheels don't turn, thus it just slides on the wood floor.I definitely do not recommend this toy for wood floors as it has become more of a hazard for my girl than fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"We received this as a gift 4 years ago, my son loved to walk around everwhere with it. We just took it out for our next child and he loves it too! It took me a few moments to remember how to put it back together... I had tried to limit the usage to the carpet, but my one year old goes everywhere, hard wood and tile with it and has had no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd look elsewhere","review":"We bought this toy for my 4yr old when he was learning to walk, but it didn't last very long. My son had a hard time using it as a ride on, he kept bumping his legs on the side, the bar was right up against his chest as well which did not look very comfortable. I had a hard time getting the toy to lock in the upright locking position as well. It actually collapsed on my son once and resulted in a cut mouth. I ended up sticking it out in the garage after that and it still remains there. I never even bothered to bring it out for my other kids, I am looking into a new walker/ride on combo for my 12 month old twins. This one just didn't cut it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I might have gotten this for my son when he was getting a little too old for it.

It has been durable, although he does not really use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, multi purpose walker","review":"Bought this for my nephews one year old daughter learing how to walk. Great for that purpose, rolls nicely. Much cheaper on Amazon than at the big Blue store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy","review":"This toy was great. It helped my son learn to walk.

My boy just used for one afternoon and give it some one else who have a boy of four year old and this person give it some one else."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boys love it!","review":"We bought this for our oldest son when he was about 9 mos old. At first, he would play with the different toys on it while it was in the ride-on position. He really enjoyed opening and closing the \\"trunk\\". When he was trying to learn how to walk, we put it in the walker position and it was very helpful. It never \\"got away\\" from him and caused him to fall like other walkers can do. When he would push it, it would respond appropriately. Even when he finally learned how to walk on his own at 13 mos, he still loved pushing it all over the place! We would take it outside and he would have to push it up and down the street. He is now 4 yrs old and still enjoys pushing it. He fights with his 18 month old brother over who is going to push it around. By the way, my 18 month old also learned how to walk with this toy's assistance. In the ride-on position, it is just now beginning to be too small for my oldest son to ride it. Great investment in a toy that will grow with your child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just discovered the fun","review":"We bought this toy for my son when he was 11 months thinking it would help him learn to walk. At that time he mostly had fun just playing with the toys, his favorite thing was putting stuff in and out of the trunk. He also loved to sit on it even though he couldn't go anywhere. We never really pushed him to walk behind it or ride on it we just put it with his other toys and when he wanted to play with it he would, which really was quite often. Now he is 12 1/2 months old and has just discovered the real purpose of this toy. The other day all on his own he started crawling behind it and then he stood up and started walking with it. And last night we put him on it to ride it and pushed it backwards and loved it! I think overall this is a great toy, even my 2 year old neice still loves to play with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"My 10 month-old grandson received this toy for Christmas. It came to grandma's house as there was no room for it at home. Although Jake has limited toys to choose from at our house, he rarely plays with this as it is so poorly designed. When he tries to push it from behind, there is no room for his feet so he walks to the side and soon trips over the wheels. His favorite part is the little green door on the front. He likes to open and close the door and put things inside, but the door is hard to open and once he does get it open, it does not stay open (you have to hold it with your other hand) and so he gets frustrated and soon loses interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two in ONE and he's starting to walk!!!","review":"We purchased the playskool Step Start Walk n' Ride for our 11 1/2 month old son for Christmas. I Saw the product online, and read that one mother didn't like it because it moved to fast across the floor for her little one.I would like to say that he got it Christmas morning, and pushed himself on the bike, and then we moved it up to the walk setting to see if he'd try it. . . and he pushed it all the way down the house! I can't believe it! My son has not showed any signs of walking up till this point. I don't think it's too slippery for carpet. And it seemed easy for his little legs to keep up with.It's simple to adjust back and forth from one level to the next, and the &quot;bike&quot; is low enough to the floor for him to get on with ease. We love it. His first steps happened with this toy, and he will be 1 years old tomorrow! I'm so excited. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"My daughter received this as a birthday gift when she turned one. The walk-behind part of the toy is fine. When you change it over to a ride-on toy is where we had a problem. The toy is shaped so that the sides flare out in the back. It runs over my daughter's feet. If the sides had been straight I think the toy would have been fine. The concept was great but I'm not sure they tested it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute, but comes with flaws","review":"It is difficult to walk with this toy in the upright position. The support bars that stick out holding the wheels are too close together, not leaving enough room for walking feet. My son constantly tripped on them when he was learning to walk. Even after he was a steady walker of his own, when he'd try to push this toy (just for fun) they would trip him up. As a riding toy we found that the yellow handle bar that comes up is in the way of a childs knees. No child has every been able to push it forwards because of it, only backwards. Very poorly designed! It is a cute toy though, and kids seem to like the little gadgets on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For baby track stars??","review":"This thing is ridiculous. As a walker, it moves SO FAST that there was no way my little would-be walker could even begin to catch up. I had to stand behind her (crouched over, hurting my back) holding the handle to slow it down for her. Even then, she slipped and bumped her chin on the (unpadded--um, hello??) handlebar and ended up in tears. Sure, she liked zooming around the room... but it's no different than us helping her \\"walk,\\" when we have to stand behind her. We're returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We like it","review":"My soon to be 12 month old loves anything he can push or walk behind. He plays with this just about every day and pushes it all over the house. Its pretty sturdy too. He hasn't quite mastered sitting and riding on it so I pretty much keep it as a push walker for now and will try the sit part of it a little later. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for learners..wheels move to fast.","review":"This was a decent toy but it is for babies in the early stages of walking.

She wouldn't fool with it too much but instead use the shopping cart I had when my oldest was young. She preferred the shopping cart even though it moved more quickly but she would always reach for the shopping cart first. I still have the walk n ride but its sitting in the backyard. I seem to remember her feet tripping on the wheels while using as a walker. I think there are better walkers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for toddlers learning to walk","review":"Bought this for my 13 month old as she has started cruising. Turn out the walker is so light, she could not hold on to it and walk without falling forward. She would play it for less than 5 minutes and not take a second look at it for the rest of the day.Overall, I would not recommend this for toddlers learning to walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK toy","review":"It took about 30 min to put together. Not a pain, but not a snap. The toy is overall just OK: durable, but too lightweight for baby to use independently. The wheels are too slippery when revolving and we slowed it down to baby speed by putting cardboard near the axle (which isnt a permanent solution, but...). The thing only goes straight whereas my daughter zigzags and wanders, so she only walk a few steps with it and leaves it by the wayside. Mostly it gets in the way of her cruising the house and we end up tucking it under the livingroom table. I dont doubt some children love it, but it has not been a favorite in our household. Something sturdier, heavier would be a little better if your child likes this sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is ok but","review":"This toy is somewhat cheaply made. It hasn't broken, but it is light and flimsy. The wheels are just plastic on plastic and don't turn well. The concept of a non walking baby walking behind this in the upright position is not a good one. They can't do that. and after they walk they won't either. My grandson just pushes it like a giant car, from the side. and crawls up to it and pushes it again. and that is about it. Not much to do for a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I bought this for my son and I had a couple of problems with it. First when he tried to walk with it, there was not enough room for him to walk. The wheel part of it is either too wide or not wide enough. Second when then toy is in the \\"ride\\" position, my son would pull it in the \\"walk\\" position, but because it was not made to secure in by me it would crash down and startle him. I would not recommend this toy at all. My son never played with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our daughter loves it--so do we!!!","review":"We bought this for our daughter to use to learn how to walk. She took off with it right away and never stopped. We were amazed at how fast she learned to walk with this toy. She was walking behind it at 9 months and slowly began to get the courage to walk on her own. She is now 11 months, walking and still enjoys it. We now have it in the sit down mode and she loves to crawl on it and have us push her around, she is starting to figure out how to push herself with it. This was the best money spent ever!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for children over 18 months","review":"This is a fun car. It's colorful and it helped both my children to get up and walk. It's changes from a car to a walker. But don't believe your 3 year old will be able to ride on this toy.

If your child can already walk, look for something bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back too wide for riding","review":"My daughter received this toy for her 1st birthday. The trunk and other little extras are fun, but she can't make it move when she sits on it. Her feet hit the back end because it is so wide. It didn't help her as a walk behind, either, because the handle is low and forward of her feet -- she'd end up leaning over her toes. She also has the Little Tykes Speed Racer and she LOVES it - at about the same price, it's a much better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy for the price","review":"I bought this walker for my 7 month old daughter mostly because it was on sale & it turns into a ride on toy, though I did not expect much from it my daughter loves it.

It is one of those toys that sits by itself and collects dust. It doesn't seem to be very sturdy and the base of it is a bit difficult to switch from a walker to a rider. They need to design some sort of control (like a brake) to slow down how fast it moves once your child is behind it using it as a walker.

It is still her favorite 2 months later! She is starting to walk on her own and this toy has been a great help to her. She doesn't care for the car part of the toy, but the walker has been great. In reading the other reviews, I see that there have been some complaints about the attachments or design. So far, our child has not been injured or pulled anything off of this toy. It has been pretty durable. She does tip it over on occasion, though. An unbalanced child can easily tip this, but it does not seem heavy enough to cause an injury and Veronica has always just gotten up and kept right on going. It is small enough to take along in our trunk and we take it with us when visiting. I think this is a great learning-to-walk toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly ugly and possibly unsafe.","review":"In the photos, this toy looks sort of cute, but in our home, it looked incredibly incredibly ugly. Also the wheels are just injection molded plastic which you press onto molded plastic axles; that is to say, they can slide easily if you have wood floors, and also, there is nothing to regulate the speed at which the wheels roll--not ideal for beginning walkers. We had to catch our son from face planting a few times before we decided to return this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usage for developmently disabled children","review":"This is not a good item for a child who has problems with coordination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We thought this would be a good idea for our 13 month old granddaughter who was just learning to walk last Christmas. But because she spread her legs to balance she kept banging her legs on the side every time she tried to push it. The way it is designed makes it hard for the child to get up close, it tripped her up and in the end it was hardly ever used. It turned out to be a big disappointment and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Easily","review":"My daughter received this walker/ride \\"toy\\" when she was 10 months. She didn't show much interest in it at all but I figured when she rounded her first birthday she'd show more interest. - Well she didn't. There's hardly any room for baby's knees... it's hazardous that baby tries to reach 'round to play with stuff in the front... most kids don't have balance mastered yet. It's also UGLY. DON'T BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little boring","review":"We have had this toy for a while, we got it when my son was about 9 months old, now he's 16 months. I think he has played with it for a total of 15 minutes in all that time. He plays with it for 30 seconds or so and then gets bored. Even when he was first learning to walk, he didn't find it helpful. It really just takes up more space than it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son likes this toy","review":"I had this toy for my daughter 6 years ago and she really liked it, now my son has one.

In walker mode it tips too easily for learners and in ride-on mode the child's foot gets stuck on the little antenna on the back. Takes up space and never got played with. I have twins and babysit triplets and still it didn't get much use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls over","review":"I don't use the car portion because it's too small for my children (my 14 month old is 33 inches tall).The walker seems better on carpet, but slides too much on hardwood floors.

I'm going to have to give this toy up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"I bought this for my grandson's first birthday, and when he got hold of it, he took off running with it!

It is nonfunctioning as both a walking toy and a riding one. As a walker, there isn't enough room for a child's feet when they are walking with it in front of them. As a rider and walker, it doesn't roll very well. I just didn't like this at all. It also doesn't have as many activities on it as many other walking and riding toys. I would not recommend anyone buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is GREAT","review":"My son (now 3 1/2) got this toy for Christmas right after he turned one. We didn't use the walker part of it as much, but the car part of it is wonderful.

It's wonderful and lasts a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"We bought this toy for our son when he was 10 months old. He loved to push and ride the toy. He is now 3 and still rides on it or uses it in the push position as a \\"scooter\\". The only downfall is that it is hard to change positions and takes a little patience in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"moderately entertaining","review":"Our son showed no interest in this toy as he was learning to walk. He much preferred cruising with furniture. Now that he is fully walking, he occasionally pushes the cart around, but still doesn't enjoy sitting on it as a car. I don't think its a particularly bad toy, its sturdy, colorful, and does what it is suppose to do. It was just something my son wasn't excited about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, but I'm already looking for an upgrade","review":"This is your basic walk 'n ride. It is easy for me to switch back and forth, but my four-year old can't do it. My baby likes playing with all of the little noise-making features, but most can't be accessed while walking or riding. I think this was available in a white/blue/red/yellow color scheme when I had my girls, and now I can only find it in a green/light blue/yellow/pink/purple color scheme now that I have a boy. These will work well for a long time, especially if kept inside. When my first one got sand in the wheels, they got too stiff to turn properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An infant/toddler MUST-HAVE","review":"The fact that it transforms from a highly sturdy triangular shaped walker into a ride-on toy is pure genius! My son used this for years until we gave it away. It was still in excellent condition, too! I highly recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Toy","review":"I liked this toy a lot at first. The idea of being able to push and ride was great. But twice my son fell while using it and cut himself. The not-so-sharp plastic edges of the toy cut him above the eye and on the lip, both times leaving cuts that I debated getting stitched. The toy is now in my garbage can. Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"My 10 month old sons Grandparents purchased this for him to help with his learning to walk. However, it was really just a waste on money. When converted to walker, it is not steady enough to help him. It is to lightweighted and he can more less just pick it up while trying to walk. It wants to tip over. The only thing he likes about it is hiding his toys in the trunk compartment. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent walker...","review":"This makes a decent walk-behind toy, but it's pretty bad as a ride-on toy. The rear wheels are set further apart than the front wheels. This design makes it easy for the child to walk behind and not trip over the wheels, but it makes it difficult for the child to keep their feet clear of the rear wheels in ride-on mode. If you're looking for something that's truly dual-purpose, look elsewhere. Also, not the most important thing to consider, but it's really ugly. Unless you live at the circus, this thing will stick out like...well, like an ugly piece of plastic. If everything else was top-notch, I could overlook the vomit-inspired color scheme, but there are many better-looking options out there that probably work as well or better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for riding","review":"The fun parts of the toy are the clicky toys on it and the trunk.It's not good for a new walker because it pushes too easily and runs away from the slowly walking kid, who then falls.It's not good for riding because the back wheels stick out too far. The kid's feet hit/get run over by the back wheels. My kid can only get it to go backwards. Older kids can ride it, but it's pretty low to the ground for them.We've had it 3 years and it's durable. Nothing's broken off and the locking mechanism between walker/rider function is still reliable. My 1st kid never cared, but now that the 2nd really wants to ride it I'm going to buy a different one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't play on hardwood floors but great on carpet!","review":"We learned quickly that this goes fast on hardwood floors. My niece is still not able to walk much without leaning on things so I thought this would be great. Instead she leaned on it and it scooted away from her. We put it on the carpet and she was good to go. She loves it, especially when we push her around on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too little","review":"We bought this for our daughter when she was around 11 months and standing but not walking. She used it mainly in her room on carpet. The toy is really light so in the \\"push mode\\" she managed to build up a lot of speed in a small space. A couple of times she tipped it over. She really seemed to prefer to push around a jumbo sized pampers box. Now she is walking she hardly looks at this toy. She is tall so when she does sit on it in \\"car mode\\" she is too big to push forward - she can only push backwards which seems to get old really fast. Considering all this and the amount of space this toy takes up, if I had to do it over I would probably pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sturdy for Beginners","review":"I bought this for my daughter at 9 mos. She was already pulling up and cruising on furniture. I thought this would be helpful for her to get around the other areas of the house with my help. Unfortunately, it's very unsturdy and the wheels go quickly. There isn't any resistance for beginning walkers, so they will lean on the walker and it will shoot forward. I thought using it on the carpet (rather than our wood floors) might help, but no difference.By reading the description, it sounds like a great transition toy. I think you should save the money and just use an overturned box or laundry basket. Same effect.The only upside is that she enjoys the car mode when I push her. Perhaps she will grow into this toy once she walks independently. However, I think that defeats the purpose and description of this toy. It'll sit and gather dust until she wants to ride on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"Bought this for my son when he was starting to learn to walk. When it is in the up position for use as a walker it wasn't as stable as we hoped for and it kept falling over. The other thing we did not like was the wheels on this were stiff and did not roll easily when he would sit on it and push with his feet. When we have our second child we will buy the other one that we looked at when we decided on this.MRC 06-21-02"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great design","review":"I was surprised at so many positive reviews for this product. It is cute but the design was terrible. the back wheels come out too far so our daughter was constantly tripping over them. also, as a scooter the front bars roll forward so there is little room for the child to sit, plus not back so children easy slip off the back. also hard to get on the scooter with the little purple thing sticking out of the back. we have a tall child so maybe that is why."},{"rating":"2","title":"good toy, insane price","review":"I am entirely baffled as to why this toy costs TWICE AS MUCH on amazon as it does at my local target. It's a good ride on for younger toddlers, and it offers ample opportunities for them to stash their little treasures (rocks, leaves, bugs, sippy cups complete with 3 days old warm milk... etc.) in the little compartment; but don't waste your money here, if you want this toy, go to target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy too Small and Not Durble.","review":"My 9 month old son loves to spin the barrel.

I have a 1 year old as well as a 2 year old and they both get frustrated with this toy. When it is in the bicycle position, it is too low to the ground and almost impossible for them to move. The wheels don't turn, they just slide. They only like it when I push them because it is too hard for them to do themselves (but this gets too tiring for me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this walker!","review":"This is by far the worst toy we have ever bought our son. He got it at 8 months old and it was a lousy walker and ride on. Our son would slide off the side every time he would try to ride it.( we have tile floor...which really hurts when you fall down on) When you put it in the walker mode ( which is also very difficult to do)...the wheels have no resistance so they take off leaving your infant to fall on the floor behind it. This is a very bad design. I think it could be improved by making the seat more square and not so round, placing some kind of non slip material in the seat and by adding some resistance to the wheels. We returned this item to the store and I strongly discourage anyone who has tile or wood flooring to stay away from this item. I can't believe such an item would be allowed to be sold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it looks and sounds","review":"We bought it for our son, and I must say, kid does not like it at all.

However, once he was at point when he was mobile and pulling up on things to \\"cruise\\", he kept trying to walk with this and it kept flipping back. It is just very lightweight and doesn't really support leaning on the handle. Also, the wheels don't turn very well, more like slide. So, it definitely would be better on carpet than hardwood, but still not good. After falling once and bumping his head, and then falling a second time and having the toy hit him in the mouth, we gave up. As a ride on, it is safer, but it is pretty small. Our 10 month old is pushing the limits (he's on the average to small side).

Here are the negatives: the wheel base is to narrow, it is top heavy and can turn over very easily, the front and back wheels are fixed and do not move from side to side-it is hard for the child to turn, the wheels are to slick and it makes the \\"walker\\" move to quickly for a little one who is learning how to walk.

Kids stumble on back legs while trying to walk and riding it is near impossible. It doesn't take the burden off of the parent/adult of helping a new walker wobble around. You spend the whole time helping them or picking them up after the poor things fall off. My nephew would cry so much from frustration that I just threw the darn thing away. What's worse is he recieved it twice as a gift! Got rid of them both! No thanks I'd rather strain my back and help them learn to walk the old fashioned way.

This walker is very brightly colored and my son loves to play with all of the gadgets and hide blocks under the hood. It will do very well when he's old enough to use it as a riding toy. As a walker, it fails miserably. It's far too light and the wheels give no resistance so the second my son tries to use it to stand up, it falls over backwards on top of him. If I help him stand up and grab the handle, it flies out from under him the second he takes a step. It's not a complete waste of money.

The moment my son sat on it we knew we'd been scammed out of the money we paid for it. The main problem is the back end is too wide. The wide back end interferes with the backward movement of his legs and therefore there was no way he can propel the scooter forward. The narrow front seat with wide back end is a major design flaw and I find it hard to believe that this toy made it out of the design and testing stages at Hasbro Playskool.Additional problems: The wheels are extremely slippery plastic; it rides too low to the ground, and once assembled it cannot be disassembled, placed back into the box and returned to the store for a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Riding, Terrible for Walking","review":"This toy has been through both of my kids now and I've had the same experience with both: this toy is just fine as a \\"riding/scooting\\" toy but is terrible as a \\"learn to walk\\" toy. The problem is there is very little to no resistance in the wheels so as soon as you begin to push on the handle, it goes rolling. This is useless for a child that still needs some help balancing as he/she begins to learn how to walk since as soon as the kid puts any weight on it, it shoots forward. This is probably a larger problem on my hardwood floors but I can't see it being significantly better on carpet.The good side of the toy is that it is well sized for a riding toy.

And last the gadgets are distracting...this should promote walking, it should not distract with antennas, and other purposeless things.

I wasn't expecting to get so much use out of it since my son seems to grow out of toys faster than shoes! I bought this at 10 months when he was starting to cruise and push chairs around the kitchen. It was a little too fast/uncontrollable on non-carpeted surfaces when he was an early cruiser, but he seemed to figure out his balance fairly quickly and was speeding all over the house with this walker about a month later. He is 18 months now and still loves to push this around. He enjoyed playing with the little gagets on it and hiding blocks in the little front compartment. In the ride position, he still hasn't figured out how to ride in forward direction, but he can speed like a champ backwards.

Now that he is older (18 months), he is bored with the stroller aspect of it. We never did find a time that it seemed appropriate for him.

At that point in time he couldn't walk yet - but he was very interested in using it as a ride-on rather than pushing it. At 9 months he was the right size to use it as a ride on, but his skill level was not there yet. He's now 18 months and is too big to use it as a ride-on toy. In fact he only got to use it as a ride-on from 12 1/2 months to 15 or 16 months. That's a very short window of opportunity. At 18 months it's too low to the ground and the room between the front and back wheels is much too short for him to get a decent range of motion as he propels himself. This is unfortunate because at 18 months he is VERY into ride-on's (he calls them go-toys) and this one is no longer usable.

She hasn't used the stand and push option yet, but she enjoys sitting and getting pushed around on it. We've had it for a little over a month, and the older she gets, the more she enjoys.

She was only 8 months at the time, so we were guessing it was a toy she would be growing into. However, she loved it right away. It was the first toy we put together (very easily) that morning, and we sat her on top, in the ride position, she squealed with delight. She watched most of the rest of Christmas morning from atop her new car. She isn't able to scoot herself forward yet, only backwards, but she likes to be pushed forward. I'll admit, we haven't used it much as a walker, but I like that it has this option for when she gets to that point. Surprisingly, she also likes to just sit on the floor next to the toy and play with all the extra gadgets. She did pull the hood cover off once, so that has been my only concern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big hit at our house","review":"I just bought this when my son was 7 months old and I wasn't sure if he could do it on his own or not. Well as soon as I put it together I put him on and he not only stayed on by himself but started scooting across the kitchen.There are enough gadgets on this to keep him busy even when he's not riding, and he loves the trunk in the front that we hide toys in. This is definitely a big hit.I haven't used it as a walking support yet but it's really easy to switch back and forth between the two. I'd definitely recommend this toy. Might want to get it even when you think your child is too young for it because you'd be surprised how much they can do before you think they're ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Wonderful, my nephew loved this item, he hops on it and plays with all the different things, lots of fun. Would recommend for a 1 yr old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cute and that's about it!","review":"My daughter pays no attention to this toy what so ever.

I'm just not all that impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont like it at all","review":"I personally dont like this toy at all, it is very hard for my son to use, and he is always kicking the blue part that they walk in between. It tips *very* easy and is not good for a baby just starting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"The product does not work as a walker. My 10 month old kept kicking the base. She could not use it. When we converted it to a ride on toy she could not reach the floor and by the time she could reach the floor it was too small to ride. I think there are many better options out there. It may be worth it to but a seperate walker and ride on toy. I wish I had done that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My Grandson likes to sit on this and watch TV! He loves to push things around and it works great on carper. My only wish is that it had a larger storage compartment in the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be aware of the adult things Alice does","review":"Alice is certainly growing up and is true to the character which Mrs. Naylor has created. However, it is now time for the elementary school to be aware of the contents of the book, as Alice attends a shower, where she is given a fairly expicit questionnaire to answer, and the girls continue their discussion of sex by wondering about positions. Yes, this is a wonderfully funny and realistic book, but be sure you know what you are getting. It is not a book for the 9-year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageously Alice","review":"Reynolds Naylor did it again! She writes books like children of the age Alice is in thinks. It is amazing. I love the way she is able to describe things a child would think of so well.

As always an A+ for the author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no and no!","review":"Alice is very different in this book. She does not think and is weird. I think if you want a good book, read another Alice book. Or Harry Potter. Alice wears her hair in green spikes, and disobeys her father. If you want a good book, DO NOT I repeat DO NOT read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for 9 and 10 year olds","review":"This book is listed for readers age 9-13. However, it is most inapprpriate for preteen readers. Alice learns about \\"sensual experiences in a swimming pool\\" and what to do with whipped cream besides putting it on a dessert. This book was donated to my 4th grade classroom library. I assumed it would be appropriate based on Mrs. Naylors other works. Boy was I surprised when a parent brought it to my attention.

Interviews make up the majority of the content and are mostly people telling their opinions of the man. The beginning of each segment of interview is marked by a stupid animation of a cartoon-PKD typing out little tidbits of trivia. I got the distinct impression that these little cartoons are only in the movie to add length, as each instance of the cartoon is exactly identical. I also though the music was cheesy and annoying. Overall, if the cartoons were taken out. A couple of the more pointless segments were taken out (who cares about the PKD section of the So. Cal. library?!) you would be left with a short, mildly interesting documentary. As it is currently a long, annoying and (in my opinion) intolerable documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"World of Philip K. Dick fascinating, but not this DVD","review":"The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick explores some of this fascinating man's life and works, but ultimately fails at being an interesting movie. The interviews are okay, but there's nothing here that can't be found elsewhere where you can learn more. The often repetitious animation of PKD mouthing his actual dialogue gets to be grating and the audio isn't very clear either. An old fan of PKD will be bored watching this, a new fan might get interested enough to pursue other biographies and want to read more of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This DVD","review":"Philip K. Dick fans will find nothing new or interesting in this documentary. People unfamiliar with PKD will not learn anything about him. About 85% of this documentary is garbage. The other 15% is merely boring. Read the other reviews to learn more about the repetitive use of animation. Not worth owning, even for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just re-read the stories and watch the movies","review":"I bought this (without reading the reviews) because I thought it would provide some real context to the genius whose work spawned so many excellent movies, but was I ever disappointed.I read PKD's stories back when he was alive, and was hoping for some insight into how his mindset influenced his work. There was very little of that. This was a movie that cried out for some critical synopis of Dick's work, and should have tied his eccentricities or psychosis to his output. Instead, we are left with reminicences, some of which are interesting, but very little insight into this artist. A big disappointment--even for a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"probably one of the worst documentaries ever made. Fans of PKD will be extremely disappointed, beginners won't find it useful.Better buy books of PKD if you're really interested.

Dick\\" targets newcomers to Philip K. Dick and doesn't seem to offer much to us fanatics. I hoped the film would include some actual footage of Philip K. Dick along with some in-depth analysis of the strange claims that obsessed Dick in the final years of his life. Instead the DVD resembles an A&E; or History Channel show with interspersed interviews from writers Paul Williams and Robert Anton Wilson, one member of a Gnostic organization, and some friends and fans of Philip K. Dick. (Not surprisingly the only conclusion made was that Philip K. Dick's death was a tragic loss.)I personally get a better sense of Philip K. Dick from his novels than from this DVD. I realize this film was a labor of love and the creators could only utilize what was available however the poor audio on Dick's recordings was a disappointment.With such a fascinating subject, this film should have offered more."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INTERVIEWS","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I had previously read two biographies of PKD and still learned a lot from watching this movie. The interviews were very good and gave a glimpse into Philip K. Dick the person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst documentary I've ever seen...","review":"There's no \\"gospel\\" in this documentary. It simply talks about his life in a convoluted, abstract, poorly-shot, ill-conceived way. The interviewees knew him, but they make no attempt to do anything but talk about their personal knowledge of him. There is little mention of his books. No mention of his impact on modern media. I highly recommend you avoid this. I just wasted 90 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do I know?","review":"Some voice inside of me seems to already know how each event of my life should go, critiquing relentlessly as though it has been here before.

Being stuck and not moving forward due to my own conversations has been maddening for years and this gave me a way to actually interrupt those conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing tool, one step at a time, to self acceptance","review":"This book is a well written, well supported understanding of a pattern in so many of us, one that can sabotage our free and delightful living in this world. I travel with it around the world :-) a great reminder at times. Byron adds not only a fresh point of view on the Judge, but also with that guides us back to revive a long forgotten/frozen Soul in hiding.. Many exercises to make it more tangible, and even \\"personal\\" stories that will echo in each whilst one reading. Take it one step at a time, this is for real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 80's Classic","review":"Pretty good debut from Anne G.

The use of \\"blue\\" as metaphor - a complicated subject to understand, is brilliantly depicted both in the poem (dream in blue/fine blue glow of moon/blue ocean/mother's blue eyes) and in the exquisite watercolor illustrations that accompany the poetry. My students identify with the baby turtle, hearing the poem spoken in his voice and I hear them singing the repeating refrain on the playground to each other through my open window.

This book is a must for all children.Barbara"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and educational","review":"The artwork and storyline are very well done. Would be worth buying. My sister-in-law adopted a sea turtles nest several years ago and would watch it to be able to help the sea turtles go the right direction when they finally came out (instead of being attracted by the lights on the mainland). I had the incredible opportunity of being there the night the turtles came out of their nest. Our whole family got in and pulled out flashlights, cell phones, and anything else we could find to use as a light to lead them toward the water so they could continue following the moon to their mother. It was remarkable to say the least. This book is very true to that experience as far as teaching children the wonderful way God has created for baby turtles to find their mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic... perfect gift!","review":"This is a beautiful story and the illustrations are superb!

I have a feeling he wouldn't request it if he had more to choose from on the kindle fire. It doesn't flow well and the repetition on every page is irritating. The illustrations are also repetitive and boring. Not much imagination to this book I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Follow the Moon","review":"I stumbled across this book quite by accident, and I found it to be a treasure. The verse is lovely and calm, as are the illustrations. It also depicts fairly accurately a remarkable natural phenomenon. As a new mom who longed for a child for many years and eventually adopted internationally, I found the symbolism achingly beautiful. I have since given the book to several friends who have also waited for their children to find them. This book is far too beautiful to be limited to the adoption genre, however. It is very meaningful on a number of different levels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute bedtime story","review":"I enjoyed reading this book for my daughter she loved the artwork.

Good buy, worth having on your kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"I liked this author's take on what the little turtles are saying as they are making their way to the ocean. The kids thought this book was cute and it was kind of a fun story, although the repeat phrase got a little bit tiring to the older kids after a couple of times. What I truly loved about this book, was the illustrations. The turtles have been represented beautifully here and Each illustration is different than the last. There is so much detail in this book that even without the story the book would have been fun to look at, which I find important in a 'picture book.' I think this would be an excellent book for kids up to age six. May not have the excitement that an older child is looking for but still a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loved it!","review":"My daughter loved the turtle.

I think the book could have been shorten a great deal and it would have been much stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your facts straight","review":"I volunteer for a local turtle watch group in my area so I know a little about turtles. The one main thing is that the mother turtle lays her eggs and leaves. She never \\"reunites\\" with her babies. I feel it is totally a lie to tell my child this story. While it's nice to think of them as nurturing etc, they are not. Why anyone would have their entire book based on such a ridiculous premise is beyond me. I can't even say it's a sweet book, although I want to, being that it's based on such an untrue idea, it tarnishes the rest of the book. I would recommend Gail Gibbons book \\"Sea Turtles\\" for a more factual read, although not quite as endearing of a story. I am so dissappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small children","review":"While this was a decent story, it is perhaps for children 7-10.

First of all, it flows like a third grader wrote it. It's full of grammatical errors not to mention in some places it doesn't even make sense.

I tried to e-mail the author about all the mistakes in the book and she told me it was the printing company and that there were only 11 mistakes. There's 11 mistakes in the first chapter alone!

I actually had to force myself to finish this book. The author spends most of the book desperately trying to convince the reader of her abilities & knowledge, the grammer/structure of the book itself is terrible, and the most disturbing thing of the whole book is how the author treated and exploited this poor family.This book is truly a worthless waste of time & money, and like others have said should this \\"author\\" ever decide to write another book, I will be running far & fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dread and the Dead Filled the Dunnam House","review":"There is nothing wrong with the content of this book.

My now-husband gave me Boy for my 22nd birthday because it was one of his favorite books as a child. I loved it and read it and Going Solo as quickly as I could. I recommend it to anyone of any age and will definitely read it to my children. Dahl had an eventful childhood which he narrates with the compassionate and mischievous tone of his other books. Boy is perfect for parents and children alike because Dahl remembers how life feels from the child's point of view whilst, a parent himself, appreciating the difficulties of parenthood and adulthood. Few books better help children and their parents to see eye-to-eye. Also admirable are the strength and acceptance that allows him to overcome childhood hardships without a trace of bitterness or melodrama. More than anything, it is a beautiful, interesting and down-right amusing look at a world not so far away in distance or time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical stories from childhood and beyond of a great author","review":"This is a wonderful combination of Roald Dahl's childhood and schooling, followed by stories from his life in east Africa and experiences as a pilot in the war.

You can see the beginnings of a number of his books in his experiences. I can thoroughly recommend as a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source for students of \\"death\\"","review":"Anyone considering going into the mortuary business should read this book.

All in all, it's worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very medical...","review":"...yet captivating. This tome outlines everything that happens to dead bodies, from death itself and forensic pathology to a visit to the embalmers.

The author bores his audience throughout with his stilted academic prose and the scholarship is weak, sometimes to the verge of pseudoscience.

This book may well suit would-be morticians, but has little to offer any serious scholar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating reading!","review":"I'm not sure what possessed me to purchase this book, with as morbid a subject as the title suggests, but I did. And when it arrived and I started to read it, I was unable to put it down!This is not a gory book, nor a morbid one. It is enlightening, straight forward, and even easy to read.Reading this book, one learns about death from a biological point of view. You also find out what really happens with embalmings, cremations, and burials. And you learn about how death has been handled over history. Fascinating stuff.While some folks might not go out and purposely purchase this book, I guarantee they would pick it up and find it difficult to put down if they found it lying on a table somewhere.Incredibly enlightening reading on one of the few topics which you rarely get to learn about.I fully enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely spell-binding and extremely comprehensive.","review":"\\"Death to Dust\\" is one of the most interesting books I've ever read, and the comprehensiveness is part of the attraction. From the normal (what happens after death) to the unusual (shrunken heads), it's all there. Legal matters associated with death--they're there too. Appendices, glossary, and index--check. Pages are even included for a nifty \\"Body-Disposal Instructions and Discussion Guide,\\" which the reader can use to help record his or her own preferences about funeral, body donation, notifications, costs, and information like lawyer, insurance, and executor.Although the book is about death, it's not dull, drab, or depressing. In fact, humor is all over the place. I highly recommend this book for everything you might want to know about death, dead bodies, or the death industry; I had always wondered about such things but never had any luck finding someone who knew the answers.

I had suspected that these might be products of the horrible Chinese trade in cat fur, but the manufacturer has since clarified that they are rabbit fur. I would never knowingly buy a product of animal cruelty, but I'm glad to know that I did not let my cat play with a dead cat.

I suppose there were soome scary parts, but the book never seemed to end! While the book differs in many ways, the plot is very similar to Lois Duncan's I Know What You Did Last Summer. Some group of drunken teenagers hit and kill someone in a car accident, and decide to cover it up, then a year later someone comes after them in revenge. I Know What You Did... was in fact written more than ten years before Chain Letter. Plus, Chain Letter was tasteless, and ridiculous.

The additional songs written by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe are jarringly different in style from what the Shermans wrote and are inferior and distracting. Actually, why add new songs at all? Why deviate from the film at all?! The movie was nearly perfect winning Julie Andrews an Oscar and Oscars for the Shermans as well. If they needed to expand the length, they could have expanded on the existing plot lines in the film... they didn't have to add the dark scenes used in the musical version.On the whole, the disc was a dissapointing listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird.","review":"Disappointing.

It sounds as if the orchestra consists of 4 or 5 musicians. The original Mary Poppins film soundtrack album has a rich, lush and deep sounding orchestration. This London Cast album sounds very, very thin and sparse in comparison. The singers here deliver their lyrics without the emotional exuberance that was so present in the film version.

Overblown, overproduced Mackintosh garbage. If he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage, I'm sure he wouldn't have hesitated.

However after 2 minutes or so of watching this video my baby began crying apparently because a freaky face was drawn. When the face started eating things I had to turn the video off because it was really scaring him. The video has a creepy feel as the images slowly change unexpectedly.

The author teaches at the University of California, Los Angeles, and has been an actor, a director and a producer. This handbook covers everything from raising money to production costs, the role of both writer and director, editing, nudity, working with animals, and much else. Schreibman is knowledgeable about his subject. After reading this work, many of us will watch films with a renewed respect for the complexity that went into their making.The writer also brings us up to speed on the fascinating vocabulary of the film world: 'black-track print', 'walla', 'foley', and other terms are explained economically. Schreibman claims that the producer provides 'creativity in front, behind, before and after the rolling of a camera'. This first-class handbook shows how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not nearly good enough","review":"I bought this book before I began my studies in Producing. I was looking forward to a good read that I wouldn't want to put down. I was looking for a book that would get me excited for my upcoming studies. This book did not meet my expectations. The author filled this book with a lot of information, which isn't a bad thing, but it was very monotone. I found it hard to read because I was bored easily and it felt like I was reading a 1980's text book. Very boring. I pushed myself to the end and felt relieved once I finished. He only had about 3 real life, mildly entertaining stories. I was joking to my family saying I wanted to find the author and tell him personally how boring his book was. I don't want to completely bash this book because it is filled with a lot of information and only information a working hollywood producer would know."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly overrated, not very practical","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. It doesn't provide the real world facts about making an indie film as other books do.

Don't waste your money here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend it","review":"I bought this book for my cousin who wants to start out in the film business.

Luckily I stumbled onto this book here. This is the best book ever one could imagine on Geishas! Full color with so many photos of Geishas! This book is a nice coffee table book that covers history, dress, culture, artistry, and more. It has enough information to entertain but not too much erudite script to bore.This book actually has a cellophane chapter that is several pages of dressing/undressing a geisha. You can literally lift her layers of kimonos off and see how complex dressing is for a geisha!I gave this book to a fellow costume friend and she LOVED it. I missed it so much, that I ended up buying another for myself!This is a MUST HAVE for any geisha lover out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A glamourized perspective, again","review":"This book is intelligent, with nuances that depict elements of culture in ways that are unique and graceful. However, the author neglects to investigate the effects that having sex with multiple men for money, the many risks involved, and the need to do so to have a place of status in that society (given the child's upbringing), has on the psychological and spiritual well-being of the geishas. Health consequences are not reported.Overall, it appears that the author, although sensitive to global perceptions and multiple perspectives, has bought into cultural rules and underlying belief systems that MUST perceive geishas as gifted in order to feel ok about using them."},{"rating":"1","title":"music format","review":"the format is not professional it is more \\"home movies\\" style which the narrator tells you from the beginning.

My daughter has had hours of fun with this game. You get to raise a horse from a foal and it grows up into a horse you can ride at 3 years of age. You must earn money, buy food, medicine, and tools to care for the horse. You can have several horses at once, but only play with one at a time. There isn't much of a story line to this game. It's strictly care and riding. We have all of the other Let's Ride games too. This one is a favorite and your horse is sure to become your best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh... Not worth it","review":"I bought this game and raising the foal is TREACHEROUS; very, very boring. Every .10 seconds you have to groom this or groom that, and out riding, the grooming goes away in a matter of seconds. There are very few horse/color choices in this game. Overall, this game is ONLY fun when there is a show. I have Vista, and in the jumping tournaments, the game will freeze, close out, and I have to start from where I last saved it. So, I would definitely no recommend this to anyone, unless you have a dire need to buy it, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but how hard can a game get?","review":"I bought this with my hard-earned money that I had earned at a garage sale while it was 100 degrees out (where I was working). I was really disappointed. It's too hard to play, but the graphics are cool and the setting is beautiful.Well, there are some really crazy glitches. For example, your horse is really starving, and you put some food in the trough. He just sits there while you worry. Then, the horse's mane is impossible to keep clean. And on top of that, he's always sick!Those two stars are for the graphics. Nothing else. Please don't waste your money; buy My Horse and Me which is a LOT better! Or get Equestrian Challenge, which is totally cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst horse game ever invented!!!!","review":"this game stinks big time. The horses are hideous and so are the graphics, and it says on the box that you can't customize your character and horse, and you can't. you get five coat colors and 3 outfits for the people. I actually can't beileive that lets ride did a game like this, because they usually are great. DO NOT buy this game. grooming takes forever, the person moves s-l-o-w-l-y. the landscape is ugly and there is no instruction at all. even the music stinks. PLEASE don't buy this game, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This game is really a waste of time. The only fun we had was laughing at how ridiculus the game is, like when you give the horse water the bucket disappears. My girls thought the horse was eating the bucket. The days are really slow. The graphics get messed up like your horse's tail sticking through a door. You can see some really great places but you can't go there. The horse can't even walk through water. And it gets thirsty on the trail which is silly since there is a creek right there it could get a drink if the game wasn't so limited. After hours and hours you can finally ride the horse except it is constantly getting a fungus and parasites. If owning a horse was this difficult no one would ever do it. Don't buy this game, we had other Let's Ride that were a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much fun at all!","review":"First of all, no tutorials! It took me almost an hour to learn how to brush and feed the horse! Other Let's Ride games, such as Silver Buckle Stables, explained EVERYTHING! Another is how slow everything is-especially the days. A normal day isn't that slow (for me, anyway)! I also can't believe how dirty a single horse can get within five minutes! The only good thing about this game is the information you can fill in about your horse and the color selection. Maybe the graphics, too. Before my mom bought this for me, I thought it was going to be as good as Silver Buckle Stables. Now, I wish she spent the money for this game on Spore or My Horse and Me. Believe me, this game is not worth your money! Let's Ride disappointed me this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible,Horrible,Horrible game","review":"This game is fun at first but then your horse starts getting sick all the time!!!!!!!!It is such a waste of money!

All you do is the stupid horse, and forget trying to keep the job at 100%, the condition of the mane and tail decay ridiculously fast. I could groom a REAL horse in less time than it spends to groom the one on the screen. The graphics are horrible,and you can't go anywhere. The show competition only counts the ribbons and bows, and there's no point or story to the game at all. Buy Equestrian Challenge or something like that with your money.

I am 13 and i spent and hour trying to figure out how u get the dirt out of the horses mane with the comb. also the beauty contests are stupidious, u get graded on how many bows your horses has on!!!!

Beyond that the other reviewers are correct the game is dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price","review":"Firewire cables, at least to me, are as overpriced as HDMI cables.

Things his father used to hear, before he died. He can hear music no one should be able to hear, and always there is a strange, eternal roar. Why is he like this? And is it a curse or a blessing? Right now, it seems to be a curse.Luke's world is falling apart. His dad is gone, his mom wants to remarry, and he can't even find refuge in his music anymore. Now, he's getting mixed up with Skin and the gang. They want him to steal something very important to someone. And he knows that if he lets them down, he will pay dearly. Maybe with his life.Thought-provoking and beautiful, this is one of the best books I've read in my life.

Receiving this book as a Christmas present, I thought I'm gonna have to read it. And boy did I enjoy it. It didn't take me long to read, so to say I zipped right through would be an understatement. It really was good, and I found myself identifying with a few of the characters, especially Luke. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of situation (being forced to do something, trying to fit in with a certain group), you'll be able to see yourself in the character of Luke.I would have liked this book to come with a soundtrack! I know it sounds daft, but the way the author described the music that Luke plays throughout sounds brilliant.I found the chapters sometimes slightly long - and I hate stopping in the middle of a chapter, cos I always forget where I was!

Chapters cover ecological assessments, analytical aspects of sampling design, reef fishes, subtidal assemblages of soft substrata, planktonic assemblages, gastropods and the indentification and treatment of specimens. Easy to read and a pleasure to the eye with many black and white diagrams and colour plates. Huge reference section will help in any further research."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Toy!!!!","review":"I've had this toy out since my twins were 6 months old. They loved it on day one and they still love it now. This is the only toy of theirs that has been a constant in their playtime. They stand on either side of it and play with something in front of them and even just stand around it and \\"talk\\" to each other. The train does get pulled off quite a bit, but they love moving it back and forth to make the clicking noise. I would definately recommend this toy to anyone. They are one now and show no signs of outgrowing this toy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice starter for an activity table","review":"I first bought this for a friend and after she told me her daughter loved it, I went out and bought it for my son. It is a cute activity table, with no extra frills, just basic music and some lights on it. It's got different clicks and doors to open and close and a cute train that makes clicking noises as well. The train does and can be pulled off quite easily, but can be put on really quick and stays on until they tear it off again. He's had this for a year now and he still plays with it, now puttting all his cars on there and using it as a bumpy course. The music is cute, not loud at all, and I haven't had to change the batteries since I've gotten it, so it's still going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this toy!","review":"There are enough different noises/buttons/etc. to keep him interested for quite a while. It's definitely his favorite toy. The only thing I'd be concerned about if a child isn't able to stand well is that the toy isn't very stable; it will slide easily across the floor if a baby leans on it. We have it on a carpeted floor. I imagine it's even easier to push on an uncarpeted one. This can be good or bad. After a few minor tumbles, my son is standing much more steadily. His favorite thing to do is play the music and \\"dance\\". Sometimes he \\"sings\\" along, much to the delight of any one who is watching! I'd definitely get this for a young toddler as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weened on Ted","review":"This was the last great Ted album. Having graduated in '79 in Minnesota it was natural to be a huge Ted fan. It was the peak of the partying years and not too many nights went by without pounding some Ted into my head. Saw him twice live and it still gives me goosebumps when Free For All starts up. It seems like Ted faded with the 80's just like the fun did. This still doesn't have the overall greatness of previous albums but manages some good guitar riffs and decent lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great CD","review":"I am a huge Ted Nugent fan & have been for 30 years, but unfortunately living in Australia I have never had the opportunity to see Ted live in concert.

I had to resort frequently to other sources to clarify topics that were poorly presented in the Prentice Hall text, and tended to find much simpler explanations outside of the text. The problem sets are particularly troublesome, as many of them do not appear to relate to the section in which they are contained and insufficient explanations are offered in the answer key. I recommend you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mediocre textbook","review":"Two things amaze me about this book:#1 This book is in it's eigth edition#2 Prentice Hall actually published this bookWow I can't believe quality control at Prentice Hall allowed this one to slip through. It has no proof anywhere, rather it just throws equations at the reader and tries to convince the reader through examples. Several key probability and statistics concepts are no where present in this book. I was able to fill in the gaps through prior experience. I think the author must have assumed a very low mathematical capability of the reader which is strange because both business and economics get very mathematical. The data exercises are for the most part uninteresting. Also my copy has serious printing errors on several pages and the binding is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tons of Mistakes","review":"Just a quick note...

I love this. I use it as our son's bassinett right next to our bed. I keep his diaper supplies in the handy bins and it makes getting up in the middle of the night so much easier. It was a bit difficult to put together and I needed my husband's help for the play pen part. But all in all, I love it and now that I know how to put it together, if I need to take it somewhere, I'll know exactly how to assemble it by myself. I think you should buy it because it's an all-in-one unit. It grows with your child from infant to toddler. I know I plan to use this for naps when our son is much older. I'll just use the play pen part once he's too heavy for the bassinett part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tape!!","review":"DOPEY DICKS is an excellent Three Stooges short, one of their best.

Shemp has some of his best scenes here. There's a hilarious scene where the Stooges have a fight with Vernon Dent in a crowded phone booth. One of the Stooges best.THE TOOTH WILL OUT is another short I've always been fond of. There are just too many great scenes in this one.

This book is a must have for the new or novice gardener - it not only includes information on just about anything you can grow in the soil, it gives you a month-by-month list of what you need to do in order to succeed. I've used it to learn about my lawn, plant a new tree in my yard, keep my flower beds looking great and even for beginning my vegetable garden. There isn't any info on growing fruits, (tomatoes excluded!) but I don't really have much interest in that part of gardening yet so it didn't bother me a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent opera - one of Verdi's best---","review":"Great cast under the baton of the great James Levine.

I even taped it so I could use it as a resource to teach my high school history students. The VCR tape was starting to get old and the quality was deteriorating. I figured I would get it on DVD to replace it - boy was I wrong! This DVD has a dry, English accent narrator which was not on the American History Channel version. His voice is matter-of-fact, and not dramatic enough to keep you interested. After a while, it became like white noise, and all I was really watching was old black and white archival footage. It's amazing how the absence of a Hollywood voice has such an effect...I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It...","review":"Picked this up as an impulse buy...a hardback Beatles' book at a very reasonable price? Why not. Once home, I got into it. Very neat, easy to read/use, & very entertaining. Each of the 100 songs receives 3-4 pages of commentary. Each tune gets both authors' \\"What We Really Like About This Song\\" + \\"What This Song Is About\\" + \\"Did You Know?\\" + some factual info regarding the recording session & who played what instrument.Not as heavy as Mark Lewisohn's \\"The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions\\"...Spignesi & Lewis' book is more about fun. IMO, a worthy addition to any collector of Beatles' books(I have about 20)...would definitely be a great first book for anyone wanting to read about the songs they've listened to & loved all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight but....","review":"The idea of this book is great. A detailed description, with a little commentary, gives you more insight into a song than you ever thought possible. And obviously everyone's best of list is going to be different. But I would like to see a little more diversity. I mean, Yesterday is a great song and all, but their hits have been talked about and written about for thirty years. I would like to know more about lesser known songs because some of them are a lot more interesting than Yesterday. But for what's it worth, a detailed description about the recording process gives loads more insight than any schmoe's supposed firsthand account about the Beatles fighting. Yeah, we know they fought. La de da."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent entertaining book","review":"Please do not read the one star reviews. They are not legitimate and appear to be from one disgruntled Beatles fan.This is a decent book for Beatles fans. Although it does not contain all of their songs, it's interesting to see how two writers list their favorites.

A classic of life's little frustrations.","review":"I grew up with this book, but tragically lost it a few years ago. Now it is finally available again. The story of Mr. Earbrass struggling with every phase of writing a book is a classic of wry humor with non-sequiturs at every turn. The illustrations (drawn actual size) are even more of an attraction than the story. Be sure to look for the distant hot-air balloon in one illustration, and what happens to the fantod under glass. What's a fantod? Read the book to see one! I also recommend this book for developing childrens' sense of humor, although I found the long-headed people and oblique references to English place names a bit difficult to understand when I was six."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Description","review":"Rick is a Gulf War veteran who is haunted by a fatal mistake.

While at times this book was campy in nature and clearly of a direct leaning towards the Salvation Army it also contained many accounts of hard work and perserverance in the face of great physical and mental hardship. The women did everything they could to encourage the young soldiers to act as true heroes. They did things from making donuts to creating a place where soldiers could come as a refuge from the ravages of war.

It features Thrills galore with amazing stunts done on moto cross vehicles, skateboards, BMX racing bikes, and the Street Luge. The music in the film also provides a rush and ads a lot to the stunts performed. The only thing I didn't understand was in the opening credits, they showed a guy doing stunts on a wakeboard, and I got really excited thinking that they were going to have a segment on wakeboarding. But, as the movie time wound down, there wasn't one. So I was kinda disappointed, but it wasn't really a flaw in the movie. It was very well made. I also didn't like how it was only 40 minutes long because I ached for more. It was a fun film, and I think that it has something for everyone to enjoy.

Another probelm was that the graphics gave only a single example of the procedure being described (as shown for the '84-'87 CRX... not very helpful to orient you to a 95 Civic).

One has an enduring marriage, likes his creature comforts & has a cadre of loyal retired spooks still active in the old bomb-the-opposition game. The other because he's so green & full of self-righteous perfect dreams. When the two of them clash the fun begins. & those purple dots? Ah, how petty are the things with which we barter.

Many of these have the ring of authenticity as well as being funny. The actions of the appointee's friends captures the fellowship and spirit of those who have worked together in prior relationships in an intense way. the friends who are all retired live on a charming area of the w. va. panhandle that gets some vivid description of the good life after retirement. all in all this is a good read ...but don't take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy, It's not","review":"This COULD have been a good read.

Mr. Lehrer could have served the reader by including the menu's from all the restaurants instead the wasted page after page of what they ate. I am not aware of fresh water fish having sex- I thought females spewed eggs on a bed and the males did their things to the eggs.

I loved this book, as I love all The Cat Who books. An aside in this book is that Qwill investigates the correlation of the number of cats whiskers to how smart they are. (Koko has 30 on each side.. Yum Yum has just 24 on each side)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on track.","review":"This is the 18th mystery in the series. This is a great series. I felt the last book had some problems, so I was glad that this one was back on track. It has a lot of twists in the plot and the who-done-what is surprising.

The clues (cheese names....I won't spoil it for you!) and interesting characters like Mr. Limburger who is as odious in personality as his name suggests, gentle Aubrey the bee keeper with a heart bigger than his brain, Onoosh, the mysterious woman. I won't go on, I might spoil things.Other clues (what Qwill finds in his ready-to-cook turkey)and other goings on, and the \\"coverage\\" of the Pickax Hotel bombing....nicely narrated. Though through Koko's catly fits (which is caught on tape at the cheese tasting at Qwill's apple barn and distributed by others for the laughs) we start to piece together who, and then later why. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book.As a long time fan of Braun I say this is one of her best. But start at the beginning...to see Qwill and Koko's genesis and struggles. What they had to do to get where they are now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Purr-fect!!!","review":"This book was wonderful. I loved all those new and odd characters like Gustav Limburger.

Good Quality, but Wrong Size","review":"I ordered this product for my 2006 Honda Accord. The Amazon.com search bar auto tool said that it was the appropriate break rotor for my car. Knowing that Bendix makes quality auto parts, I went ahead and ordered it.Unfortunately, I found out much too late that its size was too big for my car. Is that Bendix' fault? Not really, but without writing this review about it, you may make the same mistake that I did. It's too bad Amazon didn't bother to simply write in the actual length of the break rotor, because it would have saved us both a lot of time and effort.So, before buying this break rotor (it's 11.6 inches, by the way- I found this out the hard way) be sure you know what size you need for your vehicle. Don't always trust the Amazon auto tool.Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.....","review":"The watch itself, is a nice watch. However, I bought it because it was advertised as water resistant. When I received it, I noticed that the stem did not screw down. All my past water resistant watches had screw down stems...which I can only assume....make them \\"water resistant\\". When I contacted the company to question this, their answer was to take it off before going swimming (what???). The reason I buy water resistant watches for my husband is because, sometimes, he forgets.

I LOVE the look, but they have 3 big drawbacks, First off, no light. The glow paint on the watch is pretty dim. Second, it goes through batteries pretty quick. When the battery gets low the hands stop moving but the digital part still works. First time that happened I thought the watch had malfunctioned. Third, the band comes off the watch! The pin that holds it on isn't robust enough. That is why my last one is on the bottom of the river right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful by day, invisible by night","review":"In daylight, this watch is HOT. Looks perfect.At night, forget it. I mean it. When you wake up or go to bed, if it's your habit to look at your watch, you won't see it. Like, not even a glimmer of light off a hint of steel. NOTHING. Nada. Zippo.The reviews are true. The dayglow sometimes glows during the day and you wish it would glow at night. If you shine a light on the glow paint it will glow for about 20 mins, and then zippo, nada. Nothing. And this is NEW, out of the box. And I've heard flies louder than this alarm. The alarm is way weaker than the watch looks.Too bad. It could be a perfect watch with actual luminesence and a shockingly loud alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Purchase Ever!","review":"I bought this watch back when it was a new design, about 18 years ago for $128. It has never let me down, never broken, on it's third (or fourth) battery and about that many straps. I've traveled the planet, dived in three oceans with it, it has gone through multiple crashes, been dropped off the roof of a three story building, years of flying and constant pressure changes, all the banging of using it during Habitat Builds, showers, skiing and still my clients who are \\"serious\\" watch collectors ask about it because they like the style (I use a Kevlar Band which dresses it up a little). If I told them it was a Brietling, they'd be impressed.Now I buy these for Missionaries on the edges of civilization in Africa and the Philippines. They have the same thoughts as I do about this tough, yet elegant line of watches.You can't do any better for the money.

Every one of the watches listed above have fogged due to water finding a way into them except this one and the Seiko Gold self Winder(never took it in the water because it was not water resistant)This is a great watch,well worth the money.I am here looking to replace another band.would like a metal one.If anyone here has any recommendations I would appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch!","review":"This watch would have gotten a 5 star rating, but I haven't had it long enough.

I recommend this watch to any buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Function with appeal","review":"I have owned this watch for several weeks and am thoroughly pleased with it. I prefer an analog display but also appreciate the digital information this watch provides. These features are combined in a clean, asthetically pleasing design that is easy to read under various conditons. I replaced the original watch band with a more flexible fabric \\"military\\" style one that offers a bit more comfort and security from loss. Thus far, it is dead on accurate as compared to my radio controlled atomic watches. Alignment of the second hand is perfect BTW on my watch, another plus. Overall, this is a great value and I highly recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned for a new one","review":"This is a great looking watch and I like the dual analog digital functions. But the analog portion of this watch does not keep time, the minute hands locks up sometimes and you look at the watch and it is 20 miutes behind and then you reset it and a couple days later it does the same thing. The digital keeps time but I would like the analog portion to keep time so I am trying to contact Casio to get it repaired as I let the return period lapse.Update: I changed the battery and all seems well. You do need special tool to get back off of watch. I will update if it quits working again.Update #2: It quit working again and I sent it back to Casio, in about a month they just sent me a new watch that so far works fine.

It looks nice but is LOUSY at keeping accurate time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead, deadski, out of here","review":"I've had watches like this for years so was delighted to find what seems like a solid, water-resistant watch with a rubber strap. It looked great and was a good deal for the price. That written, the battery quit in less than 12 months and after it was replaced, the watch died completely. Looks and price are my top criteria but I'd sure like it to last more than one year. This one is dead and I'm not buying another regardless of the style and affordable price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after one year","review":"Worked fine until just after the warranty expired. As other reviewers have mentioned, these aren't made to last. Digital display is blank and the second hands now moves between the 4 and 5 second mark. Definitely not a simple issue to fix, and not worth repairing such a cheap watch. Interestingly, although the title includes dive watch, the manual clearly states that it should not be used for diving. If that's not false advertising, I'm not sure what is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Analog time has lost time even after warranty repair","review":"Bought watch October 16th, 2011. Noticed it was losing time on the analog portion, but digital time remained correct. Finally sent it in for warranty - whicch I paid shipping to send it, plus had to pay $9.95 for shipping and handling to get it back. Now 3 months after getting it back it is doing the same thing again!

I've been wearing it on and off for three months and find it comfortable and easily readable....however it doesn't work.Quite frequently the analog portion seems to stop...just stop. I reset it to current time and it will work for a while, but then it will simply stop again.The digital clock in the center of the dial keeps great time, but not as visible.

I replaced the battery and this did not fix the problem, so I returned the watch to the store and exchanged it for an identical one. Same problem with the analog portion losing time, and replacing the battery did not work. The watch is still under warranty, but I'm just going to return it and get my money back from the store. Why should I pay money to mail it to Casio and wait who knows how long to get another one? If I had the same problem with 2 watches, that tells me that Casio is making a piece of junk. Its a shame because I really like the design of the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time bomb!","review":"Other than the fact that the analog clock doesn't keep accurate time (loses an hour or so every 24 hrs.) I really like the watch. I will get another one, but am frustrated by the inconvenience. Digital time works and I like the look and feel of the watch. Nice size for a guy. Being a big guy I like a substantial time piece. Many watches don't fit the bill due to the watch face being too small. If it works a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Men's AMW320R-1EV Marine Ana-Digi Dive Watch","review":"Good watch for the money. I like the window for date display or a second time zone as I travel a lot. Thick solid band - good looking watch.

The radium or whatever material is applied to the watch hands and hour markers to allow night vision is not adequate - the hour marks stay visible for some time but the hour marks fade almost immediately.

The problem with these sort of watches, which really irritates me, is the lack of a real date function. I don't consider a counter which goes to 31 acceptable. Paying more than a hundred dollars for a watch that needs resetting every month or so is ridiculous. Many watch manufacturers have been lazy for decades, putting out the same ancient design with some cosmetic changes. This Casio is a great mixture of the classic with the modern. To get a watch from the \\"better\\" companies with these features costs at least four times as much. And will they last four times as long? Unlikely."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars except for lack of light...","review":"This watch is tried and true. It is beautiful, functional, and sturdy.

The cubbies are also deep enough that high heels can be stored upright, placed diagonally with one toward the back of the cubby and the other in easy view at the front (again, not side-by-side, but at least not left out on the floor). Taller shoes, like hiking boots and Uggs, will not fit into the cubbies, but are perfectly at home on the top of the storage unit.

I would not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and then some...","review":"I can't believe that someone could design a product this poorly. I'll try to use a rubber mallet like some other posters have done because this is a nightmare to put together. As others have said...the pieces don't snap together easily. You have to use a lot of force. I'm afraid it will fall apart once it is put together. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"My hands were bruised for days after putting this together. I had to put all of my weight on the pieces to \\"snap\\" them into place. Multiply that times 50+ joints and you get something that was not worth the time (1-2 hrs!!) nor the effort. Also, the joiners stick out from the boxes about a half inch on all exterior sides. When I finally did get the thing assembled, it was tilted forward because the front joiners hung over the edge of my shelf, while the rear ones did not. DO NOT BUY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"While the colour is cute that's the only thing about this product that is. Assembly is HORRIBLE. The pegs to assemble the cubbies with DO NOT FIT!!!!!!!!!!!What should have taken 20 mins to put together took 1 hour and the product fell apart.SAVE YOUR MONEY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoe Cubby hard to put together","review":"The item is very difficult for me to put together.

My hands aren't strong enough, meaning anyone with week hands or anything close will have a hard time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst storage solution for shoes...","review":"This shoe cubby shouldn't be that hard to assemble...but it is. Not only myself but 2 other people attempted to put this thing together and the little plastic holders that keep the shelves together pop off and the whole thing will collapse.

I bought it based on the great reviews and was extremely disappointed.Don't buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!","review":"I have worked on putting this storage unit together for the past 3 days. It is very frustrating and the little plastic pieces that should \\"snap on\\" are so fragile I've broken 3 of them so now I'm a couple short to complete the project.

Not a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG - So many pieces","review":"When I opened the box, I thought \\"OMG - so many pieces.\\" I had a friend who was willing to tackle the project for me. It took him about 1 hour to assemble it. I really like the storage solution because it solved my shoe storage dilemna. Just know that it's not already assembled and the assembly is time consuming and challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instructions!","review":"Although it is relatively simple to assemble in theory, it is very difficult to put together, even though I started with a rubber mallet like other reviewers suggested. I thought the assembly instructions would give some helpful hints, but there are none! I ordered two sets - both with no instructions, and none to be found on the web. Very, very frustrating - and I'm not bad at assembly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"Do not buy this item. It is difficult to put together. Each side needs to fastened with a disc shaped clip. That's 60 sides, 4 corners each. Apparently a toolkit is sold separately to make assembly easier. The item isn't sturdy either. The sides are made of thin plastic, similar to the material used for plastic folders. There are much better products on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Okay for smaller shoes, but the cubbies have gotten so small that you cannot fit a pair of size 7 women's tennis shoes in them! I had another one of these products from a couple years ago, and the cubbies are a few inches bigger and much more useful.This one is okay for heels or sandles but just beware that's about all you will get in these small cubbie holes!The product is a bit of a pain to put together, but once it's done, it's sturdy enough.Would be a better product if they would improve the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect a bargain","review":"This is definitely a lot smaller than I had anticipated! My 6 year old's shoes are the only ones that fit in each cubbie comfortably so for my husband's we used two sections without an attachment.The \\"walls\\" come out too easily, it's hard to click the pieces into place, and one of the pieces broke within a month of getting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my family of 5","review":"This has worked wonders in keeping my family of five's shoes in order. I have part of it by my front door, and I actually have it standing upright so that my kids can just drop their shoes in it. The other part is in my entryway closet for storing winter boots, rain boots, and swimming shoes. My kids are all under the age of 6 right now, so each space holds a few pairs of shoes. If my husband or I use it, he can only put 1 shoe in each space. My kids also use it to put their slippers in and also their winter hats and gloves. It has definitely helped in keeping the clutter minimized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the price","review":"Very important note:see the dimensions before you order this product.I bought the similar product from costco with the same price it was very good and more space to keep adult shoe. And it comes with 20 shelves. This one is very small the quality is very poor and it comes with only 16 shelves. This product is for kids shoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to put together","review":"I have put together every single piece of furniture in my house, TV stand, bookshelves, bed, dresser...But I find this shoe rack extremely difficult to put together, and for no reason. It's not that I can't figure out HOW to put it together, that part is easy. But the connectors are not made well for the wires. They don't just \\"snap\\" in, you have to push every connector in so hard, my hands were raw after putting this thing together. I would have preferred using tools, but these plastic connectors didn't look like they could stand up to hammering.To add to that, after an hour of putting this together, I find that I'm actually missing a panel in the box!!! Well, I'm NOT taking it apart and returning the darn thing. I would have never bought it if I knew how painful it is to put together. Go for something else, your hands will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy, no refund with return","review":"I had been searching for this customizable solution for quite some time and had been happy Amazon was selling. However, when I received it, I found it very difficult to assemble. The pieces don't \\"click\\" in place and the plastic connector pieces are weak. While the sides seem sturdy, the assembly results in a flimsy build and I would rather put comparable money into non-customizable \\"wood\\" cubbies. I returned this item (long large box) in the mail using Amazon's handy label system. I made sure to tape over the label so that no snagging could occur and rip off the label, I made sure my return address was clear and the box well-sealed. I also made a note of when I dropped it off at the post office: June 16, 2008. It's now July 29, 2008 and I have not heard a peep from Amazon nor received my refund. Not the best service/experience I've had from Amazon. I just might stick to books next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storage 15 pair shoe cubby","review":"This item was a piece of junk.

They protect the shoes from dust, yet you can see each pair. They even accomodate large clogs, etc. Very easy to assemble. I have two."},{"rating":"2","title":"15 Pair shoe cubby","review":"I think this product is great. It's space efficient, holds at least 15 pair (more if you have kids shoes), and you can stack a bunch of shoes/boots above. This plastic is sturdy so you don't have to worry about it collapsing. Also, you can stack another unit above if you have more shoes. All in all I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small for anything except baby shoes","review":"I wear size 9 and cannot fit a pair of my shoes in one box .. they won't even fit in it sideways. It doesn't matter if it's tennis shoes, dress shoes or whatever, this product is not made for adult (men or women) shoes. 1 shoe per box will fit but not a pair of shoes.Even if it was the right size, putting together the first box was not easy. The plastic pegs hold the structure together so just imagine yourself trying to push in 8 pegs to make a box. Then once you're done try to push in the back piece without it popping back out.If you have shoes for babies then maybe you'll be happy with this product. I do not recommend this product at all, and am returning it asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TO SMALL for adults!!!","review":"I purchased 2 of these to organize my closets and what a mistake! First of all, they are a pain to put together. But after assembly I took them upstairs to start organizing my shoes. Big disappointment. The cubbies were way to small for my shoes. I wear a size 7 1/2 which is even below average and my shoes wouldn't fit. My husband's size 12 would have been a joke! So now I'm waiting for my 11 month old daughter to obtain 30 pairs of shoes because that is the only size that would fit into this crappy storage.

Then I started and almost sent it back. I just finished a total remodeling of my kitchen and putting these together was the hardest and most frustrating I've ever been. Also I couldn't find any instructions until I was on the 3rd level and they appeared stuck on one of the pieces, even though I'd searched for them when I opened the box. The finished product works nice in the closet but the built is awful. They need to rethink the plastic pieces, perhaps use hard rubber that would give a little bit so they'd be easier to get on. If you're not handy or impatient, don't buy these."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"For the money, I find this shoe rack to be really great! All of my shoes fit in the cubbies, except for my boots. It is sturdy and I love that you can customise the shape/size to fit your needs. It was a little hard on the hands to put together, but once you get it all snapped in it seems strong and durable. Overall, I am pretty happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would probably like it if I could put it together","review":"Thankfully, I have currently lost my voice, otherwise my children's ears would be burning with the swearing that this product would have generated.

I've been wanting to hone my writing skills and originally found this book at a library. As soon as I had it home and read through many of the articles, I couldn't wait to begin taking these \\"words of wisdom\\" to heart. The book is chucked full of articles dating back to the 1920's, and on into the 1990's. Some of the biggest names in fiction, non-fiction, and magazine editors. Includes a section of quotes from many of the best names in writing. Overall just a huge help to anyone interested in writing of any kind. Articles include insight into all writing styles and types. You will not be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and engrossing.","review":"I was completely trapped in this novel from beginning to end. Amanda moves into her new condo, and things just seem to take a turn for the worse, starting with the peculiar people next door. She starts losing time, first minutes then hours. A so-called bug bite on her thigh turns into a master plan that has nothing to do with an insect at all. Imagination abounds as the author keeps the reader on a twisting and turning path through the millennia.I was fascinated by the premise of this book, to tell you more would give away a plot that simply captivates and boggles the mind. The writing is concrete and fast paced, perfect for a page-turner. This is the author's first novel and I will certainly read her next. I would give this novel 4.5 stars if I had the option.

I am a fan of author's such as Dean Koontz and Stephen King. I have now added Ann Werner to that list. Her writing is intelligent, witty and succinct. I appreciate the fact the Heroin is a woman of maturity but also a woman who has a silly, crazy and adventurous side. Her writing reads like a movie and is very easy to picture. A very X files-esque story that is suspenseful and quite a page turner. I would reccomend this story to anyone who appreciates a talented story teller. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned A Lot","review":"I read this before going on a tour of the UK, and it was really helpful.

He had a bad itchy rash all over his body. I got the suggestion off a website. It cured \\"Chewy's\\" ringworm right away. It smells pretty bad though. But if you can handle a little skink then this product works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"I recently received my first bottle of neem oil. As stated by most of the reviewers the smell is awful. But, I have tried everything to get rid of the fleas, and at the same time, help one of my cats who is highly allergic to them. She was losing hair, and definitely not looking good. It's only been about 3 weeks since I started using this product and she is looking good. Her hair is starting to grow back and the cats are no longer scratching. My daughter had a chance to see her and couldn't believe the difference in how she looks. Definitely a major improvement. And while the smell is bad, at the very least it goes away after a couple of days, becomes much less noticeable. Also, in my opinion far better to use this then some of the commercial flea products, which could not only be bad for the animals but also their owners."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can be TOXIC and OH MY GOD THE SMELL","review":"This kept the fleas at bay for about 1-2 weeks, but had to be reapplied diligently to retain its effectiveness and to be honest, the smell and the amount of time required to use it was not worth the benefits. This product smells like the dumpster behind a Burger King. I am not joking. That is the first thing that came to mind when I opened the bottle. For heaven's sake, do not, under any circumstances get this on your clothes because you are stuck with a nasty brown stain and that Burgery smell. I made the mistake of applying it to the dog's coat while shampooing him with bare hands and it took literally DAYS for the smell to leave my hands. Also, after buying this, I learned that IT CAN BE EXTREMELY TOXIC TO ANIMALS! I would not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Smelling Poorly Packaged Product","review":"I have heard positive things about Neem oil, so I had high hopes for this product. I should have paid attention to the review about the bad smell. This product smells so bad it is virtually intolerable. I mean it really reeks. I can't see how anyone could actually use this on their animals. Further, when the product came, it was not even sealed. The bottle had SCOTCH TAPE wrapped carelessly around the top. THERE WAS NO SEAL INSIDE! I would strongly suggest someone wanting to use Neem oil try a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten bad odor-could not use","review":"The package was hot when received so maybe the neem oil was rancid from the heat. I could not put that on my cats since it smelled like a cross between tar and something horribly rotten. Possibly it could be used outside as an odor deterrent if one has problems w/ wildlife destroying gardens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible smell","review":"Decided to use on my 20 year old ailing cat rather than subject him to toxic chemicals. Product smells worse than sulfur and did nothing to repel fleas. I used drops on my pet's skin around the neck, back and base of tail rather than mixing with shampoo so perhaps that made the difference. I also used a waterless shampoo that contained neem oil before applying the neem oil drops. After allowing the oil to absorb into the skin, I brushed the fur evenly to distribute throughout. The neem oil drops ended up matting my pet's fur. I eventually just ended up combing the flea out shortly after it had gotten fat from recently feeding on my pet after several days of finding even more flea dirt than before applying the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"stinks but work","review":"My daughter's guinea pig came from the pet store expecting - and also had mange mites. Because of the babies, I couldn't use typical vet remedies to treat it and read about neem oil on line. It does really smell bad-so bad that her babies would not come near her for about an hour after using. It took a few weeks of treatment-mixing with olive oil, rubbing in fur and washing out- but it did get rid of the mites and the fur that had come out is growing back in. I would use it again if troubles arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as advertised","review":"It keeps the fleas away and I like not having to put crazy chemicals on my animals.

None of the other over the counter products were working for her itching. We mixed this with her oatmeal shampoo and let it set for a few minutes before rinsing and drying. It does smell like dirt or onions not totally gross but not fresh and clean smelling. Her coat and skin look great. The odor wears off in a couple of days. We also changed bedding to a natural product and stopped using wood shavings. Might be a combo of things, but she is much happier now.

After watching on DVD, I was suprised how good it actually was.

The result is very unimpressive. The book is a big bulky and heavy affair. It is cumbersome to carry and use. It costs ten dollars more than the Collegiate, and takes up more desk and shelf space. The illustration and type size seems the same as the Collegiate. I honestly cannot see any reason to recommend this format over the standard Collegiate. Like New Coke, this book is marketing's attempt to fill more store shelf space. Judging from its sales ranking displayed on Amazon, it seems the rest of the dictionary buying public concures.

I really can't imagine where and how one may use this knife. You can attach it to the pole and use it as a spear to kill a bear. Maybe you can use it strictly as a weapon against other human, I don't know. But to peel something, to cut something, to hack something-not really. Oh, you can use as a pry tool or a chisel.

A Great Way to Experience Beethoven","review":"Beethoven would no doubt approve of this fine collection of his thirty-two piano sonatas. Alfredo Perl gives passionate, thoughtful performances that rightly put the focus on Beethoven's music and not Perl himself. I especially enjoyed Perl's rendition of the Diabelli Variations, which is included on a bonus 10th disc; I found his interpretation of the variations to be one of the finest in recent memory. Moreover, at this price, this collection (over 12 hours of music) is hard to beat-- either as an introduction to the magic of Beethoven's piano sonatas, or as a fresh take for those already familiar with these seminal works. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice Box Set","review":"I have to admit I bought this because it is competitively priced, but I listen to all these discs becuase of the great interpretaitons.I do not own any other complete sets of the 32, but I have most of them on vinyl from many other painists. Perl's interpretaions are, to me, conservative stylistically (nothing eccentric) but he brings great warmth to each and every note.The sonics are very good, as well. As far as room ambience is concerned, if you had a 1 to 10 scale where 1 is a typical Glenn Gould record and 10 is one of those Nimbus records with gobs of room echo (like the sound of a pianist playing for a ballet class) I would place these recordings at about a 6, which is slightly more room ambiance than I would like, in the louder passages, but it adds something to the quieter passages.I think that these recordings will stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does this include?","review":"I really enjoyed the series. BUT, how can anyone rate a product that hasn't been released and doesn't tell you what you're getting? The advertised run time is only 180 minutes. That's 3 hours. I certainly hope it's a typo. if it includes all 4 seasons and the movies, then it's worth it. Otherwise, it's hard to tell what they will give you. Remember what they did to us for season 2 and season 4? I won't consider this product until they list what's really included. Besides, is it just me, or has the cost of Blu-Ray movies jumped up about $5 this past year (about 30%!)?

It was difficult but I managed to make it through the miniseries and 4 episodes before I just gave up on it. Everything about this show is terrible. The Camera work makes you sick, it's always spinning around and at weird angles. They should have invested in a tripod. The story is bland, the acting is bad, dialog is even worse. I usually love sci-fi, firefly, brisco county, terminator, but this show takes itself far too seriously and is stupid. I actually enjoyed Caprica which is the spinoff of this show, and the original which is pretty bad is about 1000x better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is NOT the real Battlestar Galactica!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This Is NOT the real Battlestar Galactica!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why didn\`t they call it Galactica or something like that? Think about it. In the Real Battlestar Galactica, Starbuck is a Man, The Cylons was not made by Humans, but by A Race from a Planet who hates humans. If you haven\`t seen the real Battlestar Galactica, Look for it and watch the real thing. This, Battlestar Galactica, from what I\`ve seen, is ok, but they should of called it something different. Watch and Enjoy what the real Series is all about. Don\`t get me wrong theres nothing wrong with this show. They could have named it--- Battlestar Galactica: In The Future; or Battlestar Galactica: 100 yrs. Later--- You know after the First Battlestar Galactica Ended, then tell what happened to The Next Generation. Thats what they should of done."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIssing Disc","review":"I just went through the entire box set and Razor was not in the box.

For all of the fantastic storytelling, this cast (and the casts on many modern shows) just don't know how to enunciate when they speak. The subtitles are invaluable, but are nowhere to be found on the final episode - exactly where we wanted them most. Very huge disappointment after enjoying the series up until this part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once of the best dramas on TV during the past 10 years","review":"I was an avid fan of Battlestar Galactica when the \\"re-imagining\\" was brought back to the screen in 2003. The writers and producers did a great job balancing what the original series was with the new vision. But after watching the entire series over the past few weeks, I've come to appreciate what they have done even more.Most peoples first knee-jerk reaction to sci-fi dramas is \\"nerd alert!\\" but this show was more of a human drama centered in space. The special effects are great, but they weren't the show. The characters were real; the heroes had flaws, the villains had there positive aspects and watching how they evolved and grew as the series progressed was extremely entertaining. A very enjoyable ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discs skip and have errors.","review":"I was looking forward to getting this and watching it for the first time. Im only on Disc 2 and already an episode freezes; the voices of the actors arent in sync to the visual picture. If this continues I will return it.Shouldnt happen at this price. I have a new state of the art blu ray player which plays everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re: The packaging","review":"Honestly, I did not find the packaging of this set as abysmal as many reviewers here would have you believe.The box itself does look rather large and clunky, however the lift-up top is an original idea and it does look quite futuristic, so I can't blame the designers for it.As for the cardboard sleeves, they are a bit awkward, however the blu-rays are packaged in snugly, and as far as I see there is no way the discs could be scratched or broken inside the box. The only \\"risky\\" moment is when you try and take the actual discs out of the sleeve.No episode lists or brochures inside is a definite minus, though - rifling through disc menus looking for the needed episode is no fun.Nitpicking aside - the picture quality and sound on this set are astounding, and that's what matters to me the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"The packaging is nowhere near as horrible as many of the reviews lead me to believe. Yes, it's a large box, but you can see that from the pictures, and I think it's a cool setup. The discs are in cardboard sleeves, but not tightly packed at all; no need to worry about scratching them. I almost bought this by individual seasons because of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I didn't listen. The only thing I agree with is that I wish it came with an episode/special features list, but this is easily found online.Very pleased with the blu-ray quality, and of course I love the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series","review":"Short and sweet:The re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series was phenomenal to put it simply. The series looks gorgeous for a normal DVD. The packaging looks pretty cool on the outside but on the inside, the discs are stored in individual boxes corresponding to the 4 seasons and are in these irritating according like cases which makes it in a challenge to get a disc out. On the top of the box in a coffin like cutout is a battle-damaged Cylon action figure from Diamond Select. The plastic on the figure feels a bit cheap but it's a pretty nice, articulate figure. If you have any other Diamond Select Cylon figures, the interchangeable hands do indeed work on the Cylon that comes with this package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for the entire series!!","review":"I never got the chance to see the series in HD, so buying the entire collection at this price was a great value. The only downside is that I wish there was more behind-the-scenes footage and interviews included, but then it'd be a 40 disc set instead of 20. The only downside is the packaging. I wish the box was smaller but you can remove the 4 individual season boxes for each and place them on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This series is one of the best ever made. From beginning to end, the viewer is kept guessing. Drama, intrigue, mystery, action, all wrapped around a well written plot. If you're a fan of the original Battlestar Galactica series, examine first WHY you lked the original. Unlike that series, there is no simplicity to this one. It is very in depth, with truly exceptional acting, and relative subplots. You can truly see the work and artistic effect in this series, and yet the actors themselves are so true to character it doesn't even look like acting. Superb series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging looks cool.... IT'S NOT!","review":"The photo looks cool, but this packaging is anything but that. the box doesn't raise easily, the seasons are not in hardcases and the inner boxes are very cheap. The discs are very difficult to get at unless you dump them all out. Most of all, the box will not do it's most basic function, protect the discs. Over time, the cardboard breaks down and leaches acid. Moisture in storage would be a killer. Makers never seem to learn that hardcases have to be incorporated into any special packaging. You pay more here for something that doesn't even work. The series is top notch, but there is no index or informational materials with all this packaging. This set also lacks a Cylon perspective disc coming later this year. There is absolutely no reason to buy this set. WAIT FOR THE HARD CASE SET that is sure to be released sooner rather than later. It won't even cost as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging Horrible","review":"Considering the high price tag, this box set should have at least included episode guides that tell which episodes are on which DVDs. The series is terrific, but the packaging is a disaster. For this lofty price, customers should not have to guess what content each individual DVD might contain. I am not planning to buy DVDs for Univeral shows in the future. I prefer companies that can manage to somehow list the content of each DVD. It cannot be that difficult. Every other television series that I have purchased manages to do so. As much as I love the show, this hideous packaging ruined the box set for me. The DVDs are also packaged poorly in cheap cardboard boxes. The show itself deserves five stars, but I recommend avoiding this disappointing box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica- The Complete Series. EXCELLENT!!!","review":"This series was absolutely excellent!! This was recommended to me by a couple friends so I bought it with little expectation and I was completely surprised how good it was. I actually rank it up there with one of the best shows I've EVER watched in my life. The only negative thing about it is that it only played for 4 seasons. I found myself so sad when I finished it because I didn't want it to end. The cast was great, graphics with the ship to ship battles were excellent and realistic, the storyline was superb with excitement and unexpected twists throughout. An absolute MUST watch, you won't be disappointed. Never mind all the complaints about the packaging it's not as bad as many of these critics are posting and this show is so good you'll be more than willing to overlook it. This set comes complete with the miniseries that starts the series and the unrated version of \\"BSG-Razor\\" movie to start season 4, Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"This was sent to me in 5 days and that was with free super saver shipping.

But the timing of arrival was earlier than was initially expected, it was well packaged (plastic bubble-wrapped which kept it from moving around), and was in great condition when it arrived (wrapping was in tact, not ripped or torn anywhere, and box was a nice presentation of the dvds and wasnt dented or fractured in any way).

I'd love to buy them by season, as how it was done on DVD. Why do the studios always lump everything into box sets on blu-ray?

Please, somebody at Universal make a good decision and release them by season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Packaging Workaround","review":"I'm not to going to review the set because I just bought it and I'm still working through the discs... However, for those with the gripes/concerns about the packaging, here's what I suggest (sorry if someone already posted this):- Open each season's box from the bottom- Pull the carboard insert (and discs) out- Carefully open the cardboard sleeves to remove the discAdvanced Tip:- I actually removed all 20 discs and moved them into a more suitable (albeit less pretty) storage unit. If you have something (like empty jewel cases) that won't scratch the discs, you can store the discs there and keep the box as centerpiece-J"},{"rating":"1","title":"fantastic series, not worth the extra price for blu ray","review":"Let me just say that I did not purchase the blu ray set myself, rather it was purchased as a gift for me (which I couldnt argue with). If you're thinking of buying this one on your own then think again...The series is fantastic, as anyone will tell you. However the blu ray edition is absolutely horrid. As most of the other reviewers have already noted the packaging is possibly the worst I have ever seen for any product I have ever encountered (especially disc based media).As far as the blu rays themselves are concerned, the High def is really not that impressive. The series was shot in high def but was intentionally made fuzzy and even blurry to achieve the look the producers wanted. The high definition transfer retains the original look and it literally doesnt add anything to view it in HD, and even may be a detriment.All in all save your money and buy the complete series on dvd, in the individual season box sets!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"poor packaging","review":"I had only seen a few episodes before i bought the complete series, but now i wish that i had bought the series separately. This is because the packaging is very poor, and is already beginning to fall apart. Also, there is no guide to what episode is on which disc. The box set looks nice, but it is worth the extra bucks to buy the seasons separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this gets lowered in price I might bite.","review":"This really should be 149.99When it hit's this price point I'll bite. Till then I suggest just keep waiting.Blu-ray in general needs to realize just because it's blu-ray you can't expect people to be okay with paying *that much more* DvD's sold because $14.99 is a impulse buy were has $24.99 is much less so. That and many people are re-purchasing movies that they already own in DvD and it's hard to justify upgrading in many cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frak you Universal","review":"Best TV series released this decade, period. Like many others I too was late to this party as I tried to watch it when it originally aired but quickly got behind & lost. A friend loaned me her recordings and I quickly finished all 4 seasons. I enjoyed so much I wanted to own it for myself....Now in this time where people are exchanging videos on the internet you would think it would be in the distributors best interest to give the consumer a great product to keep them happy. This disc set proves the axiom wrong.If you haven't seen this series, WATCH IT. But, PLEASE, try to avoid this set; it is slap in the face to the consumer and a tea-bagging to the show's fans.

Some discs damaged.","review":"As much as I would have liked to enjoy the show on Blu-Ray, it was overshadowed by the fact that it was impossible to remove a Blu-Ray disc from the cardboard packaging without getting fingerprints on the discs.This is by far the worse packaging I have ever encountered for Blu-Ray releases.To add insult to injury, some of the episodes did not play correctly at all. They would stop working and then skip ahead.The blame must go to the manufacturer. I am aware of a new Blu-Ray version of Battlestar Gallactica: The Complete Series is now available, and from what I can tell it is packaged correctly with hard plastic instead of cardboard and should be easier to remove to play.I was very happy that Amazon gave me a refund after all the aggravation I went through.I strongly recommend that you buy the new Blu-Ray version of Battlestar Gallactica: The Complete Series, and skip this one; it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Sci Fi of all time But doesn't include Razor","review":"I watched the whole series on Sci-fi. This really beats waiting up to a year between seasons. As for the story line this isn't the old BSG with tin men and Lorne Green. No one is innocent in this show. Even the Angels are killers. Everyone drinks, smokes and gets high (stims) while fighting off the rather ingenious robots some of whom can't be identified as non human. These robots think they are God's children and must annihlate the human race as a whole. Relationships,religion, even terrorism is addressed from both sides with interesting view points. A true work of art. Why 4 stars? because Razor was left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review of the packaging only","review":"Tho artistically very attractive, functionally this is a disaster.

I would still recommend this for any fan of Battle star galactica as the quality is far superior to the DVD set. It would look fine on a 40' LED.

I was one of the people who felt the ending was a bit of a copout, just writers who seemed to get lazy and didn't want to have to come up with something real, but fortunately it does't detract from the entire series. First two seasons were still my favorite, third was kind of slow and not as enjoyable for me, but they picked up again in season 4 until the very very end where they just blew it.But still a great series, and this is the best price I've found for the entire series on blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series!!!","review":"I really enjoyed Galactica.

The Bluray set retails for $350, and for that, the DVDs come in flimsy cardboard packaging which didn't survive shipping intact. Each of the 4 set boxes had the cardboard bend/deform inside because they insufficiently support the weight of the DVDs themselves. The box design is OK, but I'd probably put it in a closet. Alas, the DVD boxes won't go well on a DVD shelf and as I said, their packaging was already damaged as soon as I opened the box.This isn't a shipping issue - it's clearly a horrible design from Universal.

The creators didn't just drop the ball, they deflated it. The incredible anticipation leading to season 4 evaporated along with the storyline. The acting and special effects, still at a high level, became irrelevant. The plot and story line are so bad that it detracts from the continuity of the previous seasons.

Although, as we all learn in school, the Inupiat of Alaska's Northwest Arctic have played a significant role in American history, an Eskimo character is nowhere to be seen in this film. What a pity.

The old Battlestar Galactica was corny and bad acting; at least some people in the new BG are good actors (but definitely not most).

A supposedly smart woman gets breast cancer because she never got mammograms? Not very smart and very soap operatic. She also wore high heels and short skirts; she was a really stupid person.

It is unforgivable that they are not included, especially since what happens in them is so crucial to understanding Gaeta's character."},{"rating":"2","title":"the series","review":"it's a very good series.so,I'm going to review the set itself.a couple of the discs skip or freeze,they didn't seem to be dirty,could of been my player.the set comes with the movie \\"razor\\",so you don't have to buy it separately(yes ,I bought the movie when I bought the set).Here's my main gripe,season 4 starts with \\"Razor\\",then disc 2,3,4.there's no disc 1... disc 2 starts with \\"previously on battlestar galactica\\" there's couple of scenes from episodes I've never seen,and that first episode on disc 2 seems to jump forward a lot.So I really believe they left out disc 1.Someone that knows the series better than me will probably correct me on that,and that okay 'cause I'd like to know.All in all,it's a really good series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will this play on a BluRay player in Australia?","review":"I doubt we'll get this for a LOOOOONG time, so I'm anxious to buy it as soon as it's available.Any idea if it will work over seasons?I have bought DVDs from Amazon and they work fine, because my DVD player was not region coded. Not sure about my BluRay player.Thanking you"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Plan is not Included in the Complete Series set!","review":"We just purchased Battlestar Galactica, the \\"Complete\\" Series, or, rather, Battlestar Galactica, the Incomplete Series, because The Plan, which apparently comes out the end of October, is not included. No room in the guaranteed to scratch Blu-Ray case either, even if you purchase the new disc. I suppose, when The Plan does release, they will come out with the Battlestar Galactica, the More Complete Series for hundreds of dollars more. Fans want the series for the episodes, not for some idiotically-conceived package design. But thank you so much for the useless Cylon toy. What the frak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not the complete series....","review":"There's still another minisode and a movie coming out... this is not the complete series by any means. Save your money and wait for xmas imo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series. Terrible product.","review":"BSG is a terrific series, and deserves to be seen from beginning to end, but this collection is not the way to do it. I could see that the overall packaging was ridiculous when I ordered it, but I figured I'd just take the individual season boxes and throw the rest away. Unfortunately, the individual season boxes are paper, not hard plastic, and the dividers within them had already started to collapse by the time I opened the package. So I threw out everything except the disks and put them in my own plastic sleeves. Now, as I watch the DVDs I'm realizing that many of them are scratched, probably from putting them into such exotic packaging instead of using standard DVD holders. I could have saved myself a lot of trouble by just getting the individual season packages. Do NOT buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica, Captivating is the Only Word to Describe","review":"This isn't a big long review, because I don't do many. But this series is a must see, especially those who are Trekkies and Star Wars fans. I watched the entire series from day one 'with few eceptions' and I could not stand to hardly miss a new episode. The SciFi channel almost ruined it by their off again, on again presentation methods. but I prevailed. So watching from the beginning without all the breaks and commercials will be \\"Great\\". So I can hardly wait for it's release. For Blu-ray the price is not that bad, regular DVD would save us all a lot of $$$'s though. Whether you wait for a while OR buy it now is up to you and your budget. But you won't be disappointed whenever you do buy The Complete Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"why??????????????","review":"why do they insist on screwing us??all this money for what? a piece of cardboard?....a complete joke...... thumbs all DOWN....."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVDs Great, Packaging a Complete Disappointment","review":"The two stars are for the DVD quality. Both the audio & video is great. BUT, and it's a big but, the packaging is horrendous.To start with, the box is so big it will not fit on any shelf in my home. The boxes that the individual seasons come in are flimsy and the folded cardboard that holds the DVDs came apart for two of the seasons. Getting individual DVDs out of the box is quite difficult unless you don't care about getting fingerprints all over the DVD. There is no documentation whatsoever. Not even a Episode guide. You have to load each DVD to see what is on it.And, as far as the Cylon figure, several joints don't move at all so it won't stand. I guess mine is a dead Cylon.I wish I had simply paid a little extra to get the individual seasons so the DVDs would be protected and I would be able to find the episode I want to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica - The Complete Series","review":"I have not viewed the DVD's yet, but I know the series and it is awesome! The complete series set comes with everything including an action figure that thrilled my friend (who I gave the series to for Christmas)! The box it comes in is very unique, albeit a tad squished when it arrived in the mail - not Amazon's fault! Amazon always does a great job with the products it sells! And I got a great deal on the box set! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I had all but the last episode on standard DVD, I am so happy I decided to purchase this series on Blu-ray, thanks to Amazon for making this purchase so easy, I saved over a Hundred dollars and the order was delivered the day it was promised. Thanks again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but for the technical problems....","review":"This could be the greatest blu-ray set ever, but in around 20% of the episodes the audio is out of sync. On such an expensive collection, this is unacceptable. Furthermore, having ordered this from Brazil, i suppose a retun is out of the question. But I have to say, the image is cristal clear and the sound terrific otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"BluRay Disk do not play","review":"I finally got to season 4 and what happens the season 4 bluray disk do not play. Season 1, 2 and 3 did fine but none of the season 4 disk played. I looked at the disk and did not see any marks on them. Since this is such a big collection it took me longer than the return period to get to this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series, great transfer","review":"Late to the party, but this is one of the best TV series I've ever seen.

The fast shipping from Amazon was also great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Set is missing seasons/gives you 2 of one season","review":"The 1 star is NOT because I don't like BSG. No way. The 1 star is because I ordered this product while it was on sale, specially through Amazon, for $130. Quite the deal right. I don't know if it was just my particular product or what (and I would venture to say no since there's a message up on the product page right now saying it's under review and not sold by Amazon right now due to complaints) but my set is missing season 3 and instead I have a second copy of season 2. PISSED!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series, but it's not worth 130.00 for 4 seasons.","review":"Who the hell do these ppl think they are charging 130 for 4 season. I'm sorry but even when friends/scrubs/SG-1 came out at 10 seasons I don't think they were this expensive.Anyway that being said, great series, good action, great drama, it's not a 5 but damn close. Acting was very good, plot was kind of the same line as the original series, but they tweaked it a lot with the cyclons it wasn't just about the humans.I thought they did a pretty good job with the remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT show HORRIBLE packaging","review":"So I believe that it goes without saying, especially if you're here looking to purchase the entire series, that Battlestar Galactica is one of the BEST shows in recent history, and in my opinion the BEST science-fiction/drama. Previously a friend lent me the individual seasons and I loved them so I decided I wanted to get the complete series, but when I saw the packaging I was APPALLED! Its simply the worst. Flimsy and seemingly bad housing for the DVDs. And NO episode guide?! Looks aside, its terrible packaging.BUT, then I saw the UK version of the box set and frankly it looks a THOUSAND times better. Much more space efficient and packaging conscious and from the photos it looks like it has a booklet etc. This leads me to believe that the UK import is the way to go, my only concern was whether or not it would play on a fairly new American DVD player. Still not sure about that. Open to input."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome","review":"I'll be honest, when this was on TV I did watch it - but - the looonnngggg breaks between seasons and half seasons really took away from the show. Well, watching it from start to finish on bluray over the course of a few months has been an eye-opener. The series is SO much better when you don't have to wait a year to see 3 or 4 episodes at a time. I can now say this really is one of he best - if not the best - sci-fi series ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"I'm new to investing/trading and attracted to less esoteric metrics such as moving averages. I though, wow, a whole book devoted to moving averages, this should be great. To my disappointment, this book is really trivial. You won't find any deeper insight here than you'll find in a few pages of a general book on technical indicators. Save your money and put it towards one of the more comprehensive books from Murhpy or others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good review of moving averages","review":"For me, the book reminded me of the importance of paying attention to moving averages and changing from the standard 50 dma to others both shorter and longer. Also, the descriptions of price dips below a moving average that just started upwards is worth viewing. Like the prior poster said, he is new to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it worth the time and money","review":"Here are some of the topics it delivered on: Traders of every level will also discover how to:-Calculate moving averages--including the Simple, Variable, and Exponential-Use moving averages to identify price cycle bottoms-Identify support and resistance levels with moving averages-Spot trend changes with moving averages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing treatment of a great topic","review":"I agree with the author on the importance of moving averages being included in some way in every trading system, but the book does not present a clear use of moving averages. The problem may be that the author assumes the reader will understand the point he is trying to make with out much elaboration or that the fuzzy charts in the book will speak for themselves. Unfortunetly for me they did not. I received very little value for this book's steep price. You would do much better buying any of Dr. Alexander Elder's books or Stan Weinstein's book. This book is like a Cliff's notes on using moving averages, being little more than a compilation of notes from other books. By all means use moving averages to buy on pullbacks, but unless this is your very first book on stock trading I doubt you wll find very much value here."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BAD","review":"I SEEN FAR WORSE MOVIES THAN THIS.

AC-Delco is usually a quality product, but I guess that depends on where it's made. I bought it from my local auto parts store and I recall that it was made in China, but didn't think much since AC-Delco is a quality product. This time I'll pay attention to where it's manufactured rather than the name. The price of the pump is not that much, but it's the trouble of replacing it again and of course you'll need new coolant again."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast shipping great price","review":"Great deal from Amazon.

I had some girl friends over and they all fell out. When the lil boy cursed out the lady I could not take it I had to rewind it to make sure that was what I heard. This man is crazy and he should be locked up and the key should be thrown away. How does he think of this stuff so fast because you can tell nothing was reheresed. Even the scene in the resturant he just pulled it off like it was stagged. He is really good and very funny. It won't be long before he'll be on HBO or something else because he has skills like Richard Pryor and he is just as funny. I would highly recommend this dvd to everyone who wants to laugh just go to the bathroom before watching this fool. Great work keep it up and I hope to see you live someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad!!","review":"The expectations for this film embraced the word, \\"epic,\\" but all-in-all, this one missed the boat by orders of magnitude. As a film that was likely intended to show the \\"reality\\" of life during trench warfare in World War I, it is an utter failure. SO many missed opportunities here! This film came about as close to accurately portraying trench warfare as \\"Apocalypse Now\\" did in accurately describing the Vietnam War, which was positively ludicrous. In fact, this film is so bad that it makes the very limited combat scenes and trench warfare vignettes in \\"Sergeant York\\" look like an epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Costumes; Staging","review":"As a film, it's a weak jumble of poor directing, and I feel bad for the actors, many of whom gave earnest performances, but bad directing can make even the best look foolish. WHERE THIS FILM SHINES, is the costuming and the construction details of the trenches and bunkers. If you're in the theatre and you are dealing with a period piece, watch this for the uniforms and the sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie to skip","review":"As an Avid Military movie fan I've got to say, this movie ranges at the very bottom of a long list of stinkers. The time spent digging the ditch to film this loser in was totally wasted. I'm sure Daniel Craig isn't too damn proud to have his name tied to this movie. Actually Daniel really didn't do a very good job here as an actor. The direction is half-ass and weak. The edit must have taken a weekend at least. All together, the WORSE WAR MOVIE I have ever seen, and I have seen most available. Save your money and go out for a Pizza. Money better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks worse than a WW I trench","review":"A dialogue filled \\"action\\" movie is fine under certain circumstances. However there must be some depth of character devloped before anyone cares what happens to these Tommies at the end of the movie. Maybe the acting was meant to bring out the personalities of a couple of average lower class Britishers of the early 1900\\"s. It didn't. It was torturous to watch the one dimensional characters attempting to utilize an ensemble approach muddle through the mud, barely understandable in their thick accents. The director failed to engender any empathy for the characters, the editing was atrocious (see the protracted scene of the soldier killed in the trench by an artillery shell) and Daniel Craig mailed in his usual performance. Perhaps the frozen screen death scenes at the end were an attempt to give the viewer some chance to place the actors who just wasted an hour and a half of my time. All the circumstances were not right, nor was this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Beware the paperback version of this book. I don't know if all sellers are doing this but the seller I purchased from (The Book Depository) sent me the \\"international version\\" which apparently has somewhat different content than the \\"North American\\" version. Even worse, the back cover of the text explicitly states that this version should not be sold in North America.

I can give this cd a B- or B rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Time's a Charm for Ace!","review":"As a devoted KISS fan this album is second only to Ace's first solo album in my book. Every riff and solo is memorable with the classic Frehley guitar tricks I felt were missing on the first Frehley's Comet album. From \\"Insane\\" to \\"Juvenile Delinquent\\" to the trade-off lyrics of \\"Loser In A Fight\\" this album never stops rockin'. Todd Howarth captures the feel of the 80's glam rock bands in his songs like \\"Fallen Angel\\" and \\"Time Aint' Runnin'Out\\" which really rounds out the album. Also, the density of sound on \\"Second Sighting\\" surpasses the first Frehley's Comet album by far. If you love Ace, add this to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried on dog-didn't work","review":"This product said it could be used on dogs, as well as other animals.

I got a small rip in it the first week catching it on an office chair.-Bulky - Even if you carry more than average to/from the office, this bag is too bulky. The padding and several pockets and dividers add too much space.-No bottom reinforcement - For a bag that can hold so much and be used as a carry-on, it needs extra protection on the bottom for setting on the ground.

They are deceivingly robust and \\"hearty\\" (I have stored all of the swimwear I own in one), and they can help to compartmentalize \\"nuisance\\" items like socks, pajamas, or underwear. In my opinion they are best for clothing items, as the mesh would likely be stressed by hard surfaces.

Makes packing and navigating bag searches at the airport easier.Did take a while for the stink of plastic to waer off. I gave them regular baths in Febreeze. The smell did pass to my clothes. Again, a travel bottle of Febreeze solved the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped to pack","review":"When living out of a backpack for a year- it's good to have some organization. These packing cubes were great. good sizes for all my different types of clothes. Zippers would get stuck sometimes, but easily fixable. With them being see-through it was easy to see what was in each packing cube to find what clothing piece I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Rick's Convertible Bag (or your bag!)","review":"We own two of last year's version of Rick's Convertible Carry-on Bag. Lived out of them for 2-1/2 weeks in Europe each of the last two summers. We also bought TWO sets each of these Rick Steves' packing cubes, which exactly fit inside his Convertible Carry-on Bag (2 large and 4 small Rick packing cubes perfectly fit inside his bag - or eliminate one small cube to allow space for your dopp or toiletry kit in the bag.) If you are familiar with Rick's travel philosophy (travel light and carry-on) these cubes are a perfect compliment to his bag - or any bag you pack. They are see-through for ease of finding what you are looking for, and add virtually no weight to your bag. They keep everything organized, which keeps you from unpacking the entire bag each time you need one item. For more on Rick's travel philosophy and travel suggestions get his book Europe Through the Back Door. Invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packing Cubes are Surprisingly Helpful - and this set is the best price","review":"Regardless of which type of luggage I'm taking (rolling duffle or structured rolling bags) these packing cubes are extremely helpful with organization inside. They allow me to compartmentalize similar items like underwear in one cube, socks in another etc. I've also been happy with them for electronic stuff - I use one for powercords and cables (for laptop, Zen player, camera, mobile phone) and other small attachments like my memory card reader for the digital camera etc.Very useful - and I've had some of these cubes for many years so they do hold up well. I like the Eagle Creek ones a little better but the Rick Steves set is by far the best price. And, Rick Steves is a travel guru by the way - if you don't own some of his books you're truly missing out. They are the best travel books on the market. Check out the Graffiti board on his website for additional info and a taste for his tips and recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"When I first received these I thought they would be great because they are a little more spacious than most other brands.

The black would not wash out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising capacity!","review":"These bags hold a lot more than I first thought when I received them. They worked great for keeping things organized, both in my suitcase and later in my (Rick Steves!) backpack.

I'll be buying more of these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells horrible","review":"Bought these for a trip and while the design was nice the Cubes all had a very strong chemical/petroleum smell which I assume is from the material used in manufacturing.

A must have","review":"These travel cubes are genius! Anything with Rick Steve's name on it is good quality and a must have. These are super light weight and practically collapse down to nothing.

There's lots of packing cubes on the market but you can never go wrong with Rick Steve's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent packing cubes for the Convertible Carry-On bag","review":"I use these packing cubes with my Rick Steves Convertible Carry-On bag, and I like them very much. They do a great job of keeping my things sorted, they fit the bag perfectly, and they weigh virtually nothing. Keep in mind that these are designed to be used in the Convertible Carry-On, and as other reviewers have noted, they may not fit so well in other types of bags. Nonetheless, they are a good value for the money and a great accessory to the Convertible Carry-On, if only to help make sure all your clothes don't fall to the bottom of the bag when you carry it in backpack mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Steves Packing Cubes","review":"Packing cubes are the way to travel and I like the variety of sizes in this set.

The cubes were the perfect size to fit into a carry-on suitcase, and they held all of the clothes that I needed for a week. My week was so much easier because of these cubes - since I was visiting three different cities, I had to re-pack three times, but there was very little hassle involved, even though I bought souvenirs in each city. The cubes allowed me to get clothes each morning without messing up the rest of my packing job, and to put the clothes away each night just as easily. I highly recommend these for anyone who wants to travel light for a week - I don't know how it would work for longer than a week, though. You would probably need more than one set if you plan to use it to hold your clothes - or you could use it just for underclothes or shirts or something like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more compression bags","review":"In the past, I've used compression bags to organize my clothing when traveling.

Bonus: if you get your bags searched, these come out neatly and go back in neatly so you don't have to miss your plane while you re-pack.We use these Rick Steves cubes every time we travel: they've held up without issue, and the different sizes are useful. The see-through mesh is also particularly convenient, and you can flip them over to hide your embarrassing boxers and whatnot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable & useful","review":"Purchase this back in 2010 and has been on many trips since then.

From the beginning the first cup of espresso is cold, unless you go though a ritual to get it hotter. The manufacturer said this was just the way it is now designed.Then I noticed that after using it, there was a puddle of water underneath. La Pavoni sent me to Thomas Cara in San Francisco, and said he was their representative. HE curtly said he was NOT their representative. But he described a defect in the Stradivari design - the heating element is made of stainless steel and the bottom fixture is brass - so they cool at different rates and frequently leak like mine was doing. So there is no good fix for this $800 espresso maker.Thankfully, Amazon has been very responsive in taking the unit back, and I expect a full refund.

I cannot recommend this set over other installments, particularly the Chinese option with its secondary English audio tracks (You guys know the one, right?).

The second hand is ticking...but it is not moving, just sitting in the same spot...tick, tick, tick. A few taps with your finger get it going again. However, since this happens several times each day, it is impossible to keep accurate analog time. I know that this style of Casio has been around since atleast the mid-1990's. They used to be very durable and a bit more expensive back then. Casio apparently has changed something in the movement to lower the cost...and as a result, ruined this classic timepiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"I remember this watch when it first came almost twenty years ago. It was cool as heck back then and is still very cool. I think the best thing about this watch is that it's a really good looking timepiece. Whoever designed/engineered this watch all those years ago really created a classic look. The gold dial makes it look and feel very expensive which it is not. Quality Casio construction is and added plus. I'm not sure how functional the digital readout is because it is quite small but still legible. Amazingly the mechanical-analog movement and the digital movement, once synched up, never lose synchronization...pretty cool.The only gripe I have about the watch is the band...which is simply too small for me. I'm ordering a NATO/ZULU style band for about $15.00 and that will take care of the band issue.I wish the watch wasn't battery powered.

Bands are lousey and break in short order so get a new band to replace it and keep it handy. Price from Target was $20 cheaper than Wally world and that included shipping. Some complain of not getting a good seal when replacing the battery and that will allow moisture into the watch and fog up the crystal.

I rarely ever take it off while performing tasks such as working on cars, washing the car, mountain bike riding, swimming, and hiking the local mountains and deserts.

The background hum is actually louder than the hum I had with my old cheapo Radio Shack amplifier! With my 12-volt battery, however, the device appears to meet its low-noise specifications. So, I'm using it with a battery. Serious inconvenience!Also, the phono stylus they supplied for my Shure V15 Type II cartridge doesn'tfit. A total loss.

The steps are bolted to the deck and not made to remove everytime you want to clean. As far as entry into the pool, the steps are great. But definetly not worth the problems they cause. Think carefully before you purchase. I paid $380 and am trying to work out a deal with where I bought them to return them. I would just about as soon take a big loss.

In fact, some is poorly done and uninteresting. But when I recently put together a surround sound setup, one of the first things I did was to look for some new music that uses surround. There's not much. There's something from Philip Glass, and there's a reissue of some old, wonderful Subotnick works. But the most advanced recording I've found so far is this Immersion release. These are some of the most vital new music composers active today, and they actually created all these works specifically for this release in surround sound.

Perhaps the company that put this compilation together put out a call to the music industry asking for their most unlistenable material. Well we have some real winners here folks!

I don't understand why so many people like this book. How they can like this book is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST pieces of crap I have ever read","review":"I was forced to read this in high school and it was awful. The characters behave idiotically as if they have no common sense. Liberals including my literature teacher love this book because of of the pro-communist and \\"blame the white man\\" views. I'm not white, and I still found it impossible to relate to Bigger. Young adults would enjoy books more if they weren't forced to read bad novels like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"well.. someone who murders anyone..out of panic either (which is a really stupid, irrational reason) does not deserve any sympathy. I felt the book was mainly about black people hating white people..as usual. now, tell me anyone....if there was a book about a white person facing discrimination in Africa..or being killed because stones are thrown at them, then everyone would look down on them. poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing","review":"As a social-political event, this book is worth reading, but as a piece of literature it's awful. The language is moribund; all the characters' emotions are described outright instead of revealed; the plot is slow and plodding; the communist sections are tendentious. The book is dated and overrated as literature. It isn't literature at all, but something of an artless manifesto, as James Baldwin aptly described it years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger desrves all the stars he can get!","review":"I obsolutly love this book, it is so graphic and electrifying. I definitly do not think that this book in any way is about \\"black violence\\", it's about the corruption of American Dream. It puts you into the body of Bigger Thomas, so you can feel every single emotion he has. I loved Bigger's character and I forgave him all the killing and lying. the book is also very realistic and honest about communism not being the evil of the world, and Mary's \\"good\\" parents being ignorant, phonie and blind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye opening but boring novel","review":"This novel is worth reading as it describes the hardships on blacks in the early 1900s. It is somewhat touching but it is really boring and I fell asleep through it many many times. I had to get a copy of Clff Notes to help me get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"in- your- face portrayal","review":"Native Son was on the \\"recommended\\" list for a grad class, so I was expecting something dense with vocabulary words and filled with symbolism, a sort of intellectual interpretation of gender and race.What I got was an in-your-face portrayal of Bigger Thomas. The separate parts or \\"books\\" vividly convey Bigger's disenfranchised childhood, his \\"break\\" as a young adult, and the events that lead to his demise. I gasped and bemoaned Bigger's very movements or utterances dozens of times, wanting so badly to stop knowing this story but at the same time completely incapable of putting it down. You have to find a way to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book!","review":"I really liked this book. It told me a lot about things that were done back in the 1900's. I believe Bigger Thomas was not looking for trouble, but it always seemed to find him. It was an excellent book. I would definitely recommend this book to others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Invisible Man Instead","review":"This story is told in three books. After the first book, when Bigger is caught, the story plunges into a anticlimax. The story stops completely. This is the first and only book that I didn't finish reading.I recommend Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"Wright's language and his ability to see into his character's heart-while showing us why Bigger Thomas does what he does-makes this novel classic, and one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel put a wrong twist on murder and rape.","review":"This novel gave the impression that murder and rape are okay just as long as the people you kill were mean to you and you are stupid. Bigger had no just cause of the two murders he commited and no matter what you have been through or the color of you skin you have no right to kill two very innocent girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"not surprising","review":"I was almost convinced of a different ending.. I did enjoy reading this book, But I do also think that many minorites think the way Bigger thought,. Not much has changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound Ideas About Segragation","review":"While the first two-thirds of this book is rather dull and slow, it is worth it for the last third, which is the trial. Techniques used by the State to convict Bigger Thomas of the murder and rape of a younger, white woman, is as interesting as Bigger's lawyer's explanation of how Whites have caused these flaws in the Black society. Very informative and emotional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book for my husband. I vaguely remember seeing a few minutes of the movie when I was young and I thought it might be something he would enjoy. He feels the story is unrealistic and over-dramatized. Also, the language was repeatedly offensive and my husband put the book down after about 20 pages. I disposed of it. I do not recommend it for anyone and certainly not for young people. Denise Massey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, yet offensive.","review":"I found Native Son an interesting short story, yet I was offended by the violence and the foul language which seemed to be littered throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't be the best thing","review":"So I had to read the book, as an assignment in my english class. I really don't recommend anyone to read the introduction of the book. The introduction is garbage, it talks about why the author wrote the book, So I skipped a few pages in it. Bigger committed a few murders, big deal!The book didn't get interesting till the end where Bigger Thomas was at the court room with Max. Max did put up a good fight and stood by Bigger throughout the whole thing. I think the true stars of the book were Max and Jan. Jan because he wasn't mad at Bigger for casting blame on him and Max because he treated Bigger like a human, and totally out shunned the State Attorney.The book showed the oppression of blacks throughout the 1940's, yes the book was hella boring but it thought a good lesson, treat people with respect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"near perfect","review":"Wright brilliantly portrays how the racial struggles of this century are not as simple as our generation likes to believe. It's a complicated mess molded by years of abuse. A vicious attack on racism, Native Son is a must read because it redefines its definition. In fact, perhaps the most dangerous racists in the novel are the self-professed \\"colored benefactors\\". All accusations of the novel promoting communism are absurd. Wright simply presents the reader with an interesting condradiction that an atheist communist defends an obviously christian principle unsupported by the white Christians in the story. The one weakness of the novel, however, is the fact that Bigger does not represent the average consequence of the years of predjudice. Still Richard Wright creates a graphically honest masterpiece describing the racial tensions decades after the removal of slavery."},{"rating":"2","title":"native son is avery extordinary book","review":"this book expresses the feelings and emoptions that a young man go thriugh in aprodominantly white society, I really enjoy this book, because many odler people i have known had went through the same trials and turmoil the main character has gone through. I find that richard wright is a brilliant writer he understands how to exploit human nature,and how the human race or society can drive a man wild. Each chapter in the book takes on a new riveting turn in the plot, it shows how man changes during times of struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing literature that will open your eyes and awaken you","review":"This book has an amazing plot and it will definitly keep you awake! Not recomended for week stomachs however. Many grusome details, but it is truly the reality of young boy caught up in his emothions. There is also a 20 page testimony of one man talking near the end. That takes a while to get through. This book is not for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential text","review":"an extrememly important text that needs to be read. grat intergratoin on behalf of the author with theory and producing a interesting text in the process. the third part brings the text down with its didactic tone but aside from that it is a great book. wright's influences shine through on this one. tones of existentialism emerge and Poe resonates int eh first and second books. it is not only about the hardships faced by the african american at the turn and middle of the 20th century, rather how an indivudiual must fight and yet deceive oneself in order to function in society. it is also a great book for political science, sociology and pre-law types due to the fact it shouws the influecne of environment upon the individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very well written book with a major philosophical defect.","review":"While Richard Wright does an excellent job of writing the book and depicting Bigger's (The main character) feelings and motivations, he has a major problem: He portrays Bigger as a human without a conscience both through Bigger's thoughts and through Max's (Bigger's lawyer) testimony. By doing this, he (shockingly) arrives at the conclusion that Bigger is not responsible for his two gruesome murders. The one redeeming quality of the book (when it's not graphically depicting violence and sex) is that it inspires a large amount of thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and Thought Provoking","review":"It's been a decade since I read this book (I am planning on re-reading it soon, which is what brought me here) and I can still recall the impact this book had on me during the first read. The intersection of two very different lives - the young violent protagonist (?) and the misguided clueless rich girl and the events that follow. The scenes where the girl and her boyfriend are unwittingly patronizing our protagonist, their attempts to let him know he has their unwanted compassion so at odds with the survivor realities of his world so that they are almost (unknowingly) mocking him are just incredibly awkward and telling about our world in general. I can remember groaning out loud as the angry young man makes mistake after mistake, desperation clouding his judgement, yet his actions realistically parallel with real lives one reads about in the newspaper year after year. Excellent book - highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Reading this book for high school English last year, I was struck immediately by the raw immediacy of Wright's style. There is no superfluous detail, no interruption in the taut suspense that he maintains from almost the first page. Some criticize the book for being too simplistic and say the characters are poorly drawn, but this is intentional-Wright forces you to read between the lines and actively search for meaning in the senseless violence and hate that pervades the story. The tripartite structure of the story (Fear, Flight, Fate) is strikingly parallel to Orwell's 1984, with the same basic plot and three divisions. Native Son is definitely the best work of American 20th-century fiction I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SON OF AMERICA","review":"As the author of a debut novel that deals with social inequities in contemporary America, I believe Richard Wright tackled that subject better than any other writer has before or since in NATIVE SON. Mr. Wright tells the story of Bigger Thomas and the world of poverty, discrimination, and desperation in which he is trapped. When he murders a white woman in a moment of panic, there is no way for Bigger to escape his doom. NATIVE SON takes on what America was like in Wright's time, an America eerily similar to the America of today in too many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wright is right","review":"Richard Wright's America is still here. July, 2008- events of today could be taken from this novel or his short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Native Son","review":"The book is riveting and paints a great picture in the reader's mind about the plight of the African American living in the big city. In some parts, Richard Wright carrys on, frustrating the reader. However, Wright has many good descriptions in the book and, despite this rambling on, holds the reader spellbound with his raw descriptions and social commentary. Any person interested in the plight of the African Americans and the sociology surrounding their oppressed existence must read Native Son, and should also explore his other works(Black Boy-Uncle Tom's Children and many others)."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"As I write this review, I am sticky with the honey that will not come off.

This is a historical study focused on the role as played by women in the Spiritualist movement and one of invaluable studies of femininity.I have observed that it is not an easy reading and can be dense in some area, but the flow of the book didn't waver from the subject on hand. There are eight chapters with an introduction and an epilogue. At the end of the book contains notes and a bibliography that takes up over 60 pages to which backs up the author's thesis. Personally, there are two chapters that became of immersed interest to me: \\"Theobald Family\\" and \\"Louisa Lowe's Story.\\"It's a great work and recommended for those who are interested in the history of spiritualism, channelling, and/or femininity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not a 2 CD set, eh?","review":"This CD is more or less a \\"best of\\", though to fit that description, I think 3 or more discs would fit better. Cuts on this album come from 4 of Christy's wonderful mid-80's string: 1983's Time Has Come, Ride On ('84), Ordinary Man ('85), and Unfinished Revolution ('87), which are all out of press in the US, & rare in Ireland. If this CD perks your interest, grab the 1st three, plus his 1972 solo debut, Prosperous. Ride On was my first exposure to his music, and is still my fave. This little collection is nice, but just not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide variety of styles on one c.d.","review":"I wanted to get an Irish c.d. for my mother-in-law for Christmas. My brother-in-law is an avid Irish music fan. He is hip to the Irish scene in Boston. He told me to get her a Christie Moore C.D. The C.D. came to the house, and to my suprise Christie Moore is not a female. I was quickly impressed with his voice. He has a voice that is rough as sandpaper when he wants it to be, or as smooth as silk for a ballad. I liked most of the songs on the C.D. Most of them were not composed by him, but come from leading composers in Ireland. I especially liked Biko the song dedicated to Steven Biko. It rivals the Biko song done by Peter Gabriel. I also like the one song Moore himself composed. A good beer drinking pub song if I ever heard one. Since I am not familiar with too many popular Irish composers I don't know how he ranks abroad. But to my U.S. ears he is very talanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing Irish voice with strong Irish thoughts.","review":"Christy Moore's voice is a pleasure to listen to..the brogue enchants, the music transports you to the Ireland of yesterday and today. The lyrics are the key to understanding the Irish feeling of wanting peace but remembering past and present outrages visited on the Irish Catholic population. While lamenting the loss and pain of the Irish struggle Moore reminds us that \\"only the very safe can talk about wrong and right\\". This album is a plesure to listen too, but will makes you think and feel also. You will listen again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christy's a genius!","review":"Christy performs well-loved classics like \\"City of Chicago\\" and \\"Ride On\\" on this CD as well as upbeat and fun \\"Lisdoonvarna\\" and \\"Delirium Tremens.\\" This album got my husband hooked on Christy - it was worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"What a fun read!

You've got the Slayers and Morbid Angels with their pulsing, baroque soundscapes but not much in the way of songs.

This is the joy of \\"Under The Influence\\", Overkill's career best album. From the slow grinder \\"Shred\\" to the fast-paced \\"Head First\\" to the insanely catchy \\"Hello From The Gutter\\", \\"Under The Influence\\" was and is one of my favorite metal albums of all time.

Razor also gives us a thrilling glimpse of the first Cylon war, seen through the eyes of a young Bill Adama, complete with old style Cylons.The DVD has a fair amount of extra footage that was not in the broadcast version, amounting to about 13-14 minutes total.

Besides, I'm a man of few words. I'll just say that this is an excellent addition to your Battlestar Galactica DVD collection, especially for those of you jonesing for another hit since that pan-out from the last episode of Season Three.Some minor quibbles; a few things could have been fleshed out a little better, in my humble opinion (as far as character development), and Adamas senior and junior having a tiff has become a tad formulaic. Given the time constraint with this one-time show compared to a story arc of 13-20 episodes, however, there's not a good way to get around that, thus I don't hold it against 'em.Like I said, romp-roarin' good show. Worth picking up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RAZOR is a cut above for a side movie .","review":"this was really a brilliant idea.its brilliantly done also.how does a crew get to where it got too.its not just plot device."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice addition to the story","review":"I confess that I was disappointed that they destroyed the Pegasus in the story later. But this story makes a good addition to the series. Still I did like the story but like always, I think the series could be better. Some of the magic I felt in B5 or startrek is just not there.Still the story is interesting. I liked the twist at the end when the cylon gave some clues into what will happen in the next season. I also like the way that in this series they often do kill off major characters. It causes a few dramatic moments in the series.The method of explaining it with flashbacks is novel and works well.The filming is reasonable, not brilliant.The acting is also reasonable. There was no actor though that I thought was outstanding.The characters development is as in the series in general only reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Enjoyed it","review":"Razor was definately worth watching. I really Enjoyed viewing Lee Adama as commander of the Pegasus. The loss of the Pegasus so early in season 3 was a mistake and Razor helps to make up for that.I also really enjoyed seeing the older model Cylons for a change. As a geeky kid who enjoyed the orginal seires (Lorne Green) I was ecstatic to see the throwbacks.Kendra Shaw was an awesome and interesting character and it was nice to see Starbuck not whacked out. The dogfighting scenes and some of the brawls on Pegasus were riveting.Now the show has one annoying little thing that has permeated the whole reimagined series. I miss the old classicalmusic theme for the original series. We catch pieces of it here and there but it needs to show up some more. Guess I'm getting a little old.All that being said this installment of BSG rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"BSG is excellent but Razor is a bad made for TV movie. The three minute webisodes before season three on scifi.com are better. I just saw it in a theater in Seattle. Much of the movie is a montage of people walking to martial music. Characters blatantly contradict themselves - at one point in Razor Adm. Odama says he's not sure he can blame Adm. Cain for making \\"hard choices\\" while in command. She ordered needless torture that yielded no material benefit. That's flat out wrong, and Adm. Odama has previously said so. The second telling of the Cylon attacks is a poor shadow of the miniseries, which I could watch over and over again. The series main characters mostly play background roles, except for Lee and Starbuck. Roslin has her contractual minimum number of lines. The new Lt. Shaw character they introduce is flat and doesn't have time to develop. I just canceled my pre-order for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor, sharp as...","review":"Well worth the purchase. This movie is a good addition to the series because it actually adds to the knowledge content in the Battlestar Galactica Universe as a pose to just providing more income to some franchised production. The story of Pegusus and the admiral unfolds further. Also you get a tantilizing taste of what's to come"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Very dissappointing. After waiting so long for more Battlestar, which is the best series on TV, Razor left a lot to be desired. Uneven pacing, disjointed story-telling, and none of the new characters were very interesting. Wait until this is on Sci Fi again and save the $."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two more hours of the best show on television","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that said it was like two more episodes from season two, rather than a standalone movie--but this is hardly an insult when episodes are as good as they are with BSG.Without spoiling it, Razor does a great job of filling in open spaces in the BSG plot. One gets to see more of the reasons why Cain did what she did, but the writer's aren't trying to excuse her actions as much as they're trying explain them.I'm certainly looking forward to the extended edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"On the surface this seems like a thrilling script, but suddenly the plot involves love interests between female leads, etc. Don't do it. just move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can get BSG 3","review":"If you really want BSG season 3, log onto Amazon.co.uk and get the European Version, then when it arrives crack the code on your DVD player and away you go.

One word: Craptacular.","review":"It's an hour and ten minutes into a two-hour program, and so far, there has been none of the heart-racing, suspenseful, tenterhook moments, or the fascinating character developement that we've all come to expect from this series. It feels like they're trying to throw a bone to all us fans who are impatient for the next season to start. It feels glib and overdone, and a little dumbed-down. They threw in a few scenes here and there with Apollo and Starbuck to make you think you're getting something. Like actual drama and suspense. Alas. Too bad.Here's hoping the extended version has a little more depth and content."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSG is no BS","review":"This show has hooked me like no other show since the X files, it's well written and the characters are just perfect, sure i won't be dissapointed with Razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor conceptualization and execution","review":"Utter disappointment. I consider myself a fan of this show and had hoped for the coherency we've come to appreciate - this wasn't it. So much jumping through time I was looking for my jump rope! The writers never gave us time in each setting/mini-story to connect or understand what was happening. Unless you live, eat and breath BG, you're likely to be lost in this movie (I gave up after an hour and wished I'd done so earlier). Honestly you're better off buying videos of the seasons than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling stuff twice","review":"This review is NOT about the series, which I love, but about Univesal questionable marketing decisions.As they did with the 2003, two hours miniseries, Universal shall make money twice out of this. First they'll sell the RAZOR movie as a standalone product, and a year later when they release the 4th season, they'll include it in the package (or in the first package, if they break the season in two as they did with the 3rd season.)I'd rather wait then."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable..","review":"although released between seasons 3 & 4 of BSG, the events on 'Razor' take place during season 2.

I'm still biding my time 'till season 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor is well worth the wait","review":"This is a must see for the Battlestar Galactica fans.

A must have for the collectors of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Movie!","review":"I could totally watch this movie over and over (and have). It is a stand alone product, meaning that you don't have to have seen the whole series to know what is going on in this movie. It is included in the Fourth Season if you are already planning on buying the DVD's. I would recommend to any sci fi buff. Acting was superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMO you should watch this before watching season 4","review":"The movie was not bad - the only part that I found slightly annoying was the one that involved the young Bill Adama (very unconvincing IMO).The scenes with and about the hybrid were pretty captivating and the show needed to fill that gap IMO (and it did it nicely in this movie). I would recommend watching this movie if you're planning on watching season 4 (which you probably are:) )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Money, money, money, money - you get the point","review":"Any business is about making money. Money is what gives us all the wonderful things we watch on TV, listen to on the radio, and yes, even download on the internet.

It's time we made our opinions known.I'll be surprised if this gets published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story...ridiculous price","review":"Universal again demonstrates that it doesn't understand how to price digital media.

Helena Cain became the hard-as-nails woman she was and how Gina (the imprisoned Six) came about being the person she is. Also, RAZOR gives the viewers a chance to see whether the rumors of the Pegasus are true or false.Anyway, a must see for BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"A great story that got away from all the Cylon Soap Opera the series had become.

This one however is a disappointment. In a straight track chapter the plot is usually complex, leading somewhere, and the characters seldom follow the most obvious path. Razor is an extension on pegasus story which is re-digested, off the main course, and putting more visuals on plots that we know already. There are no real surprises, and even though it is will played and directed it is hard to hard to jump up and down on a \\"re-run\\". It is like buying a whole DVD just for the extra features (and no feature presentation)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica - Razor (Unrated Extended Edition) DVD","review":"This is an excellent film for fans of Battlestar Galictica, and a nice hold over until new episodes start in March."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battlestar Galctica \\"Razor\\"","review":"I didn't find the special FX to be of high quality.

The who BSG series is not even believable. It is so dark and depressing. As a die-hard original BSG fan, I remember the orignal serious, yet optimistic, and somewhat humorous, with great special effects.This whole series, including RAZOR (or CRAZOR) is just weird. It seems like Peagasus and Galactica are filled with a bunch of drug addicts, drunks, and seriously mentality unstable people. I mean, talk about a ship of fools. Also, in the name of DIVERSITY and PC they took the roles of BOOMER & STARBUCK and the Admiral on the Peagsus and made them female who all seems to be constantly PMS'ing.WITH ALL THAT SAID, the special effects are usually great...what little they show, between that drunk StarBuck and Col. Tie going at it and the other freaks and misfits.If I were a ship captain in that fleet, I'd jump and surrender to the Cylons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase - Its included in Season 4.0","review":"Don't waste your money... As is the case with previous BSG seasons, SciFi Channel has repeated this content...Razor (uncut or regular) is included in Season 4.0!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Cain Dig It","review":"Razor is the type of experience that will remind you why you fell in love with newer iteration of the BSG universe. Superb acting, poignant cut scenes, mostly-seamless special effects, and haunting prophecies. Admiral Cain is completely believable as a hardened and somewhat reckless admiral. And believe it or not, her questionable decisions are adequately rationalized, though still not agreeable.My only complaints about Razor was the look of the old cylons. I know they're from the original show, but they seemed a bit too shiny in this film - sort of like plastic action figures. Also, the brief scenes with a young Commander Adama were lacking. If you had no problem with this in the webisodes, you'll probably be fine when watching this film.Great experience, and definitely better plot-wise and CGI-wise that many of the made-for-theater movies I've seen this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED","review":"Our family loves Battlestar. We don't have cable, and last year we watched it by buying the episodes on iTunes.Now the addlebrained bozo running the network / studio thinks we are going to pay $15 to download in a format that we cannot play on our iPods?Right.This one we may rent from Netflicks, but downloading at this price -- no way. Sorry Unbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"Disappointing camera work and film quality - more like what you'd expect if you're viewing the deleted scenes part of a DVD. Not well acted. But if you're enjoying the series, you're probably going to get stuck with this low-quality piece of gosa."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only one of the new series to equal the original.","review":"Absolutely breathtaking! When I first saw this I was amazed. \\"Wow!\\" I thought to myself. I have always liked the new series, but I was still hung-up on the old series, and still am. But this is the one that turely equals the spirit of battlestar galactica. Not only do we get an action-packed story, but some insites into the first Cylon war, some history on Adama and Cain's past, but also you get a real fill of Apollo's command abilities as he takes over command of the pegasus. Apart from a few scenes here and there, you never really got a good episode that turely tells you how good of a commander he was. Until now. Plus the new character, Kendra Shaw, was an amazing one as well. You also get to see a couple of old fashion Cylons. The new Cylons are better, but it's nice for a fan of the old series like me to see the old ones back again. Great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"The DVD is excellent. Definately shows a lot more and the best part of course is replaying any part that you need more clarity on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent viewing","review":"Battlestar Galactica Razor is an awesome movie. I watched it twice in two nights. The flashbacks to the attacks on the Colonies, as well as from the First Cyclon War, are excellent viewing. As usual, characters are presented realistically - they keep getting their hands dirty by making the wrong choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"As a casual fan of PM5k, I was really disappointed in this. You get the videos, which is cool, some solid live footage, and a bunch of goofing on their fans. There are also some footage of fans who sent in videos of themselves which are pretty pointless and bad. Absolutely no in depth interview footage of how the band operates. Some studio footage would have been cool. After watching it 1x I sold it on Ebay. The highlight of the entire dvd is when Satyr from Satyricon says that PM5K are a \\"bunch of hillbillies that play loud , aggressive music\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad the first time you watch it","review":"I bought this movie on vhs (...)and i was highly disapointed.

There is a cool video bio of the band but it is narorated by a alien voice(which is real hard to understand). Anything the band members talked the vocies were altered beyond the point of understanding. There was no interviews or studio footage.

A waste of my good $12 dollars that I could have spent on a haircut. To sum it up I was skipping through the tracks hoping that I would find a good song. But the way they (Young Gunz) tried to trick me was by having catchy beats to mask their poor rhyming ability. I should have known. Rap music is has sucked ever since \\"BIG\\" died. I want Rap to go back to its story telling days when rappers talked about their life to show others the right and wrongs of street life. Not Poppin Cris or Glorifying selling drugs or being a fake gangster. What made me even more mad is they have the nerve to wear JMJ's attire on a wack album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Time For JayZ to find some new rapping talent...","review":"Well, the Young Gunz basically suck. Their lyrics are very weak and wack and the choruses they come with are extremely lame. They also have very generic voices and flows which make for a boring listen. The production as a whole is decent at best. However, this album is 100 times better than the atrocity that is Memphis Bleek - 534. But it's still not good.JayZ needs to clean the rap house and get rid of these 'guys' that call themselves rappers. He should keep Kayne, Sigel, and Freeway and then cut the deck and start recruiting. Young Gunz & Memphis Weak just don't have what it takes to carry simple songs let alone the entire Roc for years to come.

Without a lot of promotions many people doubt what potential an Artist has. The first single \\"set it off\\" Was fire, that showed that they were here to stay, I just wish it would get more play time on MTV, MTV2, BET, and other music shows. Other songs that I really liked on this CD was \\"tonight\\", \\"Same SH** Different Day\\", \\"Grown Man part 2\\" \\"beef\\", and \\"We Still Here.\\" The ROC is still alive and in time there are going to be the dominant record label again.

But this cd is okay I just think the cover could've been more Christmas like and honestly Janet's vocals get annoying her notes sound so forced and struggled I think Faye gave the group a better harmony.

Some of the chapters are useful - if you are a woman and want to write about women's issues - but the areas where they deal with non-women-focused interviews, quotes and advice seem as they were thrown in as an after-thought - somewhat as if the manuscript was finished and the editors commented that they needed SOMETHING for SOMEBODY who isn't a feminist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to get you started...","review":"Over the last week or so, I've been reading The Complete Idiot's Guide To Publishing Magazine Articles by Sheree Bykofsky, Jennifer Basye Sander, and Lynne Rominger.

The book had a cute premise with Regina's friends setting her up with her fantasy, but those friends quickly became annoying. They lost control of the fantasy fix when Regina met Dimitri at a club and left with him. The friends resented that and harrassed the main characters for the rest of the book. Additionally, there was too much of the mental dialogue and on Regina's side it was often written for laughs, or smiles, but fell flat. I couldn't understand why someone like Dimitri would take a second look at her after listening in on her mean spirited thoughts at the club. I was more than tired of Regina's immaturity by the time the book was finished. The sex scenes were disappointing if you've read more than one book in this genre and overall they were hurt by the lack of chemistry and the unlikeable heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Fix - Christine Warren","review":"This is the first book by Christine Warren, but it certainly won't be the last.

Little do they know that one actually exists! What follows is a funny, sexy, heart warming tale of how Regina discovers that true love transcends all boundaries - even interfering friends and the fact that her lover isn't exactly human.I fell in love with this book because of it's humor, sensuality, and honest look at the pitfalls of being in love.

There was no measles epidemic, no child died in their care. Amy and Laurie's daughter, Bess, was 3 years old and never attended Plumfield, but when she visited the kids adored her because she was so sweet and beautiful. There were enough interesting plots in the book to draw from without making such huge changes. The love story between Jo and her husband was actually very interesting. They could have done flashbacks to how they met. It was a shame to leave out the example of a beautiful, lasting marriage just for the sake of making a possible love interest out of a handyman. It lost the point that some of the kids who didn't have parents found new \\"parents\\" at Plumfield.

Even with the pop hits such as Round and Round, Slip of the Lip, Dance, and Lay it Down, they still had a certain edge to them, which sorted them from the cheesey hair metal bands such as Winger, Poison, and White Lion, just to name a few. The Hair metal scene was beginning just starting to peak in 1988, and this is where Ratt seemed to cross over to a more toned down, and much more corney sound. Gone where the edge of such songs as \\"I'm Insane, \\"Between the Eyes\\", and \\"7th Avenue\\", Ratt begins to lose their signiture sound. There are some bright spots on this album such as \\"City to City\\", \\"Way Cool Jr.\\" \\"Chain Reaction\\" and \\"Bottom Line\\" but the rest is nothing more then listening to a glorified Poison or White Lion album. But then again its not \\"Detonator\\" ENjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is where they lost me","review":"I had been a fan of this band from the EP, but this release changed my attitude. The pop overtones that began to leak from Dancing Undercover really come to the forefront. Perhaps it was the polished production, or the poppy chorus to 'I Want a Woman.' And although their musicianship became clear with the bluesy 'Way Cool Jr' that song was just too much of a departure for my taste. Otherwise, nothing stands out on this album- all the other songs had the same tone and there was no variation to Pearcy's vocal range- not that he ever had range. Same old, same old. I longed for the heavy stuff like \\"Wanted Man\\" or \\"You're In Love\\", but there is none of that on this album. They were clearly out for radio play here, and it shows badly. More Warrant than Megadeth- a bad move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple for a band like Ratt !!!","review":"I really liked the opening track \\"City to city\\" but that was it !!!

There is tremendous bias here. No real scholarly authority exists among these people to give them the capacity to state the claims they do. They grasp at any straw in order to speak ill of the historicity of the Bible. This is a group who examined the entire canon of the four Gospels and claimed that only \\"Our Father\\" is likely a valid quote of Jesus'. Those involved in the creation of this book are self-important liberal theologians making a name for themselves and grinding an ax against the conservatives in Christianity they do not like. If they had some case to make, I'd respect it, but there isn't one here, so I dismiss this as bad research and a lot of personal, angry opinion.

Red balls meant \\"I think Jesus said it\\", Black meant \\"I don't think Jesus said it\\". Pink and Grey indicated varying degrees of uncertainty. One legal ground for invalidating a jury's verdict is that the jury made its decision by lot. The rationale for this legal requirement is that such decisions are highly suspect, not the product of detached reflection, and very likely wrong-headed. The Jesus Seminar made their decisions in a manner which would rightly be rejected in any court of law in the United States.

I to was also a second string Quarterback to a very talented and I always was outside the spotlight. The movie did have its far fetched moments but over all it was a great movie. The actors were very good and the football sceens were very realistic. I liked it so much it beat out my old favorite movie TOP GUN.

There are plenty of good ole boy hysteronics and football action to keep the male audience focused, a couple of pretty girls and of course James Van Der Beek and Paul Walker to keep the girls involved. The two keys to this film that set it above other films of this nature is the performance of Jon Voight as the thoroughly unlikable Coach Bud Kilmer and Ron Lester as the big, soft-hearted lineman Billy Bob.

It is a cool movie if you are a senior in high school but it is so fictional it is funny.

It's about dreams and living your own life. James Van Der Beek is John Moxon, a high-school senior who plays football in small-town Texas because it's family tradtion. But secretly he reads Vonnegut and hopes to get into Brown University. The situation is not helped by his verbally abusive football coach (Jon Voight). The coach hates him especially beacuse he stands up to him. The guys on the team get away with almost everything, like drinking, seeing strippers, etc (and yes, that's true to life).

It wasn't bad enough that the brains behind the franchise keep making more Pokemon, most of them ridiculously stupid. Then they tried to force \\"light\\" and \\"dark\\" Pokemon on us, which is very superfluous. But they keep making these super powerful legendary Pokemon, and then putting them in these movies in situations where they seem so weak. Why? I don't get it.They should make these movies where the focus Pokemon kicks butt. Like the first few movies. Mewtwo, Lugia, they were beasts. Even Entei represented well.

Boy was I wrong; this watch is a beast. Besides a battery change, I've never had any issues with my watch. It keeps nearly perfect time and has never broken, hiccuped or missed a beat.The titanium casing is very light, therefore switching to a heavier watch will take some getting used to. Its light enough to forget your wearing it. The watch itself is very durable and the boasted 200 meter depth is not a lie.

All of the playing here would definitley appeal to musicians. In other words, these three guys are a tight progressive rock band.The lyrics are often based in spirituality, usually Christian based, but are never \\"preachy,\\" and can appeal to those of different faiths. Other songs are based on love and human relationships, which can also appeal to many. With all these strengths, I'm not quite sure why they've never been big. Oh, well.

First, the recording's sonic quality isn't brilliant: a) the loud choral passages - notably 'Dies irae' where the bass drum sounds like cannon shots - are rather scratchy; b) there's an annoying background noise common to most recordings made in '50s and 60s, which sounds like water boiling (but that's audible only on headphones); c) the voices are uncomfortably distant, as if the singers were performing in an upper gallery. Second, Leinsdorf's tempi in the 'Requiem' passage in 'Libera me' and its conclusion are so fast that even Nilsson fails to uplift us. Pity, because the rest of the performance (81 minutes) is stupendous, notably that of Bergonzi, whom I nominate as 'THE Royal Verdi Tenor'."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same","review":"not much action nor history but marginally better than their other films...Another day at an reenactment..except your feet don't hurt after.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"I had to return this belt.

What I got with this DVD - a bizarre version of Hawaiian country line dance complete with stomping feet and hokey music which the instructor calls \\"Hula Rock\\". I made it about five minutes in and then switched to a different exercise DVD. I love exercising to music and have exercise tapes and DVD's from Tanya Tucker's Country Workout to The Goddess Workout (bellydance) and was hoping to add the hula to my collection, but this isn't it.There is no doubt looking at this woman's muscle tone that she gets a good workout, however anyone looking for a relaxing or beautiful dance in this video needs to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"modern hula","review":"When I purchased this video I was expecting to learn something about traditional hula but what I got was modern Hula.

The action scenes are described with very little detail in my opinion. A vampire huntress is endowed with all the special physical abilities but these aren't conveyed properly by the action scenes.

I was so captivated I immediately downloaded the next book on my kindle as soon as I finished each book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Neteru book","review":"Again, Ms. Banks has created an outstanding work of fiction. She is able to bring her own unique spin to the vampire mythos to fruition with The Hunted. \\"Blinding\\" Damali is a stroke of brilliance and gives her yet another obstacle to overcome. I also loved the fact that we are able to learn more about the Guardians' role as Guardians, especially Marlene, the mother figure of the book.Once again, however, the dialogue is the major sticking point for me. While it's dynamic and true to life, I find it a bit tedious after a while and hard to follow when more than one character is \\"speaking\\". To me, there is very little in the way of personalization and uniqueness to the characters with regards to the dialogue.But, overall, I admire Ms. Banks' contributions to vampire fiction and look forward to many more great books in the Vampire Huntress series."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ...","review":"I'm only a third of the way through this book and I can't read anymore of it. The so-called street talk just destroys any interest level. I would expect street kids to speak to each other this way, but not adults in an adult conversation; ain't; girl get yourself in here; I ain't trying. Just thorough garbage.

Ms. Banks takes fantasy to another level, I call it unbelievable. The Double Plunge, Damali is a vampire, no she's not, well she is but she's not and Carlos is, but he can be changed back.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE AT ALL. I HAD TO SKIP THROUGHT THE ENTIRE BOOK AND GET THE TORTURE OVER WITH QUICKLY! I WAS SO LOST,I KEPT SAYING TO MYSELF WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT!

Has a much more shadowy, midieval feel to it, portraying a cold, archaic, beautiful landscape. Production not as lush as subsequent releases, but perfectly suits the mood of the songs. Each song is outstanding, right down to the interludes \\"Silhouette\\" and \\"Requiem\\". My first Opeth album, a great place to start for fans of any kind of Scandinavian metal. Not a weak point to be found in the entire disc, you cannot be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Metal!!","review":"I had read all the reviews and the hype on this band and this particular album, and I figured that there was no way that the hype could be true. Man, I was wrong.Within the first minute of the opener \\"In Mist She Was Standing\\" I was hooked. Unbelievable guitar hooks, killer death/black vocals, and amazingly inspired and atmospheric acoustic interludes all come together to create an almost otherworld of heavy metal goodness. The songs on this album are killer, and progressive at the same time, and never get boring. The guitar sound is a bit more biting and melodic than some of their later works, and in no way does it ever sound like a debut album. Like other Opeth albums, give it time, and you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orchid","review":"This is an oldie by Opeth, but if you're an Opeth fan - who cares.

Although I agree that morningrise is the better album, in some ways I prefer the sound of orchid. Orchid is a little less dark and has a little more jazz influences than their other albums.Those of you who don't like growled vocals, still give Opeth a try, the vocals form an integral part of the music.If you are not a fan of the progressive rock genre, then try My Arms Your Hearse instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Virtuous use of acoustic and electric guitar melodies, power chords, death vocals, and so many other things I haven't yet come close to understanding.

The author throws out many obscure names, and expects you to know who they. He goes on and on about the authors of the period and their respective eccentricities. The reader is treated to countless pages about who so-and-so was friends with, and what tea party they attended that evening. It simply fails to help the reader appreciate this remarkable period in America's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"history book for the historians","review":"This book can be described as a history book for the historians for the simple fact that it has too much information for the regular reader. The book reads more like a text book then anything. The author will mention name after name, but without giving proper introduction of who the people are, leaving the reader lost unless they know their history to a great length. The book also has some shortcomings on how much of it is about harlem, rather it is about the leaders of the Harlem Renaissance. As the preface mentions the book could have been subtitled (or titled) Civil Rights by copywrite. This would have been a more fitting title for the author focuses more on the great literature at the time and its authors then anything else. While the book has a ton of facts, and an indepth look into many works, I failed to gain much insight into the events that the book is writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.k.","review":"Interesting to see about the actual people who were involved in the Harlem Renaissance, but the author uses so many names that it gets confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"door guide","review":"The door guide works great, with lots of choices for location.

Conery, Cage, and Harris gave excellent performaces. Harris a little short of an oscar in my opinion. I hold the musical score in high reguard as well.

It has alot of action and some pretty gorey scenes. This is only for people who have a like for violence, it is not a classic. Sean Connery does a good job but the plot of the movie isn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like there is a big void!","review":"To be honest, looking back at this 90s action/thriller, i come to think that Hollywood was easily ammused with fireworks, bombs and guns in a storyline. Add some big names into the mix and an acclaimed director and guess what, the movie fails. The Rock, plainly based on the world's fate or San Francsico for that matter, it just about a bunch of guys trying to evade the green rocks from exploding and causing mass chaos and nucleur reactivity.I admire Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery because their acting can sometimes be of higher class (Adaptation, From Russia with Love), but acting in a thriller with the worst storyline of the 90s changed my mind of watching big names in summer action blockbusters. If you like the 'bangs' and have no moral taste in movies, than surely this is for you. I give it two stars for the mild action sequences provided, not even by the actors but by the stuntmen, without whom this film would be impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie totally didn't need a Criterion version","review":"Note: 2.5 stars, but the .5 is for the Criterion edition itself, the extras and the mastering.The Criterion Collection has always put out great movies from great filmmakers; Jean Renoir's The Grand Illusion, Fritz Lang's M, Jules Dassin's Theives' Highway, and now... The Rock? And on top of that, Michael Bay's The Rock? Michael Bay for years has epitomized big-budget, badly acted schlock whose only attraction is being loud and full of explosions. Formula movies at best. It was fine for what it was, and Sean Connery is always cool, but it totally wasn't Criterion."},{"rating":"1","title":"vanessa marcil","review":"I just watched this film for Vanessa Marcil who plays Nicholas Cages girlfriend in this film.

Nicolas Cage, with Sean Connery(a man who knows Alcatraz like he knows his foes), Michael Biehn and a team of professionals go to The Rock and try to get the missles and stop Harris from killing innocent people. some stupid oneliners but otherwise its great with a car chase, missles flying, people eating toxic green balls. it has everything a action movie cooks up. theres a great team of other actors like William Forsythe, John Spencer, Vanessa Marcil, Tony Todd, Bookem Woodbine, John C. Mcginley, Steve Harris and Anthony Clark(who is gay and funny in this movie) that cook up those ingredients and give us a good ride"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Solid Action Movie","review":"\\"The Rock\\" is a very solid action movie, it could have been better but it also could have been alot worse.

I absoultely love it 2 bits. I have watched it maybe 10 times and I still love it. The action sequences r stunning and the plot complex and vastly entertaining. But the best thing about the film are the characters. Connery and Cage's characters are excellent 2 watch and it is hillarious how different they r. Connery is the...SAS ultimate solder and Cage is the timid...\\"lab rat!!\\" Fab movie and defintly one of the best action movies of all times. Another refreshing thing is that the characters r really well developed and throughout the flick u begin 2 understand them and begin to bond with them. Da bomb!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, probably THE BEST action movie. EVER. PERIOD","review":"The Rock is the best action movie yet that you can rent. Scratch that, its a sin to not buy it. Sean Connery plays his usual role. Dashing, debonair, slick, cool. And Cage plays his usual role. A little psyco. Ed Harris is also excellant. If your an action movie fan, buy this movie. Also, look for Desperate Measures, Air Force One, Con Air, and Face/Off."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 10 best action films ever","review":"Absolutely one of the best, original, most exciting films I've seen.

Only Nic Cage gives this film any sense of worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"More mindless Hollywood dreck","review":"Other than a lack of dialogue,character development,a decent script,a realistic storyline or any point in having been made at all, this is a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its all about cinematrography to create the suspense","review":"The plot of the Rock is fairly simple as a general played by Ed Harris seeks compensation for the solders whom have died throughout several of his missions. In order to get compensation the general and his army occupy Alcatraz and point rockets carrying a lethal chemical toward San Fransisco. Sean Connery plays the man who escaped from Alcatraz years ago and must guide Nicolas Cage who plays a chemical weapons specialist back in to the prison, to disarm the weapons. There are several stars playing smaller rolls of soldiers in this movie, which make it interesting to point them all out. The movie is more of a suspense movie, with a car chase and some action thrown in. Something that most people will miss in this movie is the beautiful cinematography, the angles and the movement of the camera makes it so much more dramatic in the suspenseful parts. The only DVD feature is the theatrical trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but unbelievable action scenes","review":"The reason this movie fails to get a five star rating from me is because of its extreme action scenes. Some examples of these are: when the trolley explodes, when Mason (Connery) crushes half of a parked car, when the F/A-18s pulled away at the very last second (it would be impossible in real life), and when Stanley (Cage) isn't hurt from the final explosion at the end. The movie would be five starts if the scenes above were more refined or devloped. However it did have great sound and great performance from Ed Harris. The bottom line: if you like well-developed, realistic movies, don't see The Rock. However, if you are in to non-stop, explosive, in-your-face action, then by all means see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cast, so-so plot","review":"The Rock is a great movie. Between the excellent cast, the action, and the location it really has something for everybody. The only thing that I felt was not on par with the rest of the movie was the plot, which is kind of important. I have no doubt that soldiers get frustrated over circumstances outside of their control but I don't think this situation would ever occur. Yes, it's fictional movie, and the movies of around the year this was released had a similar 'feel' to them, but there's just no way a general would do such a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"My wonderful bride surprised me with a trip to San Fransico for my birthday.

Yeah, I said it! Many of you thought so in one form or another when you saw Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys, or Armageddon. Their movies wreak of contrived melodrama (the massacre of the squad inside the prison), weak plot (get in, get out), weak dialogue (with a few mild attempts at humour). How can a movie be exciting if it is utterly predictable, and so insipid and ludicrous that it is unbelievable? If you want a real action movie, watch Die Hard!

We can all say that the story of this film is kind of simple, but almost all of the action movies have a week plot. The difference is that how much that the director can express the frantic, the thrill, and the action. Some people say that The Rock is one of the best action movies of the century, and I think so too. Micahael Bay and Jerry Brukheimer, these guys are real clever. These kind of action films are hard to find in the video shop. I give it 4 out of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film to see time after time!","review":"I really, really, really like this film. I love everything about it.

IT CLAIMS TO BE WIDESCREEN, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS ENCODED AT A FULLSCREEN DVD RATIO WITH LETTERBOXES. Not only does this waste space, but it gives the picture actually a smaller resolution than it should have as a DVD.

I owned the full screen VHS version of The Rock, and then I bought this \\"widescreen\\" DVD. But while watching the DVD, something looked suspicious so I compared the \\"widescreen\\" DVD and the fullscreen VHS side by side on my DVD/VCR combo player. What I noticed was the framing for the DVD and the VHS was exactly the same, except the black bars on the top and the bottom of the \\"widescreen\\" DVD covered up footage that could be seen on the upper and lower portions of the screen in the fullscreen VHS version. So a caution to people who want to buy this DVD: DO NOT BUY IT. More and more of these scams are arising, especially with MGM releases of movies on DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great action movie to watch over and over","review":"This is one of the best action movies I have seen and was the first dvd I ever bought.

Action-packed, rock-em, sock-em movie worth watching repeatedly. It is that good. One major flaw on this dvd - it's not anamorphically recorded, hence you're stuck with watching it with nearly half of your tv screen blacked out. Why hasn't the publisher released it in a widescreen anamorphic format??? Were they to do so, even now, I'm sure this title will blow away most other action dvd movies currently available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cage, Connery and Harris at their best!","review":"I thought this was a terrific movie, excellent performances by 3 superb stars...however, the movie is loaded with profanity that goes overboard, there was no need to use constant profanity to move the movie along.It would have been just as good without the excessive 4 letter words!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's got all the story a movie needs","review":"Few words are necessary to review this movie. It's almost one of a kind. The best thing is probably that Ed Harris plays his role so well, that everybody is on his side at the beginning of the movie because of the reasens he takes over The Rock.

Armageddon was a horrendous piece of donkey dung, everything that's wrong with Hollywood was detailed in that schlock! The Rock is a slightly different proposition, it's entertaining and never tries to be anything but! The story is thin and the dialogue is typically bad at times. The action is excellent and Sean Connery makes the movie work! The direction is very Mtv, the editing is silly at times - what's with the quick cuts? Why can't I enjoy the compositions? Pathetic! But still, the pace is consistent. The acting is okay, Connery's presence elevates the material. Ed Harris is always dependable and Cage is pretty funny as Goodspeed. The music is very patriotic and but fun. Overall, entertaining, switch your brain off! After this, Bay descended into familiar MTV garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action ride, sound is amazing!","review":"This is a great story of personal redemption, laced with awesome action sequences and spectacular sound.

The best thing about it is the Cage-Connery chemistry, the best action pair, I feel, since the Murphy-Nolte pairing of 48HRS. Sean Connery is extremely funny with his charisma (his best performance since Untouchables), and Nicolas Cage plays off it very well. Unlike Armageddon, Michael Bay's fast-paced tone and fast camerawork is not overkilled and it is effective. The action scenes are well done, especially the car chase near the beginning and the slow-motion massacre in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie is Great, the extras aren't","review":"Since several other reviewers have already talked about the movie, I just wanted to mention the extras that you get with this DVD collection.The Rock is a great movie by far, and if you own a surround sound system, this is definitely a great DVD to get. The extras on the DVD, however, are disappointing. Most of them look like they were filmed at the last minute and done by a second rate studio. For example I really wanted to see the \\"Do's and Don't's of Hollywood Gun Play.\\" It was very difficult to hear it however, since they filmed it at a gun range when people were firing. The \\"Out Takes\\" were not at all funny; most of them were Ed Harris screwing up his lines and yelling at Director Michael Bay.If you must have The Rock on DVD and can't find it anywhere else for a lower price, go ahead and get it. But only get it for the movie, the extras aren't worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the Rock.","review":"This is a great movie. No Academy Awards, no Golden Globes, nothing. This movie has it all. A great score from Gregson-Williams, another great movie Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson. then, you have Sean Connery. COme on, if he is in the movie, it's going to be good. He was awesome. Nicholas CAge was good in this movie, too.I must say, if you like a good story, some good movie music, and good acting and directing, then, this movie is a must for anybody. Oh, it being an action movie dosn't hurt, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but a little Dissappointed with the DVD","review":"_The Rock_ is a good movie, with good actors and a good story. Nicolas Cage plays the role of a Govt. Chemist who gets roped into helping the Govt. deal with a renegade General, Ed Harris, who has stolen nerve gas and intends to use it.The have to break into Alcatraz in order to recover the gas. In order to do that they have to enlist the help of a \\"criminal of the State\\" played by Sean Connery.All of this turns into a wonderful action movie with a bit more to the plot than your average summer movie.The DVD however left me a little dissappointed however, as it and the Movie was not that much different than what I had on tape.If you don't own the Rock then get it on DVD, if you already ahve a widescreen verion of this movie, I would wait until it became a bit cheaper to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's my all time FAVOURITE movie","review":"This movie is original and keeps you glue to your seat. Definitely worth your money. The action will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Awful DVD","review":"I Recently added this DVD to my collection having seen it before many times. I won't go into plot details, you can read the synopsis or other reviews for that. I will once again state how great of an action movie this is with intense actions scenes, great visuals, a pounding musical score and just sheer entertainment value. I am EXTREMELY dissappointed with the DVD release which is horrible. Single Disc? Non- Anamorphic Widescreen? No DTS? Trailers and Gallery a Special Feature?. This movie is begging for a proper release. Hopefully we'll have a 10year anniversary edition or something in 2006, at a reasonable price of course. Maybe that's aiming a little high - its nice to dream though."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT KICKS SOME SERIOUS AS*!!!","review":"Not only, does it mix a great storyline, with some of the best camera angles, and action scenes.

It's not the normal pops, clicks, and hiss you'll hear from material dubbed from 78s.

By the time this one came out, her career was definitely heading towards the downward spiral. The only problem: this album is actually really good and full of some great dance gems.

However, if you can get a copy of this CD, THE BOOK OF LOVE, GIVING YOU ALL MY LOVE, INCOGNITO, and NIGHTS LIKE THIS are great songs...and very danceable and trendy. So, give this album a listen, you'll be glad you did...and I am sure Stacey will appreciate the extra donation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of nonsense electronic beats","review":"This album is not an exciting one. \\"Give you all my love\\" and \\"you wrote the book\\" are ok.

The lever feels completely loose, in that there is no engagement into anything that I can tell, that would cause it to lock the current height in place.In effect, this overbed table is unsafe and useless at any height other than its lowest tabletop height of about 36 inches.In summary, it's a 36-inch high tabletop.

Trivium seem to be oblivious to this. At this point whose cdrown of the genre. Trvium it aint.despite some admirable solos scattered tthroughout the album is dragged down by nu-metal staleness and over familiar stylings. The vocals are pretty weak and when the vocals cleaning they sound forced and irritating. the screaming is old news if tollerable. but despite the bands best efforts to keep it from being boring the band doesnt have much to offer. Trivium is sadly another nail in the brief light seen from the coffin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fireball to the brain","review":"This album is an extraordinary concentration of all that is, and ever was, metal and hard rock. This disc is an effortless and harmonious blend of everything from Hatebreed and Slayer through to Maiden and Kiss and everything in between. The band not only impresses with technical virtuosity - precision riffs, slick solos, incomprehensible drum fills exploding all over the place - but we are also treated to catchy tunes and well thought out lyrics. All the more impressive when one considers how young the band members are. There may be nothing really new in what Trivium offers us in this album but it is executed so irresistably well that any accusations of jumping on the metalcore/emo band wagon become simply irrelevant. They do it so much better than anyone else. From one moment to another this band makes you want mosh, headbang, slam into the nearest wall, dance your best 80s party groove and put your lighter in the air. Totally inspirational from start to finish"},{"rating":"2","title":"In Flames with a bit 'o Slayer","review":"This infectiously melodic, yet aggresively heavy metal album is by far the best thing to come out in a while from a newer, more mainstream metal band.The Florida-based quartet mix classic thrash elements with more modern sounds similar to that of In Flames and Chimaira.The band opens with an instrumental tune primarily piano and acoustic guitar based- but don't let it fool you!!! The second track plunges right into a hour of throaty (and some clean!) vocals, crunchy shred guitars and double bassed drums.Favorite tunes of mine are: Drowned And Torn Asunder; Ascendancy and Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation.Defintely a good pick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy Wonders!!","review":"My album picks so far for '05 are Kreator, Enemy of God, and this exceptional platter.

They are an overrated metalcore band that sounds like all the other \\"groundbreaking\\" crap out there right now.... I think what really throws me off is the vocals.... He sucks as a screamer, but not a bad singer... So, I say just sing.. Don't scream, you sound retarded......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Matt Heafy, get the fudge out.","review":"To start with, the instruments on this album are great. In fact, if this was a strictly instrumental album, I think it might get four stars from me. But there's this guy called Matt Heafy in the band. And his \\"metal vocals\\" annoy the hell out of me. The guy can sing just fine (listen to \\"Dying in Your Arms\\" or the Roadrunner United tune \\"The End\\"), but everytime he starts to do that metal bellow it just makes me want to listen to far better metal men like Dez Fafara (DevilDriver) or Randy Blythe (Lamb Of God). Maybe they should get a new singer, maybe they should pursue another road. Regardless, \\"Ascendancy\\", as is, is a broken album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Metal-Core","review":"If you enjoy listening to ordinary and derivative music with cliched vocals that alternate between growling and melodic, you will love Trivium.If you still get a kick out of your old Slayer, Megadeth, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Morbid Angel, Motorhead, Metallica, Death and Carcass albums, you'll probably find Trivium boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Stuff","review":"This was my intro to Trivium and what an intro it was. I actually got it at Barnes and Noble and listened to some song samples there. Well I was hooked and was pleasantly surprised that I could find Metal of this caliber at a bookstore. I bought it and listened to it again and again since. Parts of the album remind me of Dark Tranquillity, and some of the vocals remind me of Phil Anselmo's voice from Pantera. But those are not complaints. Trivium has a fresh sound that manages to be original throughout. If you are a Heavy Metal fan I urge you to check out this album. It's pretty damn sweet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trivium Ascends Above The Others.","review":"Having seen Trivium put on an awesome show at Ozzfest and loving \\"Like Light To Flies\\" and \\"Pull Harder On The Strings Of Your Martyr\\", I was so stoked to finally get this album. I was instantly hooked by it. This is without a doubt my favorite CD of the year so far. There are many great songs on here. Besides the aforementioned awesome songs; \\"Rain\\", \\"Ascendancy\\", and \\"A Gunshot To The Head Of Trepidation\\" are also highlights. There isn't one bad track on the album, but at the end it does seem to slip the slightest bit in quality. It's still good, though.I wish Trivium all the success in the world, and all the good word of mouth they've gotten is well-deserved. You should definately give them a chance and pick this up. The more you listen to it, the more you'll love it. They're excellent live and in the studio. I recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album...Completely Loved It","review":"I heard about Trivium from a friend, and he said that they had a lot of guitar licks that sounded a lot like Metallica. Needless to stay I was skeptical. But I was completely blown away by this album, the second by Trivium. From the earie intro of The End of Everything to the explosive finish, this album rivals a lot of older CD's and is far and away the best metal record in recent years. Their vocalist (although most of the time it is impossible to understand him) is great and sounds a lot like Hetfield in Ascendancy and Dying in Your Arms. Their guitarists are great (it reminds me a little bit of Slayer). The drums are crisp and on time and there bassist is pretty good. This review dosn't even come close to describing how great this record was. If you like Metallica, Slayer, MegaDeth, Slipknot, Mushroomhead etc. you will love this album, guarenteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for Musical Effort","review":"I was looking forward to this album when I heard \\"Gunshot to the...\\" and I liked the style of music that Trivium was playing. It is easy to hear that they are highly influenced by 80's Thrash and Metal, while throwing in some modern twist of thier own. Problem is that the vocals kill this album. I really can't stand the screaming, then going to singing, then back again. This works with a few bands, such as Linkin Park, since it seems to flow with thier music, but its like the vocal and music just don't mix, and its gets in your nerves. Happy to say that this vocal style hit the scrap heap for the new album. New album has almost a Chuck Billy/James Hetfield vocal approach to it, and it really flows. If you want to take a chance with this, you might like it, but if you are new to the band, I think that you will love the new album much more then this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you dont have this cd BUY IT NOW!!!!!!","review":"A while back I downloaded Like light to the Flies on the Roadrunner site. I was hooked right away. I then downloaded the Ember to Inferno cd which is fantastic. So I was expecting alot from Ascendancy. Well lets just say They Delivered. Every song is a 10. I love the solos and the drums and the singing is also very well done. Its alot more of classic metal than most current cds that have come out. Its amazing cause these guys are so young and have such a bright future ahead of them. If your a classic Metallica fan that also likes groups like Killswitch Engage you will be very pleased. A must have.............get it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"How can they get away with blatantly ripping off so many other bands? In the first few minutes of \\"Pull Harder...\\" they had ripped off \\"Hangar 18\\"(Megadeth), and that riff in the middle of \\"Imperium\\" (Machine Head). Everything about this is unoriginal and poorly executed. From their overuse of those stupid octave chords to their awful vocals, not even mentioning their pointless solos that are some of the worst I've ever heard. If your going to use legato as extensively as they do it has to fit into the song, it has to have a reason for being there, not just to show off that you can move your fingers quite fast without any pattern of thought. It's pathetic that so many people are calling this the future of metal when its just a (copyright infringing) poor rehash of everything that has come before them. The new Metallica? You've got to be kidding me."},{"rating":"1","title":"...crap...","review":"I gave this two stars because it seems evident that the guitarists have some skill and some of the leads sound fairly interesting.

Around the time this was released a friend that I had at the time burnt me a copy of this knowing my love for metal proclaiming he had found a great band. I was so disappointed that this passed for something amazing in his eyes...but he isn't alone, there are tons of kids that play this right before they throw on their emo albums.

It amazes me how completely unoriginal metal bands are these days. Carbon copies galore.WARNING: If you want to hear another metal/em-core metal band, then by this album - you'll probably love it.If you are a purist and would like to hear some truly thought-provoking and ground breaking new heavy metal albums, then get something by Mastodon, Clutch, Arch Enemy, or Shadows Fall (The War Within).

However, some parts of the movie is pretty stiff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A standout episode because of its noteworthy casting","review":"In the early 60's when television rarely showcased an African-American actor, it was \\"The Outer Limits\\" that spotlighted Hari Rhodes in a part that was not racially based. In this episode from the series landmark first season, Rhodes is cast as \\"Lt. Travers\\", one member of a moon-based crew that encounters escaping aliens in search of sanctuary.While many do not think this to be one of the show's best episodes, I find its significance as presenting a black man as essential as any other to the execution of the moon mission to be commendable for the show's producers.Though slow-moving at times, this installment still provides a pleasurable viewing experience, especially during the moving soliloquy by the alien spokesman (voiced by veteran actor Ben Wright)."},{"rating":"1","title":"korea relived on moon","review":"It is a common opinion that the first season of Outer Limits, under the direction of its original creators, was stronger than the second season. It is, however, also apparent that towards the end of first season the series wasn't as consistently good as in the beginning.The Moonstone has plenty of values to keep it watchable: the actors are adequate, the production classy and the special effects (especially the moonstone itself) are among the best in the entire series. For once the aliens are portrayed as truly ALIEN in form. Also it has an unusually realistic ending, no superheroics, once again showing how intellectual this series was.There are no moments of stupidity or embarrasment, but unfortunately, for some reason, Moonstone fails to be very exciting or gripping. The characters aren't that interesting and the story lacks that \\"awe and mystery\\" advertised in the title sequence...however, the episode is definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am fighting with this book","review":"I bought this book because it is our text book.

I must say that this book is one of the worst books I have ever worked from. The material in the sections is all over the place, and the examples are blended in with the material so you really don't know what's going on. The fact of the matter is, the subject matter in this book isn't very complicated. However, the god-awful examples and the lack of clear and concise explanations really drives you insane. Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre text not worth the money","review":"I've never owned any other texts on probability and statistics, but this one is no good. The underlying mathematical concepts are not difficult, but they are presented in a very poor manner. I often have to read a section several times to understand how the authors move from the theory to a specific examples, they seem to leave out steps that aren't intuitive to the first time student (me). Then, once I think I undestand the ideas sufficiently to move to the exercises at the end of the section, I find that they often ask the reader to solve problems the likes of which were barely (or sometimes not at all) explained in the text... its VERY aggrevating. This text, combined with a terrible Prof. has made Prob-Stat a real nightmare ...if you want to safe yourself a lot of time and frustration, get another book, its almost garaunteed to be better....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clear","review":"As a beginner, I found this book not clearly written.

I feel sorry for the trees that were used to make the paper its printed on. The writing style is like that of a dreamy alzheimer's patient who may have known statistics at one point and doesn't really care if you don't already know what they're talking about. There are whole paragraphs that refer to something they mentioned in passing several sections previously.The mathematical operations they show within the text are incredibly vague without giving an overview of what they are actually attempting to show. There are no highlights of the main points and one topic runs into another with no transitional sections.It will be a waste of your time. I know it was of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty confusing","review":"I used this book in a 300 level mathematics course. Before taking this class, I had taken 2 applied business statistics courses. However, many parts of this book were very confusing despite the fact I was not totally ignorant of statistics. Some of the \\"simpler\\" statistics concepts are made unnecessarily difficult by the authors. The notations used are not labeled well or at all, and the authors tend to skip steps when solving problems. I have taken 3 calculus classes yet the calculus used in this book confused me, again the authors skipped steps and did not explain what they were doing. I know a lot of math textbooks are not very clear but this one is the worst I have ever read. Maybe okay for math majors, but not for the rest of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"There are good books on probability and statistical inference. This isn't one of them! If you are hunting for something - look for authors like James T. McClave or P. George Benson. James McClave has written some good books in this area.Examples are HARD TO FOLLOW. There is no development of concepts. The writer doesn't seem to have any idea how to explain or how to provide examples. THIS IS NOT A BOOK THAT NORMAL PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND!

I don't understand why it is so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"a (yawn) mechanical approach to mathematics","review":"I studied the first 8 chapters of this book instead of attending the undergraduate lecture. This was a mistake. Tanis & Hoggs present probability and statistics, an otherwise interesting topic, in the most mechanical way imaginable. There is no reference (that I can recall) to any underlying mathematical ideas or questions, nor to the problems which originially prompted Poisson, Bernoulli, Gauss, etc. to inquire about the nature of \\"randomness\\" in physical events. The authors seem to suppose that their examples demonstrate such things by proxy. This book may make a decent reference for advanced students, but should not be used to teach those seeing prob & stat for the first time... that is, unless, you want it to also be their last."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fit for teaching","review":"While studying statistics with this book I thougth I lack a gene or something because I couldn't make much sense of the subject. Today I know that the book is conceptually wrong.The book is basically stuck in the 1930's, ignoring major breakthroughs by Shannon, Kolmogorov and others. Fundamental concepts like entropy, individual randomness and typicallity are completely missing.Furthermore, the book is heavily biased towards hypothesis testing, with little mentioning of Bayesian statistics.From a pedagogic point of view it must be said that statistical concepts emerged historically and are better understood when placed in the context of the original problems. This book does not do that at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogic organization and non-intuitive explanation","review":"i'm not sure whether it's useful as a reference, but it's far from being a good textbook. obviously the authors didn't care to explain anything clearly. all they wanted was to write down all the relevant formulas to finish their book. no intuition is given at all. it's a pain to read and i would recommend both instructors and students NOT to use this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stat Book for Math Majors","review":"As a Mathematics major, I found this book to be helpful on two conditions: (a.) You have a competent professor teaching the material. (b.) You have had at least Calculus III.Hogg and Tanis, as other reviewers have stated, make liberal use or reference to concepts covered in calculus courses: partial derivatives, double integrals, McLauren/Taylor Series etc. If these two conditions have not been met, this would be a terrible book to start with.

It is too colorfuly and with lots of trivial examples but no real \\"maths\\", its like spoon feeding the readers rather than creating probability as an interesting subject. Most of the problems are trivial in nature and most of the concepts are too convulated.I would have given it no stars, my advise is to avoid this book if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probability and Statistical Inference","review":"I had to buy this for a class b/c Hogg & Tanis renumbered the problems (same problems, but put different numbers on them) this was done so they could sell another edition!

The contents of the book start with summary and display of data, then gradually move to estimation, hypothesis testing, linear model and non-parametric methods. Several lists of distributions, confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis are given in the book.

My daughter really enjoys watching Thomas go. The only problem is that Thomas falls off the track too much when trying to go around the curves and where there is a break in the tracks (such as a switch track). My husband and I believe this is due to the fact that the wheels have rubber on them. It probably was not neccessary to put rubber on all of the wheels, especially the front ones. In looking at the Brio battery operated set, the engine only has rubber on the middle wheels - this is probably a better system. Also, Battery operated Thomas is higher than all of the other trains and cars, so the magnets don't hook on as well as they would with the regular engines. But those things aside, it really is a very fun thing to play with - adults and children!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mets Lovers Delight","review":"I love wrapping in shopping bags as it makes my life so much easier.

This movie does not make me feel any sympathy for the plight of the character.My personal feeling is that I wish those who support terrorism and are actively involved would die out, along with the idea.

It is a good workout, but is lacking in Hawaiian traditions. It is an insult to the sacred dance of the hula. The instructor is 1/2 Western Cowgirl, 1/4 body builder, and 1/4 Kumu Hula. Too much time is spent with the camera-man's nose up her skirt, and some of the \\"hula\\" moves are a bit vulgar compared to how they are traditionally done. Better to go with Patricia Lei's \\"Hula for Health\\" video if you are looking for graceful, beautiful hula exercise and dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with these dvd's. The info on them doesn't mention that they're far from being traditional hula. The music in the weight loss one isn't bad, but I couldn't stand the song on the beginner dvd. The warm-up was practically nonexistant. When doing this kind of dance, your muscles really need to be much more warmed up than what Kili does. I also thought that she needed to break down the movement more. Even with a dance background, I thought she went much too quickly, so I can only imagine how difficult it would be for someone with no dance experience at all. Unfortunatly, there doesn't seem to be an alternate dvd out yet for someone who wants to learn real hula."},{"rating":"1","title":"'A'ole Hiki (impossible!)","review":"In order to do this workout, you must be very coordinated, able to move quickly, and able to look past the distorted variation of hula dancing. You can get a good workout (if you can keep up) but if you're interested in learning hula, this is not the right video. The movement in this video is very fast, rigid, and down right ugly.

I can only surmise that Lou Gramm was caught up in one of those \\"love two women\\" situations, his vocals pleading with the listener for a solution that I guess he never got.Not an album for people who have their head firmly on their shoulders, but a GREAT album for those of us who, over the course of their lives, have occasionally \\"lost it\\". The album has a theme that keeps it running well from start to finish, despite the changes in tempo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I shouldn't tear this album up too much (hey, it was released in the mid 80's.) Foreigner always represented BIG arena rock and then they released \\"4\\". Yes it was a real rockin' album, but it was also their departure into more of a MOR approach, which leads to \\"Agent Provocateur\\", Foreigner fifth album of new material. Produced by the late Alex Sadkin, the album seemed too mechanical on the rockin' tunes (tooth and nail, she's too tough, reaction to action.) I can barely hear any guitar on the slower numbers (I want to know what love is, a love in vain, that was yesterday, two different worlds.) Like I said earlier, this record came out in the mid 80's and like a lot of other great bands they fell victim to a very mechanized sound and production.

Don't listen to the reviewer Darth Kommissar who said that this was severely underrated. It's not thought of very highly for a reason. The only thing that I like a lot from this album is the song \\"That Was Yesterday\\". I can kind of stomach the song \\"I Want to know what love is\\", but it's a little to syrupy and sweet for my taste. So basically those two tunes bring this review rating up to two stars. I hate the song \\"Tooth And Nail\\" and I think there's another song called \\"Reaction to Action\\" that's very bad too.

It looked brand new."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book debunks the myths of the Irish in America","review":"Usnig data gathered from over 500 interviews conducted with Irish-Americans in Albany, NY in the early 1990s, Byron's book shows how \\"Irishness\\" is constructed in contemporary America. Arguing that people mix knowledge of their own ancestors and genealogy in with widely held myths that the Great Famine and English oppression forced Catholics to leave Ireland, the book examines the commercialisation of Irish ethnicity in the USA at the end of the Twentieth Century. With chapters centred on issues like contests over the meaning of St. Patrick's Day in America's northeast in the 1990s, this book is a welcome change from other discussions of the Irish in America that focus mainly on biographies of famous Irish-Americans or nineteenth century immigration data and experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"This did not fit my GMC side post","review":"This did not fit my GMC side post.

A great dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book blunders","review":"No refrences are properly cited and much is based on misinformation. The story about W.C. Fields is often quoted but instead of fact is actually based on a joke he told. There is no W.C. Fields missing money. It could have been better researched. But it makes for entertaining stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"This book has interesting monologues to read; but as far as using it to find audition material. . .forget it. It is not clearly organized. I like monologue books that are divided into serious, comedic, etc, so I can go straight to the type of monologue I want. But this book is full of monologues with obscure chapter headings that make absolutely no sense. This is not a resourceful book. . .I would use it only for entertainment purposes, but then again, if I time for that, I'd rather read the entire play, rather than an excerpt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and Helpful in emotional connection...","review":"The introduction explains that the obscure chapter headings were for emotion connection that certain monologues have in common, so it's a creative way to go about it. I thought that was a higher level helpfulness. It also says that it is wise to read the plays after interest in the excerpts. It's really intelligent, the organization and the thoughtfulness is generous to actors. Female perspectives are catigorized into universal quotes taken from used monologues and they express so much more that just comedic or dramaic catigories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around, more meditative yoga series","review":"I like Rainbow Mars approach - calming yet challenging poses. I have yet to work through all the CDs as I have moved overseas, but she does a nice job of providing instruction and support throughout the routines.

The combination of master storytelling by Dische and Enzensberger and Sowa's richly surreal art is mesmerizing. The story is light, simple, and very rewarding. You will return again and again to this story of a rabbit traveling through modern Germany. It brings back memories of my time in both East and West Germany, around the wall. When I read it, I smile and feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming story....amazing illustrations!","review":"The story of little Prince Esterhazy is so simple and charming, sure to delight young and old. We bought the book because we are huge fans of Michael Sowa's art. The illustrations are at the same time surreal and precious; a bunny trying on boxer shorts? A bunny in the bathtub? Fantastic! And the poignant story of a bunny finding love as the wall falls in Berlin is too sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes *nothing* like Sencha!","review":"For anyone who is a seasoned Sencha tea drinker, this is tea is a total dud. It barely tastes anything like fresh, high quality Sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves.

Generally in these stories, something traumatic has happened to the grandchild, usually the death of a parent. An animal, an experience - in this movie it's a river trip - is the crux that somehow gets through to the grandchild, sets him or her straight, and makes the aggravation involved worthwhile for all.Although there are a couple others I could recommend in this category, I'm personally most impressed with this one by way of acting quality and interesting storyline. Definitely worth a watch, and after watching twice as a rental, I'm buying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"A powerful story!Many tearful moments.I recommend this book for those interested in a different side of WWW II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Early Belew Solo Work","review":"Excellent album.

The gentleman who runs this storefront is absolutely off the hook cool. Not only is his pricing fantastic, but he hooked me up with a bit of a collectible without sticking it to me. Initially, he had this record listed as a CD, which is what I wanted (and still do). Later that day he contacted me to inform me that what he had in stock was the original vinyl pressing of this masterpiece. He spent a great deal of time attempting to locate the CD for me, but to no avail ... it's been out of print for quite some time. No, I did not get what I was looking for, but without ANY fuss he allowed me to procure this without any additional charge. For that, I am thankful ... and it even arrived a couple days earlier than advertised!You ROCK, Roy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show...but dvd's seem out of order","review":"I am a huge fan of California Dreams and have been ever since it aired. I waited forever for it to come out on DVD! I started watching it the minute I got it. However, I noticed on the last disc, which is disc 5, that the episodes seem somewhat out of order or something. In the episode 21 Jake Street, he starts to date this undercover cop but then the disc ends with him and Tiffani breaking up at the prom. There were also other episodes before the prom episode where they weren't dating. Obviously something got screwed up. Didn't anyone else notice that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wow.","review":"Been waiting so so long for this to come out. Used to watch it everyday with my sister when it was on in the nineties. Used to tape them all, never quite got every episode and the sound and picture quality got really bad over the years. Been on forumns for a long time with lots of others trying to spread the word to get this to come out. I can safely say me and my sister are going to be rekindling some great memories.

Thanks again Amazon; Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A interesting little book.","review":"This is a pretty interesting book for vexillophiles (thats a person intrested in the study of flags).The author takes you on a journey from the early days up through 9/11 and the genesis of our American flag. Along the way are many sidebars, some with more tidbits of information. some of the sidebars are short pieces written by various famous people on their anecdotes about the flag.It is this part that caused me to lower my rating from a 5 to a 4. Not very many of the personal anedotes were interesting. The exception would be the excerpt from a speech by Sen. John McCain on his experiences as a Vietnam P.O.W.All in all though it is an intriguing book which you could probably read in about 1 night."},{"rating":"2","title":"morningrise","review":"every song on here is excellent. to me, there is no average song on this cd and the bass guitar is the best i have ever heard. i wish this bassist had stayed with opeth. get this cd now. Nectar is my favorite song on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opeth- for your head","review":"Do something good for yourself today and buy this album and any other Opeth CD you might find. These guys kick some serious...! The only thing tenuous about this group is finding their recorded music. Some albums are imports and or rare. Amazon has most of 'em.The first time that I heard this group I was hooked! I can't even describe the way that they can blend this heavy dark side with the way kuwel vocals and they just keep on surprising the listener with these twists and turns.Opeth may be the best metal band that no one ever heard of. That's a shame because this is 65 minutes of music everyone should hear! I listen to them everyday and love to see the \\"NuMetal fans\\" faces when they hear Opeth for the first time too. BTW- OPETH is not a NuMetal band... they have though redefined that genre as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is quite possibily some of the most beautiful music I have ever listened to, and ironically enough, it has death vocals! Yes, somehow this band has created music that right when you first hear it, you know it's great.The perfect example is the opening track \\"Advent.\\" When I first heard the acoustic guitars kick in, I simply said, \\"Damn. . . .\\" Advent still remains my favorite song on this album. There is something about it that sends shivers down my spine, but at the same time remain beautiful.I cannot stress how much everyone must hear this album. Anybody who enjoys music of any form, especially classical or metal, will enjoy this album. Go buy this now if you have not already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohh Yeah","review":"This CD mixes all sorts of types of music. Heavy Metal, Folk and I guess some Jazz. I'm sure Im one of the only people who actually likes his vocals. But the music is outa this world. With all the blending I wish i had money to get the rest of their albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opeth's masterpiece.","review":"If Opeth had released only this album they'd still be one of the best bands around(maybe even better...). I'm just going to say that this album goes just beyond anything this band has ever released and I really don't think they'll ever top this one (this is maybe the reason that I judge them so hard). Musicaly this album has it all. Very long songs which build around compositions which seem to have their basis on death metal but also include acoustic guitars, folk parts at some parts and the occasional clean vocals by singer Mikael Akerfeldt who has one of the best voices around, be it clean or brutal vocals. One of the highlights of this album is without doubt the 20 minute opus \\"Black Rose Immortal\\" which is one of their best songs. It's very hard to find a weak moment on this album which makes me believe there isn't any. Highest ever possible Opeth recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"the gods of today's metal community","review":"opeth is unlike anything that i have ever heard and they are definetly one of the best. they are in a category all their own. their music is just so beautiful as well as their lyrics and they play and sing w/such a passion that deeply stirs my soul. opeth is the most talented band i have EVER EVER EVER! heard and one of the best bands ever(along w/my dying bride and the cure) and every one of their songs as well as cds have been GREAT and i am quite sure that still life will also be a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to hard to find that moment of brilliance that they don't capture until the albums after this","review":"I didn't mind \\"Orchid\\" too much, sure some of the songs on it were a bit too long, but they had interesting melodies and really proudly showed Opeth's influences, but \\"Morningrise\\" is definitely a step back and nothing like the absolutely brilliant \\"MAYH\\". Besides the decent, but 20 minute long, \\"Black Rose Immortal\\" there is nothing really great on this album. This album is filled with half baked ideas scattered throughout which cause Morningrise to really lack a clear mood that Opeth somehow captures after letting go the drummer and bassist for some Hispanic geniuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know, it just doesn't do it for me","review":"I love Opeth. I was crushed when I couldn't see them when they toured near me, and I couldn't wait for Lamentations to come out. For some reason though, Morningrise, for all of the things people had to say about it, bored the hell out of me. The songs just droll along and do definitly travel from one point to another, but they never really rise in energy or gain any momentum. It's kind of like an engine idling the whole time. I was just waiting for them to break out with something throughout the whole thing and they never did.The songs didn't seem to flow very well from one riff to the next as if there were just a bunch of riffs written and randomly strung together.I would recommend My Arms, Your Herse or Deliverance to this one. Yes, those two albums are their heavier ones, but they are solid and don't have any of the problems mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better...","review":"I heard nothing but good reviews for Opeth, But i personally was dissapointed. The five tracks are all atleast 10 minutes long, the longest going for 20, and this would be ok if the songs actually flowed, but instead it sounds like the intro to several good metal songs have been pasted together while someone growls over it. The music itself is actually quite good, but after a while it starts to drag on and become quite boring, each time the songs build up i was expecting the music to get heavier and actually pick up pace, but each time i was let down, and when the songs end, left feeling unsatisfied. Although i'd personally consider it a waste of time, it is better than wasted money, so if you really want to give Opeth a try, I suggest you download a few songs first (It doesn't matter which, after half an hour they all sound the same). Then again however, some of you may actually enjoy listening to this crap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acoutic intervals do not make this art","review":"Put your favorite metal CD and your acoutic quitar CD (if you have one) on the stereo. Then switch between the two every 30 seconds and you have Opeth. The acoustic interrupts the metal (which isn't going anywhere anyway)and vice versa. The glowing reviews here only indicate how naive metal fans are about music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opeth is not good","review":"Imagine Limp Bizkit mixed with classical music, it might sound ok if they knew how to play their instuments . Not good, not worth buying, liten to the new album from Cold or Linkin Park, now theres REAL talent ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the Best Cds Ever","review":"First off, I would classify Opeth as a progressive melodic death metal band. They aren't black metal, because they sing about death not the Occult and there are no keyboards present. But enough with genres, if you can tolerate harsh vocals and epic song structures at all you should by this CD. The CD is about 50% acoustic,50% electric and 50% clean, 50% unclean vocals. The acoustic melodies are the best I have ever heard, and the songs manage to hold one's interest throughout. Also the vocals, both clean and unclean, and lyrics are exceptional. Morningrise is a very somber masterpiece, and Opeth has managed to make four other brilliant CDs worth owning as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"death-progressive metal","review":"That's the genre these guys have delved out for themselves. It's not progressive death metal, because it's not death metal except for the vocals and some of the heavier sections. Opeth's music ranges from soft acoustic to heavy, really heavy. They're one of those bands that are hard to hate. Even people who hate death metal vocals will have to admit the brilliance of this music (read: as in the brilliance of a jewel). Black Rose Immortal has got to be my one of my most favorite songs ever. It's progressive metal without the distracting prog elements like nonsensical time signature changeups or meandering keyboard sections. As a metal fan, my complaint is that this album starts off very heavy, but the last track slows way down, so it's overall kind of a let down. Still, I have a hard time marking off a full star for the pacing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD, not-so-amazing bonus track.","review":"If you're reading this review, chances are you already know that Morningrise is an amazing album. You probably even own a copy already, and just want to know if it is worth the extra money to have the one bonus track that is on this reissue. The answer, sadly, is no. The bonus track, Eternal Soul Torture, is a basically a poor quality demo recording of a song that ended up being incorporated into another track on this album. It really doesn't add anything to the album. In fact, it almost takes away from the brilliant work that is Morningrise. If I were to review the regular edition of the album I would give it 5 stars easily. Because of the poor quality of the bonus track, and the high price of the reissue, I am rating this edition at 4 stars. I would recommend it only to those people (like me) who are completists and have to own every single Opeth song."},{"rating":"2","title":"rare find","review":"The following statement is true for all of the Subdudes performances.Rock, country, blues, bluegrass, gospel, and even zydeco all wrapped up in soulful voices, harmonies, skilled musicianship, careful songwriting, integrity, and most of all...love.I have all of their CDs and I've seen them live. If only the music industry showed them the respect that their fans know they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome soulful southern rock with touch 'o Cajun","review":"Why is this band not better known? They are an immensely enjoyable listen - finely crafted tunes, diverse and imaginative instrumentation (normal mix plus accordion, mandolin, tambourine, occasional xylophone, tuba, even kazoo!), engaging and supple rhythms - these guys are good and yet very few have ever heard of 'em. Trust me - if you think you might like say, a southern Fleetwood Mac, then buy this album! With a 500+ cd collection, this is one I still go back and play again and again. IMO, this one is their best, then Annunciation and Lucky. Thank me later ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great starter set for your little train lover!","review":"My 2&1/2 year old son has become completely enamored with Thomas over the past six months. Prior to that it was just trains in general. By watching the Thomas videos and reading the books the trains were brought to life. So when we saw this relatively inexpensive track available - complete with three trains- we had to buy it for him. It is a great investment. He can spend hours playing with it, expanding his imagination while at the same time increasing his fine-motor skills. With all of the expansion packs available, plus the bigger sets, we know we will be able to expand the tracks for years to come! We are already looking ahead to Christmas for more \\"Thomas\\" options. But this one is an unbeatable value for a beginner set for the young Thomas, or trains in general, lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy we've ever had!!","review":"We bought this set for my 2 year old son several months ago, and he has enjoyed this set over any other toy...EVER.

This product arrived and the +/- speed did not work at all out of box. product operates, single sped, no means of turning off without removing batteries. Layaspot was not a big hit with the Mrs. so I can not give this a favorable review. For the money, we would expect more from German design and quality. All our fun factory products have speed control or noise issues.

It is a clearly written portrayal of what it means to be black or a minority in the U.S.A. As a white person, I never understood how minorities felt or what they experienced. Gwendolyn Parker paints a picture that communicates the subtle behaviors and attitudes of prejudice so everyone can comprehend how it feels to be a minority and what people of color experience in this country and she accomplished this in a very compelling manner that is a joy to read. This is a must read that you don't want to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving, memorable memoir, balanced, insightful, readable","review":"Ms. Parker's memoir resonates powerfully for African-Americans and other Americans, who may be among the \\"firsts\\" from their communities to \\"tresspass in halls of privilege\\". Unlike some similar memoirs, it is not so tragic as to be embittering, but is a balanced presentation of a carefully examined experience. Ms. Parker's love of the written word is evident in her well-chosen descriptive phrases and well-paced story-telling. The book is very readable, and, if you can relate to it at all, once you pick it up, you don't want to put it down. I commend Ms. Parker for her courage and tenacity in telling a very important story, that needs to be told and retold, and understood by Americans of every hue. For blacks, there's insight into our own diversity, and our weakness for hurting each other when in pain. For others, there's valuable insight about what it takes to create a truly inclusive society."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Another Sister Making that Journey","review":"I read this book while in the 'throes' of my Doctoral program. I was so encouraged to read about another bright sister going through emotional pain and stress in a place of \\"higher learning\\" that was supposed to build you up, but seemed to be about destroying you at all costs. In fact, I had gone to an Ivy League school in Virginia for my Masters degree and did not nearly have the crushing discrimination and prejudice aimed at me that I did at this much less elite, (though well known), Texas University. Gwen's book made me remember that I wasn't alone in my experiences, nor crazy, and encouraged me to continue the fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and unenlightening","review":"This book focuses on the mundane details of a woman who was motivated to advance her self-interest and seemed to care little about helping others less fortunate.

As for the USB, every time I play something using the usb, it gets a high pitched frequency that is audible whenever it switches tracks, which it seems to do sometimes in the middle of a song. If I use a cd, no high pitched frequency, no random song changes. Also has the problem where if it's left in the sun, the display stops working. Just not a good product.

All of the instructions are done via voice over, and therefore some of the cues come after the motion has ever started. Before the hula workout begins, she does the whole thing as an example, but never again demonstrates a move before you do it. It is very hard to follow. It is an easy workout, for those who are just starting a workout routine, but I suggest watching the video a few times before actually doing it, so you can know what to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Change from the Everyday","review":"While Hula for Weight Loss will certainly take some practice, I think it's a great way to work out. There are certain components that are a little tough to follow such as camera angle (gosh I wish I could see her entire body as she does this step) but that is a \\"problem\\" of most workout videos.Hula for Weight Loss, however, features beautiful scenery and the instructor is in great shape, has a pleasing voice and is reassuring.I think the video offers a great alternative for exercisers who want variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sweatbreaking workout.","review":"But this is not for beginners! She covers the movement once and goes on to the next too quickly, then it is all to be followed at a quick pace.

Better than other Hula W/O series I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout with so so music.....","review":"This workout shows Kili in the early years without her back up hula dancers.This is definitely a workout that targets every part of your body. Kili has you all over the place and even though you may feel lost at times because she is moving through the steps rather quickly it is so worth it. This hula routine is definitely going to contribute to the weight loss.That said, the music sucks butt.I prefer the music in her later hula workout videos with the back up hula dancers.Hawaiian with a nice (drum) beat, unlike what she has playing in this video.Anyway, had the music been better I would have given it a 5 star rating instead of the 4 stars.So if you can get past the music then its worth it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hula Workout\\" is fun, but it takes some patience.","review":"I found this a delightful way to workout.

Tom Cruise is excellent as the Marine who's bio is the focus of the film. It's full of heart-wrenching scenes in Vietnam as well as \\"Ron's\\" homecoming and I cry everytime. It's definitely a two-thumbs up type of film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film despite inaccuracy","review":"It is difficult to review films when they claim to be true stories or try to reflect on history in an accurate sense. Do you review the film in a nutshell, or do you review it's relevance to the subject it is referring to ?If you review according to accuracy, you would have to give this a 2 or 3 at the most. BUT, the film is excellent. Tom Cruise won me over with this role. The boy can really act ! He was absolutely brilliant and I don't think he has matched this performance to this date in any other film.The story is moving and at times disturbing when faced with the reality of a young man trying to live and deal with severe injuries aswell as his Vietnam experiences.A brilliant film which does not deserve to be panned due to it's obvious historical flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"I did not want to like this movie","review":"I was in the USAF during those late 60's and we had it much easier in many ways. Marines and Grunts were expendable and like Tom Cruise (the tragic hero Ron Kovic) I first HATED the protestors and when I got back to the Nation I first HATED the lack of respect for the debt our country and military men paid even more. Like our hero Kovic after many years I started to see the stupidity of the \\"War we did not try to win (not bombing Hanoi and the dams to flood the country) and the lack of justification to pay the price or to be there\\". This movie made me ashamed I did not stay gun ho or re-enlist and to go back to fight for the friends I lost but thanked God I go out in one piece. One negitive point that hunts this film is Oliver Stone's failure to spend enough to really capture the heat, sweat, loneliness, helplessness and fruitlessness of the war and the real reasons for being in the Nam that only Fahrenheit 911 exposed."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tom Cruise Gives An Oscar Worthy Performance\\"","review":"Tom Cruise won an Oscar nomination as Best Actor for his performance of a Vietnam vet who leaves the United States as a young, vibrant man, but returns a wounded and emotionally damaged soul. \\"Born on The Fourth of July\\" is the most honest and frank account of what the Vietnam war did to American soldiers and how these soldiers must be applauded for their work. They must also never be forgotten.It is hard to imagine Tom Cruise never winning for this role as this was really his first serious dramatic part in a film. It is even harder to believe he has never won an Oscar for any of his fabulous motion pictures.Oliver Stone did win the Academy Award for Best Director for this movie in 1989. This DVD set features an informative and interesting commentary by Stone as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as Saving Private Ryan","review":"I saw this movie in the theater and I fell asleep through the whole movie. Saving Private Ryan is my least favorite movie. This movie was terrible and I don't want to say this but Tom Cruise had bad acting in the movie and I have to give this movie one star because it was one of the worst war movies I have ever seen. If I were you don't even rent or buy this movie it's terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The corrosive gaze!","review":"There have been many similar movies around this theme (Coming home still remains by far as the unbeatable film about his delicate issue) but what it confers this gripping and awful story that touch of grandness is the merciless, intense and real approach so typical of Oliver Stone.There are three remarkable aspects that basically, consolidate and reaffirm this movie as the best artistic achievement of Stone; the crudeness and incisiveness of this bitter script; the best performance given by Tom Cruise in his career and the unforgettable devastating images along the film, as that mesmerizing and metaphorical fight on the desert of Cruise and Dafoe.To my mind I must insist, this is the majuscule achievement in Oliver Stone's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real film which touches our thoughts","review":"when i watched born on the 4th of july, i thought it was much different then other movies, it showed a different side of war showing that a country did not care about a person who fought for his country.

Born on the Fourth of July was written in Santa Monica, California during the fall of 1974 in exactly one month, three weeks and two days.

Despite discouragement from family and friends, he enlists after graduation and is shipped off to Vietnam. While in combat he makes a horrible mistake, and his resulting lack of vision leads to his being wounded. Ron is left paralyzed from the chest down, and returns home in a state of bitterness. His body mends far ahead of his mind, and his resulting disillusionment with the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war leads to his becoming an antiwar activist. Vivid recreation of the 1960's war movement with a stellar performance by Cruise. Every proud American should own this film, which is more rewarding with each viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"no complaints why should there be it is in good shape their nothing else to say. Great movie comes in perfect excellent pitcure."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN OLIVER STONE TRIUMPH!","review":"Oliver Stone is one of the most interesting directors of all time and this movie is definitely in his best top 5. Tom Cruise's portrayl of Ron Kovic is chilling to say the least. Anyone who is a fan of \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" or Stone's \\"Platoon,\\" will really enjoy this film. When I think of Vietnam themed movies, this one is on the top of my list. The movie I think it resembles most is \\"Coming Home,\\" with Jon Voight, but I enjoyed this movie a lot more. It's not amazing that this controversial movie became so liked when it was first released at the box office. If you want to see one of the best directors and Tom Cruise's best work, this movie is for you. It didn't make the AFI 100 greatest movies probably because of \\"Platoon's\\" entry. Oliver Stone deserved his best director academy award for this terrific movie. I think this is definitely one of the top 5 greatest films of the 1980's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Treatment of the 60's","review":"Based on the true story of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), a gung-ho marine who questions his patriotism after some serious war wounds. Stone's surreal treatment of Kovic will make you empathize with the main character, but too many gaps in his Vietnam-era odyssey keeps the film from being a masterpiece. Still, a fine production in keeping with Stone's signature style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very surprising Cruise","review":"Regardless of what your politics are - or what you think of Oliver Stone's politics - Born on the Fourth of July, which is based on a gritty memoir by Vietnam war veteran Ron Kovic, is an engrossing movie, not least because of Tom Cruise's performance. Up until starring in this movie, he was always acting as some young hot shot - an attorney, a pool player, a car dealer, it doesn't matter - someone young and arrogant and hot-headed who usually wound up committing himself reluctantly to a greater cause. Here he begins the movie as an idealistic teenager aspiring to serve his country and winds up totally unravelled, in what is one of his most wild and tortured performances. It's incredible (and very disturbing) to watch. Here is one of the rawest portrayals of a man struggling to deal with the impact that war has had on his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"we can do","review":"shgfsfhgfhsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss fjij dai dio dao dtypea yo j fdia; ti;atjia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Acting GREAT : Movie NOT SO GREAT","review":"The Acting of Tom Cruise was absolutely wonderful!

Stone purports to be making a true story. The violent confrontation at the Republican Convention depicted in this flick did NOT occur. It occurred at the Democratic Convention. Oliver Stone is a member of the Hollywood clique that is attempting to rewrite history. All of Stone's propaganda cannnot change the facts that the Democrat Party started the Vietnam War (under Truman) and that the Democrat Party was responsible for the major opposition to Civil Rights legislation in the 60's. Sorry, Stone. You are a Stalinist. This movie is just pure commie-prop. Had Stone promoted this movie as fiction then it would be good entertainment.

I'd like to know how they're doing now! One of the main lessons I learned from this book is that you have to be someone like Philip to succeed in business. You have to be someone that just jumps right in, gets busy, and stays on the job all day every day without any letup or any fear. On the other hand, Nora was slow, fearful, and a procrastinator.

It's taken quite a beating and still works and looks great. Of course I touch it up occasionally with a Dremel and polishing compound. Think I've had it well over a year and it does everything it should. The only thing, which I suppose has to be expected, is that you have to take it off to get a room temp. I bought it mostly because I would us it during ghost hunts. The temperature doesn't fluctuate that quickly to reflect the current environment, at least not that I've noticed. I've worn it in the shower, while swimming and have had no issues there either. I really recommend this watch. The only possible thing I would improve is having the crystal recessed into the watch instead of flush with the top. I find it's much easier to scratch in it's current design. I realize their are other watches that have this feature, but I'd rather not have a slab of rubber on my wrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could buy another one of these watches???","review":"A great watch but Casio does this thing where the watch band pin goes into the watch is cheap plastic; after awhile the pin just wears out the pin hole and the watch is unusable because you cant put a pin in it to hold the watch band. A big rip off. I have had 5 or more expensive Casio watches become unusable because there isn't away to put the watch band on? I am sure that as people wake up to this, there will be a class action lawsuit against Casio for premeditatedly having watches to break after awhile. I wish I could buy a Casio watch, I wont give any more money to those con artist's. A greedy shame of them.

As an international traveler, it gives me all the time options I need. As a guy who likes to cook, it gives me countdown and timer funtions.

I was glad to find I could get this watch through Amazon when I needed to replace the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, good looking. The strap could be better.","review":"This is a nice, good looking and sturdy watch. Features like world time, automatic backlight and the analog+digital features make it a worthwhile buy. The thermometer is very accurate (once you calibrate it to your body temp). The strap however although it is very well made, has big links which make it somehow difficult to adjust to some wrists (because it can get too tight or too loose). Not a big deal though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this watch.. if you want something that will last.","review":"I bought this watch for my husband less than 6 months ago as a gift. Initially we were both thrilled with all the cool features and the very cool look of the watch. When it came down to wearing it, it doesn't stand up. The face scratched the first day and after several weeks he was worried about scratching it up and stopped wearing it. His work is not a rough job, he's a pilot. A week ago, the plastic piece they hide between the metal front and the back of the case broke, mind you he was just sitting at home on the couch, and CASIO refuses to warranty it because he lost the receipt. This watch is crap, unless you only plan to wear it once. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-warranted plastic case","review":"I got this watch for Father's Day, and about three weeks later, the tab on the case that holds the pin for the watchband, broke. It was then I noticed that the case was plastic with a sliver-like coating. I sent it back to Casio, (repair IDESS337539), expecting a repair under warranty, and was told that Casio does not warrant their cases.(Unbelieveable to me.) I read my guarantee that came with the watch and that's what it states! Casio's price to fix their cheap plastic case? $29.95, almost the price of a new watch, and I would STILL be the owner of a new watch with a cheap, non-warranted, plastic case. No thanks, Casio.

The highlights truly soar, particularly the gently rocking tunes \\"Fall in Line,\\" \\"God and Country,\\" and \\"House of Dreams.\\" \\"Girl of Mine\\" is a first rate ballad and \\"The Ballad of the Dime Store Greaser and the Blonde Mona Lisa,\\" is a surprisingly good story song. On the downside, the album is interrupted by experimental instrumental tracks like \\"Swells,\\" and \\"Blues Piano,\\" that are intrusive sonic interruptions and a few of the other \\"proper\\" songs, like the tile track, are somewhat grating.Overall, four stars for an album that contains some very strong material but is maddeningly inconsistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again, Almost a Good Idea","review":"The story of early Blue Rodeo is summed up in two words_ great and forgettable. As on Outskirts, the opening tracks are great, the latter tracks (remember this is still the era of flip-em cassettes) is pretty much filler. So, of course, side one is gangbusters, the tail end no one pre-cd had ever heard. Appropriately. Still, anyone save reviewer Hepworth could realize that these guys knew every pop hook better than anyone except Nick Lowe, and were not shy about displaying their talent. Again, the jazzy keyboards get in the way, but they were on the way out. Their absence makes room for the entirely new vision unveiled in \\"Western Skies\\" and elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rickety Truck - Great for Thomas fans!!!","review":"This \\"Rickety\\" troublesome truck is great. He bounces up and down as the trains pull him along. He has a wonderful smiling face as he is truely happy causing problems for our little engines.

I fretted over the characters when I had to leave the book to go to work (how annoying - work, I mean). I found the exploration of butch culture fascinating, and the difficulty of the older butch's life almost unbearable to read about. It's hard to imagine what life would be like looking like a stone butch in a society that scorned (scorns) that identity, coupled with the unbelievable alienation of being illiterate in our society. My partner and I talked about the book for hours. She read it after I did and I kept interrupting her to ask \\"what's happening now?\\" Beautifully written. As much as I worried about Chris and Anna, I also found the book wonderfully entertaining, filled with rich characters, lots of humor, wonderful insights.

Easy clean up, for the most part. Only minor complaint is the pointer on temperature dial needs to stand out more - the first time I used it to toast, I thought I turned it to 'toast' & actually turned it to a temperature setting & wondered why my toast wasn't toasting! But after that initial education lesson, everything has been smooth since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent toaster oven","review":"I bought this toaster oven based on the price and because it came in black to match my other new appliances.

Good toaster for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toaster Oven","review":"The price is right.

I think that is the one positive attribute I can mention. The door's weight does not seem evenly distributed. My family finds the ticking very unnecessary.

This is a great toaster though. I can bake a small pizza in it, without heating up the entire kitchen turning on the big oven. It toasts well (once you get used to the settings). Hopefully it will last as long as my last toaster oven did!UPDATE: November 17, 2010; I still have this product and it still works very well. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. I am impressed that I could actually make a small 8 inch pizza in it. I use it all the time. Esp in the summer when I use it to bake chicken instead of using the big oven. I have even made chocolate chips cookies in this, and they turned out just as they would in conventional oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle flowing beginning tape that will make you feel great!","review":"This tape by Rainbeau Mars, the first in a 4 tape set is really wonderful!It moves thru a gentle sequence of poses, with emphasis on breathing, that will open your body, mind and spirit in a gentle way.Rainbeau is a gifted teacher who comes across very naturally and openly. She radiates sincerity and grace.The scenery is beautiful which is always a nice addition and is nice to wake up to (especially in the middle of January:) )and the music is a perfect compliment to it.I would highly recommend this to those new to yoga or those (like me) who have been doing it for years but want to have a gentle routine for those days when you want to do some yoga but don't want to push too hard. I felt amazing after doing this tape (and I've got over 50 Yoga videos) and will use this regularly on those more \\"Gentle\\" days.Namaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"life-changing yoga practice for beginners","review":"i absolutely love this dvd. rainbeau mars is a wonderful guide on the journey to inner and outer peace. this is the first dvd or class to really get me into yoga, and it has honestly made a huge impact on my daily life. the reason for this is that it's primarily (for me, anyway) a spiritual, meditative practice - not just stretching. for a beginner with little to no experience with yoga, i would highly recommend this dvd. it will help you relax and \\"let go\\" of day-to-day struggles and just appreciate BEING. other reviewers have mentioned the lack of real physical challenge in this practice, but i've found it challenging because i was very inflexible when i started using it. again, for a complete beginner with an inflexible, stress-ravaged body and mind, this practice can work wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Bliss!!!!!!!","review":"This is my second review of this tape and after using it for about a year or so I must express again how wonderful it is. These days I have over 60 yoga videos and have been doing yoga daily for over six years (I study with a wonderful teacher as well) so I've got a fair bit of experience with both yoga and yoga videos.This tape is Pure Bliss. An excellent tape for anytime you want to completely let go of the tension in your body, mind and soul.One way in particular that I love this tape is to use it as a night time winddown. I just finished doing it a little while ago after a long and stressful day and it worked wonders.If you are looking for a gentle tape, that is easy to follow and is also enhanced by soothing tropical ocean scenery and perfect background music, then I highly recommend this tape. Rainbeau Mars also is a wonderful teacher who leads you with grace and clarity.Enjoy,Namaste"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga","review":"Too easy.

Now with Soulful christmas don't expect a funky or rocking good time since this album showcases Glenn's soulful voice with a smooth jazz sound. Ave maria and Noel are standouts as is this christmas. This is a decent christmas album and really showcases Glenn's dynamic range as a singer. Downside is some of the notes he hits can be a bit sour as.

The one thing that partially separates it from the chaff is the guitar solo. The first part is done on mandolin, the second on typical loud electric guitar. Unfortunately, it's the only good tune on an otherwise generic CD.

He apparently failed to accomplish this as evidenced by the awards and accolades Boukreev received by other mountaineers.....but Boukreev was his victim and all Krakauer was looking for was an American audience, and as I said, a paycheck.......This book is not an attempt to portray Boukreev as he wasn't but accomplished to show Boukreev as he really was, truly an outstanding individual....truly and individual....his returning to the mountain to find Scott Fisher and Yasuko Namba only indicates the person he was......"},{"rating":"2","title":"EACH WORD IS LIKE A VIEW OF CARRIBEAN HEART","review":"READING THIS IS LIKE PAINTING A PORTRAIT .

Plus, the minimal cultural milieu added to this impression as well.

Ever since I arrived here I\`ve known something was wrong - something was causing me to be utterly disillusioned. I thought it was only culture shock (and it may be, I\`m still not sure), but I think it has more to do with what Kerr has written about. The environment I\`ve encountered has been little more than glitzy, pop-culture, flashy trash, with a back drop of construction, concrete, concrete, and more concrete.

It is not a book about Japanese art; it is not a history book. It is an exploration of the workings of modern Japan. It sometimes reads like a lecture, sometimes like a vindication; but it is written with deep love for the country and if it seems determined in its indictment, this is only the result of a passion for the subject. Read it alongside his other book, Lost Japan, which deals more with the art and culture of the nation, if you want to understand where he is coming from, or if you want a more rounded picture of the developments he is describing. Don't worry about re-reading the same material the books are very different and both are well worth the time.

It's thinly disguised but nevertheless obvious that this author thinks he's better than the Japanese and feels he has something to preach.

Japan has been very good to Mr. Kerr, both personally and professionally. Therefore, Mr. Kerr's case for Japan's current malaise cannot be dismissed as the opinion of an embittered expatriate. This is how negative books about Japan written by foreigners are typically viewed. Nor can one say that Mr. Kerr does not know Japan well enough to write about it; he lived there for 35 years from the time he was a little boy, and I presume he is fluent in Japanese. This book is something to be taken seriously.I think a good measure of a book's quality is how quickly or eagerly one reads it. Well, I basically put aside all other business and read \\"Dogs and Demons\\" in a few days.

(Except enjoying Monica Belucci's naked body later in the film.) But it is a rewarding film, both artistically enlightening and a sharp kick in the gut. Under no circumstances should you watch this movie with your mother, your significant other, or your kids. In fact don't watch this if anyone else is in the room.

The beginning (which was supposed to be the end) gave me eye problems with all the red lightening on and off (not to mention the same question being asked over 20 times) and the end (which was supposed to be the beginning) made my head spin.. there wasn't any lesson, any message or even any point of this movie. The raping lasted for 15 minutes, over and over again.. well, we got the point there, it was a repeated rape!!! absolutely disgusting in my opinion! i think to rate this movie good, you have to be sick!

Her face being kicked and punched to a pulp was utterly sick. I realize this must happen in real life, and I am truly sorry for women this happens to, I just don't need to see it in my home.Another feature of the film that made me almost seasick from the start was the camera technique of swirling the camera around and tilting it different directions.

The movie could have been made better but the story line is definitely worth sharing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to Watch","review":"\\"Irreversible\\" is one of the most violent and cruel films I have ever seen. The rape scene is brutally honest, shot in one long eight minute take without interruption, and the beating at the beginning is so graphic you feel as if the camera is participating in the violence, rising and falling with the blunt instrument.And yet, because of the films honesty, it becomes a film that does not at all condone violence. Instead, it seems to demonstrate it's unnecessary existence in society as it completely destroys two lives, seemingly bound to this destiny by fate as the movie is told in reverse.Brilliant, althought unwatchable to most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oppressive and disturbing","review":"This film reminded me of Man Bites Dog, another film that made me feel sick. But this is possibly worse than MBD. Irreversible is gimmicky pretentious camera work and oppressive soundtrack which makes you want to throw up, and an unnecessarily long rape scene which is only one of the scenes of sordid and sickening violence. There is something peculiarly poignant about how it ends, but it is not enough to redeem the film. Monica Belluci is amazing, especially in the play of emotions over her pregnancy test. But again, not enough to redeem a film that is essentially designed to shock and disturb. Life can be pretty grim as it is without even grimmer fiction thrown in for good measure. It may be worth seeing this once for academic interest, but only just. If you want to be kind to yourself, don't (it is not going to enrich your life)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype OR the hatred","review":"The simple truth is, this movie is boring. Yes, it has a really long (not to say interminable) rape scene in it, and yes, some guy gets his head smashed in with a fire extinguisher. But so what? It's still boring. We just sort of drift around from moment to moment, through what seem to be virtually unscripted scenes, backwards through the \\"story,\\" which has pretty much no focus or ultimate impact. Then it's over and you get to do something more interesting, like shine the silverware. Don't get me wrong, I like dark and disturbing films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, anyone?), but I prefer them to at least be interesting and involving. I'd take anything David Cronenberg ever made over this, and I'm including the early stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure","review":"I found this film difficult to watch. This was not because of the violence, unpleasant though it is, but because in nearly every respect the film fails. The camera work in the early stages is simply irritating and pretentious. The continual girations of the camera creating visual frustration rather than conveying a mood, which is presumably the intention. By telling the story in reverse you know all you are interested in knowing about the characters (who I found uninteresting) and the plot 2/3 of the way through the film thus making the final 1/3 tedious. It comes across as a film student's attempt to make a controversial film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Mediocre","review":"This is by far the most pretentious piece of French crap I have seen in years. What bothers me are not the admittedly disturbing scenes, but rather the banality of the film's underlying idea, which the director, Gaspar Noe, attempted to convey in a thoroughly unremarkable fashion. The characters are not shown in any depth; in fact, there is no meaningful dialogue or any other attempt at all to introduce them to the viewer. Camera work is simply awful - somebody should have explained to the cameraman that rotating a hand-held camera at will for minutes at a time does not always produce art. Apparently, these sterile methods combined with shocking scenes of rape and murder are supposed to produce a new form of cinéma vérité.In short, even though in France almost every baker is an \\"artiste\\" (think \\"baguette artisanale\\"), Mr. Noe is not a \\"cinéaste\\" even by French standards: hit someone in the face with a teakettle and call it art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaspar Noé is pushing the audience into a dark sphere...","review":"In Irreversible, the director Gaspar Noé is pushing the audience into a dark sphere where the audience is exposed to some truly brutal violence as if Noé wants to educate the ignorant minds of the masses. Thus, Noé is creating a very offensive experience as the story is told in reverse where the audience already knows of the coming events as the story unfolds. The story itself will not be revealed here, however, the violence is extremely grotesque and might cause distress and disgust among the audience members. However, behind the nastiness there is something to be pondered that might leave the audience with an echo ringing \\"You cannot escape your actions.\\" The cinematography is cleverly tied together with each frame, and it leaves the audience with a disturbing and distressing cinematic experience that might affect their sleeping patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defines 'gratuitous violence'.","review":"Although I realize Gaspar Noe's entire idea was to shock viewers, I can't help but be disgusted by him and his film. 'Irreversible' is certainly a film that challenges viewers. However, not in any conventional way. Noe challenges viewers to keep watching as a woman is brutually raped for 11 minutes. This scene is shown in all its horror without a single cut. The film is structured somewhat like \\"Memento\\" in that is is shown backwards. This is one of the redeming qualities of the film. The film opens with one of the most violent and realisitc looking scenes where a man is beaten with a fire extinguisher for sometime after he is alrady dead. His skull is smashed into what resembels a crushed melon. It seems like the ideas and and intesity of the film could have come across without all of this excessive brutality. The plot is basically that a man is searching for the man who raped his girlfriend. When in fact the true rapist is Noe himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undue Violence","review":"I rated this film *1* out of *5* because I had to abandon my viewing. The violence was graphic beyond what is tolerable for a person with sensibilities within what might be considered normal. I am no prude; this is the first film I ever abandoned due to violence. I am male and if I ever _do_ abandon a film, I will abandon it out of boredom -- not violence. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what it was hyped to be","review":"According to many of the reviews I read the film was \\"better than Momento,\\" which turned out to be false. Though the camera work was somewhat original it was over done and really not necessary. The story was far too obvious and many of the \\"great\\" scenes went on long past what was needed. This movie should never be compared with Momento, they're completely different movies meant for completely different audiences, and I am not that audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous - Disgusting","review":"Exploiting a rape scene for fame is more than disgusting.What put me most off in this film, was not its violence, but the self serving aim of its financial beneficiaries, namely Noe and Bellucci.That's the bottom line of the whole film, because there is neither an underlying story nor a glimpse of a message/meaning (!!and for sure nothing philosophical!!) to the whole film. Hence the extremly long focus on violence and nudity is used purely gratuitous.Moreover, waving the camera around in an attempt at avant garde technique, doesn't make up for a missing plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will feel as if you have been slimed","review":"This is exploitation cinema masquerading as art.

As for chronological or rather nonchronolgical filmaking, I'm used to that, too. As for violence I'm used to that.But this film was so gratuitous, it ranks on the level of 8mm for shock value. I saw no redeeming value in this and stopped when Monica was seen taken in the ambulance after being raped. (Why did a prostitute tell Alex to take the underpass as being safer (than the street? That didn't make sense to me. And how many times can one use the word rec**m so many times? The foul language and beatings were really gratuitous and could have used a lot of editing.

I also prefer to have stomach turning experiences at an amusement park and not in front of my television.

But this device cannot hide the lack of meaningful diaglog or character development.There is no Tarrantino-like or Polanski-like edge to the violence.

The movie attempts to be \\"Arthouse\\" but only achieves annoying. The infamous Rape scene is vulgar, the only good thing about it is, it eventually comes to an end. The Head Bash scene is almost too hard to see (I suppose that's a good thing too) and the rest of the film is anticlimactic.

The whole movie is in reverse and if you thought Blair Witch was bad with the shakey cameras stay far away from this one. Even if you didn't think it was bad, this will make you dizzy. I don't know why the director kept filming scenes and making it look like the camera was going in circles but it did not help the movie.If you like violence you'll love this movie. If you like to hear people talk about sex, party, and portray violence against women you'll love it. If you're looking for a good revenge story you may like it but I expect a lot more from a film than just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery incarnate","review":"The only good thing about this movie is the way it was shot. The trick camera work is this film's best asset. The retribution scene at the Rectum is not really that big of a deal. The thing which makes this movie intollerable is the long and horrible rape scene. I think this is the most horrible thing I have ever seen in a movie. This scene makes the rape in I Spit On Your Grave seem timid by comparison. (Even the notorious razor-blade rape in the Stendahl Syndrome is comparitively tame.) Many people were disturbed by the rapes in Blue Velvet and The Accused; the latter are G-rated compared to this irresponsibly long, realistic, and sickening (simulated) sexual assault. I'm sure the real sickos out there would probably get off on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will make you sick.","review":"I only made it about 15 minutes into this joke of a movie.

I am not calling this a bad film or a good film. It is effective. During the rape scene you feel like you are right there with Monica Belucci. After I watched it I wanted to go out and kill someone with my bare hands, I was bloodthirsty. I was so angry that such things can be done to innocent people. I have never had such an emotional response to a film, and I watch A LOT of films. It made me feel like the world was a horrible place filled with horrific people. Not a good feeling.

I was intrigued by the polar reviews, some praised the movie for understated direction some hated the nonstop swirling of the camera. As a victim of rape I thought this movie would invoke some emotion, isn't that what a good movie is about. But for the first 25 minutes all I could make out was my reflection on the computer screen and the subtitles. The rape scene left me laughing, so obvious that this is coming from a male's point of direction. So pitiful and delicate, I swear I was watching an anime. I felt nothing for the victim (Alex) and by the time she had her head bashed in I was thinking \\"Well that's what happens when you just lay there\\".

There is no need to be introduced to the slimy world of sex clubs, homosexual or otherwise. An unpolluted mind will do fine, thanks anyway. I'm glad this shaky hand-held camera circus is fast receding from my mind, possibly helped by the (fortunately) ample shades of darkness inflicting most of the flick, which must have saved saved the director from making much sense.I would advise potential viewers to beware of the movie industry's self-congratulatory movie reviews.

The violence is extremely realistic and i am not a squimish person but i felt physically sick on several occasions. Horrific doesnt even cover it and the infomation on the back i think downplays how brutal the film is.nothing is left to the imagination.if i was going to praise this film for anything it would be how it reveals just how much we fool ourselves into thinking we are civilised creatures and how close to instinct driven predators we really are."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star because I can't give zero","review":"A piece of dung in an artistic package is still a piece of dung. This was the most SICKENING work of cinema I've ever seen. Unless you find enjoyment in watching a rape scene in which a man forces violent anal sex on a weeping woman at knife-point, I urge you to steer clear of this one. I'm not talking a slit-second visual flash to let you know what's happening ala Pulp Fiction, but several excrutiating minutes (felt like an eternity) of uninterrupted, graphic rape followed by beating - great, guys.

Don't make the mistake I did - stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repugnant Rubbish","review":"Just when you thought the French couldn't sink any lower along comes Irreversible. Told in reverse this film is essentially a tale of revenge however unlike other films in this genre this film lacks any class and goes straight for the juggular. Whilst much of the debate over this film surrounds the infamous 10minute rape sequence, an act of violence towards the start of the film is perhaps the most violent and reprehensible scene ever committed to celluloid. Stobe lights and crazy camera movements drive the viewer to reach for the sick bag rather than be dazzled by the director's attempts at stylistic meaning and the main characters are all shallow, unlikeable people. This film is an ugly and pretentious attempt at displaying the darker side of human nature and the concepts of fate and time however ends up wallowing in its own sordid mess losing any messages it was trying to make in the process.

I love a dark/disturbing movie just as much as the next guy/girl. But this film is sick and twisted (the rape scene goes on way too long). Unecessary. We get the point after the first minute or two...I don't know...I guess this is either one of the most daring films to be made in the last few years or one of the worst. Shouldn't a movie be something you want to view again though? This is definitely not one of those movies.

First, the movie starts from backwards to forwards, similiar to Momento. In the beginning of the movie, the camera work could make anyone dizzy. The worst part of the film without question was the rape scene. This is the longest rape scene (about 10 minutes) that I have ever seen and it was very brutal. Lastly, I have been going to movie theatres for a long time, but I never experienced a reaction from moviegoers as was the case here. Halfway through the film, most of the people in the theatre left! It was incredible to see people walk out of the theartre, all of whom were very upset about the contents of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"If you like spinning camera effects for no other reason than to seem artistic, you'll love this movie.

I don't think it's very innovative to constantly spin the camera or to have the film in reversed sequence...seen that all before. Surely, it's technically well done but also makes it kind of exhausting to watch.What bothers me most is the story: I have nothing about very explicit movies, but there needs to be a reason for that. Just showing how wrong and bad people can be is not deep, it's nothing new... and this is the biggest problem I had with this movie: it tries to be really deep and unraveling, but the story really isn't.

This movie is so bad that I hardly know where to begin. At the start,or is it the end, of the movie the movement of the camera got me as near to air sick as I care to be with the constant moving around.

Irreversible (which as a lame play on words is told in a reverse chronological order) almost always teeters on the brink of the latter, shocking for the sake of shocking, gory for the sake of being gory.If voyeuristic fireworks is what you're after, at least real porn maintains the honesty of not hiding its true identity behind an artistic veneer. I regret that the colossal waste of time on this idiotic film is indeed irreversible."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"Two scenes: a murder, and a rape.

I almost vomited so many times watching this movie that I felt like I was playing some sort of drinking game in reverse. Where I expected to see time lapse footage of, say, a sprouting seedling, instead I was confronted with death and head-smashing and a devastating fire extinguisher.I have watched this movie 10+ times now and have not noticed a single plant, even in the background. This rejection of the natural world is tantamount to ecological murder. So this is a murder movie. One wonders where the characters in this film get their oxygen, given the dearth of photorespiration.

Its like an art film but NOT a horror movie!It has a couple violent scenes in it, including a disturbing rape scene but this movie is not scary at all.The camera work made me dizzy, and was done for effect. If you are looking for a violent movie about revenge, check out the \\"I spit on your Grave\\" remake starring Sarah Butler. \\"Irreversible\\" is a hodge podge of visual images that attempts to turn rape and revenge into artistic cinematic statements.

Some people might also dislike the style in which the story is portrayed. It's told in reverse order, with awkward and revolving camera shots, dark and almost incomprehensible imagery, plus bizarre sound effects. It has a very twilight zone feel to it.But its done in a very artistic manner, with the intention of numbing the audience. This movie wouldn't have the same effect if it was told in the more standard format. Brilliant filmmaking.There are a couple of the most savage and violent scenes I have ever experienced.

It's not for the weak at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil in the flesh","review":"This is a remarkable movie on many accounts and, unless you spooked by its 'controversy' trumpeted in the media, you oughta see it. A hint: if you appreciated 'Once Upon a Time in America' - you should be well-prepared. The hard-hitting sequence of brutal acts in the beginning of the movie is undoubtedly to make you, the viewer, suffer with the victims IRREVERSIBLY. And there is no way around it, unless you want a film about something else. The director is thoughtful enough, though, to make it reversible, at least for us, by flipping the time backwards. This film is about the oldest collisions of humanity: temptation by evil, paradise lost and suffering of innocents. It is very compassionate, even poetic, and has zero cynicism. In short, it is a moral tale told the way that makes you GET IT. A+!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sex and violence exploitation, thats it","review":"This film was only made for exploitation and shock value. I see no entertainment value in this movie. I wish I never watched it. There is no character development, not much of a plot. The only reason this film received praise is because it's French which automatically puts in the artsy category. Vincent is a great actor but he's wasted in this mess. After watching this film the only things you will remember are the brutal rape and violence scenes.

The banality and beauty in the ending scene (the first chrologically) between the romantically linked characters illustrates NOTHING. Apparently, we are all predestined... which is a trite and infuriating belief system as far as I'm concerned. One does not need to BELIEVE in what a film SAYS in order to LIKE it, I realize... the message of this film is simply too childish for me.I believe that this film was important for some people to see... hell, I believe it was well made for the most part.

Maybe this is a good film but I couldn't tell you because the camera work makes it incomprehensible. The spinning camera trick does mostly stop after 1/2 hour, but I decided at that point if I should watch the rest of the movie. It is full of allot of nauseating violence and gay sex.

Everyone looks at the photo and no one dares to say how shitty the photo is actually. The filming is supposed to create a different fresh perspective and angles but it is really some high schooler trying to show off a technique and overdoing it. The violent rape scene is done in detail, brutal, crude but real. This is the only real enthralling part...can even be called art. However, it dwells excessively long on it, with no real clear purpose.

And, as expensive as electronics are I would prefer them to be properly grounded! another note is that even tho this plug has a flat head it is very bulky (slimline, ha!) and won't fit into a recessed box and probably will also cover too much of a regular flush mount outlet box to allow you to use the second outlet.It would be very helpful if Amazon posted better pictures of products so one could see that they will or will not work before ordering.

Although the view is perfect and the crashing waves are serene and soothing, for the more experienced yogi, this workout DOES NOT make you sweat. Additionally, this DVD does not showcase true vinyasa flow yoga. Rainbeau does not flow, but rather fidgets into, throughout and out of every single pose. Her voice is also quite annoying, and it definitely does not leave you in a calm and peaceful state of mind after completion. I did not find this DVD to be challenging, a workout or pure sweat. If you would like to sweat, build muscle, increase cardiovascular endurance and flexibility, and lose weight/keep in shape then this DVD is not for you.

The flash works fine, there is no need for extra lights. Give the camera a second to just 'assess' the lighting and you'll see it'll boost the image up by cranking the ISO and that might be where many are complaining about the noise levels. Getting too close to a persons face can distort how they look so it's not the camera. It works great indoors and out. My husband and I just needed a simple camera that fit in our pockets and this one is it. I'm not wild about the way the colors change in the different modes such as sunset and a few others, but that's it. You can't control the ISO so if you are concerned with noise that shows up in JPEG images so this one might not be right for you. With enough lighting the camera doesn't boost the ISO. In some modes you can turn on the flash and override that little problem. For the price it's not a bad camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used mine for over 1 year, 1000s of pics until recently broke","review":"and it was really my fault: I've gotten so used to treating the thing with (relative) impunity, I just tossed it into a backpack, where the power button must have been bumped.

Nary a bad picture in just about ever conceivable lighting condition, good videos (with sound), and small form made this ~$150 very well spent.

I will agree with others that the pictures are 'noisy' under less than perfect lighting conditions. I took flash pictures indoors and non-flash pictures outside under grey skies and both sets of pictures appeared 'noisy'. I attribute this to the auto-iso feature; (I would love to have been able to preset the ISO setting to see if it made a difference). Because there is only a 3x optical zoom, noise is an issue as you cannot zoom in well enough for most distant subjects and cropping would be necessary, thus magnifying any noise issues present.For me, the ease of carrying does not outweigh the noisy images I received. If your primary need is for a convenient pocket-carry camera then the L3 may fit your needs as it is easily pocketable in a shirt or pants. but be forwarned about image quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"depends on what you expect","review":"If you expect a cheap camera with limited functionality and picture-taking that will only work in good light, then this is a good camera for you.When we purchased the camera, I didn't expect that it would be as bad as it is indoors.

I opened it to the first page and was immediately transported to the 17th century world of Puritan father John Winthrop and his niece, Elizabeth. Since that moment 20 years ago, I've read widely in the field of American history, both in fiction and nonfiction. Winthrop Woman is one of the few books I've returned to again and again, for its portrayal of this little known but highly courageous woman, her times, and the times of America's very beginnings. Writing, plotting, biographical treatment, characterization, and historical accuracy in this novel are superb. This is \\"time travel\\" at its best, the real thing. While some of Seton's novels have become a bit dated, this is her masterpiece, and it has stood the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a romance.","review":"I wouldn't call this book a romance, though it certainly contains romantic episodes and can even be sentimental at times. but Anya Seton is renowned for her detailed historical research and it is very evident here. based on a real-life character, The Winthrop Woman captures how very difficult life was on the eastern seaboard in those early years; it was a real frontier, and must have been terrifying at times for those women trying to make a home for husband and children in those days. This is what I liked about the book - yes, in places it was a little slow, but Seton brought Elizabeth's day-to-day struggles to life for me. I looked around my little house at the end of it and felt very blessed. In short, a book for those who like well-written genuine historical fiction from a gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing After Katherine","review":"I read this book after reading Katherine--a novel that was a page turner from the start. The Winthrop Woman was a major disappointment. The characters seemed flat and uninteresting, and I had to convince myself to keep reading at several points. The main character, Elizabeth, seemed headstrong and foolish but not in any way that was endearing.

For someone who is a early colonial history enthusiast the book might have some merit but overall it was not an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not entirely fictional","review":"While technically this book is historical fiction, it tells the tale of a real woman and the people in her life.

You can't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Seton's best","review":"This novel has so much to offer. It tells the story of the relatively unknown Winthrop family -- specifically Elizabeth Winthrop. The novel is long but you'll find yourself wanting even more at the end. Seton takes her time, describing the girl's life growing up in England, her voyage across seas to a new land, and her adult life in Massachusetts and Connecticut. It is a fascinating story and once again, Seton does an immense amount of research that makes the novel even more enjoyable to read. I certainly recommend it for anyone from the New England area, as the Winthrops were quite a prominent family in the 17th century.

For example I found it hard to believe that Guido would allow his teenage daughter to become involved in finding evidence for a murder which he suspected from the beginning might have Mafia connections. Until now, I have not been a fan of murder mysteries since I don't like graphic descriptions of violence. But the Leon books seldom dwell on those details.

I will bail out at CD 2 or 3 if it is excessive and not required to keep the plot moving.The reason this book should be avoided is WHEN you combine The Ending of the book WITH the graphic violence described 'on the video tapes', there is no redemption, no catharsis, nothing of value for the reader. All the reader is left with is pictures of depravity and a depraved society.What is the benefit of getting merely one more slice of depravity?I can't think of any.

The writing and acting is horrible which is somewhat unforgivable because Mr. Loaf gives a stunningly great performance in Focus and, of course, his memorable job in Fight Club. Not to mention he had enough talent to score parts in Hair and The Rocky Horror Show. Where is that talent here?It could be the abysmal writing. It could be a total lack of direction.Even the music sucks.

It may not be Oscar material, but as a cult classic, this is up there with Rocky Horror and Easy Rider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corny, but fun.","review":"If you are a big Meat Loaf fan as I am, this movie is a real hoot.

Hate him if you choose to, this brotha has the ability to light up a stage and get every fan involved. His performance on this album is almost like a stage play. His band, (talented by the way) directed by Valdez Brantley on keyboards made the music sound much more enhanced than any of his studio recordings. The dancers gave the production an intriguing storyline with the focus geared towards intimacy, love, peace, unity and equality.

While it does contain a decent quantity of useful, relevant reference information for a bioinformatics student, the (dollar) price tag is far too high. Furthermore, no real introduction to Perl is found in the book, save the preface in pp. 4-5--that is to say, some basic knowledge of Perl will be an absolute requirement. As a student, I would personally lean toward any of the excellent O'Reilly bioinformatics and/or Perl books myself; they are well written, contain much of the same relevant information with additional explanations, and at a much lower price per page. Bottom line: You may find Perl for Bioinformatics useful as a pocket reference guide, but it is probably not worth the astronomical price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can Perl be used for in bioinformatics?","review":"This is a brief introduction to some of the things that one can do in Perl; it lacks scope and has few useful examples, but gives a flavor for what is available.

His novels, such as Dhalgren and Triton, are well-regarded. They are also frequently unapproachable: big, gnarly books with big, gnarly subjects. They certainly are not much like the rafts of semi-literate junk that passes for much of SF these days. But you won't sit down and toss of a Delany novel...This book, though, is hugely approachable. As a short story collection, it covers a wide span of the author's career and gives us very classic, deep, meaningful, soulful stories. From \\"Star Pit\\" as the start to the author's afterword we get a range of great and near-great stories. If you love Delany's longer work, here is a chance to collect a beautiful volume of short fiction. If you want to get into Delany, here's your best opportunity.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top shelf SF","review":"Delany's language is poetic and stimulating but refreshingly succinct. I've never read words like these.

The DVD never mentions Paula's first twins. Where did they go since their father had died? What happened to Linnett, Paula's younger daughter? Lindsay Wagner as a red haired Brit is a disgrace.

My high school English teacher was apalled when she saw me reading one of his books, and laughed at me in front of the class. She's one of the type that only read stuff like Lord of the Flies or Grapes of Wrath. I'll admit that it's not high literature, but for an American adventure writer, L'Amour certainly did his best. Flint contains a unique story unequaled by many of the most symbolic novels or short stories. The character development, description, and emotion are powerful and moving, as well as the sense of breath-taking adventure characteristic of L'Amour at his best.

Ray Gillen's soulful voice is incredible. You feel each of the songs that he sings in his voice. These guys had a lethal combination and knew how to rock. Stand out tracks for me on the album are the riff oriented drive of \\"High Wire\\", the lament of \\"Winter's Call\\", the hard rocking \\"Streets Cry Freedom\\" and my favorite 2, \\"Devil's Stomp\\" and \\"Seasons.\\" If you like good bluesy hard rock and want to hear the best, I recommend that you obtain this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book of beginning tunes.","review":"It is obvious that Paul Deloughery set out to assemble a book of highland bagpipe tunes catering to the beginner when looking at this collection.

I have had none of the problems with leakage that others have written about. It is easy to set up. The timer works well and I like the automatic cutoff. Because of the metal in its construction it is heavier than som other coffee makers. This might be an issue if you have to slide it out from under a cabinet to pour water into the tank.

Well, Hamilton Beach already told me that it is discontinued. The problem is that Today's Concepts, Amazon and Foto Connection are advertising that they have this product in Apple color, but once you order it, you'll find out they don't. They are all going through Hamilton Beach who doesn't make it any more. It's a waste of time.

Very heavy, looked very sturdy and I thought this would be the coffemaker I would have for years. We make coffee only once a day, on most days of the week. The heating element pooped out 6 months after our purchase. O.K., the company made good and sent us another one, it was under warranty. It lasted 1 year of light use, and the heating element went out on us again.....lukewarm coffee, and the enamel paint was peeling just above the hot plate. It bubbled up and flaked off in big pieces to reveal the bare metal beneath it. I am very disappointed to have spent $130. + dollars on this item. Last week we bought a new coffemaker for $69., and I threw the other one out. Don't waste your money......2 coffemakers and the element went on both of them. I only hope our toaster lasts......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The only positive thing I can say about this coffeemaker is it looks great, until the enamel above the burner plate starts bubbling and peeling off.

Ours died after a short year and a half, not what I expect for the money paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last long","review":"For a year and a half, this coffee maker would have earned 5 stars. I bought it for it's solid construction and as a side benefit, it made darned good coffee. Then I noticed some blistering in the plastic lid that covers the water well. I guess the water heating element had melted it, making me wonder what kind of hot-plastic chemicals were seeping into my coffee. Then the burner plate started to peel...dramatically. I contacted the manufacturer to see if I could purchase a replacement cover for the water well and they never responded. It's gone to the landfill now and I've switched to a manual drip cone over an insulated carafe.Greener and cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish we could have more color options like this in other brands.","review":"I love the LOOK of this coffe pot I had mine for a year and a couple months and all of the sudden it made an electric \\"noise\\" and the warming plate did not work any longer!

I am scared that it will also break but I love the sea breeze color and that is why I bought it!!!! But if you are looking for quality for the price other than esthetically this pot is a gamble....nov08: I have had the replacement only for maybe 6 months and already there is a problem, the coffee pot now will not turn off and so I have to unplug it to turn off the warming plate.. So the first one would not heat and this one won't stop..

The guitars are louder, the drumming more technical and the vocals more angry. The evolved sound suggests that a violent guitar hero read a Time magazine and got a conscience. The Death holds on to their original values and at the same time put out records that sound nothing like each other. I for one applaud their bravery to again put out a record that sounds nothing like the one before it. Each record is completely different and this one is no exception. I think this record will open up the musical ears of rebellious kids and at the same time make metal kids care about something more than mere shock value. Buy this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of an absolutely outstanding trilogy","review":"Kilogridis has written a truely wonderful vampire trilogy. All three of the set were books that were impossible to put down until the last page was read. But this last book in the trilogy was definately the icing on the cake.

All around great trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative with subtle homophobia","review":"It isn't even that much of the elements have been done before by better writers. Or that the few original ideas don't logically track. It's that the author runs a subtle but nonetheless disturbing homophobia through all three novels.(Every time there's any hint whatsoever of some ambiguous character, this person is always repugnant) And yet she seems to have no problems whatsoever with rampant incest. Disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A childish and ill-thought out book","review":"I have only read one book in this series, that relating to Bram Stoker's Dracula, and that was more than enough. I am at a loss as to how the other reviewers could praise it so highly. The plot line which follows Stoker's Dracula was laughable, it was so unbelievale, the characters retained nothing of their original form and the ending was so ludicrous it left me annoyed that I had wasted my time in reading to the end. If you like pulp Vampire fiction with pretensions at being literary then buy this, if you want a decent vampire tale, then avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read - You'll Enjoy!","review":"\\"Lord of the vampires\\" is the last of the trilogy of \\"The Diaries of the Family Dracul\\". The first book is \\"Covenant With the Vampire\\" and the second is \\"Children of the Vampire. The reason I mentioned the other novels is because they really should be read before reading this one. All are highly engrossing and interesting. How Ms Kalogridis thought up all this is beyond me - but she is obviously talented. Although all the books are wonderful reads - be prepared - there are strange situations in the books - among them are incest and homosexuality. The books don't go into to much \\"intimate\\" details on these subjects - and they're not something that carries on into the complete story. So the squeamish should tolerate them just fine. Therefore, I would advise anyone who likes vampire novels to purchase all three of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tour de Force of what Bram Stoker started.","review":"I thought \\"Dracula\\" was the consummate vampire saga, so theidea of a \\"prequel\\" was suspect. I was not disappointed.This is the final book of a trilogy that left me wishingthat Kalogridis had started her tale even further back inthe Dracul family tree. I was stunned and excited by theatrocious and erotic scenes so vividly woven through thesebooks. From the evil of Vlad, the impaler, to the goodof Dr. Van Helsing, the author has animated characters ofdepth and substance, while creating a most frightening storyof pure fiction, pure legend and actual historical facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY do people like this book?","review":"This is quite possibly the most dissapointing novel I have ever read, horror or otherwise. After two GREAT books in the series, the final book is rushed and features every two-bit hackneyed method the author could come up with. It starts off great for the first 200 pages, don't get me wrong. The parts with Elizabeth, Vlad, Harker, and Zsusanna are absoulutely perfect. But once we get to England...it's formula all the way, with some 'twists' thrown in to attempt to keep the reader guessing. This book is deservingly spoiled when I say that the ending to the entire series is cobbled together from the last ten pages of the book, and everything beforehand is utterly pointless.But if you want a good read, you can always just read the first 200 pages and then make up your own ending. That's what I wish I had done before I had unfortunetly kept reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Vampires","review":"I received the book in great time and it was in excellent condition.

But do not listen to this album hoping to hear a authentic phish sound because you won't. It's a very \\"Page\\" sounding album. But as anyone who is probably buying this album knows, music by an artist like Page McConnell can't be appreciated at less in the live format. I personally own SIRIUS radio and caught his live performances on air. I am really psyched to catch him this summer. The highlight on the album for me is \\"Heavy Rotation\\". I recommend giving it a listen, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This CD showcases Page's talent, creativity and musicianship in a way that reminds me why I loved listening to him play in Phish so much.The songs are tight while still conveying an improvisational, jammy feel that works well. Page's piano playing is the highlight for me. On some tracks, he adds synthesizer and other fun instruments (including \\"toy piano\\") for cool, sound-enhancing effects. The lyrics are decent enough: heartfelt without being (overly) cheesy. The instrumental, improvisational reunion jam, \\"Back in the Basement\\", is a great mid-album highlight.Despite a solid effort, there are a few weak tracks here. The album fades towards the end and I get slightly tired of Page's voice for a full album (perhaps a duet or two would have been nice).Overall, this is a worthwhile buy and a nice branch-out addition to my CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ANY Phish album!!!","review":"Page has blown my mind, man!

When I ordered from SmileMedic, I was unable to get a specific product expiration date from them, only that it would be 12-18 months. I believe I got a faulty product because I've had trouble with the syringe tips popping off and the gel oozing into the case while being stored which exposes the remaining gel to air and ruins it. Also, the unopened tubes seem to have lost their potency despite having several months left on the expiration date. I found SmileMedic difficult to communicate with from the very beginning because they did not know everything about the product they are selling and will buy elsewhere in the future. It's too much like talking to a wall to attempt an exchange at this point. Though I'll take a loss on this purchase, SmileMedic has lost a repeat customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product featured not the one sent","review":"After reading reviews, I carefully selected teh product that indicated it was the Discus Dental product as this is the one I purchased through my dentist and have had great success with. What I received was Phillips Zooma and as I was travelling in a few days, felt I would try it anyway. No matter how many \\"best product award\\" stickers you put on the box, doesn't make it a better product. Just wasn't as effective at whitening.

Most importantly the watch is accurate to the second. I love gadgets and this is one of the most fascinating ones I've owned in a long time.

Not only are the shots beautiful, the acting superb, and the story enthralling, the parallels between the prison threatre scences and the flashback scenes are incedible.

The resulting product is disappointing. I was left wondering as to the relevance of many scenes, and decided that the whole thing reflected some one's ego trip/ Probably someone in production. The story line is unrealistic and unbelievable, which is so in many movies, but the viewer is never convinced otherwise, as is the job of a good director and/or producer to manage. This movie fails on those accounts and left me bored and wanting it to finish as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay awake!","review":"With the current situation with priests in the Catholic church this film shows that it has been on on going problem, as early as 1912.

This film could be all women or even straight with minor changes. That to me, is a test for a movies interest factor. If you want to read about the storyline in great detail, there are plenty of them listed here. I however, want to share my thoughts about the overall production values.The casting was fantastic. The actors seemed like they were molded to play the characters they played. The sets are dreamlike (when appropriate) and clear as a bell (when appropriate). There was lushness mixed with raw sewage\\"right\\" with \\"wrong\\", love with hate and love with love with love... Visually, it's perfection and that, with perfect casting, acting and direction is high on my list of essential viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missed the point","review":"One reviewer was upset by so many \\"effeminate\\" homosexuals in the film. I think he totally missed the point!! Many of the male characters in the film were supposed to be putting on a play. The story is a \\"play within a play\\" .Many of the male characters were supposed to be playing females in order to tell a 'true' story. They were supposed to be acting and portraying female characters; not effeminate homosexuals! The film does not even imply that the male prisoner characters were even gay! The truly (known) Gay characters in the film (the bishop and the lead prisoner telling the story) were not stereotypically effeminate.Side note (me on my soapbox): There are masculine and effeminate Gay men. To paraphrase a great man of history: \\"People should be judged by the content of their Characters, not by the color of their skin (OR any other trait like degree of effeminate or masculine behavior)\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Film","review":"I loved this movie when I first saw it a the Gay Lesbian Film festival in San Francisco. It is beautifully filmed and is a touching suspenseful story. The way the prisoners transform themselves to act out the part of these 2 men's past is delightful. I am very choosy about the films I own. I bought this one and it stands up to multiple viewings. You must check out this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful if theatrical","review":"Lilies is a beautiful play and the sense of the play is very much present in the film. That theatricality can be a little off-putting if you are not prepared for it - the inmates performing all the roles, male and female, for example - but for me it does not distract from the simplicity of the story. The soundtrack, sections of a latin mass, composed by Michael Danna, add an ethereally spiritual quality to the procedings. Well worth the suspension of disbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try wearing this for very long!","review":"This thing is just murderous on your back. Straps are narrow, cheap and uncomforable.

Considered by many as the greatest driver vs driver battle ever in F1 not one bit is shown during the French coverage even though you can get stacks of footage of this moment in various degrees of quality on the internet.Here is a sample of what was left OFF the DVD:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr_6mA8Q2tITo top that off they don't even show three Grand Prix from the season and the commentator constantly confuses drivers Laffite, Depallier, Arnoux, Jabouille, Lauda and Piquet.On the positive side the footage that is shown is good quality, but come on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great and virtually unknown 20's jazz/blues singer","review":"Elzadie Robinson, was a great blues/jazz singer in the 20's, this set of 17 songs needs to be re-evaluated by music historians. Robinson deserves to be more well known then she is, her music hasn't dated at all, she often used top notch jazzmen of the era to back her up. On this CD there are 17 songs by the virtually unknown Robinson, and six alternate takes by the even more obscure Lottie Beaman who sings pretty darn good too!

If that was what I was looking for then that was what I would have made it my business to buy.

There was much more \\"telling\\" than \\"showing\\" going on in all three of the stories Ms. Alexis has written. I knew what the characters were thinking, since their thoughts were all in first person, but there was no descriptive actions or emotions that matched these thoughts. I felt that this lead to very little chemistry and no emotional connection between any of her characters - other than he's hot/she's hot, lets do it. As any romantica/erotica fan knows, there has to be chemistry for anything else to be believable. Since I couldn't feel the heat, all of the sex scenes were mechanical at best and downright boring at worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nadir of the CSN career","review":"Firstly I'd like to say that this is not a live album - as described here. Its a studio ablum from 1990. frankly, its quite bad. The production is very very cheesy - synths, wimpy drums etc. With a different production - perhaps simple acoustic guitars - this album could be rescued. There are 3 quite good songs on the album - Haven't We Lost Enough, Yours and Mine and After The Dolphin. These guys can sing almost as good today as they could in 1969 - a sparse backing track instead of the awful 80's synth/drum tripe would've been lovely. I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to buy the Box-Set (which contains the 3 aforementioned songs), or a fanatic who must own all their stuff - otherwise i wouldn't bother - Buy \\"Crosby, Stills Nash\\", \\"Deja Vu\\", \\"CSN\\", \\"Daylight Again\\", \\"American Dream\\", \\"After The Storm\\" or \\"Looking Forward\\" first - they're all better albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their weakest album","review":"This is Crosby, Stills, & Nash's weakest album. They venture too far into pop and not enough rock on this one. The most interesting song on it is \\"After The Dolphin\\" where Nash seems to try to remake the C&N classic \\"Last Whale\\". All-in-all, this is a very forgettable album. Recommended for hardcore CSN fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost album","review":"Not many folks give CSN much credit for this album. Lost hippie cred writing into the 90s? No mega-classics? Aging voices? Despite these issues, the album isn't really that bad. They carry their protest through the decade of greed, and the first two songs: Live it Up and If Anybody Had a Heart are both worthy of their prior panthenon of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to reconsider","review":"Issued in 1990, just before the boxed set, with great expectations (Lou Reed, Neil Young, Bob Dylan had just issued relevant and popular albums), this LP was universally banned by the critics and was a flop commercially.The prejudice at the time was probably more against the production (slick 80's and actually not what one expect from a CSN album) than against the songwriting itself. In fact both were good. Live it Up is a cathy opener with a great guitar solo. Yours and Mine (with a Brandford Marsalis solo !) After the Dolphin are also very goog songs. And the best track of the album Haven't we lost enough ? is one of Stills alltime best.Just give it a try, you may have a good surprise if you're a CSN fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only CSN Album To Avoid","review":"Being a CSN (and sometimes Y) fan, I bought this CD when it first came out. I wish I hadn't. It seems as if CSN didn't put any effort into recording it, and that they were more interested in making a \\"90s\\" record than a CSN record. It isn't a total waste though. Stills' \\"Haven't We Lost Enough\\" and Crosby's \\"Yours and Mine\\" could fit on any CSN record. It's better just to skip the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes,the cover does say it all.","review":"simply the worst album ever recorded by a respectable artist!believe me i'v tried to like this,but all in vain,it stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ever","review":"What were Crosby, Stills, and Nash thinking? This is awful record. As another review has mentioned, they were only supposed to be releasing live discs and such at this time. It was 1990 and they released this barfbag of an album.

Last year, I picked up an epixor eb-30, in addition to my conventionals.pros:-easy to cast(i can't cast a conventional w/ a 3 ft leader if i tried.)-bait runner works great, used on smacks, ling, bull reds, sharks, kings.-EB-30 holds ~200+yds of 30lb of braid, which is more than enough via kayak.-drag is nice and smooth, just as good as a normal epixor ef-30-has a standard rear drag when in baitrunner mode, helps when trolling for kings if your ribbon fish is causing too much dragcons:-slightly bigger than the ef-30-the clicker is not loud enough!!!!-the paint on the exterior chips too easy, typical okuma quality. Okuma products tend to work just fine, but they look beat up with only 1+ yrs of moderate fishing.I recently bought a 2nd epixor eb30 and no longer bring out my conventionals for nearshore fishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reel for the price","review":"This is the 4th Okuma reel I've purchased and they have all been great reels, especially considering the price. Fished in the Hatteras, NC surf with this one. It cast nicely and operated flawlessly. It cranked smoothly and the baitfeeding lever tripped effortlessly. I paired it with a light surf rod for my teen-aged son. He loved it, my wife loved it, I loved it. And I can buy a whole lot of these for the price of high-end reels, especially when I don't have the opportunity put real high mileage on a reel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality on the Okuma Epixor","review":"After using this reel for about five hours it became very hard to reel in as if the spinning part was jammed. Once I got it turning there was a constant rubbing sound--it looks as if the part that spins (the cylinder that holds the bail) is bent and rubbing against the part it surrounds.I paid $13 to send it back to Okuma and they did fix it so it does not jamb anymore, but still rubs and reels in very roughly--that roughness is very annoying to hear since it constantly reminds me what low quality it is.On a side note; I am pretty sure that Okuma makes the Cabela's Salt Striker reels which are much lower in price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expixor EF20a","review":"Purchased two of these reels from Sportsman' Warehouse in Chattanooga. Both had the extremely annoying problem with the line hanging up in the bail pickup.

I loved the New York theater milieu and the skill with which he juggled a large cast of characters. Yes, I balked at some outrageous coincidences early in the book, but I was eating out of the author's hand by the denouement. Bram writes convincing sex scenes of various persuasions and offers a broad cast of characters ranging from a famously out British Shakespearean, to a New York-phobic suburban matron, to the New York Times' No. 2 drama critic (\\"the buzzard of Off-Broadway\\"). The whole gang ends up at a beautifully handled party scene that brought to mind \\"La Regle du Jeu.\\" And Chekhov's famous dictum about the gun on the wall comes into play before the final page. Great fun, with sympathy for all its flawed characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A amazing view into a very rich Chinese history","review":"I have read this book a total of four times since my mother bought me this book. The description of the T'ang city is extremely rich and very colorful and the characters are very wonderful to read..

You won't be making alot of noise when walking across the floor. The calf circumference is adjustable somewhat with the belts, and the details are nice. I only gave it 4 stars as it is somewhat \\"manish\\" in style, but I still love them. The price on these aquatalia boots from East Coast Shoe is amazing.

So, you'll find the novel switching back and forth between the story and the scenes at the bar (such as Sisko stopping to enjoy his Jambalaya). I find that the scenes just get in the way of the story and gets irritating at times.If you want a better book in the series, go for \\"The Captain's Table : Once Burned\\" by Peter David. It's a lot better than this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a good story in here somewhere","review":"If you can get past the fact that the focus of the action changes on an almost page by page basis (from Sisko's story to the bar to his story to the bar), there's really a good story in here screaming to get out. However, it's quickly lost in Trek cliches and some weak prose. Sisko's reactions are good and the idea that the story is set during season four is a nice touch. But how many times do the authors have to remind us of that? Once is enough, thank you.Beyond that, the shifting, which is amsuing at first, wears thing quickly and causes you to lose track of what exactly is going on in the action. If they'd confined the bar comments to the beginning or end of chapters it would make a whole lot more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"'The Mist'; An awful Deep Space Nine novel","review":"I absolutely hated this novel; the third and worst edition of the six novel 'captain's table' series.

I have used the WebLogic bible before and it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner by Dr. Ben-Natan","review":"The book is extremely well structured, offering a broad scope of information for the entire horizon of users ranging from the people who want a high level understanding of the functionality and purpose of the application server, to installation details for system administration and troubleshooting purposes.It is excellent from a developer and architect perspective as it offers a complete explanation of what the functions are, where they should be applied and how they should be coded, including sample code, covering all key areas such as JMS, EJB, web services and LDAP. Further to these the book also explains the use of other applications such as Visual Age for developing Websphere.The book also provides a CD with trial versions of the applications including Visual Age and the Websphere Developer Studio.All in all an excellent well thought through book offering both high level and in-depth detail of a very complex application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound in a Small Package","review":"I selected this sound projector to address a space constraint from built in cabinets. I had purchased a small plasma TV without speakers to fit into a lower cabinet and needed an audio solution. Receiver plus left/right/center speakers was not a desirable solution, again due to space constraints and without prewiring. The Yamaha YSP-800 was the perfect solution - right dimensions, eliminated the receiver, all the wiring to external speakers, and the sound is really solid. Source devices - tuner, cable box, DVD - and external subwoofer (recommended) all connected without a hitch. If you have a space constraint, want a simple turnkey solution for audio output, I highly recommend this Yamaha. It provides great sound in a small package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rental Movie","review":"Box indicates this is a rental movie, but I don't see where the description says that any where.

Wow, this movie was great fun. Not a classic, but the deaths are fun and more Rube Goldbergian than ever. And the tie in to the series was great, even if you saw it coming. If you enjoyed this franchise, or even if you thought it wore out it's welcome, you'll have fun with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again...?","review":"There are two crucial movies in this series: Final Destination (1) and The Final Destination (6). FD 2, 3, 4, and 5 are simply less and less exciting rehashes of #1. They do get progressively bloodier, but also progressively less relevent.Basically, see FD1 and TFD6 in that order, back-to-back. It's one big, exciting ride. Leave out the fluff that is 2-5."},{"rating":"2","title":"final des","review":"This particular final destination movie was a little more close up with the gory accidents that is always forseen at the beginning,but this movie has a good ending even we know how the movie goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 3d No Purchase","review":"I will not purchase this film unless it has a 3d version the way it was meant to be seen...its down right cheap of new line enema i mean new line Cinema to release this film in 2d only...the british are getting a 3d version why cant we..i am tired of companies double dipping"},{"rating":"1","title":"Until this movie is offered in 3D it will suck!!!!!","review":"This movie was ment to be in 3D (infact it was shot in 3D) and no word of a 3D release date only a 2d version just like shark night. I would give this a 4 out of 5 stars if this was also offered in 3D but cause it is not i will give it only 1 star. That is how great the 3D was in it. It was better than avatar and legends.

What a waste!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"they just wanted extra money","review":"how sad. these thrillers (Final Destination Franchise) were actually pretty good, overall. Thoughtful premise and okay acting plus imaginative ends for those involved gave the movies a foot up on the usual slasher garbage. Then along comes this one. Boy were we excited! Too late we realised someone really needed money. They destroyed what had been a good run for some better than average teen slasher/silly fare. I KNOW...foolish of me even for a minute to hope that anyone in hollywood has a smidge of integrity remaining but hope for mankind never dies I suppose.

Here is a list of what i did not like:1. the plot is the same as all the other movies2. the CGI was not too good, though it might be intentional3. everything was predictable4. the laws told were disregarded in the end5. it was too violent, but not comparable to the quality of saw.thats all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb movie","review":"I didn't know what \\"final destination\\" was about when I rented it, but I suspected it was one of those dumb movies - the kind with not much plot, cheap thrills, and few surprises.

A bunch of young people getting bumped off one by one in gruesome and semi-fathomable yet unrealistic ways.

Different ways of peoples' demise. This one's premonition starts on a charter bus stuck in traffic on a suspension bridge maintenance project. It was one of the better of the FD flicks. Possibly a bit more gory than others.I thought the ending came together better in this than the other four. Oh, it does leave the door open for 6. Sit back, and enjoy a movie not to be taken seriously"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as all others in the series.","review":"Unfortunately I can't stop watching these terribly bad movies.

The actors did it credit and I stayed awake and managed to survive the movie. The thrills start at the beginning and continue on throughout the show there are times it is interesting, It's worth watching and judging for yourself I rated this one an B plus, entertaining keeping me on my seat with what is next spills just not to spoil it all, mum is the word, I would still buy the popcorn and relax for a while"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rental?","review":"The Blu-ray disc I received is a Rental copy, and should have been advertised as such (both the box and the disc are labeled with \\"Rental\\").

Fine for some folks I am sure, just not my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing,","review":"The 4th film was labeled \\"The Final Destination\\" which was supposed to be the final chapter of the series. I admit that when I found out about a new Final Destination film I couldn't wait to watch it and it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me. When I watched it, I was letdown. It wasn't that interesting or entertaining, it was somewhat boring compared to the first 4. It was slow and lacking in suspense that made the first 4 films. It isn't better than The 4th film, not even half as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the Final Destinations","review":"I am a fan of all the Final Destination movies. They do a great job at setting up the insane deaths that take place. If I have any negative feedback, it would only be that they could have lengthened the death scenes a little more. All and all, if your a fan the the previous movies you will probably like this one.

Waste of $3.50 I recommend watching the 2D. Otherwise the movie was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A series in decline","review":"This series is becoming more and more B-movie quality, with a worse plot, acting, and directing. I thought that the first 2 movies in the series were good, especially the 2nd one with AJ Cook. You could argue that 5 is the worst of the bunch with unconconvincing plot details around the death scenes, and also a poor overall story. It lacks the gory charm of the first movies where we wanted to see how somebody received the deep six. The characters are extremely shallow and we never are able to build any connection with them. It leads to a bland plot, bland characters, and a feeling that we need to finish up the movie quickly. I think that this movie is really for only fans of the series. The mnovie is worth seeing if it is free (ie cable) but I certainly would not buy the blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Destination 5","review":"My husband and son-in-law chose to watch this - dumb story, way too gory for my taste.

I watched this movie alone too so that makes it even better. There were many times in the movie when i jumped, cringed, and even felt nauseous. I loved the ending and essentially the entire movie itself. My favorite before this one was number 3 but seriously this one tops it by a lot. FD4 was essentially worthless but I saw it anyway and 1 & 2 were too slow for me. 5 jumped right in gave a little backstory and ended with a bang. Well worth whatever they are charging for it and I REALLY don't wanna wait until December to buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Destination 5","review":"If you were a tad bit surprised at the release of yet another Final Destination film, I can't blame you, considering the last installment was titled The Final Destination. Then again, the horror genre is notorious for reviving franchises thought to be dead and buried. No, the real surprise here? That Final Destination 5 actually is the best franchise's films. This time around, a bunch of coworkers are saved from a collapsing bridge when one of them has an eerie premonition, and Death slowly hunts them down, one by one. FD5 is the only film of the series that I would even marginally recomend, and while it's still mostly for established fans, the flashes of dark humor and creative death sequences make it more enjoyable overall. In other words, perfect for new year's celebrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"JamieLynne","review":"Probably one of my favorites of the series, besides the first one.

I'd sure love it if they could redo all the great disaster/horror/gore movies in Blu-Ray 3D...in fact, I have a computer which can use the 3D Nvidia glasses, and can take Alien/Aliens on Blu-Ray and \\"magically\\" convert it to 3D, or even IMHO the greatest Sci-Fi \\"scary movie\\" of all time, \\"The Thing\\".But a conversion from flat 2D to extrapolated 3D will never equal true stereoscopic \\"filming\\" of 3D (HD digital of course). At the end of this movie, they have a soundtrack of AC/DC singing \\"if you want blood, you've got it\\" along with multiple gory death clips....like NASCAR cars flipping over in crashes, etc. So you know the movie has to be good.... and as far as realistic 3D gore, it is great......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I love this movie series and had to buy this one to complete my set, it came quick and is great to watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"Pretty dumb movie.

I really like that the Pastorals are included, because that is the initial Pope, and builds into the rest. You get the Essay on Criticism, a good cutting from the Essay on Man, and the entire Rape of the Lock.In total this collection is really good. I do not agree with all the editors have chosen, but there are comprehensive anthologies out there. For a beginner, or the new student of Pope and neo-classicism, this book is a fine start."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone concerned with cooking well","review":"There is a lot in this book that is not covered in any other book that is regularly available. I had struggled with simple tasks like cutting an onion. With simple and clear pictures and language I now know how to quickly get that perfect dice. It covers preparing all the standard cuts of meat and fish to all types of vegetables. It is the best source outside of Peterson's book on soup for preparing stocks, consommés and broths. This book is filled with all those fundamentals of cooking you just don't get in your average cookbook, and it provides them with clear pictures and language. From how the raft forms during clarification of consommé to a bevy of traditional and modern example recipes. This book is for anyone who wants to learn to cook well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource","review":"I'm not a professional cook nor am I planning on becoming one. But this is the first book I bought to help with my self-study in cooking, and I wasn't anything near disappointed in my choice.Rather than alot of cooking texts which assume you have a basic background in cooking, Professional Chef takes you step by step, lesson by lesson to show you what you need to know. Starting out with an introduction to being a professional chef, they move on to food handling and safety, tools, knives, terms, ect.Even for a homemaker like me who just wants to learn how to be a better cook, this text is indispensible. Don't be scared by the price for Professional Chef pays for itself many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"The basics","review":"Here are the basics of cooking in a textbook. If you want to learn how to cook, this text can help you lay the foundation for your education. Covering everything from nutrition to food safety to knife sharpening techniques to types of food and recipes, this book is for those unsatisfied with stacks of cookbooks.

This book has multiple errors. Photographs at times show poor technique. There's a picture of chicken with beads of sweat which looks like it has been left out too long. Equally as misleading are pictures of fried food which look like they slept in the fry pan. Try making the pumpkin bisque and see how it tastes.The book does a poor job of explaining technique and the rationale behind cooking ingredients, steps etc. In short everything you need to know how to cook professionally is poorly laid out. Don't get me wrong I am learning.

It is more in the form of a text book for professional chefs and though I could glean a little info regarding methods, if I were a beginning cook, this book would overwhelm me. Also, I found it hard to find just what I wanted in the book - it would take quite a while searching before I would find what I needed to know...first trying the table of contents, then the glossary then endless reading of text.

I like the book about knives as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic instruction but lackluster index","review":"I have found no problems with any of the recipes in the Professional Chef. It is informative and incredibly effective in teaching the most interesting and esoteric of cooking techniques as well as the most banal. My only problem is that it refuses to act as a recipe book inasmuch as it is often impossible to find something in the index. I would recommend this to anyone looking to expand their cooking techniques but would have to recommend the Joy of Cooking original to those who want instruction as well as fantastic and easy to find recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Conventional Thinkers","review":"In retrospect,this book reflects some of the internal conflict that the author was experiencing. Originally (in the mid 70s),it was the photography that caught my attention. Later, it was the chapter in which the author initiated a dialogue between Christ's humanity and divinity as He hung on the cross that held me spellbound.

Should authors dumb down, or use a preachy approach because they are writig for kids?I think not. Some of my all time favorite books were written for kids, but I didn't necessarily feel like they were.My expectations of being swept up into a new world that would stretch my imagination? No, I was just annoyed by it. I had to swallow too fast too many details that happened before the story.

Several unhappy youths and a dark secret that you can probably guess, although the maze you will have to work through is harder than it might have been. The real secret of the film might escape you--which is why I watched the commentary, where it is all explained in a round table of discussion by the film producers.It's a unique story and could have been presented in an easier narrative and action sequence, at least for my part.

The author apparently had enough money and spare time to actually experiment, and living in pre-World-War-I Britain, had access to actual original examples of a lot of the weapons he wished to study.

The small paperback book contains little extraneous information--however helpful it might have been--and its verb forms seem to be sadly lacking. Were the shortage of information the only problem, I might still recommend the book with only a few reservations; however, the devanaagarii script is so small and smudgy that at times it's difficult to even make out what a particular word is supposed to be. For travelling scholars or those who only need a small reference for reminder's sake, this might be a good, inexpensive pick. However, for beginners a more comprehensive and comprehendable dictionary would be a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few caveats","review":"Let me make clear what is so concise about this book. For one thing, it is exclusively Sanskrit-to-English; there is no English-to-Sanskrit section. For another, the Sanskrit words are written only in Devanagari script, without Roman transliteration. There isn't even a reference key provided. Because of this, I would recommend this book only if you are already familiar with Sanskrit and just want a reference that will fit in your pocket.

Each speaker can't be more than 10lbs. or so, however after only a few weeks these speaker mounts are now sagging a good 1-2\\" downwards. These mounts have three seperate rotating joints and they are held in place by set screws which, at the time, didn't seem all that sturdy when I was installing them. I guess they really aren't! Especially when I'm reading other users with even lighter speakers are seeing a sag as well. AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away, terrible product.","review":"So, no only are the instructions nearly impossible to understand, the product itself is garbage.

I am using them with the Onkyo S5200 7.1 system and they hold the satellite speakers fairly well. I would say those satellites are between 3 and 5 pounds. The mounts are easy to install and again come with a lot of screws, nuts, bolts, anchors etc. which is good for this type of project. The ONLY thing i can say is i wish they were a LITTLE more sturdy, as there seems to be a slight bit of sag with the weight of the speakers, but overall these are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all for me","review":"This book may cover some areas for the Rav4 but, as for me and mine, no.

They called it The Good Life (\\"summum bonum\\") then, and the ship of fools that were searching for it had completely booked its passage. Today, it's the same.Erasmus doesn't let up. He catalogs every type of fool, every kind of folly, and has room to spare. Reading this funny, I mean, profound book, has given me a new respect for those idiotic life decisions I have made. Looking back over the grand scheme of it all...yikes! I can't believe I did that, said that, acted like that!I highly recommend this satire for teachers, politicians, priests, professors, administrators, managers, Rotarians, poets, grave diggers, and anyone else tempted toward hypocrisy (and if you think you aren't tempted, I mean you most of all).Reading this book can make you human again. And that is the first step toward the good life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erasmus makes H.L.

Lest you think writers \\"back then\\" weren't funny, guess again. This book lambasts everyone from Popes and Cardinals to merchants and ownders for their ridiculous pursuits. My only regret is that the edition I read (not the Penguin) had no footnotes at all and no explanation of background information. Even though the work is short, I'd recommend going with the Norton Critical Edition, or at least one that has some explanatory notes. It will greatly enrich your understanding. Of course, his book was super-popular because of its naughty content and criticisms.

The final portion is in a more serious tone as Folly genuinely praises \\"the folly of the cross\\" (I Corinthians 1:18) and the accessibility of true faith to even the simplest of people (I Corinthians 1:6).The sarcasm was entertaining and thought-provoking, and the final section on the foolishness of the cross was a good reminder of the true simplicity of the Gospel. Even though I would disagree with Erasmus on plenty of theological & sociological points, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Just a word of warning: don't try reading this without footnotes unless you are really up on your Greek/Roman mythology and philosophy and Renaissance theology."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Praise of Folly","review":"This book must have been revolutuionary in its time. The basic idea, that folly is a major characteristic of humanity, still needs reminding today.

I am as big a fan of this particular genre as they come, and an award-winning media professional. It was based on these fine reviews that I rushed out to purchase this book. While his writing craft is alive and well, the author repeatedly asks us to suspend our disbelief near the end, in order to further several key story twists. Can you imagine this happening in The Maltese Falcon, for example? Then, we are handed a reverse Deus Ex Machina ending that is totally out of character with the protagonist (if you care to call this unshapen character that).

I immediately appreciated being able to run up a few numbers (ie: 9.9 * 0.052, etc). This has been my alarm clock every morning.I have pretty fun life (mud, sweat, digging in abrasive dirt ..) so I do tear them up, but they stand up to a couple of years of abuse. It's gone in and out of production so everytime I can buy one, I buy 3 or 4.The bands tend to break first, so I keep a few replacement fabric and velcro bands.In about 1998, a friend called me just after Christmas and said \\"you have to come see -- I have a nerdier watch than you!\\". Indeed he did. Remember those huge, goofy things that read data from a barcode broadcast on your PC? Those are gone.

Great price!","review":"This watch is great because of its practicality and convenience. It is the cheapest and smallest calculator watch out there, yet still maintains a classy and discrete feel. It is comfortable, reliable, and great for most occasions. The only problem is that the time becomes a little off by about a few seconds every week, which, if left unchecked, can add up. The calculator buttons are small, but a good size: any smaller would be harder to press, any larger would be weird. The battery crapped out about a year in, but they're so cheap, you can easily replace them. Overall, great for all purposes, a good size, and nice functioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Babies Last Forever","review":"Well it finally happened. After almost 20 years my old Casio CA53W-1 watch quit even after a new battery was inserted. Oh, it was 'on' but would not function properly. So I broke down and bought a new one. The old watch was used almost entirely when working in construction. The calculator function was used frequently.So, these things work and last forever. Pretty good for about sixteen bucks. Even the batteries last for about five years. Yeah, it's ugly and not very hip.

I didn't find in this movie an ounce of poetry. To present Arab tales in a very realistic manner, with the exception of one or two scenes, is maybe original, perfectly boring but not at all poetic.Furthermore, I'm not specially excited by the presentation of nude teenagers, masculine and feminine, making love in a rather mechanic manner and by the erotic toys shown by Pasolini in his movie. So I strongly advise you to reread or buy a copy of \\"A Thousand and One Nights\\", a book that has the merit to plounge his reader in an imaginary poetic world and leave ARABIAN NIGHTS to Pasolini's aficionados."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing....","review":"I did not find the film luminous, the scenery stunning, or the acting even entertaining. And, by the way, where were the 101 tales? All in all, neither the acting, nor the scenery or plot were enough to engage my attention beyond the first few minutes of unhappy disgust at the money I spent to purchase the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious.","review":"Pasolini directed it, and that should be sufficient warning for any one who has even the faintest idea of his work.

Don't get me started on the scene in the tent with the golden bow and \\"arrow\\"! I paid $8.50 to see this at a theater and walked out 2/3 of the way through.

I thought it was a very good book with very interesting twist that differs from Shakespears Romeo and Juliette. The love story is very unique. It not only is entertaining, but also gives a lot of information about how life in China is different from the U.S. Women were treated very unequaly and did not have the freedom that people do today. Women weren't even allowed to go to school. Butterfly Lovers also shows that there was a deffinite cast system in China when this book was written. People who were poor did not get the many privileges that the rich got. The ritual of marrige is also very different than it is here in the U.S. and other countries. The bride does not have any say in who she gets to marry. This causes a big problem for young woman in Butterfly Lovers.Over all this was a very well written book. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUTTERFLY LOVERS","review":"Butterly lovers is a heartwarming tale of two young people, Yingtai and Shanbo. Yingtia is a women who goes agaist her country and parents wishes, and attends school where only men are allowed to go. While at school and disguished as a man, she meets Shanbo, and they grow a special bond togther. They eventually fall in love with eachother, after Shanbo knows the truth about Yingtai being a woman. Although noone really wants them to get married to eachother,they are in love. Even sick in bed and almost dying because of Yingtai's fiance, Shanbo still loves her. Shanbo and Yingtia finally reunite, but tracially its through death.I would recommend this book to teenagers. I think it is a book they will not only enjoy reading but they can also relate to lots of the situtaions. I think they will actually have a hard time putting down the book becuase its so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers and Friends","review":"Butterfly Lovers, written by Fan Dai is a tragic love story. The novel is about a girl, Yingtai, who wanted to go to college, but college was prohibited for girls. Yingtai dresses as a man to go to school, and when she got there, she fell in love. Her only problem was that she needed to tell the boy, Shanbo, that she in fact was a girl, and that she loved him. Then, Yingtai went home, only to find out that her father found her a rich guy to marry. Yingtai soon had to make a decision. Would she marry the one she loved, or the man with the wealth?I really enjoyed reading Butterfly Lovers. I liked the novel because after the turn of every page, something new occurred. Butterfly Lovers kept you on your toes; always wondering what was going to happen next. I usually don\`t like classic love stories, but the novel gave me a \\"new look\\" on classic love stories, and my opinion changed. The novel was a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"While the story is intriguing and fast-paced, Fan Dai's writing disappoints. At several points during the novel, it is obvious that English isn't her native language, and that she has a LOT she needs to improve. In short, I found this a creative novel that still needed a lot of refining. Sometimes the writing was forced and choppy and left the reader wanting a lot more. Advanced readers will be disappointed in this particular novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This book is a general love story that really drags on. It comes down to the basic comparison of Romeo and Juliet but it was based in old china. The young girl wants to go to school then she finally gets her way and dress's up as a boy. Through this she falls in love with her roommate and has to keep secret that she's a girl. Then the rest of the story is up you to read and find out what happens.My opinion on this book was that it was pretty bad. It drags on and seems to just be a basic love story that goes no where. Love stories are not for me and this book is to general how life is portrayed. The book really made me hate love stories because it isn't what real life is like. This book in my opinion was horrible an should not be read by anyone. The story is bad not the writing which is very descriptive. If you are into Romeo and Juliet then you should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"it may be good for some people, but i definitely did not enjoy this book. this chinese romeo and juliet was just a drag on story. this girl wants to go to school and dresses up like a man for a few years with nobody suspecting a thing. she ends up falling in love with a boy and cannot tell him that she is a man. and if she sleeps with him before she goes home, she has to kill herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"This Chinese Romeo and Juliet was about this girl that wants to go to school and dresses up like a man for a few years with nobody suspecting a thing.

Once the boy finds out she is really a girl, she has already went back home and her parents try to get her married with a rich family. Read the rest to see what happens.In my opinion this book was horrible because I could never see this happening in real life. In the book, the boy and girl who is trying to be a boy, are way to close to eachother all the time to be taken seriously. You would assume they were married in the book. This book was absolutely horrible and nobody should read it. The story was just a stupid version of romeo and juliet that did not seem real at all.

I would even go so far as to giving this record it's own genre, because I can't define it, as is the case with everything else about it.Theres no way to describe the awesomeness, just get at this album fast.Buy, download, do what you gotta do to get this album today.

Open Hand's first release \\"The Dream\\" was quite possably the greatest cd ever released. Open Hand was known for there powerfull drum beats, articulate riffs, and amazing vocals. Now they have a sub-standard drummer and guitar riffs that just dont stand out and seem cliche. The only thing good about this cd is that they still have the same vocalist. Not worth the buy especially old fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"because i cant rate it a zero","review":"This CD sucks. if you have heard what their other cd (the dream) sounds like then you will understand. there are bands out there that as they write new cds their sound changes slightly and it may be better or worse. this cd sounds nothing like the dream. I have heard that the only original member of open hand is the singer. he should have came up with new band name and not tarnish what was Open hand. you may say \\"you are living in the past.\\" well i dont care i want the open hand that came with further seems forever and blew my friggen mind.

If the first CD is anything like this...I'll be rockin' that one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"Open Hand has not come out with new music, except a few demos in 5 years, since the release of the Evolutions EP. Well, it has been worth the wait. The music on this record is so rock and roll i cannot even begin to explain.Few bands of today can write the guitar riff you will hear. The guitars have the cKy type of riffs and the drumming is very powerful and to the point. Justin's vocals swoon over the landscape in a captivating way.Not one song sounds the same on here.Some are very rock and roll, others are spacey, a few ballads are thrown in there.... all in all, its a great record.Standout tracks: You and Me, Tough Guy, Hard Night, Crooked Crown, Trench Warfare to name a few.... but in all reality, they all stand out.Go buy this record and bang your head upon arrival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, full of charm","review":"Another of Don Freeman's classics, Rainbow of My Own will delight young listeners and readers.

Getting an entire season on 7 DVDs is great for fans of the show, and those who have never seen the entire run of the show. It's great to be able to watch each episode in order as my time permits. The stories that weave through the thread of these episodes are captivating. Some episodes of note include \\"The Blessing Way\\" with Mulder's resurrection and Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose - a sweet, and funny episode.The video quality is higher than anything seen of these episodes before, and the extras are great - including two episode commentaries, and deleted scenes. No X-file fan should miss this set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruckman","review":"Probably the worst x-files episode I've seen to date. Scully and Mulder were practically supporting actors in this one and did barely any real work.

I love her LOTU series and her Atlantis series and have read some of her stand alone books such as Animal Instincts (I think that was the name of it but not sure). I am sad to say I was very disappointed in this book. I felt the characters lacked...well...character. Normally Gena's characters are full of life, sarcasm, wit and are likeable. These characters were not. They both fell flat for me and I found Julia Anderson to be annoying and didn't know why Tristan would like her at all. I also didn't find Tristan to have the humor or wit that Gena's warriors normally have. I got about 75 pages into the book and stopped reading. It just didn't hold my attention at all. I hate to write a bad review, especially on one of Gena's books since I really love almost all her series. I highly recomment the Lords of The Underworld and the Atlantis series. Love them!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pleasure in Reading This Book","review":"Let me sum it up for you quickly--the plot has been wonderfully summarized by the other reviewers so I won't recap. Frumpy self-doubting heroine with apparently nothing to offer anyone suddenly and magically becomes pursued by a completely hot male who spends all his time trying to make her feel good about herself, although he's been abused and mistreated for thousands of years by dozens of women because he wouldn't kiss the butt of a powerful magic chick. They finally get together and have hot sex, then La Frump decides he needs to be freed and sets about to do it. It's downright dumb.

Unfortunately, the pleasure slave theme has already been used by an expert in Fantasy Lover and Showalter's attempt is paltry at best. The main character is so unbelievably pathetic. She does nothing but question herself throughout the entire book. She has no depth of character and is so annoying. Tristan, the hero, is also unbelievable, even for a fantasy. The pacing of the book is slow. I can ususally read a book in one sitting-it took me almost a week to wade through the Pleasure Slave.If you want really want a good read on pleasure slaves--check out Sherilyn Kenyon's Fantasy Lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with cats","review":"I think the device is probably fine for dogs, but it didn't work with cats at all.

The show deserves DVD release, but not this way. I understand and accept changing the soundtrack - beating copyright laws are akin to burning a wet dog.What I am not clear on is the other editing. Removing 10-15 minutes per episode just does not make sense. The news segments have largely been cut (why?), and it feels like other segments of the show have been shortened.I will echo another reviewer - the video quality is not what we watched on TV, or the interwebs for that matter. It feels brighter (in a bad way) and sharper...in a bad way.If this stuff matters not to you, buy the disc.

There are other cuts as well, including a couple of the \\"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\\" segments.

It appears to be a hastily-typeset and published collection of terse lecture notes in near-outline form. It doesn't explain microarray data analysis, but is rather more of an annotated listing of statistical methods useful in analyzing microarray data. For the biologist looking for conceptual content, it is nearly useless. It lists a lot of equations without explaining how and why they are used, or under what circumstances. A much better book is Steen Knudsen's A Biologists Guide to Analysis of DNA Microarray Data. Paradoxically, to find Jagota's book useful, you would have to already understand its content. This book might therefore serve as a quick reference for seasoned statisticians who are suddenly tasked with having to work on someone else's microarray project. This serves to show how new the field of microarray data analysis is, and how sorely a good and thorough treatment of the subject is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Skool Recommendation","review":"this one's not a bad choice... though it may not be as great as Metallica!!!worth the penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"I enjoyed reading this book but it was difficult to get into the Irish brogue.

The list of plants, attributes, dimensions, bloom season, planting time etc... in each section is a quick cheat-sheet when selecting plants. The authors also distinguish between the different conditions in North, Central and South Florida. The only drawback is the reference to plants only by common name without the latin name. Since a plant may be referred to by different common names, not knowing the latin name may leave you wondering, or unable to locate an interesting plant."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"I'd like to think most Floridians know not to get too exhausted out in the heat and drink lots of water but this book takes the time to spell that out for you. Finding a shady spot for midday gardening is great advice if you have a shade garden, otherwise, you're gardening wherever your plants happen to be. This trivial information really grated on my nerves and is what earned it just two stars.The lack of pictures is a big disadvantage especially when the author decides to use common as opposed to botanical names.I find Home Depot even uses different names from week to week on certain plants and it's impossible to determine just what is being talked about without a botanical reference.The calendar was a little disappointing as that was the main reason for buying this book.I can find something useful in any gardening book so it does have some value, it's just not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent guide","review":"this book was exactly what we were looking for, and was delivered in a timely manner. we are well pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book has lots of things in it.

Level 2 mostly because of the complete and intense instruction on the various tenses, working its way from the Present Indicative to the Past Anterior. If you have a firm grasp on elementary Spanish, this might be the book for you. SPANISH NOW! Level 2 teaches Spanish optimally by itself, but I've found that this workbook functions even better with a vocabulary handbook, because SPANISH NOW! Level 2 tends to focus more on the grammar and ultimately the verbs. SPANISH NOW! Level 2 is ideal for the beginner or intermediate highschool or college Spanish student, or for those who want to be able to read and write in Spanish. Finally, this book is NOT for those who solely want to become conversational in Spanish, because it focuses on reading and writing ability along with sentence structure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use without a teacher","review":"I have Kendris' book of verbs and it's a good straight forward resource. The Spanish Now! Series is very common at the large bookstores and I picked it up because unlike most bookstore titles it had a level two book for intermediate students. What I find difficult is that as a bookstore title it really is designed as a textbook for a class room situation; not really surprising given Barrons' business segment. Be that as it may, this makes the book nearly impossible to use for self-study. In every chapter there are examples and exercises where you're supposed to converse with a classmate or listen to what the instructor reads to you. Beyond that, the exercises are repetitive and uninteresting. For self-guided study look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"I like Barron's Spanish products, and LOVED Spanish Now I.

I found the book a rather slow page turner at some points, and it was a little difficult to come to the end. Perhaps because of its 450 pages. Anyway, the book is not as fast paced as I would like it to be. This does not mean though that anyone should avoid it.

If I held them in place, the sound seemed fine, although I'm certainly no expert. After 3-4 months, the rubber covering fell off of one of the buds. I can't complain too much, b/c it's so cheap, BUT you certainly are getting exactly what you're paying for with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I bought these because Runners World picked them in their magazine as a runner friendly device.

I am going to just keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful for my ears and occassional fell off...","review":"I bought these ear phones because I accidentally left my other sport headphones at home while I was on vacation for two months.

It does the job it's designed for - hold on to your ears while your body is shaking.The only drawback I would mention is that they still seem to be made for a bit larger ears than mine (and I think my ears are of a regular 35-year-old man). The fix is not too tight, so I may need to adjust it once or twice per training session, but that may be normal and perhaps even good - the plastic is tender on the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonable price, good sound, good fit for me, secure","review":"Right out of the box, when I tried these one, they fit me like a glove. nice soft, comfortable fit without digging into my canal, and secure behind my big ears. I got these mainly for my wife, and they work good for her too, better than the large ones that came with our mp3 player. The sound is excellent, even though the range is not as good as others. However, overall, the design, size, and comfort win out, and these were well worth the investment.

After I began my jog outdoors , I began having difficulties immediately during the first minute. The earphones would constantly begin to loosen its grip on my ear no matter how securely I tried to wrap them around my ear or snugly place the bud inside. It was a very frustrating and disappointing experience for me. I would definitely not recommend this for anyone with ears on the smaller side, let alone use these earphones for running.

Great for a few weeks, then useless","review":"I bought these headphones to replace my iPod earbuds, since I am a runner and needed a more secure fit. At first, these were a dream for the price -- good sound, comfortable, stayed put. However, due to the very flexible design, over not a lot of time (perhaps a month), these lose their elasticity and begin to get looser and looser. Honestly, these flat out fell off of both ears with just a little bit of sweat on many occasions.

First, this isn't an instant shelf, they are spring loaded. Second, this does require tools, specifically a hammer and level. You have 3 pin type things that have to be hammered into the wall and then you line up these pegs with drilled holes in the back. Doean't seem very sturdy to just \\"pop\\" it in vs made in the unit. I cut a corner piece of wood, drillrd holes and inserted tack nails at 3 points, glued them in and painted it. I have the exact same style corner shelf from what I found lying in my garage and I know its more sturdy because of how I built it.

Like everything he writes, I think I'll need to read it three times before I completely grasp it all. The thesis is one that most have heard, but he lays it out perfectly: Significant parts of Europe have tried to erase the Christian foundation which allowed Europe to form and prosper and this has lead to where the continent is today and will likely continue going unless something dramatic happens. Mark Steyn's \\"America Alone\\" would be a great companion read to this book if you haven't already read it.Read them both.

He argues that it is impossible for a civilization to sustain itself when it has no purpose for doing so, and illustrates why Europe faces this problem. Weigel points to Europe's large fundamentalist Muslim population as the greatest challenge to Europe's continuing existence. In light of the 7/7 attacks, his argument takes on added force. Americans should not imagine themselves immune to Europe's problems - we tend to follow Europe down civilizational paths, and we are already well on the way to joining them in militant secularism. I highly recommend this book. It is one that everyone concerned with Western civilization and Western culture should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a rehash","review":"Weigel spends most of his time sifting through others work most notably J.H.H. Weiler and trying to defend the RCC's social gosel. While he correctly sifts the \\"europe problem\\" as a lack of faith in God, he tries to fill the void of a faithless europe by substituting John Paul 2 and the gospel of works instead of the life changing gospel of Jesus. His solution doesn't resolve the problem of faithlessness.He mentions that Europe is without hope, yet he doesn't connect that only Jesus Christ is \\" The Christ in you, the hope of glory\\"He seemed to have written this book by condensing others works along the lines of an undergraduates term paper in college.Very little , if any, original thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIVELHUNTER","review":"Man oh man does this flick suck!!!

This halfbreed, Jacob, has his own way of dealing with the possessed, using martial arts to the nth degree and usually killing the possessed. Stephen J. Cannell, the producer who brought us THE A-TEAM, and has written several good Shane Scully novels, is responsible for this gloriously ill written and acted bomb. And why Sean Patrick Flanery, a decent actor, agreed to star is baffling. While he manages an aloof Clint Eastwood-style delivery, his dialogue is so horrible and his script so erratic, he gets lost in the mire as well. Even at 78 minutes, DEMON HUNTER seems too long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An abomination of cinematography","review":"I only watched it because it was late and there was nothing else on.

Sean Patrick Flanery stars as a human/demon hybrid who hunts his own, and has his sights set on a very evil demon (genre stalwart Billy Drago) in this shlock fest. Now, I don't have anything at all against low budget horror/thriller/sci-fi films, nothing at all. However, Demon Hunter is so bad in terms of story and some atrociously laughable dialogue that you'll be busing a gut when you hear it. Flanery is servicable and appears to take the material seriously enough, but one wonders how he got stuck with this bomb. At a very, very brisk 78 minutes running time, Demon Hunter is over before you know it even begun, but mercifully that's a good thing with this film. All in all, Demon Hunter may be good for an unintentional laugh, and that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful...","review":"The concept is good but the feasibility of being able to use the card is useless since it doesn't take into account the card combinations with multiple opponents in different positions.

For instance, he claims that certain Old Testament chapters are dated incorrectly too late and that is why Zoroastrianism could not have influenced the Bible but he doesn't say HIS PROOF for how it was incorrectly dated. If you're interested in a book that gives a neutral account of world religions, this IS NOT the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"unworthy of serious consideration","review":"Unfortunately, this work closely resembles what a second-rate high school student would attempt to pass off as a research paper.

Please Mr McDowell just give us the facts of the religions and not your opionion. This book should of been titled \\"why my religion is right and yours is wrong\\".Concerning his arguments for his chosen religion, what can I say other then they make him look like a fool.

This movie is also criticized for ripping off elements of the film \\"Casablanca\\". Pamela Anderson Lee was well casted in the lead role but was mainly just used for her cleavage, which was a shame.

Although Barb Wire has some nicely coriographed fight scenes, that is all the substance the movie contains. The story follows Barb, Pamela Anderson, run her night club and protect it from bad influences. The word is a dark and dirty future Earth.

After that I might as well have gone to sleep. The film concept had potential and the \\"Casablanca\\" adaptation was a good idea. There were some moments when the story had a chance for some interesting twists but it never quite worked. Ultimately, the whole thing came crashing down because of dreadful acting, lame dialogue and a completely transparent story line. Outside of Pam's gratuitous flashing this movie was just plain dull.

Such as any film starring a leather-clad Pam Anderson with her breasts nearly popping out in almost every shot. Pam looks great in a really dumb movie that is actually inspired by Casablanca (I'm not kidding!).Pamela Anderson is a leather-clad babe (but don't call her that) who is fighting crime in 2017 as a female soldier who also runs a nightclub. Anderson's superb cleavage (which pops out at every corner) is the real star of this silly live action comic book. Running around in leather bondage-type numbers with really big guns makes for some easy on the eyes entertainment. Her acting is awful but if you are in for that, you get what you deserve. As far as movies for horny young males to entertain themselves to, they don't get much better, but as a serious action film, this one is pure garbage.

The one on Dick's Pick 23 (from 9/17/72) blows this one away... utterly destroys it.The China Cat > Rider is a pretty hot one and Phil's bass sounds thick (as it should) throughout this release.Whether or not you'll like this pick all just depends on what you want from your Grateful Dead. All the little filler tunes are played well enough here so I doubt those will bother anyone.

Maxham that Boyle hasn't dug quite deep enough into the character of Katherine to make us understand how such an obviously intelligent woman could have married the lunatic Stanley. I think he comes close -- love is a strange thing, and people fall in love despite obvious red flags all the time -- but in this case I had trouble believing that, when all was said and done, Katherine would go ahead and marry Stanley anyway.

Not to say they were ever uptight because they always sounded loose and relaxed, but there is a plug it in and just crank these tunes out feeling about the material.

It presents the arguements against free trade and the problems associated it with it like loss of jobs and capital outflows so it is good to understand the oposing view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodrik gets it right","review":"In his spellbinding account of the economic realities of globalization, Dani Rodrik gets it right.

There are some short simple songs,along with the long jams. The best parts are the long jams. This is what made the Dead different from all other bands, the ability to jam on and on and on. Who else could play Not Fade Away for 15 minuets or longer. The Truckin jam has Phil Lesh showing the world why he is a world class musician. Dark Star is vintage Dead with song structure being unimportant, but the ability to improvise while maintaning focus and make tremendous music is sheer brillance. Capped off with the the most touching version of Morning Dew makes this worth the price alone. Playing in the Band gets the royal 20 minuet space jam treatment as well. Execpt for the off key screaming of Donna everything is played with confidence and passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed replacement band~","review":"My son has Equinox watch that had the rubber band and had worn it so that the band split - so he wanted to replace it with this band and it works great!

But you'd be wrong.The clever ones guessed this is a 30-minute episode of some early 80's teen talk show, in which Carradine speaks maybe 10 sentences (and one of those sentences is used up plugging the upcoming \\"Americana;\\" his bare foot do get a lot of camera time, though), the teen hosts sloppily don white belts and ask martial arts instructors a few basic questions, and, of course, there's the video of Survivor's \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" and a few clips from the bottom of the poorly-dubbed-kung-fu-theater barrel.Silly me.

Based on the title and cover photo for this DVD, you'd probably buy this item. You would, however, be greatly disappointed upon viewing it. What you get is an episode of a late 70s Saturday morning kid's talk show (at least, that's what it looks like [and I do recognize one of the hosts from something, so maybe for nostalgia it's worth something]). Sure, the focus of the episode is martial arts, and they tease you with an \\"exclusive\\" interview with Carradine, and close-ups of his bare feet (woo-hoo!!), but it's really the most basic primer to martial arts, a few clips from old chinese karate movies, a visit to a dojo and about 2 minutes with Carradine. Wanna know what he says?- Kung Fu really just boils down to this [holds out a clenched fist].Worth $15? Try 15 cents.You'll get more from Bruce Lee. \\"Punch is punch.

Also the light portion was poor and could not read the digital section."},{"rating":"1","title":"will be returning","review":"There is nothing wrong with the watch itself. I really like it and the band is unusally long which would have been wonderful for me - I usually have to use the very last notch on watch bands.

Hardly notice that you are wearing it. Has many features tht I haven't even used yet.

It's obviously no reason to spend money to put a new battery. Especially it's not easy for a regular person to change it by yourself because my check shows that you probably need special instrument to open not the watch back cover but inside cover what holds the battery. Ans obviously no reason to send the watch to Casio for to change the battery because it will cost at least half of the watch price. Of course, the AW-80 very cheap, the glass scratches very easily.But now I bought another one the same AW-80 because I think that 4 years is enough for $20 item like this.From the beginning I didn't expect the $20 watch will work for 10 years. Hope the new AW-80 what I bought now will take also at least 3-4 years.I give the AW-80 4 stars because it's it's good enough for the money it cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"This watch is truly a piece of crap.

Kind of a pain to set the analog at first. But overall a very good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak light, battery difficult to replace","review":"I like the way this watch looks. Like that it has analog hands as well as digital time, date, and day of the week. I only use the alarm and stopwatch so I don't need the other features on the watch. Light is almost of no use in the dark and the luminous hands are not luminous so you may as well not count on being able to see the time in any dark places. Tried to replace the battery when it died out after a year or so but it was difficult to take out the old battery and difficult to replace the new one. Followed the procedure online (need to reset by inserting needle nose pliers or tweezers into correct areas on the inside of the watch) but the watch died out on me again after only a week or so. Had good success with my previous Casio watches so I'll probably buy another one but definitely not the same model."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 year battery but you'll be lucky if the watch lasts 1 year!","review":"Casio = Poor quality and terrible customer service! I am not very hard on my watches yet this watch began to show cosmetic wear after a few short months. I also purchased a similar model at Amazon which ceased to function and Casio did not honor their warranty. Prior to the two Amazon purchases, I bought a Casio watch when on vacation. It died within a few weeks and I thought it must have been a counterfeit. Well I know the two I bought from Amazon are genuine and now I understand that, not only does Casio make a shoddy product, but also that they have terrible customer service and will not honor their own warranty. Shame on you Casio. Needless to say, I will never buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"It is incredible you can get a 10-year battery watch for so low.

The analog time is set separately from the digital time, so you could have 2 different time zones as well.

But for 20 bucks, I cannot complain, it does it job well enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Advertised","review":"As advertised, watch is simple but good quality. Rubber band is soft and comfy. As other reviewers have mentioned, nightlight is very weak. I dont mind: Timex's Indiglo is too bright for me, and this works fine in a completely dark room.Watch keeps excellent time, though you'll need the 30 page mini-manual just to set it.

This watch looks nice but it is made cheap (that's why we pay about 18 dollars in Amazon). Well it was fine but quickly got scratches on the glass and the worse thing was moisture on the glass. I sent it to Casio and they returned very quickly but i haven't had the chance to test it. If this happens again probably i will throw away and purchase a Timex.I updated my review to one since zero star is not allowed. I went to the pool and the watch got moisture in the glass again.

You can even store up to 30 PHONE NUMBERS in your WATCH. That's right, in your WATCH. My favorite feature is the stopwatch because I use stopwatches for time trials and such while I'm skating. All I wanted was a classy, analog watch but I got something waaay better.

Dual time display with your choice of global cities.2. Three alarms for those hotels without an alarm clock.3. High contrast hands and dial- read it at a glance.4. Looks better than most Casios that are cluttered up with labels and logos, but not shiny enough to garner unwanted attention in the bad part of town.5. There is so little metal in this watch that you don't need to take it off to go through the airport metal detector. It won't set it off!6. Cheap enough that you won't cry if it's lost or stolen.I take off one star for the poorly designed backlight that others have mentioned. And here's a tip: to make the band last longer, don't ever wear it in the shower. Soap makes the resin brittle and it will crack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely cheap, incredibly easy to damage","review":"The 'crystal' of this watch is in fact made out of plastic, which causes it to become marred and scratched nearly as soon as it's removed from the containing box.

The analog dial does not even feature a second hand.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Price but very confusing programing","review":"I like the look and feel of this watch but it's very confusing to program. I've tried a number of times to program the day and date in (in the digital window) but I haven't got it right yet. maybe I should give it to my son he's very good at programming. The little \\"programming\\" booklet that comes with the watch needs a Casio Watch Programing for Dummies insert.The analog part was easy to figure out, I have a watch that tells time but I'm clueless on how to get the right day and date in the digital window. Is it me or Casio?Once I get the programming figured out I think it's a great watch for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap travel watch works well","review":"I bought this watch as a way to keep track of my home and travel time zones simultaneously. It did both of these functions well. The light does not illuminate the digital portion. I like have an inexpensive watch when traveling abroad and leave my more costly watches at home. The timer and other functions I did not really try extensviely, but seemed a little clunky to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, a very good buy","review":"I needed a rugged outdoor watch that would not die on me.

It is very easy to set and meets or exceeds my expectations. I have over a dozen watches and I always like the ones that are either automatic, manual wind or extended life batteries.

I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cost/benefit","review":"It's a great cost/benefit item.It looks good and wors pretty well.My only complaint is the night light, as I had read on some reviews before I bought it, I have to place my opposite hand close over the display to be able to read the digital display, the analog one illuminates OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend","review":"Hard to follow, also very annoying. The dancer is not one I would recommend for many reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't like how the video goes straight into the moves, with absolutely no instructions or step-by-step poses. It seems very fast paced, especially if you don't know what you are doing.If I had the choice, I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love it...","review":"Neon delivers the best abs workout and I have fun doing it. She is very graceful, perfect cueing, awesome digital effects to show you the moves and whatnot. The exercise is broken down into 3 sequences, followed by a dance sequence/routine with each. You get a cardio workout because she does not stop and talk then move but you can follow her easily because she delivers perfect cueing through oral instruction and the special effects. I think the quality of the DVD is top notch and Neon is mesmerizing...I owned a LOT of bellydance workout and by far this one is the best! (I also purchased the Bellydance Party by Neon and it has the same top notch quality)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not for beginners","review":"The actual workout seems fine however if you have never done bellydancing before this DVD is not for you. The instructor moves too quickly to the next step before you have a chance to grasp the move. I threw out my back trying to keep up with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but a little fast for beginners.","review":"It's a good video, in my opinion. They do tell you what muscles they work, they do tell you what techniques to use when a move is hard, and they do have easy to read drawings to show exactly HOW to move your hips.It's a perfect video to work out to, especially for someone with an old hip injury like myself who's looking to tone and restore muscle use to a weak hip, and is afraid of putting too much stress on it through traditional exercise.Unfortunately, the video moves fast for a beginner, and I had to play it a second time through to get it just right. But only a second time! It's not THAT hard to catch up to, once you figure out what you're doing.Bonus: My 3-year-old son tries to bellydance with me.Definitely a good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Instructions","review":"I bought this DVD with the thought that at first they might break down the moves BEFORE they just jump right into the deep end of the pool. Personally, for someone who has never done bellydancing ever before, this was a horrible buy. I didn't like the way they had the set up either, seemed dark, and they just jumped straight into the moves, telling you how to move your body as they were doing it and going onto the next one. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love NEON....okay video...wouldn't purchase again.","review":"First, this is not a Neon bash. I love Neon. I think she has a fun, fluid, unique attitude and style that is contagious! I do not however, love this DVD. I own many, and this is not one I chose to workout to.....almost ever. It is very fast paced, and when checking for alignment or proper technique, she is already way past me and onto something else. She is such a delight, it is a shame that this video represents her. It is not her best work. Give her another chance on something else...you just might love her too, but don't chose this one for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great phonics songs for learning and entertainment","review":"My four-year-old daughter loved this CD and so did my first graders at school!

Americans can appreciate the sometimes silly but always enjoyable pop cultures references, Indians can revel in the lush, elaborate cinematography, and everyone can love and adore Shah Rukh, Preity and Seif. This movie drew me in and made me laugh out loud, then break out into tears in the next moment. All of the songs are catchy, including the wise and beautiful title song. Everyone in the film is perfectly cast, and although the movie is a typical 3 hours long, it's well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Bollywood Film with Heart","review":"The story told here, complete with the songs, was truly touching and full of heart. The acting was excellent, especially, as always, Shah Rukh Khan. Khan is a master of drama, pulling off both intensity and humor with a naturalness that rivals the best of both Bollywood and Hollywood.I will admit that there were parts of the film that were over the top (the Hindi version of Pretty Woman); but that's part of Bollywood style and you must accept Bollywood on its own terms. All of the rest of the music stayed with me, in a very good way, long after the movie ended. Trust me, you'll find yourself playing them back!This film has so much to teach--about the importance of friendship, about faith, about love and sacrifice and the importance of feeling every moment directly and with a full heart, for as the theme song itself declares--tomorrow may never be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of an era!!","review":"After three incredible albums: \\"Out of the cellar\\", \\"Invasion of your privacy\\" and \\"Dancing undercover\\" and later the good \\"Reach for the sky\\" then comes the final nail in the coffin for one of my favorites in the 80's. Detonator is the synonimous of pop metal in the worst and out of ideas. In this album, i feel a tired Ratt, pushing themselves hard to make an stand out album, after the \\"Reach for the sky disillusion\\". For me \\"Detonator\\" is one of the worst album in the 80's.

I'm a big Ratt fan, all the way back to the E.P.But this just isn't a good album. They'd resorted to outside writers by this point, because their main songwriter (Robbin Crosby) from their salad daze couldn't write killer songs anymore. I always liked \\"One Step Away\\", but even that's a little too clean & polished for Ratt n'Roll.

I gave it 2 1/2 stars. When Detonator was released in 1990, and I had first heard it, I knew that Ratt had truely \\"sold out\\" as this album is some very bad hair metal. Its sounds nothing like the Ratt of old, and even gives in to some bad \\"electric\\" drums. The only song on here that is any good is \\"Shame, Shame, Shame\\", the rest is just garbage. Even though Hair Metal would die a in two years, Ratt had died and gone to hair metal heaven after this piece of junk release. If you like your hair metal cheesy such as BulletBoys, Winger, White Lion, and Ugly Kid Joe, then this is for you. If you were a die hard fan of Ratt's \\"out of the celler\\" and \\"Dancing Undercover\\" (their two best albums) then avoid this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giv'n Yourself Away","review":"See the title. That song is the GREATEST ballad ever done by a band, in my opinion. I listen to Giv'n Yourself Away at least ONCE a week even here in 1999.Detonator was more of the same great rock we came to expect from Ratt when it was released. The tour to support the release was one of Ratt's best.

Once I got to the good parts I enjoyed the book immensely, but there were far too many parts that seemed to be there merely to educate us readers about the Israel/PLO conflict, and that didn't serve any purpose in terms of moving the plot along.Were I grading the book on how well it was written, I would have given Prince of Fire all five stars.

The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary. I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works. But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over. I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to. Too bad - I know I won't buy that one. I LOVE to read and \\"consume\\" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.

Gabriel Alon is a fascinating character. The plot and story are so well developed compared to many other thrillers I have read. Silva does a nice job of drawing the reader.

The Prince of Fire was one of the better in the series, although they are all fantastic. The stories all tie together in little ways, a reference to an event or person from a past book, but they are not so interwoven that you can't read them out of order.I will likely read most of these again, as I plowed through this book and others at lightening speed to get to the ending, so I'd like to go back and savor the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince of Fire","review":"This continues the excellent series with Gabriel Allon proving once again that he is a most human hero.

I have been using it for a few months and really like it. The panning is smooth and the quick release platform is really nice.Pros:- smooth panning- quick setup- comes with a carrying bag- lightweightCons:- Since its lightweight you have to hold on to it when your panning sometimes because it jerks a little bitOverall, its a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, overpriced.","review":"I bought this tripod with the intention of using it for both still photography and video. Its head is truly fluid moving, unlike many other tripods on the market. However, the pluses end there. The construction is rather flimsy, and is not best suited for outdoor conditions. Do not use this tripod for still photographs; one cannot rotate the head vertically, extremely limiting is usefulness. As a matter of fact, after about a month of ownership, one of the rubber pegs on the leg fell off, and now it does not attach on securely. Not only that though, is that the grip that allows you to move the head fell off, rendering the tripod useless.For $85 there are many more higher quality tripods that I would have bought. This tripod in reality is worth about $35. I will return this product, expect a refund, and go visit a real camera store to actually try out the tripod before purchasing online."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice fluid head, junky legs","review":"the fluid head on this tripod works great, but the cheap plastic parts making up the locking mechanism on the legs broke the second time i used it. junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"head creep","review":"When you tighten the elevation screw, it pitches the head horizontally from level to non-level.

Unfortunately it shows as some of the components do not feel solid or feel a bit loose, even when tightened up. For the price I can't complain, this tripod has very smooth movement and is very stable. It's not super light but not difficult to lug around. The quick attachment for the camera is not always quick as it can be difficult to get it set in just right, but after a few uses it gets a bit easier. I'd definitely buy one of these again.update: Their is a plastic piece that holds the legs in and seems to be poorly built and breaks easily. Unfortunately I was directed to return to the maker, which is very difficult to get ahold of being in England. They want me to ship the entire unit there and wait for them to fix it, which hardly seems worth the cost and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken and 0 customer service","review":"100% agree with the other reviewer who commented on how it broke after 5 uses. When I first recieved this, I heard something shaking inside. worked fine so thought something might have gotten in. After about 3 uses, the fastener on one of the legs completely snapped off along with whatever part was inside. Tried calling the manufacturer as well as email for 1 month straight and not a single word from them. Had they fixed the leg I would say decent product, but for lack of service, I have to rate this below the $25 tripod I've replaced with which is found strong after more than 20 uses.

Then I barely used it and now it is almost a year old-I went to use it (barely opened the clasp) and the cheap plastic parts making up the lockingmechanism on the legs broke. I tried to get in touch via email to the Velbon company and they donot seem to care. I tried calling and realized they in the UK. So, if you bought this piece of junkbetter return it quick before it breaks on you too and you are left with no product support on it at all.My suggestion. Buy USA made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid for home movie affairs","review":"Though it is mostly plastic, the tripod is surprisingly sturdy and the fluid head movement is great. You can perform smooth pans and tilts in almost any direction without it being jerky. (Only problem is that because it's so light, the tripod will get knocked onto its side if you pan too fast. The best way to counter that is to keep one hand on the base of the tripod.) This is a great tripod if you want to make more sophisticated looking home movies as opposed to the \\"turn-it-on-and-leave-it-there\\" look of most videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very affordable tripod for professional-looking pan/tilt shots","review":"I bought this tripod on a whim because I needed a fluid-head tripod for some shots I was getting of my college campus for a video project. It was 80 bucks from Samy's Camera, a much better price than most fluid-head tripods, and I was skeptical at first. But a few days and a dozen tapes later, I'm very impressed. The fluid movement is very smooth, and has allowed me to get some great-looking pan/tilt shots of my campus. The quick release is convenient, the built-in level has been very handy, and the overall construction is solid. I would definitely recommend this to any amateur filmmaker on a budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average tripod","review":"I bought and returned this tripod.

First of all, it has a very smooth flow in all directions with multiple adjustments and lock-ins. That was the main reason I wanted a new tripod. Secondly, I liked the long handle which made control much easier. An unexpected surprise was how well the camera mounting bracket works - it's very sturdy and has an automatic lock in when the camera sits down in it, so it securely holds the camera regardless of position.

The mattress feels firmer than others we considered. It has a nice comfy feel to it and the cover does clean easily. We'd initially looked at some more expensive models, and based on advice from some more experienced parents and Baby Bargains, we decided to make this slightly more economical choice.

He uses interesting real life stories to illuminate the workings of the human mind. I found them thought provoking and informative.As a physician, I was particularly interested by his description of Goldman's algorithm, which is a simple tool for doctors to determine if someone is having a heart attack. Many writers stumble when they write about medicine, but Gladwell is spot on.Some reviewers have criticized this book as a series of articles rather than a coherent whole.

You won't go wrong with this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Look at Off-the-Cuff Decision Making","review":"This book was an easy and fun read.

The first and the second last chapters are definitely an interesting read. In between these two chapters all he does is to narrate examples of supposedly( i havent heard of any of these people) famous people on how they trusted their 2-second snap decisions / judgements. The author has made very little attempt to give any sort of insight on how our instincts really work. I must agree with one reader that its like going through psychology 101. The only part I truly enjoyed reading was the piece of information on autism.All said , I must admit the author did a good job in collecting data and he sure knows how to write.

The book goes on and on with examples and explanations but not once gives you an idea on how to improve your snap judgments. If you are looking for that kind of info don't buy this book.

I mention this just to worn you that I am a little biased.Gladwell is extremely good at simplifying common phenomena, which is usually known by many but is usually too complex to describe. He is also a master in gluing you to his books. He does this through the number of case studies each of which is a mini course in its field.The part that liked most was the case study about the pentagon's war game. It is a crash course in leadership and team management which is very very informative and entertaining at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effects of Snap Judgments","review":"Blink is a great book. This book talks about how we make snap judgments about people and the things that surrounds us. He proposes an idea and supports it with many peer-reviewed research. He does raise questions and provoke the reader to ponder on the issues raised and come up with his or her own conclusion. What amazes me the most about him is that all the ideas in this book is about finding ways to improve our society as a whole. I strongly believe that he is a another version of President Obama that wants to help and improve society as a whole. There is more to this book that will make you step back and think about some of the issues affecting our society today. You must read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major, MAJOR Disappointment; DRIFTS, BADLY!!","review":"This book could probably be anywhere from a 1/3rd to a 1/4th as big as it is; if not a pamphlet. Maybe the 2d star I gave it is too altruistic. But I will credit it with a few good points.For what it purports to write about, it's WAY WAY too heavily larded down with minutiae and details to the point of the reader starting to doze off, break concentration from Gladwell's aggregate point, or both. Gladwell really needs to take a course on/in brevity.As much as I tried to give it a chance in spite of what the coverflap said of who the author's written for, I can understand why he writes for them and why they hired him.Definitely near the bottom of my list of recommends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gladwell...fascinating as usual","review":"I've loved reading Malcolm Gladwell's writing in the New Yorker for years. Standouts include \\"Clicks and Mortar\\" about internet shopping and \\"Big and Bad\\" about SUVs. In his usual fashion, BLINK draws from a broad range of sources and studies to help us understand the world we live in and our own role within it. I suggest you buy this book and keep it on your nightstand. Read it little by little and allow the chapters to sink in slowly. If you're like me, you'll be amazed at what you begin to observe in your daily life. Gladwell's gift is not so much inventing new ideas, but rather in putting ideas together and allowing us to see what was there all along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two seconds make all the difference","review":"Gladwell offers an intriguing look at how the subconscious or intuition of a person works in different situations, as well as how it can be trained and the importance of sometimes taking a step back before acting on a situation. This is a relatively quick read with some intriguing ideas offered in it. If you like this book, you may find it useful to track down some of the writings by people he references as they go into more depth than Gladwell does."},{"rating":"1","title":"No conclusion","review":"Like someone allready said, it's a bunch of stories with no conclusion to it (and yes there even is a conclusion chapter.. but guess what.. it's another story)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Social Agenda","review":"I was fascinated by the beginning of this book. Gladwell did a good job of bringing me in. I really enjoyed learning about how the brain works and processes information before we consciously recognize what we have seen. When he started his social agenda and race issues I had to force myself to finish the book. At the end of the book I felt like I was reading something from an angry citizen who felt that police officers were out to get the minority population. He should have stopped the book 100 pages sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it. Why this book has so many stars","review":"I got the book because of the number of reviews. I started reading it and I didn't get the first part so I continue until I got to the middle. Nothing special. Just a lot of research from the author but nothing I can really take and use. It was a waste of my money and time. I don't know if I need to get to the end to really understand the value of the book but currently in the middle of it I am bored and I don't want to continue. So I decided to stop and got another book. I hope I am wrong and I hope there is something else that I am missing. Maybe I will give it another try later this year but currently I am very disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but superficial","review":"There's very little substance here. The basic idea is laid out in the early chapters and most of the rest of the book are anecdotal examples. It is interesting and well-written, however; even if a rather superficial. Keep in mind also: the author has no credentials in psychology, neurobiology, or any other science. I believe he's a journalist.Overall, \\"Blink\\" is pretty lightweight stuff: good if you're stuck on a plane or need easy bed-time reading.

According to Malcolm, we must strive to rid ourselves of the horrible limiting stereotypes we have of African Americans and females, etc. However, while it is important that we do that, it is still okay to stereotype individuals experiencing Autism. In fact, he shares a few based on one study with one individual experiencing autism and expects the reader to be as ignorant of the subject as he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"please","review":"I didn't finish blink, made it two-thirds of the way through. The whole premise is stupid to me, and the most bothersome part is that while the author tosses around buzz terms like thin slicing and this so-called built in ability to laser through the troublesome act of actually reflecting on a comprehensive picture, he never really touches on the fact that 9 out of 10 of his examples are the result of expert ability based on 20+ years of dedication to the respective discipline, or riding on the shoulders of the equally applied efforts of someone else.

Very quick. Educational and entertaining.Interestingly enough, when I read it my take on it was that everyone can learn to \\"thin-slice\\". But like another reviewer, a friend of mine who read it thought that the book showed you that you need to be an expert before you can \\"thin-slice\\" otherwise you are relying on faulty intuition.I think your conclusion about \\"thin-slicing\\" is based on your perceptions of how data can be boiled down to a quick judgement whether you are an expert or not.Absolutely fascinating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Psychology, but fun reading","review":"Like The Tippng Point, Blink presents an interesting perspective on the movers and shakers in today's society.

I found myself reading this for more than 60 minutes at a time without even realizing time had passed. I have become a fan of Gladwell and am anxious to read his other works. I would highly recommend this book for the interested reader. Nothing in it is really ground breaking, but it's the sort of book with a lot of interesting bits of information that make you a little more interesting of a person, a little more aware of your self and others in the world, and give you an enhanced perspective on thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Book","review":"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without ThinkingI am 63 years old and an avid reader.

This something is cognition...and sometimes your hunches are right and someitmes they are wrong, but here are some cool stories about lucky guesses! That is basically all Gladwell writes about. He tries to impress you with stories of the rogue general who beat the big bad US, and about the classical archeologist who just felt something was wrong. He tries to tell you about the 1920 election and the most perfect yet ugly chair. He tries to explain that all of these ideas are related to a power none of us can control or really understand.

Paint drying boring.Gladwell's epiphany: humans make quick subconscious decisions that are often correct. However, sometimes subconscious stereotypes can result in wrong decisions.

However, if you are looking for the application in your own life...look elsewhere.Along about page 100, I wanted to put it down because it seemed to have little to say. Another thin-slice I missed. By the time I got to the end of the book, I felt like my time had been wasted...not to mention the money.

If the research was accurately presented, it was compelling. The problem I had with the book is that it never presented any information on how one can work to develop one's own \\"blink\\" ability. There is the suggestion that it is possible to develop this capacity. I felt like a salesman had gotten me all excited about the features of this new, fabulous, remarkable car, then walked away from me refusing to work with me to buy it.

The author challenges the traditional notion that intuitive decisions are based on mounds of subconscious information. He shares his concept of \\"thin slicing\\" with compelling examples. A worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating read!","review":"Gladwell writes in an engaging manner, but his methods are suspect. Thousands of psychological experiments are conducted each year at universities around the world in an effort to advance knowledge. Cherry-picking the ones with broad appeal and presenting them (out of context and without mention of their methodological constraints) is just plain wrong. Fine for a superficial understanding of certain topics. Read Roy Baumeister for a better integration of experimental findings and real-world concerns.Note to Gladwell: psychological questionnaires are not \\"highly respected\\", they are either valid or not, that is they either adequately measure the targeted psychological characteristics or they don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book in one sentence:","review":"\\"Trust your instinct except when it's wrong\\".There, I just saved you $10. No kidding, that sentence is the entire book. Sorry Gladwell fans, I must say this book is terrible. For the first few chapters, Gladwell talks about all these instances where lives, money, and prestige were saved thanks to people who trusted their instincts (or where all this was lost, because people did not trust their instincts). So you're thinking, great, you should trust your instincts. Then without warning, all his stories start to shift to ones where people trusted their instincts and turned out to be wrong. The End. And you're left wondering, why did I just read 10 stories where people who trusted their instincts were sometimes right and sometimes wrong? Of course that would happen.Skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Much Information Do We Need?","review":"\\"Blink\\" does a fine job of shedding light on the decision making process. The primary concept of the book is \\"thin slicing\\"--making decisions quickly on a minimum of information. The author shows when it works and why. He also shows when it doesn't work and why. Finally, he shows the reader how to improve on his/her \\"thin slicing\\" ability.The concept of \\"thin slicing\\" is a great one, and the book is well written and easy to follow. Several reviewers were critical that the book was overly repetetive.

But for all of the hype this book has attracted (and that might well be part of the problem), this one doesn't even come close to meeting the standards of his past efforts in terms of the calibre of the research, fresh perspective, new insights and writing. I have found that much of his work in The New Yorker of late falls short on the same counts. Perhaps he has forgotten that less is more and that his fans expect him to meet the high bar and standard he set for himself in the past? Or maybe someone should tell his publisher to stop hounding him for more books that don't make the grade to fill their pipeline?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting anecdotes. Lacks conclusions.","review":"The author references some very interesting studies, including how one professor is able to predict with 95% accuracy whether or not a married couple will still be married in 15 years by observing the couple for 1 hour and identifying some key behaviors. Overall though, the author never forms conclusions that can be applied to life. After reading the book, I wonder to myself, how am I better informed about making snap judgements than I was before? I honestly don't think I am. Good start to the book. Poor finish. Also, many of his anecdotes are lengthier than they need to be. All-and-all, it's thought-provoking, but not instructional at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massively Overrated","review":"This book is a classic example of how good editorial style masks the flaws of poor writing. The thought leadership in Blink could fill a postcard--at most a sheet of note paper, if you wrote in big, loopy cursive. But Gladwell's anecdotes are entertaining (if loosely tied to the premise) and his prose clips along (if repetitively), making for a mildly entertaining read.The first half of \\"Blink\\" is about why you should trust your instincts (the orchestra story). The second half is about why you shouldn't (the Amadou Diallo story). And very little effort is made to reconcile this self-canceling arrangement. As for the promised \\"how to improve\\" and \\"how to overcome\\" sections, they largely fail to materialize.On a positive note, the book is self-fulfilling in one way. My first thought when I saw Blink is that it was another phatic suit-narcotic. Now that I've read it, I can confirm empirically that my instinct was correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book that doesn't have ALL the answers","review":"i would definately reccommend this book. it is an interesting subject, it is well written, and it makes you step back and realize how we take a large portion of our thinking for granted. when he talked about how words that we barely acknowledge can make subtle changes in our behavior and actions, it made me more aware of the potential of our brains, as well as more aware of what i am reading or seeing. this is not a self help book that tells you how to increase your thinking power. this book tells you that you already have the ability to make sound snap decisions and you should realize that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use the second half of it as a sleep aid","review":"This book is 50% \\"thin slicing\\", 50% lesson on stereotyping, and no real explanation on how to improve our already innate ability to thin slice. \\"Don't rush to judgement without a sufficient knowledge of the subject and don't question yourself too much if you have sufficient knowledge of the subject\\".

It felt to me as if the author was writing a PhD dissertation with this audio. He went into such colorful detail on tangential themes in order to attempt to relay his points that it became difficult even in the car to sit and listen to. His points were not that difficult to relay, but one got the idea that he had to fill space/time, and a lot of it. That is exactly what he did.Unfortunately, I can't even say that his ideas were very creative.

I quit reading after the chapter about Van Riper's big victory, so maybe all the interesting stuff is in the end of the book (I wouldn't know because I kept falling asleep by this time).

The book's premise and assertions are its strength. The writing is engaging but the packaging a bit too commercial and in some spots faulty. If you have to make a quick decision - I say buy the book and read it - just use it as a starting point to conduct your own observations of how to make quick decisions and be more intuitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialist Propaganda","review":"The beginning of the book is interesting, but after that the Author begins flailing around trying to make his points. Ultimately on the very last page of the book you learn that apparently the whole purpose of his book is to promote his idea that people on trial should be behind a closed door, and communicate to the Judge and jury through \\"...e-mail or the use of an intermediary.\\" The Author repeatedly demonstrates that he is simply trying to use his influence to push a globalist agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a must read book","review":"Let me start by saying that each chapter in the book is very interesting, easy to read and engaging. A real page turner from this point of view.Now, having said that, as a whole I couldn't see what was the author getting at through the book. The book starts with the premise that some people can make a snap decision about something and be right, which is interesting. But then, the book goes into chapter after chapter of examples on exemptions to this. Which at the end feels like the original premise is completely false. The only conclusion I could get is that some expert in something might be able to make a quick decision and be right, which is mostly chance alone.So in essence I found this book to be mostly unimportant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly Banal","review":"This \\"book\\" is written as a 10 year old would write an essay.Not worth the price.It's cr*p. Completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLINK -NOT A GOOD READ FOR ME ( I WISH I GET MY MONEY BACK)","review":"I did not like this book because to me it felt like the author is providing unnecessary details to fill pages of a book.The underlying theory is well understood, but the narrative is too verbose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink","review":"Even though this book starts off with a bang, I did not find the information conclusive. Based on anecdotes, the book lacks empirical data. Gladwell points out that once we have acquired a significant amount of information in a particular field, then related decisions tend to be more accurate. His \\"thin slicing\\" concept is worth a read. I recommend the author's previous book, The Tipping Point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable, riveting book","review":"I heard a book review cum interview on NPR with the author. The social implications that they talked about in the show was definitely interesting, so I bought the book - its still on the best seller list, if it means anything to any one - and I couldnt put it down. Its one of the few non-fiction books that has had been rivetted. It is written in a very organised way, in very simple lay person terms and also explains every concept with examples. It demystifies, without reducing the respect for the phenomena. I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about social psychology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradigm shift ... or just a light read?","review":"I devoured this book, it's an interesting, quick and fun read. Initially I was convinced the author had conveyed some brilliant insights, and my life was changed. A few days later, though, I kind of think that his insights are interesting, yes, and thought-provoking. But not really much more than common sense would lead any intelligent person to conclude.Still, I do recommend it as an interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunity","review":"I had high hopes for this book. It actually has some insights that are worth listening to. But ultimately it turns into a culturally biased commentary on why you are racist whether you know it or not. Also, we are reminded that the author is better than you, particularly if you are a white male. And finally, he manages to make the book political by using only examples to support his arguments that are out of the liberal playbook of stereotypes and false premises. I actually think some of his points are valid, but if he cannot see past his own viewpoint that racism is under every rock and behind every tree (which is patently false if you are a liberal reading this) how can you trust any of his conclusions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written and an excellent source for learning","review":"This book is extremely interesting and thought provoking. It is all about a concept called \\"thin slicing\\" which is a fancy term to describe the intuitive first impressions that humans make upon other people. There are tons of historical facts, astonishing quotes, and scholarly references that will absolutely blow your mind. This is my first Malcolm Gladwell book, but definitely not my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like It.","review":"My brother had told me about this book and some of the social experiments that were talked about in it. I thought it sounded pretty interesting, so I bought it. Now, I'm not quite finished with it as of yet, but I'm really into it. It helps you think more about smaller things and pay more attention to things you normally wouldn't.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished strong","review":"Got this book from a reading list for a Critical Thinking class I attended. I struggled through the first couple chapters of the book thinking the support for the conclusions to be rather weak. But as I got further in I was finding it more interesting and meaningful. The book finished strong. I've since purchased a couple of the books referenced in Blink. I gave away my original copy and will buy another. I thinking my second reading will put the first few chapters in a much better light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"A book obviously intended to entertain as opposed to educate. While the premise is interesting, the science does not support the jumps that Gladwell makes. Read Damasio, Baars, or even Dennett to get a better idea of recent brain science from people actually in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little better than a snoozer","review":"While this book has some fascinating sections (see the section on autism, as well as the opening chapter) mainly I found Mr. Gladwell's latest release to be boring overall. Some of his examples of 'thin slicing' were far fetched to say the least, and he did not explore the other possible reasons behind the failure of certain of his examples. Read it for a book club, and everyone else liked it to give the author credit... but I won't read any of his other books on my own. After the interesting first chapter I was expecting better, and was let down. And there was absolutely no reason to include every muscle twitch in the body language section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretching it to the max","review":"Like the author's \\"Tipping Point\\", \\"Blink\\" gives a fascinating hypothesis that will change your marketing perspective dramatically and forever, whether you're pushing yourself or a product.The only problem is: in both books, Gladwell's unique, little brainstorms could easily be reduced to about 25-30 pages without losing a thing. Once his theory has been expressed and examples given, there is not much else to say, but Gladwell goes on and on and on...and on. I have to admit, I could not make it all the way through either title. I felt like I was being repeatedly beaten over the head with the same information, just formatted in different ways.Would have made a great, A+ school report, but a book??? Now THAT'S marketing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Okay Read","review":"Some insightful stuff, but not a lot earthshattering. Intuitive listening is the principle, and some time spent on how that is used against you (not actually your intuition, but basic assumptions that have you make snap judgements).The key is to be able to distinguish between intuition and preconceptions. It takes awareness, the book does not provide means to develop this. Instead it merely documents the phenomenon.There's probably a lot better material to spend your reading time on. Like The Tipping Point, I think the concept can be garnered quickly, you really don't need to read a whole book to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink stinks...","review":"I've never seen a more transparent effort to cash in. This is a (really) dumbed down psych lite book about nothing. At times, Gladwell's effort to make a strong point in confusing (I suspect there is no point). At other times, he provides mini-overviews of the examples discussed in the book in case we couldn't remember them...There is nothing interesting and nothing to gain from Gladwell's flimsy theory about \\"thinking without thinking.\\" If you're interested in the thesis \\"the power of thinking without thinking is so strong unless it's a situation where regular thinking is required,\\" buy the book. Because that's all there is to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy of a magazine article, but not a book","review":"Great concept, but the book is simply too repetitive. After the first few chapters, you get the point - gut decisions are about as good as long, thought out decisions. It would've been a nice magaizine article, but didn't justify an entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast reading, nothing profound","review":"The basic ideas of Blink are that people make snap judgments, some people are good at it, sometimes snap judgments reflect prejudices, sometimes too much information can cloud thinking, using both snap judgments and deliberation can be effective, and it's never too late to give up our prejudices (well, that's how Thoreau put it). Gladwell documents these banalities with anecdotes (some interesting, some not) and bits and pieces of marketing analysis and/or research.Really, there isn't much more to say about it than that. There is nothing here that is groundbreaking or original. In essence, this New Yorker writer wrote an extended magazine piece and put it out as a book. I think a better title would have been Snap!, but I'm not a marketing analyst and that's just a hunch!Borrow it and pass it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as his previous work","review":"This book seems to have been written only because of the success of the Tipping Point, not because of a worthwhile subject matter. It jumps from facts, to anectodes, without a strong enough argument. After reading the first one, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"deluding","review":"Blink is the diet version of Gladwell's previous book: The Tipping Point. It is neither original nor thought provoking. The bottom line of the book is that we are influenced by our snap judgments in our everyday life. However, some persons are more capable than others in that craft. Yes, that's true. And Cialdini's book: \\"Influence. The Psychology of Persuasion\\" says the whys and the hows."},{"rating":"2","title":"The logic behind intuition","review":"This book attempts to provide insight into intuitive decision making. Gladwell starts strong with his prescription for data selection reinforced with fascinating case studies, but the book loses steam. I definitely prefer his previous book, The Tipping Point, which is more substantive. For solid information on decision making and optimal choices using logic with intuition, read Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have the urge to read this, \\"blink\\" and maybe you won't","review":"I thought that this book, though well-written and easy to read, didn't really teach me much that was useful. Perhaps my fault for setting expectations too high, but I thought this book would offer insights into how WE can go about improving these gut-decisions that we sometimes have to make. I don't think I got anything like that. Outside of some interesting data points on how accurate some people's instincts seem to be or how, with training, we can discern some of the causes underlying some of our decisions and prejudices, I thought this was just trivial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink and its over","review":"Gladwell spends half the book telling you how we are capable of making incredible, enlightened deductions in an instant thanks to our subconscious. He leaves you hoping the next half of the book will tell you how to harness and refine those deductions so you can use them in everyday life and decision making processes. Instead he goes on to reveal how we override our initial intuitions with conscious thought, and interestingly, vice versa. He ends by giving examples of how we make errors in judgment by relying on our intuition too much. So what was the point? Not the treatment on the subject I was hoping to receive. Basically he says the subconscious is capable of powerful things. Great. Now buy a book that talks more about how to use it to your advantage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Step","review":"This book should be read by anyone who is looking to add to there intellect and by anyone who is yearning to learn more and more about people. I think of this book as the next level to a movie like Crash. Crash is an icredible film that illustrates how connected all of us are, and how convaluted our decisions can become if we rely merely on prejudice and stereotypes. Blink tells us why we do that. Blink explains why we make these snap judgements and touches on how such snap judgements can be helpful or detrimental. Blink also talks about cultivating our subjective unconsciousness into something that we can use in our everyday life, whether it involves love or the work place.This one is for the human who are dedicated to take their intelligence to the next level."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sure hit in MBA programs","review":"What a bore! \\"Blink\\" is a grab bag of platitudes that leads absolutely nowhere. The core thesis is risible. The author basically argues that under the right conditions, humans make better decisions when they use their instincts. He then states that under the wrong conditions, decisions based on instinct can be disastrous. Jee-whizz, Malcom, thanks for the insight! The book is hype and empty of any valuable content; it will certainly become standard reading in MBA programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Data, but no interpretation","review":"I had high hopes when I bought this book, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Rather than a manual about how to refine one's snap judgments, the whole book is a series of how quick decisions can sometimes be better than careful reasoning. As I read, I kept thinking, \\"Great, snap judgments might work sometimes. How do I improve them?\\" but he never got to it. The examples were interesting, but to write a whole book about them and only them...it makes you wonder if the author just wants you to go through his book without thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I was absolutely startled that this book got 3.5 stars so far! The whole book talks about one thing: the 6th sense sometime works, sometime doesn't. What a spectacular revealation! It was a practical humilation to me that I've finished 80% of the book before I am writing this. Don't waste your time and money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising idea, failed to deliver","review":"First 1/3 was good.

That summarizes his entire book. Spending any more time on his book will provide no greater insight. Take his advice - accept this 2 second summary of his book, and move on. There is nothing more to learn from reading it. Apply this to Tipping Point's basic idea - if a phenomenon achieves a certain critical mass, it will grow exponentially. Now you don't need to read Tipping Point either."},{"rating":"1","title":"good at the beginning but boring after 2nd chapter....","review":"the book began with lots of interesting observations and new ideas, really eye catching so to speak but after a couple of chapters, it is the same thesis rehashed many times with different stories to illustrate the same concept(s). i thought the writer could have done a magazine feature article on this topic instead of writing a full length book. so, definitely borrow the book from the public library as you can finish the whole book in 2 hours. on content alone, this book does not deserve a \\"buy\\" but deserve a \\"borrow\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insight","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding human behaviors and why we react the way we do under certain circumstances.I particularly fascinated by the cop's reaction after a speed trace and the research done on facial expression. A lot of decisions can be made in a blink, some are good, some are detrimental. After \\"Tipping point\\", this is another great work on human instinct and psychology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to understand themes that are transformational","review":"Gladwell is one of the best at integrating massive amounts of research into easy to understand themes that are transformational. Blink is a great example of how he helps us understand how we think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive book of repetition. Whoops. Did I say repetition already?","review":"In theory, this book was good. It had a great concept, but it could have been explained in just a few chapters and not an entire book.

I was bored with the book by the time I got to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink Review","review":"Great read!Made me think in a different manner about my \\"knee jerk\\" decisions.

The only thing I didn't like about the book was that sometimes it became a little vague otherwise a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duh....","review":"In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking","review":"This book was given as a required reading for a yoga teacher training course I participated in. It was wonderful! I'm so glad I had the opportunity to experience a book that made so much sense!I would highly recommend it for anyone,for those who already believe in intuition and especially for those who don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never think the same way again","review":"Nevermind the armchair critics, the nitpicking ninnies, and the wannabe eggheads who pooh-pooh this book. \\"Blink\\" is a powerful book. It is comprises a spectrum of anecdotes about how people think before they start \\"thinking.\\" Gladwell has taken a narrow psychological topic and turned it into a thrilling page-turner. Most important, \\"Blink\\" has changed the way that I think. Few books do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink....but not too hard","review":"This book has many great examples and is well written....that being said, his conclusions are all wrong. The conclusions are sooooo far off as compared to his examples that to claim this book as \\"self-help\\" is absolutely absurd. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever been curious why you judge people like you do?","review":"After reading this book, I learned so much how people make judgements. Gladwell calls the snap judgements we make, usually without much information is known as \\"Thin-Slicing\\" and is something we all do every day.After reading the book, I have realized many situations where I am \\"thin-slicing\\" and making quick snap judgements. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn how they make the judgements they do. An excellent read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too long.","review":"The title of this book, \\"Blink\\", and the back cover caught my eye. I read most of this book but I got the feeling that there were too many examples of the same point. The feeling I got was that the author was trying to make the book thicker with repetious examples. Maybe Im wrong. Maybe I just couldn't grasp the importance of the examples. Any way, I wasn't able to finish. The point I got was that a snap decision could be a good decision or it could be a wrong decison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much there","review":"This book was mostly full of stories that illuminate the fairly obvious. Basically, the theme is that over-analyzing can often be worse than simply making a snap judgment. There is such a thing as too much information (especially when not interpreted correctly), and likewise, snap judgments are often wrong. How to find a balance? No answer in this book.I did find some of the stories and information entertaining, insightful, and perhaps slightly useful; but overall, I was glad it was a short book--I would not have finished it had it been any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink Not","review":"It seems that this book is more about the DANGERS of \\"thinking without thinking\\" then the advantages. Maybe the first 50 pages are interesting stories of people acting on instant insight successully, but the rest of the book describes disasters from doing so. I was looking for insight on expanding this ability, not reasons not to.A short, easy, read, but confounding... Not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLINK!! Blank. blunk.","review":"Gladwell deftly squeezes about 100 pages of content into almost 300 pages of book. It goes from pretty good to tedious to boring. He draws conclusions which are not based on any \\"facts\\" in the book, but he states his ideas as if they were absolute truths. I gave him 2 stars because the first part of the book was OK.Don't waste your time and your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Cohesiveness a Virtue?","review":"There are many lessons to be taken from \\"Blink.\\" Among them:1. Our first impressions, taken in a split second, are often more accurate than lengthy analysis.2. This is because our unconscious perceptions are uncanny.3. There's also the \\"Warren Harding Syndrome,\\" where these impressions can be totally wrong and overwhelm factual proofs much to the contrary.So, what gives? When you get done reading it you feel like you've learned something, but are a little hard pressed to put it into use. If it were advertised as a \\"how-to\\" book, it would fail miserably.Good thing it's not advertised that way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeated Theme","review":"It stricks upon on good idea then proceeds to beat the idea to death. Short quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bestseller dissapointment","review":"Looking at the ranking on the best seller's list and hearing a few reviews I had high expectations for this one. Quite frankly the last two pages sum up the entire book quite succinctly. The stories are interesting but the author never brings out anything that instills a need for action. Sort of like reading a novel. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Too often there's a difference in how we make decisions and how we claim to be making those decisions","review":"Start with the introductory chapter, The Statue That Didn't Look Right. If the first section doesn't intrigue or remind you of some related experience in your own life, then this book probably won't make sense. It's comprised of case studies that are mercifully light on scientific jargon and relate well to experiences we all know.I've interacted with and worked under people who consistently misunderstood the power of intuitive decision making. It's easy and intellectually lazy to point to a chart, a graph, a spreadsheet, or an equation and say, \\"This is why we should go this way.\\" It takes guts and willpower to rely equally on your own life experience too. You won't always be right, but I believe, as this book does, that you'll be right much more often than you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIpping point for individuals...","review":"While it's not as good as the previous book - TIpping point, Blink is still a very quick, interesting read. Where Tipping point focused on the group dynamics of how things change, this book looks more at the personal realm. How people make \\"unconscious\\" decisions and judgments - very interesting stuff.Gladwell clearly has a wonderful intuition about how people operate, either in a group or individually. This book doesn't seem as much his passion as TP did, but it's still interesting.This would be a great airplane read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided Ideas","review":"At the time of a blink, I know this book has a very misleading title but it fits today's Americans' need. It suggests that you don't need to think but you can make right decisions. However, intuition or hunch actually comes from years of experiences. But today's society, we need to get rich fast and enjoy life and we need a reason to make a judgement without real thinking. The result will be disasterous. Blink should not be a substitute of years of experiences and hard work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Power nor Thinking","review":"Just a long list of antedotes.

I am a psychology major and I was hoping for new ideas about how to judge things quickly with very little information, but the book ended up being a series of anecdotes about snap-judgment situations. The level of analysis was very poor and unoriginal, and the ideas were completely innocuous. Nothing in this book was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"all over the place","review":"I have heard many good things about this author.

I have been working in Strategic Marketing for over 15 years and was very excited to receive and read Blink. I thought his last book was brilliant but don't waste your money on this one. Go buy yourself a drink instead. In a blink, without thinking. What a dissapointment this read is. Mr. Gladwell chooses all kinds of well known incidents, examples and dissasters to prove his ''Blink concept''. From the New Coke flop(come on Malcolm)to a Pentagon war games excercice. The general idea of the book is: Keep a balance between the emotional and rational parts of your brain when you make a decision. But that doesn't warrant a 276 page book and absolutely not being in the top 10 on the Amazon best seller list. I want to have breakfast now....Blink...Blink... Should I or should I not?

The book is almost entirely devoted to describing instances of snap judgements that either assisted or led people astray in their decision making. No great theories on how the mind does this or why.The startling conclusions in the book are that we make snap judgements and that sometimes they help us and other times they hurt us.

That being said I found it both ironic and irritating that the author was so long winded in convincing the reader of this insight. In fact this insight isn't original psychologists have known for awhile that intuition is nothing more than really fast thinking. The more expertise one has in an area the quicker they are to make a good decision. Consider the x-ray technician takes one look at an x-ray and knows exactly what is broken and how bad. The patient has been staring at the x-ray and doesn't understand what to look for. The x-ray technican has looked at thousands and knows exactly what to look for.This book isn't worth the time it takes to read it.

Too bad my \\"thin slicing\\" is apparently terrible and could not help me on this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long look at rapid cognition","review":"Blink is a very long look at rapid cognition, the science of intuition. The problem with this book is it's about 200 pages too long and I felt like I was reading a magazine article that wouldn't stop - every chapter was a reiteration of the preceding chapter. This book in a nutshell is as follows:1. We each have an innate, rapid, largely unconscious sense of reasoning; i.e., intuition.2. We could greatly benefit by listening to this intuition.3. This intuition can also hold our unconscious prejudices.4. Our rapid cognition can often be wrong and get us in trouble.Personally I found this all very interesting - just not 320 pages worth of interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I'd like to echo the thoughts of other reviewers who've said Blink is merely a collection of anecdotes on how snap judgments can help us or harm us. Though interesting reads, these stories don't teach us anything we don't know already about intuition - Sometimes your instincts hit the bullseye and sometimes they fall completely off target. How do we know which instincts to trust? I was hoping Gladwell would provide an answer to this question, but found he really didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read...","review":"I think this is a must read, especially for those that enjoy psychology and understanding human behavior, human interaction and the reason we do many of the things the way we do. I think it is also a great self improvement tool.This book really makes you think. I loved the different examples that are provided from situations in the lives of people, from various walks of life, ranging from an Army commander to a food taster!The author does a great job of evaluating all sides of the topic and provides frequent reference to earlier instances.Overall, a very nice read, that I hope to keep doing time and again"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you smarter - 'nuff said.","review":"Gladwell's \\"Blink\\", a fantastic follow up to \\"the Tipping Point\\", reveals what most of us have known since the dawn of Creation, but ignore none the less. Trust your gut. We can all know, in the blink of an eye, what's \\"really going on\\" in a situation or circumstance - if we'll take the time to be receptive to what's happening around us. This isn't New Age drivel, this is using your brain. He would have gotten 5 stars out of me, but the one missing component was the \\"how to blink for dummies\\" manual at the end of the book. Malcolm defines the problem with conviction and shares the solution with wit, but never really puts a finger on exactly how you can put it to work in your life. Then again, that's the beauty of it - it's there for you to find, you just need to use your brain a little more to get it. Great for business and for life, Blink is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if not great","review":"Some interesting observations: but Gladwell could have been clearer about highlighting the fact that what he is talking about is really trained intuition. That is, experts trained by years of study - or even scientifically determined heuristics - can make snap decisions, not just anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and disappointing","review":"The main reason I bought this book was because of the promise of teaching you how to improve upon utilizing your gut instinct. As I progressed through the book, my gut instict was telling me that wasn't going to happen, and it was right. It was just a series of studies and examples of where instinct has worked and where it hasn't. I didn't read one paragraph where the author instructs on how to improve upon or develop your unconscious decision-making. The stories are interesting but the book was a big disappointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink and you missed it...","review":"It breaks my heart to write a negative review of a Malcolm Gladwell work. Tipping Point was incredibly easy to read and provided useful discussion and thinking points, however the lessons of Blink (if there are any) are difficult to apply and certainly impossible to substantiate, even after you plough through this work (which becomes tedious toward the end). Blink will not have anywhere near the impact that Tipping Point did (and, from here on in, comparisons to Tipping Point will for Gladwell be inevitable). The book is well-written and focused. I still ponder some of the examples give n in the book weeks later -- but a few of the stronger examples are painfully short on detail and their bond to the central theme (which, unfortunately, is obvious to anyone capable of having purchased the book) is fairly loose.Sadly, Blink reads as though Gladwell had less time, and less inspiration, in its composition. I have no doubt he'll make up for this on his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiter, Oh Waiter!","review":"It's an interesting topic to ponder: how do we know things in an instant? In fact this topic has been pondered for millennia and studied extensively for the last fifty years. There are wonderful philosophical, religious, and scientific works on this topic. The knowledge and insights available are both broad and deep. This particular book, Blink, The Power of Thinking without Thinking, does not add anything new or insightful.While reading this book I felt as if I were at a business reception and found myself engaged in a one sided conversation with a nice fellow who went on way too long about how the mind works. My mind works. And what my mind told me was find a waiter, get another drink, and excuse myself. Never ending anecdotes, no matter how well intended, embellish a point, but do not prove it or provide a deeper understanding. That's the way Blink is. I cannot recommend it because it sheds no new light on an old subject and there are better works on the mind and cognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synopsis: Intuition Works","review":"Blink is worth the read, but only for the paper back price. It's very easy to follow and a quick page-turner. However, it's a bit shallow.Blink's basic premises is: intuition is real, it's been scientifically proven, and you too can learn to use it. Most people feel there is something more to the \\"gut feel\\" or the \\"intuition\\" a person has. This show's that's true. The proof's Gladwell outlines are fascinating but the point is made too many times. However, I was disappointed to finish the book and not learn anything about honing one's own Thin Slicing capabilities.Read Blink, but borrow it from a friend or buy the paperback used."},{"rating":"1","title":"anecdotes with an overlay of pseudo-analytical mumbo jumbo; basically, an incoherent book","review":"Virtually every supposedly analytical utterance is just an assertion with little logical basis. One could easily have interpreted the presented facts in any of a dozen other ways, drawing some other type of lesson. Basically, the author lays out dozens of anecdotes and then makes highly dubious remarks about decisions that were made. But it simply doesn't hang together in any coherent way. This is way, way over-hyped."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your looking to understand thought and intuition, look elsewhere","review":"Gladwell is an entertaining writer, I'll give him that. I did enjoy reading this book. However, it's not about the substance for him. He is basically reaching for something we all sorta kinda know about, but is not at all scientific or expository. The best book on doing without doing, thinking without thinking, intuition, the sense of self, self-knowledge, and the mecahnics behind all of this, is, by far, God Without Religion by Sankara Saranam. Not only does it deliver what readers likely expect from a book like Gladwell's, but it does in the context of world-shaking issues. If you want to know what thought is, not to mention supermental knowledge, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink and this book is gone","review":"It amazes me what makes a bestseller. With enough marketing dollars and big name, this book was predetermined a bestseller even before it hit the bookshelves. Notice how the covers on bestselling books like this one is already printed with - millions sold- on the first day. A bestseller even before the cover was printed and a book sold? Without the hype, this would not even catch the eye of the public. Poorly written, nothing original on business.

If they are trained in what to look for and are intimately familiar with the details, then it should come as no surprise.What is MISSING is any advice, hints or other information to help the average \\"Joe\\" learn to put those abilities to work in the real world.Don't waste your time.

A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLUNK","review":"Perhaps it is simply ironic that so many pages are devoted to explaining something that happens instantaneously, yet still manages to miss the target.

I have to accept this book is a compilation of good articles and everyday examples but a lot of what he explains is common sense.Blink is about trusting the instant impressions you get in the blink of an eye, but this is not necessarily true all the times. For example, how many of us have dislike someone we meet but after a while we become excellent friends?I think he is right in some things but his theory warns you against ovethinking, and that not always works.Like I said some of Gladwell's points are ambiguous.

Gladwell's research into an area completely removed from his own arena of expertise is detailed and thorough. He approaches the subject with enough humility and honest curiosity that the reader feels he is more along for the ride than being lectured from the podium as are most tomes on psychology and sociology. Especially noteworthy are his many references to specific studies and the occasional invitation to participate in a few prove to be...illuminating to say the least (I swore I wasn't bigoted, until...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Good book.Go with the gut. If you feel you should read it, read it.If you feel it isnt for you, you are probably right.That is pretty much the book's premise. Your first instinct is right.

If people headed their predictions, the countries divorce rate would be at like 10%. Imagine that!

You see, as Mr. Malcolm describes, you think right AS you see and NOT after. As you learn to apply these \\"rapid fire thought\\" techniques to your everyday life, you will be suprised.

I must confess that until now I didn't realize how much thin-slicing I do in my life fortunately most of it in a positive way and the few negative misuses are not significant, whew!Mr Gladwell carefully and simply elucidates the essence of thin slicing and when and how to apply it judiciousily. It really does make you question your dearly held preconceptions.I frind most touching chapters six and seven dealing with Diallo to be highly enlightening as well as saddening, as these scenarios will undoubtledly continue to be played out in major cities.Once again thanks a great and fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Trivial stories","review":"This book is a series of trivial little stores with vast conclusions drawn to fit the authors needs. In short, we often make decisions( quick or not). Some correct and some incorrect. I just can't express my disappointment with this book. I cannot find any conclusions in this book that are not contradicted later. This is not a self help or an improvement book, just stories how decisions affects our lives.

Very interesting if you like thinking about how people think or make decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but lacking a point","review":"Throughout the book, the author offers numerous examples of how people make snap judgments, and how some of these are harmful while others are more accurate than decisions made after over-analysis. Unfortunately, though, the author doesn't say much about how to distinguish the two. I think we all know that people make snap decisions and that some work out and some don't. Gladwell tells us little more than that. For a book like this, it would've been much more helpful if Gladwell could offer insights as to how and when people should use snap judgments rather than just offering examples of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"How long before you're opinion of this book is developed?","review":"Very intriguing book. Examines not what we typically call first impressions, but the first moment or so of that first impression. Provides numerous examples of how people's opinions are unconsciously formed in those first few seconds and how we should be aware of, and occasionally control those formations. The only real downside is the book occasionally lacks a cohesiveness. It is a collection of studies and events that the author attempts to pull together, and is somewhat tenuous at times. But, overall, I really enjoyed the read. One of the few books I've been able to sit down and really get into for hours on end. I wouldn't surprised if there are others out there who finished the book in just a few sittings as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the First Chapter, and even take that with a grain of salt","review":"If you read the first chapter of this book, you'll get the point he's trying to make.

A combination of first thoughts, wisdom, and experience brings us to the title \\"Blink\\". I have always enjoyed the reading on the whys and wherefores of actions of the human race.

All he does is provide shaky examples of what he want's to \\"prove\\" without giving any kind of nod to a counter example.

Blink is possible 2. It takes practice. That's it. I don't think I've learned a lot from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for psych students, terrible for the real world","review":"I read the entire book (nearly 300 pages) and not once does he tell you how to utilize/hone/refine/implement any of the thin-slicing skills that the book is about. It's just a collection of short stories to prove the point that thin-slicing is as effective as exhaustive scientific research. This would be an excellent book for an undergrad Intro to Psychology class, but for someone looking to learn how to apply those skills in the real world, it is awful. What makes it so bad is that he implies that readers are going to come away with some sense of how to utlize their thin-slicing skills. I am actually upset that I read this entire book. I wish I could get my Sunday back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than a glimpse.","review":"This book does nothing more than skims the surface on the subject of snap judgments and general psychology. Gladwell does nothing more than report on the subject matter, offering no depth, no analysis, no digging deeper into associated concepts to help the reader better understand the context and material in the book; not to mention that the more cognitive types will find it - quite literally - an empty read.Read it like a news story if you must, because in my opinion it's just one long-winded, repetitive news article.Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff.....","review":"An entire book that provides nothing more than a problem with no solution. How this book made it onto the front marketing tables at my bookstore, I have no idea other than Gladwell's hair. It's certainly not his propensity for choosing interesting topics.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it were over in one blink","review":"Starts off very interesting as if there was some grand scheme that was about to be revealed.

There isn't a lot new here but its a well told stringing together incidents resolved by intuition. But intuition is too lax a discription. What, Gladwell really reveals is how bits and pieces of our past exprience come instantly together, a processes suggestive of lens clouded with the detrius of missinformation, but one which still renders the outlines of fact in the blur and hurry of a needed decision. \\"Blink\\" will be new stuff to many but to those who have been around a whild it is nonetheless a refresher course how decisions are made, often under duress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malcolm in the Middle","review":"This is Malcolm Gladbag's follow up effort to, \\"The Power of Farting without Farting,\\" and Bruce Lee's \\"The Art of Fighting without Fighting.\\" I took the quiz at the end of the book and got an A+.

The Tipping Point was an interesting book, but in this boring and silly volume the author tries to analyze all sorts of topics without the credentials to do so. The reader is left with information that seems upsupported and in some cases outdated. Moreover, the book needs a good editor. Even some of the basics of English have been overlooked. For example, the author mixes a singular object with a plural subject in this sentence, \\"we need the ability to know our own mind.\\" There are a number of examples of this throughout the book and it made me think that the author and the editor rushed to get this book published. What a disservice to readers and what a shame. You know one would think if the author is so good at examining the mind, he would be as good at catching first-grade grammatical errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has a lot of useful tips.","review":"It puzzles me how some could not find any practical use for this information. It was pretty clear that snap thinking works, as long as you have fed your sub-conscious more complete data, and if you don't allow yourself to panic. I think it helps clarify what I have seen in successful decision-makers, both in business and the military. It is therefore no surprise that floor traders and professional soldiers can have a surprising amount of common ground.The book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I find the authors book to be very interesting. Thin slicing is something we all do everyday and do not realize it. I would recommend this book to everyone.The one suggestion I have would be to not go into so much detail with the examples provided.

But ultimately, it doesn't even end up proving or disproving any of the ideas on its jacket.Some people are good at trusting their instincts, and they end up right. Others are bad at trusting them. Other people's instincts themselves are untrustworthy. Other people don't trust their instincts. Some are right, some are wrong.It's the equivalent of snob candy--it feels like an intellectual book, but it really doesn't say much of anything. It just makes you feel smart for a few minutes, if that.I'd put money that no one will be talking about this book in two years. It's just the flavor of (last) month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but lacked a conclusion on what you can do","review":"Blind provided excellent examples of people making snap decisions -- when it works and when it doesn't. Based on that, you find things you can start or stop doing. For example, do you expect a leader to be a tall, thin man? Yet those qualities have nothing to do with leadership. Why do you let physical appearance drown out other information about the person? The book also gave examples of experts who are trained and have the vocabulary to verbalize what they sense. While the rest of us could only say we like or don't like something without being to explain why. Although we may be right, we don't give snap decisions credibility because we don't have facts to back it up (or the training/vocabulary to explain why). The only problem with this book was that it lacked a conclusion. It didn't provide steps on how you can \\"think without thinking.\\" You need to come to your own conclusions based on the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The point of the book was not that snap judgements are always correct. The author shows how more factors than just logic come into play when making decisions, and how if we rely soley on logic we can reach wrong conclusions.It was an easy read but very thought provoking. I liked this book much more than \\"Freakonomics\\" because the author is not using the book as a vehicle to impress the reader with how smart he is (although he clearly is, and is a good writer, but he lets his work speak for him)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin Slice this!","review":"Ok so at the end of the book you are given the full belief that what you work out in your mind in the first couple of seconds of any situation you are right and just go with your \\"gut\\" instinct.

How anyone can consider Gladwell a serious author or innovative thought leader needs to complete more detailed research in to his writing. Blink proves to be ample additional proof that in future generations, when school children are reviewing the work of early 21st century writers, Gladwell's work will be used as an example of what NOT to aspire to..."},{"rating":"1","title":"conclusions drawn without rigorous logic or lack of evidence","review":"Although many people does make decisions quickly and those decisions appear to come out of thin air, the author omit the fact that many of them may not want others to know why they make those decisions.

How things are advertised etc...I can see how it fits into the subject, about Thin slicing, but he got so far off subject that i was no longer able to hold an interest in the book and stopped about 3/4 the way through.The first half of the book talks about Thin slicing; the process in which your mind relates the information it is receiving to past events in order to gain an understanding of it. He gives numerous examples of this and it is rich in detail. Definately a good read until he gets off subject. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"My initial gut instinct said it was good, then i read it and it SUCKS!","review":"Here's some words that describe this lenghty and boring book - lenghty and boring to begin, not useful, too basic, did i mention boring? Oh yes i did. Outier is a way better read. Blink is useless garbage. So disappointed.Follow your gut or don't? That is the question. Dumb question, just use your brain.

But as I started the book, I could not put it down. Even while I was on vacation, I still had it in hand reading. Blink discusses the reasons why we do the things we do and it was very interesting. The writing was entertaining and easy to understand. Some may be skeptical about a book dealing with the economy, but this book deals with the pyschology behind it all. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal Ideas","review":"No wonder Michael Levine salivates whenever you mention this guys name. They both have the same approach to writing books. Take a bunch of ideas that are already out there and try to make it sound like they are your ideas. I believe that here in American we call that plagiarism.I would recommend this book to legal students looking for case studies in plagiarism, and if you really want to see plagiarism at its best then be sure to read Guerrilla PR by Michael Levine--it is STOLEN entirely from Jay Conrad Levinson's Guerrilla Publicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left confused.","review":"Blink, is predominately a collection of outcomes from previous research on unconscious thinking. In the first half of the book, the author tries to categorize rapid, unconsciousness decision making as an \\"instinct\\" that the human mind makes on its own. The second half of the book the author wonders off into a re-interpretation of unconscious thinking as something that is a product of extensive training and experience. The preface of the book is \\"The power of thinking without thinking\\". With the two different interpretations of unconscious thinking, I am not sure the thesis of the book was proven. For anyone with little education into the human mind, this could be a good primer on unconscious thinking, otherwise, leave it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"I found this book pretty shallow. I think the same message could have been communicated in a short essay or paragraph. 95% of the book is examples which simply dilute the basic message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book that dies after 70 pages!!!","review":"I bought this book all excited because various critics raved about it. I also love insights into human behavior. Was I ever disappointed? Mr Gladwell starts off well,his stories reporting seemingly unusual events are interesting and well written, his analysis highly flawed and his agenda pretty evident. I would suggest that Mr Gladwell stick to books telling amusing anecdotes , and leave the analysis of these anecdotes to psychologists because he doesn't have a clue. His conclusions on speed dating and the car salesman is stretching the truth so far that its quite amazing that a publisher would bother publishing this as anything other than fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously someone published this?????","review":"I have never written a review before but I owe it any unsuspecting reader out there to tell you.....DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY -- THIS BOOK IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!! Seriously someone published this guy? The book was a bunch of antidotes that didn't deserve the page space that they received. There was maybe a small nuance of a point but it was so minor that it wasn't really a point at all. This is highway robbery. I wish desperately I could get a refund.

The viewpoints could have been well delivered in a five-page magazine article.Sensible stuff:- Much information may be extracted from a brief encounter (for instance, the lab that fairly accurately predicts success in marriage from viewing the brief conversation of a couple)Stuff that isn't sensible to me:- More analysis can be inferior to less analysis (I consider one major example used simply unpersuasive: A team with fewer intelligence tools beat one with more sophisticated information gathering mechanism in the U.S. military war game)Stuff that seems obvious and doesn't need pages and pages to explain:- Through training, one's intuition could become more reliable for quick decision-making"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wondered how you knew something without even thinking about it?","review":"Have you ever wondered how you knew something without even thinking about it? Maybe you knew something was amiss or something was exactly how it should be. You might say \\"I have a feeling that this is...\\" but not be sure about where that feeling comes from. In Blink Malcolm Gladwell exposes some thinking behind this phenomenon. As with his previous book Tipping Point, Malcolm's writing is extremely readable and easy going. I \`get the feeling' from reading his words that I would like him. He is smart, observant and descriptive.I give this book 9 out of 10I loved the writing and the content kept my attention through most of the book. The pace is mostly good.To get a 10 I think there could have been some deeper probing into some of the ideas, by the end of the book I got frustrated with the repetition of some of the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the Tipping Point","review":"If you've read the Tipping Point, you might be disappointed by Blink.

Its more insightful then any other book I have read on a broad spectrum of ideas. Sending it to my son, the homicide detective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"Self-Help\\" book","review":"I've read many self-help books. I picked up this one espcially because I have \\"The Thinker\\" personality and it usually takes me time to take in data and decipher information before I make a decision. I can sum up the idea of \\"Blink\\" in a blink:When it comes to making a decision, often times, there's something inborn in us that (your gut) that can make the \\"right\\" decision for you in three seconds. So follow your gut! On the other hand, our guts are prejudice at times, and they can lead us to make the wrong decision. So be aware of prejudices you have before going with your gut.The book is filled with examples wherein people made wrong judgements in a blink, such as the electing of Warren Harding as US President, New Coke and Amadou Diallo. Although the books tells you that the right decision can easily come by you, it is short on HOW people can make the right decisions in a blink - and that's what's most disappointing of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use The Library","review":"I would recommend one borrow not purchase this book, and after the half-way point return it. I found the first half extremely interesting and captivating. The remainder loses the reader in a case with racial overtones and fails to establish a logical relationship with the first half. I read a comment by another that seemed apropos: describe a new method of building an office building by explaining briefly a new building method and what the building might look like when finished. And, then talk about some of the surrounding pavement, you'd have \\"Blink,\\" well--in a blink."},{"rating":"2","title":"a high recommendation on a book with the power of thinking","review":"Gladwell did surprise us with a lot of hard facts about how certain people possess the ability to \\"do the things right\\" without even thinking. An interesting read, but unfortunately lacks of a central belief in his book. After reading, you just have this difficulty to conclude the lesson learned here!It reminds me of another book, \\"From Lowbrow to Nobrow\\" (Peter Swirski, 2006) which is with an enjoyable writing style and a strong point to support the writer's keen observations and insights to fulfill your apetitie of learning. It clearly depicts the unique phenomenon of the popular culture of today. I personally highly recommend you to take a look at this book as it is a book of thinking power!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"tipping point was a much better book in my opinion. i enjoyed the diversity of the examples in the tipping point. blink caught my attention faster but towards the end, the ideas and examples began to get repetitive. Not a bad read though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book that I never read","review":"Alright, I did start it, but I could not finish it. It was that boring. Don't make a snap judgment though, you should read it for yourself and realize that anyone without a brain can get published these days. A former boss who liked to drink and employ the services of hookers gave our team this as a Christmas gift which were some of the many Blink judgments he made."},{"rating":"1","title":"The arguments in this book are so poor that they are funny","review":"For a book that has received so much acclaim, I'm surprised by the number of logic holes in Malcolm Gladwell's arguments. He is also very verbose and talks about many random things that are unrelated to the topic of the book. The arguments look like obvious attempts to make money by deceiving the general public. By far, one of the poorest books I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I am reading blink for the 2nd time now due to the enjoyment I had when I first read it. It is a very animated and easy to read book that basically highlights several examples of our adaptive unconscious mind and how it works and comes up with decisions. He also dwells on the concept of thin slicing which is the predicting patterns and behaviors/trends by zooming in on the slices of experiences that matter the most and coming up with a rather unsconscious decision from it.. I really love the book and highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it merely highlights how the process works but does not provide means and ways of improving our skills of the adaptive unsconciscous.. however the author points out to other works by authors like Paul Ekman and John Gotman and others that provide the next step..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gut feeling was right","review":"My gut feeling after reading a few pages was that I shouldn't waste my time by reading this book. I still did. My gut feeling was right - I found the book quite noninteresting and repetitive save for a few passages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blinking waste of time!","review":"The author feeds you some entertaining anecdotes about everyting from the fraud archelogical findings to cops in extreme circumstances to marketing research. Unfortunately, the point of the book is a very primitive one: sometimes we are right in our snap judgements and sometimes we are wrong. He even comes up with the a catchy new term: \\"thin slicing\\". In my opinon however, the only place where you can't go wrong with thin slicing is a deli. So, go spend your money on a nice sandwich and skip this book. If you must read it - get it from a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"My first intuition for this book was good (or what Gladwell would say \\"was my gut intuition\\"), but I failed. This book is boring, full of repetitive examples (some of them very interesting, specially the first chapters), but at the end you get nothing in conclusion. We all know that people with more experience on their fields can get a very accurate explanation to some phenomena with very little information, is this new? My gut intuition did not work for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth Thinking About","review":"When I saw 'The Power of Thinking Without Thinking' in the store, I instantly thought that it was just another shelf-stacker designed to fleece gullible readers and to secure for the author ten minutes of frivolous fame on the chat show circuit. But after skimming it, I thought it might offer positive insights into the all-too-human habit of immediate judgments. Having now read it, I will be forever grateful to Malcolm Gladwell for proving that my initial assessment, albeit hasty, had been right. Had I applied the power of thinking without thinking in the store, I would have saved myself $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was good for you??","review":"I do not understand why this book earned decent reviews. The people who gave this book 4-5 stars, are they real? or are they part of Marketing tricks nowadays. This book was the most naggingly-redundant book I've ever read, constantly repeating scenes and lessons like my mom would with her stories. I'm no expert, Im just the average Juan who wants a good read..and being average makes me wonder what is wrong with these \\"experts\\" giving it a thumbs up.

I didn't finish it, which I rarely don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of anecdotes in search of a theme","review":"Malcolm Gladwell has pulled together a series of nicely-told anecdotes about .... something. He doesn't put much effort into trying to explain what is going on, whether in fact anything interesting actually is going on, nor does he make a convincing case that the various examples he uses actually have anything in common. I couldn't see much connection among museum curators being able to recognize fake sculptures, psychologists predicting the strength of a couple's relationship based on watching a conversation, and a former Special Forces soldier using unconventional guerilla tactics to outwit the military establishment. Gladwell's journalistic background comes through in his easy writing style and lack of intellectual rigor. It's easy to read and easy to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink and You Might Miss the Science","review":"The book Blink is nothing more than a collection of anecdotes about snap judgements and decision making without thinking. The problem is that there is very little science or other supporting evidence to back up or explain the phenomena that are the subject of this book. The book is more pop science than a work of serious study.God forbid if more people think without thinking. We have enough of that as it is in business, government, and other areas where real thinking and leadership are required."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!!!","review":"I am sad to say how disappointed I was with Blink. After reading Tipping point I expected this book to be another phenomenal book, making the complex simple. Alas it did what Einstien warned us about \\"Make things as simple as possible and not any simpler.\\"This book tried to argue that we need to let go of the logical thought and analytical thinking in favor of gut feelings. \\"Think\\" by Michael LeGault is a rebuttal to this book and I think it is worth reading in conjunction with Blink. Why? because implications of pattern based thinking (whcih is how our brain processes information at the fundamental level) and what Blink argues for, is deeply powerful, yet is a fundamental imperative to use the carefully balanced approach in decision making that uses instinct and mixes it with analytical thinking. Without this balance our society can be regressing towards middle ages as opposed to advancing towards the next creative era of growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"You have got to be kidding!

I found it to be disjointed and lacking in real actionable or interesting information. We should study Gladwell in terms of how he has somehow managed to have an entire generation of savvy business leaders depend on what he says when his own real experience in leading a business is nil.In terms of marketing, and leadership I would recommend \\"Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word Of Mouth Marketing\\" - there's an amazing amount of actionable and easy to understand applicable ideas in terms of behavior, business, customers and making meaning instead of buzz.Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word-of-Mouth Marketing"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've reached my \\"tipping point\\" over Blink.","review":"One anecdotal story after another with a weak conclusion (which was yet another anecdotal story) attempting to tie it all up left me flat. Here's my summary: All you need to know is \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" well... unless you're an expert of some sort. In that case, you can trust your initial reaction, because you're probably right. Well... unless you've paid attention to the wrong things... in which case you are proabably wrong. So, Don't judge a book by its cover - ESPECIALLY THIS BOOK!!

Then my Amazon friend Conan wrote a rather lukewarm review and I delayed the purchase. Then I found the book on my daughter's shelf. Thanks to Conan for saving my money.I borrowed the book and read it. In a blink I thought it was as interesting as it had promised. It took me more than a blink to find out, that it does not deliver: you learn some interesting anecdotes about marriage predictions and about malpractice suits (my other Amazon friend Joe Neuschatz will be interested) and such things, but you never really get nearer to understanding what the alleged special rapid intelligence process really is.The book reminds me a bit of the style of articles in Der Spiegel: journalism well short of science.

Possibly the best Eyes this deadhead has ever heard starts off disc two, which also contains a nice Scarlet Begonias as well as Me & My Uncle, always a pleaser. Disc three has the real meat of the second highlighted show, though, with a full Weather Report Suite followed by an unnamed \\"Jam.\\" The rest of the disc is not quite as spectacular (although I must say I do enjoy that Goin' Down the Road quite a bit), but is good enough to call this the best $ I've ever spent on CDs.

The mesh pockets, though, are the pack's weakest point. They are made not of nylon, but of cheap plastic, which breaks over time, making them unusuable. The pockets are essential for storing wet suits, so once they're broken, the pack is useless to swimmers. My first pack had holes in the mesh pockets within a few months; I foolishly exchanged it for a second and now it too has holes in the mesh pocket.Furthermore, when the pack is full, the weight is poorly distributed and strains the middle back and shoulders.

In the late 80's / early 90's, no matter how bad a movie was, you could usually count on some great rock songs on the soundtrack.The soundtrack to Navy Seals is no exception. You get two exclusive songs from Mr. Big, both of which are fantastic, Bon Jovi covering the Thin Lizzy classic \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\", plus new material from ex-Foreigner mainman Lou Gramm. The rest of the album, despite featuring relatively unknown artists, is just as good. In particular, the tracks by Gowan and Lisa Hartman are great AOR songs.This is a must-have soundtrack for any fan of 80's rock. There are at least half a dozen tracks on this disc that you could point at and say \\"this was worth it for just this one song\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I bought this at a local store sight unseen. I ordered it special. I took it home & was very disappointed. I was expecting to hear the terrific bombastic score that was in the movie, but alas it was not there. I did get my terrific score though. It took a couple days & a very expensive music editor, but my computer & I snagged it right off the video, complete with sound effects. Sounds like a regular war zone. Sorry guys, you'll have to make your own (or someone might get upset with me). It would be nice though if someone would make a soundtrack from the score, cuz I would like to buy it! I only gave this one star cuz there wasn't a choice for zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Sandal Ever","review":"I am on my second pair of Shark Mephisto sandals now and plan on my next pair soon. They are the most comfortable sandal/shoe that I have ever worn and have never had any discomfort with them or problems. They have spoiled me for comfort. They also feel very secure on the foot and there is not adjustment period that comes with some sandals or shoes for how they wear on your feet. If I had only one form of foot wear to wear for the rest of my life, I would choose the Shark. I wear them nearly everyday, and the only time I do not wear them is on the beach when I go into the water. Why ruin them, even though you can wash them with a hose if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sandal I have ever owned","review":"I live in AZ. I wear them year round.

I have been looking for something more comfortable and durable since being diagnosed with a morton's neuroma in one foot. Anyway, I like the build and feel of these. They are solid and the sole is quite rugged. Comfort is OK and they do seem to be molding to my feet fairly well, but they are are a bit heavy and I still have to give my feet a break at times. I've had them just a couple of weeks now so hopefully I'll have more to add later.Update: After wearing them nearly every day for a summer I still can hardly see any wear on them. they last very well.

He writes with great style and displays a truly unique imagination. Pollen is definitely worth checking out, but, as other reviewers already stated, I feel it does drag on a bit long. One thing is for sure...this really isn't a Vurt part 2... and I applaud Noon for that. I like the fact that he writes from such a different perspective on the Vurt world. For those not familiar with Jeff Noon, I would recommend checking out Vurt first... not because you really need it for the plot of Pollen, but, because you might get a better introduction to some of the going ons with the feathers and all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing sequel to a great book.","review":"What a disappointment! I loved Vurt, especially in the Books-On-Tape reading, and I was looking forward to learning more mysteries of the Vurt. This book revealed very little that was new and abandoned its hip-slang narrative voice that made Vurt such a pleasure, in favor of narration by a middle-aged Shadow-cop with little sense of humor. When I finished reading Vurt, it seemed like Jeff Noon's inventiveness was boundless. After finishing Pollen, I felt his imagination had been exhausted long before the book ended. Too bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rational Vurt","review":"This is absolutely one of my top 10 books, a much more thought out Vurt, but with the same vivid style.

It started out fast paced and addicting just like Vurt and kept that way for more then half the book, but for the end sequence it just didnt get me like vurt did. I really did enjoy this book i just wish Noon would have ended it sooner and didnt drag it on the way he did. Still a great book and i recomend it highly just because Noon is an amazing writer and it is worth reading just to see his words leap off the page and swim in your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Disjointed for Me","review":"Noon is a well-known English sci-fi writer, and his wild imagaination is on full display in this surreal blend of cyberpunk, science-fiction, drug haze, surrealism, and Greek myth. Unfortunately, it came across as a little too much of too many things to keep me involved. In a Manchester of the future, the barriers between the real world and the dream or \\"vurt\\" world start to break down as an insidious pollen begins to reduce almost everyone to sneezing, sniffling wrecks. It all gets far too phantasmagorical for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I, unlike most readers of this book, I suppose, did not read the prequel, Vurt. I was suckered in by the comparisons to Gibson. I must confess I was sorely disappointed. There were interesting characters, and a fairly interesting plot, but as a whole the book just shouted, look at this cool idea I have for a story, see, SEE. The writing certainly was not as tight as Gibson's, and I really had trouble caring what happened to the characters. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different can be good.","review":"This book goes in a very different direction from its prequel, Vurt; although Vurt was a high-speed page-turner, and is still one of my very favorite books, Pollen may be higher in intellectual content. The references to the John Barleycorn story are quite fascinating, and we get a knew perspective on the Manchester of Noon's imagination with its zombie-filled hinterlands, and the trucks of Vaz that cross the wilderness.I also love Noon's prose. In Pollen, he abandons the hipster sing-song of Vurt in favor of more flowing, sensuous lines, and unforgettable imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"the book arived fast and is in excellent condition. im very happy with this buy.the store is trust worth as i see it and i would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and complete, perhaps too much so.","review":"The book is superbly researched and seems to include every scrap of autogiro history from the beginning right up through the ultra-lights of the present day. Each period is given it's due and no enthusiast will be disappointed by the coverage of his or her special interest. Excellent bibliography and further reading suggestions as well.Having said that, reading the book from cover to cover is slow going. And the interweaved tales of various autogiro developments in various times and locales makes some sections almost unreadable. For example you'll be reading about some invention progressing from 1926 to 1939 and then be abruptly jerked back to 1927 to start the next thread of development. When this happens 4 or 5 times in two or three pages you loose all sense of what happened when. But I'm not sure how you'd fix that except to edit out some of the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"Thank you for writing this book, as I am a great-great-great grandaughter of Thomas Egan.

I don't think my sense of humor is THAT much different from most people. I didn't think the movie was predictable or boring. The situations were funny, the bosses were over-the-top in a good way. There was action and shock value. All the actors were great.The only thing I can think of that would be a legitimate reason to not like Horrible Bosses is perhaps the less-than-plausible storyline/circumstances. The three guys had so many opportunities to be caught due to their inexperience or some would say stupidity. Who owns a huge house and does not have an alarm system? The likelihood of no one being home during every \\"surveillance mission\\" is slim. Announcing in public that they're looking for a hitman? \\"Luck\\" had a lot to do with the success of these guys.

The premise is that three guys have jobs where their bosses suck. One thinks everyone should be there for 14+ hours a day, another wants to only make money off of the company his father started and another one is threatening to tell his wife he slept with her until he does. All these guys should quit, right? No, it's not that simple. Without giving anything away, they are stuck in these jobs. So what should a guy do? Kill his boss. That's right, eliminate the problem and the job gets better. Imagine the three whitest guys you know walking into an all black biker bar, and this is how their hair brained idea begins.

This is just swearing and sexual innuendo for the sake of shock and laughs, although there's no humor to be derived from this joke of a film. Got 2 stars because Jennifer looks absolutely stunning.

It is a total turn off. Thus, tens of thousands of people will not see this movie because of the language.

Kevin Spacey is great, too, as the ogre boss, as is the third guy who plays the coked out son who inherits his saintly dad's business and proceeds to wreck it. However, the main plot, involving the usual three stooges who decide to kill their bosses, is quite lame and not even worth watching. It's a shame because they had a good premise here. If they had just sustained the title theme throughout, this could have been a winner. As it is, it's just another unfunny comedy with the usual three boobs running amok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crass humor, not what I expected","review":"Watched the preview, heard others rave about it, then decided to watch it.

But ... the plot was mediocre and the humor died out halfway through the film. Also, what the hell is up with Jason Sudeikis? How is he cast as this ladies man ... and one in real life!? I mean Mad Men's January Jones and House's Olivia Wilde!?!?! Seriously!?!?! The guy looks like a used car salesman! I don't get how he would be cast in a role like this.

If you have got to see it on your bucket list, at least rent it for .99 and then pee on it, throw it away and save the rest of the country. Yep. And oh, drink plenty of Maddog 20/20 while kicking your own ass for unfolding any kind of dollar and sticking it in a red box. Anyway, watch the film more as a National Geographic \\"WTF happened to filmmaking\\" and perhaps maybe those who are dreaming the dream MAY just get a clue on what not to aspire to when you grow up.

Obviously it always comes down to personal preference, but how could ANYONE find this amusing????It's unoriginal, relentlessly rude, and most importantly, NO ONE in the movie is remotely likeable. And I still don't get Jennifer Aniston. She is not much of an actress, and she's pretty much the same in everything she does. Finally, I have a problemwith movies that take every opportunity to hurl a disgusting p[hrase or epithet at the audience as a substitute for genuine wit. Richard Pryor was as profane as all get-out, but he was FUNNY. Excessive references to sex organs and sex acts bear noresult except numbness.

I just cancelled my preorder of Green-Lantern because of this digital issue and my have to start cancelling more. This will, in the end, cost suppliers money because no one wants to stream movies on the go...that only works if you have WIFI and that isn't everywhere. This seems like the same deal with Netflixs and we all know how that turns out. At a time were people are watching what they spend, to start this kind of crap is again terrible.

Anniston look rough nearly naked as if she had stopped working out just to play the old lady harasser unless she has gone down hill more since her previous flick with Adam Sandler. Then again, it is difficult to picture her as a whore type when she has played mostly wholesome characters in the past.

Maybe ok to rent, but would never want to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny enough.","review":"Three friends come together and decide to eliminate their respective work supervisors, whom they all hate, for different reasons. This is another in a long line of modern-day comedies containing coarse language throughout, which does have its place (see Superbad), but at times is used to replace good comedy. In this case, the problem I have with the film is that it just isn't as funny as it should be. The movie has a strong cast, and they almost make it work. The movie does have its moments, but when the outtakes during the closing credits are funnier than the movie you just watched, you know that it was not all that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo","review":"I love the people in the movie, sadly the only time I laughed was when a cat jumped on a persons shoulder and scared them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideously moronic","review":"Grown-up guys acting like horny 6th graders, dumb ones at that.

But, honestly, I could not make it through more than about 40 minutes of the movie --and at that point I was really pushing my patience, hoping it would get better. While the premise has potential for comedy, the humorous moments were few. Mostly, it was a painful, joyless experience watching the characters struggle for freedom from their horrible bosses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty funny","review":"People have different types of comedy they find humorous.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO MUCH POTENTIAL HERE BUT NO DICE","review":"Yes, there was so much potential here but no dice. What an awesome cast they got together and they let it all sink down to a mediocre film at best. The biggest problem was that a good chunk of the humor just wasn't that funny. In fact, the gags running at the end were funnier than half of the humor attempts in the actual film. Tale focuses on three male friends who are under the thumb of horrible bosses and come up with the idea to have them all murdered.In the end it doesn't turn out as expected but they all get their revenge and yeah most of us saw it coming this way.Yawn and lawl. Good soundtrack. It cost $37M to make and yielded over $200M at the Box Office. This is one of those rare moments when I agree with the critics over the masses.

I was very excited to see Colin and Jennifer in it and they made me give the movie another star so their work was good... But overall the movie sucked. I give it a chance and it failed horribley.

Also Kevin Spacey and Jamie Fox were HYSTERICAL- actually, Everyone in this movie cracked me up. CLASSIC. Funny Funny movie, haven't laughed this hard since Hangover (the first one of course.)

That was until I actually watched it.The best part of the movie was about the last 7 minutes, which included the outtakes. I'm not at all a prude, but vulgar language and innuendo, simply for the sake of so-called comedy, was a gigantic failure and a complete bore. For the first time of years of DVD-watching, this was the first time I had to check the time remaining, to see how much more of this was left to endure.That's 98 minutes of my life I'll never get back, and even though it was only 99 cents, I still feel like I'm entitled to a refund, based on extreme disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misses Being Great due to Bateman","review":"This movie could've, would've, and should've been just as good as \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" but the writing and directing fell just short of bringing this in on that level. The overall problem is that Jason Bateman's character was too flat and unemotive throughout the whole movie. The other actors and actresses brought home performances that I could buy into, but Bateman seemed to be reprising his 'Arrested Development' schtick here, but he needed to be more out there for this movie to work.Aniston and Spacey are terrific, and there are moments of high hilarity to be found.

It was a really bad remake of Office Space to my opinion. It was to obvious that they were really horrible, but at the same time I felt no sympathy whatsoever for the working guys. They were just a group of lonely men with no future, nothing to like about then. I just didn't felt they deserve better bosses that the one they got, I think they have what they deserved.

I would not watch this again or recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY DIGITAL COPY VERSION IF YOU WANT TO VIEW ON IPAD","review":"Got my copy today and am really upset. No support for itunes, have to stream it over wifi, using the flixster app, that has crashed several times on me. I will no longer be buying digital copies that are ultraviolet. The only reason I paid the extra money was to be able to watch on my IPAD...If you own apple products and want to use the digital copy on apple products it will not work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Horrible movie!","review":"This movie is hilarious! Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Ferrell play bad guys tremendously! Plus Jennifer Aniston is super hot as a bad girl! The lead guys, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudekis, do a great job in keeping you rolling in the aisle! A great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEVER laughed so hard!","review":"I don't write reviews. I have never laughed so much. This is falling out of your chair funny. BAD SANTA may have come close. Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx stole the show for me. I know you don't know me... but trust me, SEE THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"digital copy is terrible","review":"Dvd/bluray works flawless but do not buy this for the digital copy unless you want to sign up for 3 accounts and still not have a format that can be put on your ipod. Ultra violet is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Comedy Includes Great Writing And Acting.","review":"In 2011 Hangover 2 was on track to be the most talked about R Rated Comedy. That held true until the release of, \\"Horrible Bosses\\". As a life long fan of Jennifer Aniston, I already knew I was in for a treat. The fine acting of Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as well as the smart writing left me entertained and satisfied. All of the work that went into the production of this film is top notch. It is hard to say too much about this movie without giving anything away. I will say, be prepared for one of the funniest films you will see. It is too bad that the Academy of Motion Pictures does not have a category for Best Film in a Comedy because this little gem would definitely be the one to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Movie - Hate Ultraviolet","review":"Quick review of the movie - my wife and I loved it, absolutely hillarious!We bought this addition because the packaging clearly says Digital Copy. A digital copy it is not! You can stream it to a computer, iPhone, etc. after a laborious process, but you have to have WIFI or cell coverage. So much for watching a movie on the plane!As this was the first Ultraviolet movie we purchased, I consider it false advertising. At least more recent releases now display Ultraviolet instead of Digital Copy on the top bar of the packaging. A type of packaging I will avoid from now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIGITAL COPY SUCKS A**","review":"If I pay for something, give it to me. Don't make me share my purchase with Facebook, or keep asking me to enter in my credit card information in order for me to watch me. Put it in iTunes, and leave me ALONE!!! Never have I had such a terrible experience. I will never buy another Flixster digital copy movie. I hope that at least one person learns from my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish it","review":"I was so bored with it about half way through I just gave up. The characters and situations were too over the top for me to care about, and not in a funny way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously dropped the ball(s)","review":"This one had SOOOO much potential - great premise, great cast and could have been really cathartic for the thousands of us who have worked for borderline sociopaths. The Kevin Spacey character is a retread of his character from \\"Swimming with Sharks\\", a far better dark comedy with a similar plot-line, and comes closest to being successful. The Colin Ferrel character is relatable, but they really missed the potential for some great, crass humor, going instead for a few fat jokes and the like. The Jennifer Anniston character is an absolute cop-out, though. There is great potential in exploring the tough female boss, who overcompensates for her perceived shortcomings or for inherent sexism by being TOO aggressive (I've worked for a PRIME example), but instead they go for the fantasy character of the sexy nympho boss. This plotline is completely unbelievable and ridiculous. What could have been an excellently dark cathartic comedy ends up being unforgivably lazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Region or Wrong Planet ?","review":"I purchased the \\" Fritz the Cat \\" DVD set without first reading the customer reviews .

And it was great to see that this old school piece of nostalgia was available for purchase on a DVD format. But as for the play-ability of these movies, it was nothing short of a huge letdown. I attempted to play these DVD's on a standard player, my Xbox 360, and a PS2. All came up with the same error. Regional restriction. After carefully looking at the case I found that the website for the publisher was www.arrowfilms.co.uk. Now after talking to some friends i found out i actually need a DVD player from the UK in order to watch these movies. Even though the info on this page under regions says: All Regions. So just a warning, if you live in america these DVD's will not play on your standard player."},{"rating":"1","title":"The version is wrong","review":"The version delivered was for European machines, therefore we could not watch it.

Also the sound output level is barely sufficient for watching DVDs (it is not uncommon to turn the volume all the way up when watching a movie). Other than that the unit looks great, especially with the tall speaker stands, the bezel is very attractive, and the remote is quite nice looking too, except for the large battery compartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Namey, It Breaky","review":"POS Panasonic.Anything on this thing that could break, has,-display, power supply, DVD drawer motor, now the LED laser to read the discs has failed. I've been buying used systems from Ebay to keep this thing going. Luckily(maybe not so lucky?)I have the skills to repair it.I'd venture to guess that all Panasonic stuff in this price range is junk, it's made like crap on the inside.I paid $400 new for this thing from Best Buy (probably not a best buy either)which is a lot of money for me. An additional $200 would have bought an equivalent Sony at that time. Panasonic used to make decent stuff, not any more.Should have bought the Sony.Now that it is junk I could set it on fire in the fire ring in my yard to torch it, but it probably won't even do that well.Buy Sony and save yourself some grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best","review":"Dar's latest CD is \\"My Better Self.\\" It's a bit of a disappointment. The best song is \\"Teen for God,\\" which is a typical upbeat, funny, catchy song. The rest is kinda depressing. I hope her next album has more upbeat songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good stuff, right up there with Mortal City","review":"As I already said this Dar release is right on par with Mortal City. Although there will probbaly never be another \\"February\\", \\"The Ocean\\" or \\"Iowa\\" this record has some great songs of its own. The opening \\"Teen for God\\" is a biting satire against the hypocrisy of the Religious Right. The sad \\"I'll Miss You Till I Meet You\\" channels the best shades of Sarah McLachlan. The gentle \\"Echoes\\", \\"The Hudson\\" and \\"You Rise and Meet the Day\\" are definitely worth a listen. Certainly not to be missed is the excellent cover of the Pink Floyd song \\"Comfortably Numb\\" which Dar manages to put her unique spin on while still keeping it recognizable unlike a lot of covers these days. You should definitely buy this if you are a Dar fan. If you aren't you will probably still like it but I would suggest you start with Out There Live, since it offers a good overview of her career up to Before the Rain. Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a tad bit dissapointed.","review":"I LOVE Dar. I've been only listening to her for a year or so, and I got Mortal City and The Honesty Room a while ago. I decided to pick up My Better Self, just to see one of her newer albums, and it wasn't as good as I hoped. Maybe I was just wanting it to be more like the others, but this cd didn't seem to have as much spirit in the singing, it blended together more and did not seem to have as much of Dar's quirkyness in it as well as her deeper side. It was still pretty good (I mean, it is Dar) but still not as much the the other cds I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Dar","review":"I too am hugely fond of her music, but in my view this isn't one of Dar Williams' better efforts.It just doesn't have the original and lyrical music we've come to expect, great music like \\"The Christians and the Pagans,\\" \\"End of the Summer,\\" \\"Spring Street,\\" etc. The final track--a live version of \\"And a God Descended\\" from \\"The Green World\\"--only painfully emphasizes how tepid the preceding music is.That she covers two songs--\\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\"--suggests that her songbook wasn't exactly brimming this time out. I don't get including the music of Pink Floyd, as vapid and unoriginal a group as ever there was. (Ok, ok, I heard her say in concert that she chose \\"Comfortably Numb\\" in reaction to last year's re-election of You Know Who, but the selection is still too much of a stretch.) Covering Frank Zappa's work, perhaps \\"I'm the Slime,\\" would have been just as apropos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone with that beautiful voice","review":"Dar's songwriting talent continues to expand, entertain and move. \\"So Close to My Heart\\" is so beautiful, it's reason enough to acquire the album. Her covers are a fitting tribute to the originals, with their depth and engaging sound. I think \\"Echoes\\" could be a hit if Dar would seek to promote it. As a loyal fan of Dar with all her CDs, I rank this one at or near the top, in the running with \\"Mortal City\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Dar's best.","review":"From top to bottom this is a very solid CD and deserves a spot up there with \\"Mortal City\\" and her other best material. I liked the duet cover of \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" The highlight for me on this disc though is the lead off song \\"Teen for God.\\"If you like Dar's music this will not dissappoint, if you are new to her...this might be a good launch point for you because of the album's pop-oriented sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album yet","review":"I've been a longtime Dar fan, and this album hits the spot. Her venture into covers of other artists' songs paid off completely, those prove to be some of my favorite songs on the album. Also the album is (to me) edgier than her more recent albums, and that's both refreshing and timely. The only \\"miss\\" on the album, which is otherwise one hit after another, is \\"The Hudson,\\" which falls flat both musically and thematically, but it is so outshined by the other tours de force here that this absolutely deserves 5 starts. This is a great first album for a Dar-Williams-fan-to-be, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - lot of back ground noise","review":"I got DVDs on Nov 21 2012 directly from Amazon.
