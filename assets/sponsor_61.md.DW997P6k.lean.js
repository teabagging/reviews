The 3D effects were laughable and I still don't know why they even bothered with the *3D* label. The only *bright* spot was Sid Haig and even with him, it was still dreadful. The storyline was awful (I know, I know, how many different ways can one do a zombie movie?), the 3D effects were awful, the entire movie was unbelievably awful. Do not waste your money or your time on this and coming from me, that's saying a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"I really enjoyed this movie way more than the boring original. Sig Haig is great, the rest of the cast was just ok. It could have definitely used some gore, but it was still entertaining without.

I would recommend this to any zombie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"3D in the movie is awesome!","review":"I really liked this movie for the 3D effects.

Don't take it too seriously and DO NOT compare it to the original. The original is a classic and this is NOT that! If you can get past that, this just simply is a fun zombie film. I'm glad it wasn't a direct remake (that was already done surprisingly well in the 90's) and this takes a bit of a humorous turn with a pothead family. The zombie FX is excellent but the gore isn't that strong (save a few shots.) I was reminded alot of those zombie films from the 80 (particularly Return of the Living Dead). If you don't mind cheese with your zombie film, then check this out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sid Haig deserves better","review":"If you know absolutely nothing about this flick, let it be known now that Night of the Living Dead 3-D has nothing in common whatsoever with George Romero's all time classic of the same name. This is not the classic zombie movie that started it all in 3-D (you can more than likely figure that out just by looking at the cover of the DVD case), but rather an ultra low-budget, terrible zombie movie that just so happens to bear the same name. Cult actor favorite Sid \\"Captain Spaulding\\" Haig stars here, and he certainly deserves better than having to be in this. The zombie makeup is horrid, there is virtually no blood to be found, and the film as a whole just comes off as one big joke that no one is laughing at. It isn't even so bad it's funny either, it's just plain awful. The fact that it's in 3-D may coax some cackles, but even the 3-D glasses are just plain lame.

It is not a copy, but that is good!I had seen this before and not thought a whole lot about it (a few years ago). Now, re watching it I find that it is not too bad, actually much better than I remembered. I even ordered the 3D version on DVD. Near the end it reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (intentional? I don't know).

This is what happens when no-talent opportunist hacks who have no love or respect for the genre attempt to cash in on a classic which happens to be in the public domain. You see, it didn't cost them anything to steal the name or plot from Night of the Living Dead, and they knew it would be a marketable title, so they really didn't need to invest any time or effort in to making the actual film.

Alpha Male is not a book for the gentle-hearted, as its suggested motivations for a weightlifting partner include yelling phrases such as \\"Worthless must have been on sale, it appears you stocked up!\\" (and that's one of the more tame examples).

The only problem I have come across with this textbook is that you have to go back and forth quite a bit to cross-reference.

As a first published novel I marveled at his use of language, visualizing and framing a scene, as when the bodies of Mary-Ann and her daughters were found, and making the shelter in the snow, or the encounter with the whale on the Inland Sea, the way he had his characters use language to distract, to persuade, to seduce; his acknowledgement of the influence of women in pivotal events, and to the discomfort of Western sensibilities, the acceptance of fate and predetermined destiny.

The writing was not that good, the plot was wacky, and the characters were poorly developed. All this might be forgiveable for someone in a college-level creative writing class, but a book by a major publisher? Well, that's just incredible! It really made me wonder how publisher's decide who gets published. It also made me question the wisdom of their editors and review boards. However, I will be more discerning next time. I won't be take in by the marketing hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Writing","review":"I struggled to get through this apparently strange spin-off of Clavell's novel, \\"Gai-Jin\\". The author cobbled together some bizarre plot elements, but he fails to connect the dots. Plus his prose is awful. He definitely needs a good editor. The story takes place in Japan in 1860, and spans a little over a year. I could believe the missionary, but the gunfighter was preposterous. The characters were in general cardboard caricatures. The author seemed to concentrate more on bloody action than character development. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eagerly anticipated, greatly disappointed.","review":"As a student of Japanese culture and history, I was eagerly turned to the first page of Cloud of Sparrows and was hooked. However, as the story progressed, I grew increasingly frustrated. The author (clever use of the name \\"Genji\\") had ample opportunity to develop the characters, but concentrated, instead, on detailing the battle scenes. The characters were two-dimensional and left me feeling deprived and disappointed. His descriptions of the countryside, however, were enticing, and I look forward to another visit to Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharper than a samurai sword.","review":"This story is one of the best I have ever read.The story takes place around 1800's a Daimyo named Genji meets a small band of missonaries have come to spread the word of God.

I recommend this book for those who have a liking for Japanese history."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Shogun","review":"It's hard for me to imagine anyone other than a Delacorte marketing executive comparing Cloud of Sparrows to Shogun. While Cloud of Sparrows has a decent plot, the writing is fairly bland, the characters shallow, and the dialogue forced.

On the other hand, I've read Shogun twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great great!!!","review":"great story line and great action. Good humour too. Seems so real.

Personally, I feel like I was rip-offed by Random House. I've lived in Japan and studied Japanese culture, so I think I know what I'm talking about. Once you get past the bad writing, the weird characters, and the strange plot, what really hits you, if you know anything about Japan, is how false both historically and culturally this novel really is. The author may be Japanese, but he knows little about mid-19th century Japan, and even less about the late Tokugawa cultural landscape. For the life of me, I can't imagine how this novel ever got published. There had to be a bribe or pay-off somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Unbelievable","review":"I couldn't believe a major publisher actually published this book. The writing was bad, and I mean very bad. I could not finish the book. In addition to bad writing, \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" suffers from a completely unbelievable plot. An American gunfighter in 19th Century Japan?! A mentally ill Japanese warlord? Improbable shifting alliances among samurai? I don't think so. The book was also too blood-thirsty. Why have the principal character wipe out a whole Japanese town, including women and children, to avenge one errant transgressor? This book was morally troubling trash. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stereotypical and bloody","review":"I forced myself to read it, and I don't think the book's that good. Here are some of the problems: prose is difficult to read, not straightforward; too many Japanese and western stereotypes; too bloody (why massacre a whole village of Eta? Samurai were honorable, not genocidal);historically inaccurate (era of wild west gunfighters was 1880s, not 1860); and there were just too many preposterous contrived plot devices (for example, Genji is psychic and sees the future). It seems the author had a good story buried in there somewhere. It's just too bad he had to hide it under all the b.s. and gore. Also, I'd expect much more honesty and a plot with a moral center from a former buddhist monk. Not this hyped garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clavell Rip-Off","review":"I read this book after Gai-Jin by James Clavell. It appears to be a rip-off of that novel. Plus the writing is worse, the plot is asinine, and it's way too gory for most people's tastes. Clavell was the master of this genre. No one else even comes close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Rate Pablum","review":"After buying this novel, I read to page 124 then tossed it in the trash where it belongs. \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" has no bearing or relevance on Japanese culture or history. All it is a gross caricature of samurai violence. But what I found most disturbing was that a major publisher was taken in. Well, I think I might try my hand at this game. I know nothing about the history of Russia, but I think I'll change my name to a Russian one, write an historical action adventure set in Russia and submit it to Random House. Heck, they'll publish it, just because I'll use a Russian last name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathological","review":"I was deeply repelled by this work. On the surface, it appeared to be a Clavell clone. However, once I got past the first thirty pages, I realized that it was written by a sadistic psychopath...just one bload-soaked scene after another with no rhyme or reason for most of the bloodshed. At least Clavell's violence had purpose. Additionally, the book is historically inaccurate. However, since our culture is so dumbed-down few will notice that; but most will notice the unending gore. Was Matsuoka off his meds when he wrote this garbage? I wonder. Even more disturbing was that a major publisher actually printed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant and savage","review":"This blood-soaked attempt at historical fiction stopped me cold in my tracks. Only a psychotic sociopath could enjoy this work. But what truly amazes me is that it somehow slipped past the screening process of one of the major publishers. How did that happen? Whoever was responsible should be taken to task. I wouldn't even recommend this book to Charles Manson. What a loser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly gruesome and disgusting!","review":"I enjoyed Shogun and Gai-Jin by Clavell, so I thought I'd give \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" a try. I have never been so disappointed in a novel in my life. The plot seems to be a mere convenience for hundreds of pages of bloodshed and gore. Sadists will enjoy this book. Normal people will be repelled. Don't be fooled into buying this unmitigated trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subarashii !!!","review":"A great read. I couldn't put it down. If you're at all interested in Japanese culture, you will enjoy this book. The description was wonderful and set many very atmospheric scenes. The characters are well developed and the plot develops in an easy to follow and intrigueing way. While it may not be 100% historically accurate, it is after all fiction. If you want total accuracy go read a Japanese history textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I can't really put my finger on why I liked this book so much. There are, of course the obvious things, great writing, fascinating setting, interesting story, plus and an interesting view of a countries unique history and culture. There is something sad and bitter about our hero, and his companions. One thing that is utterly refreshing about this book is that I never knew what to expect. In lesser hands this would have been a goofy exercise in boring fantasy/adventure themes and set pieces. Not Cloud of Sparrows though, not at all. There is geniune surprise in this novel.I recomend this book wholeheartedly. It is a unique departure into fantasy, with action, intrigue, suspense and character. Also, let us not forget, really exemplary writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, not even worth a more detailed review","review":"I cannot believe how bad this book was! It is poorly written, and the characters are so... uninteresting. I could not care less about them; the story, and the protagonists, simply failed to engage me, at any level. I read more than 100- 150 fiction books a year, and I know I cannot expect to find, even if I am lucky, more than 20 or perhaps 25% outstanding novels in that pile. Many other books are good and adequate, and may provide an interesting, even excellent, read. I know some books are not going to be so good, and that a few are not going to be worth the time needed to read them. This one, unfortunately, is at the very bottom of the undesirable pile, or at the far (bad) end of the tail of the statistical distribution. Save yourself a big disappointment--never mind the money! Life is too short to waste it reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non stop bloodletting","review":"I am a great fan of historical fiction set in Japan and China, and have read many excellent books of that type. This one is a disappointment. It is one violent scene after another, with a body count that must be measured in the thousands. The \\"heroes\\" -- to use the term loosely -- are all coldhearted murderers. One's culture doesn't change that fact. Are we to admire them? Like them? Understand them? I could not, and therefore was left with reading about people who merely went from one bloody scene to another.The book is sadly lacking in real insights into the Japanese culture of that age -- there is far more depth to it than mere barbaric Samurai blood thirst. If the author's intention was to show us how horrid Japan was at that time, he succeeded. But if the book had been written by a Westerner, the author would have been called a racist for such a one-sided depiction of Japanese culture and life.All in all, not a book I can recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I wanted to like this first novel by T. Matsuoka. Unfortunately, I couldn't. The writing was bad, the plot was strange, and the characters were like wooden japanese puppets. The hype surrounding this new novel did not deliver. I wondered to myself if Random House invested in a pig in a poke, and then realizing that it had went all out to get people to read it. But the truth is in the sales. As I write this review, Cloud of Sparrows is somewhere in the high forty thousand range on Amazon. That says a lot about the quality of the book. I'm sorry for Mr. Matsuoka, but he needs to do better...much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and a difficult read","review":"I fell for the marketing hype and bought this new novel. I didn't think I was going to get another \\"Shogun\\", but I did think I would be getting a good read. Instead the book turned out to be very difficult to read...definitely not a page turner.The editor spent too much time trying to make the prose avant garde by adding all kinds of literary devices. Instead of the desired effect, it just tires the reader. The plot also had too many baroque elements to it. The idea of a Western gunfighter in Japan was laughable and totally absurd. Also, it was kind of silly to make Genji somehow clairvoyant. I honestly don't see how this book ever got published by Delacorte Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as \\"Gai-Jin\\"","review":"Very disappointing. Clavell was the master of this genre, and no one else even comes close to the depth of his characterizations, subtleties of plot, and elegant prose. \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" seems to be a knock-off of \\"Gai-Jin\\" by Clavell. They're both set in the same time period, and the plots have many similarities. However, \\"Gai-Jin\\" was far and away a much better book. In particular \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" has several fatal flaws: the writing is very poor (where was the author's editor?), the plot is completely ridiculous (a Texas gunfighter running around in 19th Century Japan trying to hunt down an enemy who has somehow become a buddhist monk?!), and the characterizations are extremely weak. When I finally finished the book (and it was no page-turner), I realized that I didn't give a damn about any of the characters. Matsuoka needs to take a course in creative writing; and Delacorte Press needs to do a much better job of editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-researched at all","review":"The thing I liked about Shogun and Clavell's other works was the detailed research effort that went into each novel. I'm afraid Matsuoka doesn't deliver on the same level. He basically co-opts Clavell's Gai-Jin plot and then tries to overlay a real 17th Century Japanese historical event, the pivotal Battle of Sekigihara, onto the late Tokugawa landscape. I'm afraid it doesn't work for me or anyone else who knows history, since the samurai were almost gone by the time of the late Tokugawa shogunate. The same can be said for Stark, the American gunfighter who comes to Japan to hunt down a ruthless American desperado, hiding out as a buddhist monk no less! Ha! Ha! Excuse me, but I just have to laugh at this improbable nonsense. Add to that, Lord Genji's strange psychic abilities and you've got the makings of a good soap opera, or anime movie, but not an historical action adventure. The other reviewers said it best: James Clavell remains the undisputed master of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are other ways to love your children","review":"I was searching for a good bike for my child.

In fact, I'd hardly call it a rock album at all. Rather, it is more a pure AOR album. Forget about big guitar hooks and catchy choruses, Belief is a far more laid back, atmospheric album full of well-crafted songs, compelling lyrics, and a warm vocal delivery. In short, it's a thing of beauty.Whatever the band's roots may be, Dare is closer to post-Fish Marillion or perhaps Crowded House on this album. In fact, Belief reminds me a great deal of Marillion'sThis Strange Engine, and even rivals that album for sheer beauty.If you want to rock, you'll probably want to skip this album in favor of one of Dare's earlier works.

Yes, she is a hottie. However, she is far better in POISON IVY 2 (the weakest of the Ivy trilogy). Of course, as a story, EMBRACE OF THE VAMPIRE is a swirling toilet-yacht. This is an imbecilic romance novel (w/ extra cheeeeze) disguised as a vampire story. The love-sick vampire is a lame, whimpy dink of a fella. I especially enjoyed his pouty face and Wal-mart manicure! Oh, how I longed for his impalement! Alyssa herself is gorgeous, and does have one decent, semi-exciting scene w/ a wanton photographer of the female persuasion. The rest is pure, languid hell! If you want sizzle in your vampire epics, I recommend HABIT for pure animalistic sensuality... P.S.- Jennifer Tilly (Bound) is in EotV for about 5 minutes, and manages to be more alluring in her fully-clothed role than anything else in the movie! Just the sound of her voice reduces me to her potential slave! Has it suddenly gotten hot in here? Whew..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the Nude Scenes are Weak","review":"Even Alyssa Milano flashing her silicone filled breasts, nice as they are and as cute as she is, cannot turn this into a movie worth watching. This movie is mindless in the writing, disjointed in the directing, and weakly superficial in the acting. What you get here is 130 minutes or so of boring nonsense interspaced with a few segments that total about 5 minutes of Alyssa Milano showing her breasts. Unless you are a male that is also a committed Alyssa Milano fan, you should just pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not for the plot","review":"This movie showcases the exquisite body of Alyssa Milano in the most erotic ways. The seduction scene with Alyssa and the photographer is without a doubt WORTH the price of the movie by itself. However, the plot is practically non-existant. Other than the nudity, the only thing I recall about the flick is a vampire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alyssa Milano nude is the only good thing this film offers.","review":"Alyssa Milano stars as a college girl being seduced by a vampire who has to have sex with her to survive, or something like that. Silly erotic thriller has a story that makes no sense, has no suspense and no scares. The only entertainment value it offers is a nude Alyssa Milano. That means about 10 minutes of sex/nudity (Admittedly, the lesbian scene between Milano and Charlotte Lewis is steamy, if not a little too short), 80 minutes trying to set all these scenes up, not a very good bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alyssa","review":"This so called movie is only and excuse for alyssa Milano to take her shirt off. And what an excuse it is. Her being nude for about half of the movie makes it even worth while to watch for those who like soft-core porn movies. That is why I gave it a 4 star rating"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have been much better.","review":"I was very annoyed with a lot of parts. I am a huge vampire movie fan and this one was almost an insult. That Dracula was kind of gay. The dreams she had I did enjoy. I almost felt like giving the movie away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Alyssa's lack of clothing maybe the only redeeming feature of this film. I love vampire flicks, which was my second reason for buying this. But i was sad to find out that there isn't a good story behind it. Martin Kemp (Spandau Ballet/Eastenders) give a strained performance , but with such a bad script who can blame him. If you like the supernatural and Alyssa, watch \\"Charmed\\", she may keep her clothes on but at least you won't wear out the fast forward on your remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH YOUR TIME","review":"Please don't watch this film. I mean, I tried to give it a chance. I was hoping for a good vampire movie, but I accidentally picked up a video that was more of a \\"how-to\\" for bad acting. Alyssa Milano really hit rockbottom with this. And the dude who played her wannabe vampire lover was a joke. The plot made no sense. Please don't watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why else would you want to watch.","review":"This film is for Alyssa Milano fans only. There's no story, there's no acting, there's no creativity,...there's nothing. There is Miss Milano nude though, and if you're into seeing pretty girls looking barely 18 engaging in lesbian sex, then I guess this one is for you, because if there wasn't a fast forward button on any DVD remote, nobody, and I do mean NOBODY would ever finish this made for after hours cable-TV turkey.Oh, I gave it four stars because I like to look at 18 year old lesbian sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST horrible movie ever!","review":"With all the extended cuts of movies out there, when are they gonna make a 15 minute revised version of this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY NOTHING - except Milano skin!","review":"The only redeeming (? ) value of this waste of tape is the over abundant topless scenes of Alyssa Milano.

My copy will arrive in the mail in 3-5 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget soft porn","review":"Despite this movie's title, it's not even close to being a horror flick. This is a very low budget made-for-cable style soft porn with a rather random vampire element thrown in to make it seem more legit. The main reason for movie was made was to show Alyssa Milano nakkid.The acting and casting are terrible. Alyssa doesn't do too badly, but doesn't really have all that many lines. She's mostly expected to look like she's enjoying the erotic scenes, then look confused in all of the other scenes. The best scene in the movie is Milano's encounter with the photographer.There's a lot of cheesy, annoying voiceover by the vampire to substitute for plot, story and character development. His acting is the worst in the movie.Overall, the only reason to see this movie is to see Milano nude. Other than that, there is nothing else compelling about this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing","review":"Noteworthy only for Milano's willingness to shed clothes, make out with another woman, and feign torture. This looks and plays like a cable-produced cheapo attempt to lure viewers who want to see Milano's new and improved breasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth Watching","review":"I haven't seen many vampire movies, but I can tell that this is a bad one. It is filled with nudity scenes for no reason.The film could easily finish in half an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"embracing alyssa","review":"bought it to check her out, and she did show most of the goodies but other than that the show bombed not worth watching other than the occasional moment that martin kemp could have made her scream i'am a bad girl..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alyssa Milano in her best \\"role\\" yet","review":"You know and I know it, the only reason to rent, buy, or watch this movie is Alyssa Alyssa Alyssa.

Thriller? no. Lots of nudity? Yes.","review":"Look, if you come to this movie looking for a great story and very high quality acting, I am not sure how you got here. I have given this film 2 stars just for Alyssa Milano, who looks incredibly suculant. To make it worse, they advertise this film as a horror and I think I remember 2 dying throughout the entire film. The only, and I do mean ONLY, reason to see this film is for Alyssa's nude scenes, and her sort of lesbian scene with a photographer. The rest of the film leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virginal co-ed is focus of lost vampire love.","review":"A rather uninspired vampire film with plenty of external anatomy thown in to keep the viewer awake. Mostly lacking in action, the movie follows the contrived descent of an innocent college girl into the clutches of a would-be vampire lover. Milano fans will love it - vampire fans will mostly yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for Alyssa...","review":"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. But, wait a minute...

I came across this film while flicking through the tv guide one night, being a fan of Alyssa Milano, i thought that a vampire Milano movie couldnt be too bad, and probably quite interesting. HAH this may aswell be an Alyssa Milano porn movie. All of the films appeal is in the fact that Alyssa is nude in multiple scenes in the movie. The storyline is weak and the character that the film is based on (the vampire) doesnt even have a name! The special effects are also piss weak. I can see why so many men have given the film positive reviews but really..............cmon. Having said that I am still a Milano fan, but hope she can devote her talents to something better then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"none","review":"i did not see this movie yet but what is the different between the (r) and(NR). please let me know??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifyingly Horrible!","review":"TRUST ME! Save yourself 2 precious hours of your life that you will NEVER get back and curse yourself for wasting time on this erotic flick. First off we all buy it for the same reason so props to that, Milano looks great however this movie couldn't be worse. The vampire is the polar opposite of sexy and his wal-mart press on's took more attention from the viewer than necessary. He bit into the victims like he was eating snails. Delicious it was NOT. I'm sorry if you're going to be bitten and seduced make it hot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Five star reviewers, I hate to say....got this one wrong.","review":"It was very unfortunate that this movie did not work out as I love vampire love stories.Unlike other reviewers, I, a female, still think Alyssa Milano is more than just eye candy...in some of her movies; however, she must have been cutting her teeth with this film (pardon the pun). Her acting is mechanical and, yes, those fake [...] and very toned body does not suggest purity or innocence. I'm sorry, I know it is just a movie, but we like movies when they are convincing; that way the audience can connect with the characters to make the experience more real.This film is just a cut above cheesy. It has the caliber of a Lifetime movie: Worth watching if you like late night made-for-tv movies....or if you like to watch good-looking people getting naked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as any random episode of \\"Charmed.\\"","review":"Despite its cult reputation owing to Alyssa Milano's frequent nude scenes, \\"Embrace of the Vampire\\" is unfortunately not as satisfying as any random episode of \\"Charmed.\\" And don't rent this expecting to see Jennifer Tilley, who has only a tiny five-minute cameo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry product.

The movie was average at best, and the same can be said for almost all the songs on this soundtrack CD. It's one of the worst selections of songs ever released by the legendary singer, and the whole album has a depressing feel to it. The songs all resemble the poorest songs from the Elvis movies of the same era. Finding a few good songs is almost a chore. \\"Roving Gambler\\" is a fairly good song and good performance by Jim, and \\"Could I Be Falling in Love\\" is pretty good, too, but by and large, all the other songs are forgettable. It's not worth the purchase to anyone but those who own everything else by the singer and want to complete their collection with bottom-of-the barrel material.

I'd only recently become familiar with him (through a local music magazine) and was absolutely stunned by the power of his singing and song-writing skills. Mr. Clarke's family is from Ireland, but this is not traditional Irish music. In the best story-telling tradition, Terry Clarke paints verbal pictures of longing and loss that are heart-breaking in their beauty. This cd is paradoxically sad and uplifting. Families separated by the Atlantic Ocean, reminiscences of his parents from a simpler time, reluctantly leaving Ireland for a hopefully better future, the love of a good woman are all themes that, coupled with hauntingly beautiful melodies and spare instrumentation, make this an unforgettable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible --;","review":"I watched cuz I liked Ekin and Louis.. and man.. what a mistake!The whole film seems as if it happened inside a computer.Confusing, too graphic, and too obvious that it's computer graphics.. --;Don't watch it... but if you have to, just borrow it from any Chinese video store."},{"rating":"1","title":"80% of the movie is computer graphics.","review":"If you like animated action movies, you might like this one.

So much is said about the \\"ground breaking\\" special effects, but I felt like I was watching a Saturday morning cartoon. On paper, this movie should've been great.

Better fight scenes, better humor, colorful-well-played characters, and a plot that makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godhead HK Fantasy/Martial Arts.","review":"This is a very important HK film; its the first to impliment computer effects (SGI's LightWave Im told) for one thing, and yet the movie does not rely on them to any degree.. the battle scenes are as epic on occasion as the plot itself; an excursion into heroes, war, the world of martial arts, and even love.Its simply one of the finest period piece, fantasy/martial arts movies ever made, and is frequently cited as an influence even today.In a world being torn apart by fueding among the schools that compose the loosely defined (but ever present in the genre) 'World of Martial Arts', a young man seeks the aid of a great and mysterious master, to end the fueding and ultimately to save the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"An outdated firework by Hong Kong's most eclectic film-maker","review":"Seminal in 1983 for its amalgamation of special effects, wire-work, and kung-fu, now \\"Zu\\" looks like an antique whose wrinkles are glaringly obvious next to today's wire-fu/fantasy films (\\"Crouching Tiger,\\" \\"Storm Riders\\"). Hark, like his contemporary Western counterpart Spielberg, ranges from the sublime to the subterranean, and \\"Zu\\" falls just short of his worst attempts (i.e. \\"The Master,\\" \\"Once Upon in China 3\\"). However, Hark's visual palette with vast array of vibrant colors create a few striking tableaus that make \\"Zu\\" moderately interesting. But in the end, the lack of kung-fu and an engaging story leads to a big superfluous mound of color and chaos, which will only please the most diehard Hark or Hong Kong fan.

This CD contains material from the first 3 CDs - maybe more, I haven't compared track listings. The first time I saw Masada they were still coming to grips with the material; this recording proves their mastery of it.

Story is just blah - not the fun chick lit I was expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"i thought botox diaries was funny at times you feel like you know lucy and jess. i am 25 and didnt relate to the charcters as being in there 40's i thought they were funny. it was a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable, But Bad","review":"The Nannie Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada, The Ivy Chronicles... The Botox Diaries joins a long list of chick lit with the theme \\"aren't rich people crazy and amusing?\\" The twist is that this novel focuses on a forty something women.Unfortunately, The Botox Diaries brings nothing new to the table. The novel is poorly plotted, completely lacking in cohesion. Did the authors outline the plot beforehand, or did they just make it up as they went along?The main character is not nearly as funny or charming as she's supposed to be, and the main character's best friend is downright unlikeable. Nobody would be best friends with someone who doesn't listen to your problems, is completely self centered, and puts you in compromising positions.The hot French ex-husband of the main character speaks tenth grade French throughout the novel. This is really a minor point, but it bothered me.The ending is insulting to the reader's intelligence.Skip this book and spend your money on something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Frowning-- not enough Botox","review":"Forty-somethings with homes, children, husbands, jobs-- but yet, one is unable to stand up to cheating her pea-brain \\"best friend\\" and the pea brain is too busy satisfying her shallow needs to notice. You'd think that when a grown woman, mother, and wife turns 40, she'd have some backbone, but this book is too busy being \\"cute\\" and dropping New York-brand names to get a spine. I'm amazed that a so-called \\"friend\\" would play the beard to her cheating buddy. That's just gross. Wait a minute-- Jess (or is it Terri Hatcher of Desperate Housewives?) marries, divorces, adopts a kid (??), and is doing her ex-husband after 10-years-plus-one hour? Wow- what a role model.Yuk. This book turned me off-- and I'm a liberal from California.I was hoping that with women aged 40+ I'd escape the teen-chick-lit genre and find a bit more depth. Wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tiresome dialog","review":"It took two people to write this book? I was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but this book really was a waste of my time. You can see the ending a mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. It was the writing. The main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in an overly quippy, aren't-I-clever with my snappy dialog way. Nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). Real people just don't talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. By the way, my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. I won't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"I have never offered one of these reader reviews but disliked this book so much (not hated--but strongly disliked) that I felt compelled to do so. It is so terribly predictable and flashy in all the wrong ways. Wow a single Mom with an adopted daughter who meets celebs/gets wooed by a very rich frenchman/is allowed to borrow a Chanel dress from the showroom in NY/gets bought Tiffany earrings on a whim/goes on a TV dating show and somehow never has her daughter around at just the right moments is almost insulting to read (read: so totally unbelievable)... this is chick lit at its worst. It seems contrived and very intentional in all the wrong ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Botox Diaries","review":"It's a cute story ... it just felt like the authors were trying TOO hard to be funny. Nice summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh.","review":"But this book frustrated me to no end. The thing I hated the most was the annoying dichotomy--on the one hand \\"being rich is so uber awesome and it makes me more awesome than you\\", but on the other hand \\"being rich is not really more awesome than being a girl who is not that rich and is happy in her Gucci-less lifestyle.\\" I feel as though the writers constantly show the reader the luxuriousness of wealth, and then apologize as not to offend the reader in case she is poor. I'm a lowly schoolteacher by choice, but I still enjoy reading about the good life. No need to try to protect my feelings. The writers tried too hard to give the book a conscience, and in the end it failed.There were bright spots here and there and I did manage to finish the book (I'm not quitter). But all in all, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Botox Diaries","review":"This book is lighthearted, predictable, and I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a good beach read. It was fun, indulgant, and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"Considering I actually finished this book I was generous to give it 2 stars. I found the book to be dull and I could not connect with the main characters. I could not relate to the characters because they did not allow you to. The characters are somewhat thrown at you with no real background story to them. I noticed that the authors jumped from scenario to scenario as well without a real flow. I only finished it since I wanted to see if it ended how I predicted (and it did). If your looking for a good summer read this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing beach read","review":"The reviews on this one seem to be quite polarized. Of course, I notice many of the 5-star reviews seem to be from the 'professional' reviewers...I was very disappointed in this book. The pace was so un-even and the character development was thin at best. I really wanted to like it, but I felt it was more of an exercise in Westchester brand-name dropping than good fiction. Maybe it's just me but I don't enjoy reading about any character who doesn't have the moral fiber to stand up to a friend who is destroying her life for no good reason. Aren't we supposed to glean something from our pleasure reading? The only thing I got from this book was a non-stop ride through cliche-town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fast Read","review":"A very enjoyable and fast read. The lead character is quite likeable, despite too many attempts to make her every thought funny. The writing and comedy is not as good as Pearson's I Don't Know How She Does It, but much better than many \\"chic-lit\\" books which have emerged lately. Wonderful for a few stolen hours of simple pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Cliche!","review":"I usually only feel compelled to write reviews for books that move me. Well, this one certainly did--to the bathroom to THROW UP! This insultingly unintelligent book is chock-full of every cliche known to man (or should I say woman). From leg-humping dogs to French dreamboats, The Botox Diaries is about as cleverly written as a fart joke. As an avid reader, I try to finish a book even if I don't like it. Well, there is an exception to every rule! What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"easy read","review":"Rather weak predictable plot. Easy summer reading for mindless entertainment. Go for beach or poolside entertainment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I found this book to be a catchy title, sloppily written with many cliches. Could be a good bus read, but the advertisements may be more inventive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This took 2 people to write???","review":"What a silly, moronic book! I was looking forward to a snappy, contemporary read, featuring women closer to my own age for a change, but instead found a couple of clueless women who define the word \\"DUH\\"-- they act more like teenagers.Here's a couple of little gems from this sloppy book: at a ridiculous \\"sex ed\\" class featuring masterbation for 11 year-olds, Jess (supposedly the level-headed one) contemplates her own child's sex life, and concludes with \\"The best I can do is teach her my values, light a candle and pray.\\" (page 206)Followed by a sordid tryst with her long-lost cheating ex-husband: \\"We barely make it off the elevator and into his suite before our clothes are off.\\" (page 218)Neither of the main characters have values, and it's just so shallow, and meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad!...Just BAD....","review":"I think the great reviews are the authors' friends, parent, editors...etc. This book is so dumb and boring it's unbelievable that anyone over 16 would be entertained by it. It is NOT \\"funny\\", or \\"sexy\\" or \\"fresh\\". It is contrived and cliche-riddled and dull as dirt. Also, the writing has a strange aged quality to it. I am pushing 40 and so are my friends, but the women in this book sound like our moms (60+). No hip woman in NYC EVER wears panty hose! EVER. And only dated old fuddy-duddies say \\"Blue Jeans\\". Those are just a couple of eye-rolling offenses I could remember as I forgot most of this forgettable drivel the second I put it down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harmless fun","review":"If you've put your mind in cold storage for the summer, this is the book for you. It appears to have been written from an outline of cliches. The writing is pleasant despite the trite characters and marginal yet predictable plot. A good beach book. Don't read it if your mind is engaged at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Ok, I read like 60 pages and then gave up. I felt the characters were dull and not developed enough. And the affair that Lucy was having was just annoying. And I couldn't care about Jess's ex husband and her seeing him again. Maybe their next book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries way too hard....","review":"My overall impression of the book is that the authors are trying WAY too hard to be funny. Literally, every other sentence is some sort of joke and it's annoying as can be! Other reviewers have commented on this and say that it takes away from the plot line. Honestly, the plot line is as weak as the authors' poor attempt at humor.I really had to force myself to complete the book because I refused to give up on something so unintelligent that it took virtually no thinking to read.If the book would have skipped its continual attempt of humor, I may be able to recommend it, but then, it would probably only be 10-pages. Don't get me wrong, I love books that make me laugh, and I do have a sense of humor, but this was an insult to those with a sense of humor.I give this book two stars instead of only one, because a few of the characters are somewhat charming. Unfortunately, each one is stereotypical so this is only surface level charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up and Down and All Around...2.5 Stars","review":"The Botox Diaries sets out to be chick lit for the mature women and ends up reading like you're a mouse in a maze and just wish you could find the cheese. I SO wanted to love this book but ended up just thinking it was ok. The storyline jumped around too much for my taste. I like sarcasm and dry wit as much as the next person but the authors laid it on too thick, it was like reading a nonstop Seinfeld episode. You also have to really pay attention to the qotation marks because you don't know if Jess is speaking to someone or just having the sarcastic conversations in her head.After all that said there are some genuinely good and funny parts in the book but most of it is forced. The authors prove that's two heads aren't always better than one. If this book would have toned down on all the sarcasm and kept a steady story line it could have been great. I say borrow this book from the library and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, but predictable","review":"I think the title says it all. It's a light summer beach read that doesn't require much concentration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paralyzingly Pathetic! Botox for the Brain.","review":"By far the most impressive thing about this book is that these women were able to get it published. Aside from nepotism or cashing in favors owed, I can't imagine how it got into print. The constant, futile attempts at humor more than cancel out any plot interest that might be present. I finished it just because I was disgusted that I actually spent money on this useless drivel. In addition, I found it impossible to believe that two people could agree on this hopeless manuscript. Can't remember a more disappointing book in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Baz Luhrmann's version!","review":"This version of Romeo and Juliet is awful. The lyrics to the songs are awful, the way the \\"star-crossed lovers\\" find each other and automatically begin to dance provocatively on each other is ridiculous. The idea that two young people of different races liking each other would start a full on race war is unrealistic. If you're looking to watch something ridiculously hilarious, this is it. If you're looking for something that does Shakespeare justice, put your money toward Baz Luhrmann's version and watch Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes show you how it's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 year old loves it !","review":"My daughter is a huge fan of the chipmunks !

The chipmunks teach some good lessons to the kids without making it to obvious. Also each DVD has other great episodes from the show. A good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Muti's Beethoven, especially the Seventh","review":"After three decades of Muti recordings and hering him on one occasion in Carnegie Hall, I came away unimpressed. His career high on CDs began in the Seventies when Muti made scads of recordings on EMI with the Philadelphia Orch. he inherited from Ormandy. This coupling of the Beethoven Seventh and Eighth finds the orchestra in great shape, and the recorded sound is warm, clear, and detailed. Both supply strong support for Muti's surprisingly powerful readings.This is particularly true of the Seventh, which emerges with great spirit and vigor. It's not as prpulsively intense as Carlos Kleiber's or as epic as Karajan's 1963 recording, but Muti comes closer than Dohnanyi on Decca. One gets the feeling of a large-scale, lush orchestra playing with grandeur but not pomposity. I am somewhat less fond of Muti's Eighth, wishing for more lightness and fleetness, but it is admirable on its own terms. In all, this is the best Beethoven I have heard form him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jigmastas got me detectin perfection with their album Infectious","review":"Man oh man. I just got this album.

This book does not cover anything that you don't already know if you are on the MCSE track. It seemed to be more written for someone that is just taking this exam... and hasn't studied anything for the other 6 exams in the MCSE track.

Gordons awesome tenor power, but I would like to mention that Bud Powell is not really at his best anymore on this record. His very reason of moving to paris were his mental problems and problems with narcotics. From mid-fifties onwards he was never quite the same as in 49-50, wich I consider his best years. Untill his death in -66 his playing was at times just plain terrible. On special occasions, like this recording for example, he seemed to cheer up a bit and could at times give us short glimpses of the genius he once was, but other times... The reason I'm making such an issue out of this is that had he been at his best, this record would truely stand out as a landmark. However on this record he was unable to play like he once did.

He says Christianity is dying but the cureis his brand of liberal nothing in the bible is really true theology. strange but the churches that are dying proclaim his thoughts continualy to fewer and fewer parishioners. on the other hand the churches who preach a literal resurrection literally are growing.Spong takes great pains to share his integrity and honesty. how is it he can be so outspoken a proponent of the teachings of the uniterian church while wearing the mantle of an episcopalian bishop. did he forget the vows he took at his ordination.Spong esentially takes a Unitarian theology wraps it in the mantle of a Christian bishop and gets rich selling books and making speaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual from Sprong","review":"Once you begin to discredit the Gospels and become your own authority what you get is Sprong.

Something that was repeated several times over 132 pages. If this book wasn't being discussed at church it would be headed to the local used book emporium. He also discusses the accepted gospels as being writen by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John even though it is known that the earliest copies of these works do not credit authorship, which I feel compromises Spong's scholarship.I have just started \\"Jesus, Interrupted\\" by Bart Ehrman, which I purchased at the same time more or less on impulse and I alread find it a more easy of a read.

It was well written and I learned something from it, mostly concerning the new approach to the power behind the life of Jesus.It takes Bishop Spong some time to develop his theory but he eventually gets there by taking the myths out of the Gospel stories in a most logical and respectful way, by tracing back toward the Hebrew roots of the stories and festivals chosen to reflect the events described in the book.The power of the life of Christ has the power to change lives and that power can be recognized in any interfaith dialogue.This is a book about the Jesus who is behind the Jesus created by the traditional churches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bishop Spong Does It Again","review":"Bishop Spong has dealt with most of the issues in this newest book in previous works. However, he has brought together in one volume the work of his lifetime, and done so in a concise and clearly understood fashion. While traditional Christians will look with disfavor on his positions, he speaks with honesty and with relevance, making of Christianity a force that can change our society for good. I have followed Bishop Spong for years, having devoured all of his precious writings and his weekly essays. I eagerly awaited the publication of Jesus for the Non-Religious, and have not been disappointed. He encapusates my own pilgrimage of faith precisely and enables me to put into focus my beliefs and practice of the way of Jesus of Nazareth. I understand that he anticipates one more book to be completed in the future. I will look forward to that one eagerly.

Welch is joined by several Danish musicians here, and they provide him with great support.

This compilation compiles new pieces like \\"Haymakers\\" and \\"Midwife\\" with some classical reworkings of some his solo Love Songs to Linda. \\"Junk\\", \\"My Love\\", \\"Warm and Beautiful\\" and \\"Golden Earth Girl\\" are all instantly recognizable, but are still given a fresh new treatment. Like Sir Paul said himself, the new rocking \\"Run Devil Run\\" is for Saturday night, while \\"Working Classical\\" is for Sunday morning. This package is highly recommonded even for thos who aren't considered fans of the classical genre! P.S.

Note please that George Gershwin PLAYED these himself. I see no basis for comparison with the Paul McCartney pop song arrangements included here whatsoever. In other words, it is quite beside the point that these string quartet arrangements are anything but \\"endlessly inventive\\".

A lot of bands seem to have that problem not being able to top their first major label release. The good side about this album is there is a lot of catchy radio friendly songs. What I really miss from this CD is Kevin screaming. There is only about one song where he rages out. Other then that this is a really good CD if you like his soft singing voice and you are looking for some catchy songs that after a few listens will stick in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"If its not broken...don't fix it!","review":"Truer words never spoken. Trust Co gives us thier second major label release and it does not dissapoint. IF you looking for something breakthrough or edgy, stop reading.The Alabama quartet sticks to its roots, w/ raspy vocals, chunky and twiney guitars, and tribal-ish drumming. The only new thing is that Fukai (guitarist) added a couple pedals in his set. The heavy, muted bass is there, the quiet to blasting aspect still lives, and they still hate ex girlfriends.A great release album, and its like 6.99 at Bestbuy and Circuit City this week.

When the CD came out I was suprised that I liked it more than the first. By far the best songs are \\"The War is Over\\", \\"Slave\\", and \\"Retina\\". It is a great CD and I encourage everyone to go and buy it. You certainly won't get tired of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid follow-up to Lonely Position","review":"I bought this CD hoping for something like \\"The Lonely Position of Neutral, Part 2\\" and wasn't disappointed at all. As many people have said here, it sounds very similar to their first album, which in my opinion is a great thing. TrustCompany has a sound that is very distinctively theirs, and they aren't afraid to show their softer side (\\"Silently\\", \\"Without a Trace\\"), which is just as powerful if not more so than their aggresive side. Anyone who liked \\"Lonely Position\\" should check out True Parallels as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sophmore release","review":"The new Trust Company cd is a very solid release. Although I like Lonely Position of Nuetral a little bit better, True Parallels is still a great cd. The songs are more fast paced, and there is a little bit less screaming. My favorite tracks are: War is Over, Surfacing, Fold, and Erased. There is so much intensity in this album, and every song is good. There is even an acoustic track on here (Without a Trace)! TrustCompany did a great job with this cd and i think it can easily do better that LPON. Definitely pick it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I am not writing this one star review to bash the band, but almost every review says if you liked the last album you will like this one. I loved the first album, but just can't get into this one at all. I've been listening to it for almost a month, and it just isn't doing it for me. The songs are much poppier, a lot less heavy, and very repetitive. Surprisingly, even though the songs seem poppier, they do not have the catchy hooks of the first album. None of these songs stand out, and I don't see myself listening to this album for years as I have done with their debut. All I can say is buy their debut (the Lonely Position of Neutral) but don't assume that you will like this one if you like the debut.

Yeah, it's repetative, but they're repeating something good. I mean the first album was excellent, so even though a lot of songs have a similar melody, it sounds fresh. So in a sense, you are listening to the old album, but it does sound fresh all over again. I think if you buy it used like 4$ as I did, it will be well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like trust company","review":"this album is good if you are a fan of the band or like \\"stronger\\". that being said every song sounds the same. they could have just wrote one 45 minute song and had better results, because then it would have at least been something epic. if you like the last album you'll like this one, but if not don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I Could Give it More!!!","review":"WOW!!!

I was a fan of these guys for awhile but I just got bored with them, and then I heard there finally coming out with a new cd so i said ok it might be good, but i was terribly wrong theres only 4 good songs on this cd. And it sounds like they are moving into the EMO category which I HATE WITH A PASSION. Well maybe there 3rd cd might be much better but until now stay away from this awful cd.

The seller was honest, and set a low, fair price. I had a positive experience with this product. I found the collection of these four poems by Eliot to be quite intruiging, though a bit elusive.

Following Grandson Richard, 39, they board the Concorde.What somewhat surprised me with Wings is that it's not only the conclusion to a tremendous adventure: the story really gets a level deeper, as the relationship between the nomes and the Thing develops. And don't worry, you still get those hilarious puns such as the one about frogs who have \\"such a tiny life cycle it still had trainer wheels on it\\"!The Bromeliad trilogy is a gripping story, extremely funny and easy to read, but it's also a story about how the world around you can always amaze you if you only look a bit further than just at your direct neighbourhood.

Each year, the orphanage would hold nurmous concerts where adolescent girls would play violin behind a curiously shaded curtain.Op. 8 not only remains one of Vivaldi's greatest masterpiece, but is reflective of the mastro de' concerti at his most musical and creative stage. To play such a passionate, flawless piece of music as Perlman did is, to say the least, insufficient. Perlman's techique and intonation are flawless, but behind that there is nothing else. Tempos drag (especially in the presto movement of Summer), and the dynamics are forced (listen to Winter's 1st movement). Perlamn renders this great piece of music to mere finger exercises, and does diservice to such a great piece of music.

Therefore I decided to give this book only one star because ultimately I felt really deflated and disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a \\"Zombie Epic\\" for our times...","review":"A great book from somebody who really knows how to merge the gore and excitement of a horror thriller with the hard research and verisimilitude of a Clancy-type \\"techno-thriler\\". A gripping read from start to finish -- and I was particularly engrossed by the story of Gary, the guy who accidentally turns himself into a zombie and retains his human intelligence... and becomes a threat to all life on Earth. It's great to read something (to paraphrase Otto from The Simpsons) \\"from the zombie's point of view!\\" Seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"Considering the average rating for this book, I was surprised by how bad it was. I'm a big fan of the zombie genre in general, but I wouldn't classify this as a zombie book. Sure, it's chock-full of zombies, but the \\"magical\\" element to it makes me think of it more along the lines of \\"fantasy adventure\\".The narrative style varies widely throughout the book and is confusing at times. The author certainly did lots of research into the background elements of the story, but there is often too much detail about trivial facets. One of the main characters is constantly whining about being afraid or repulsed by the zombies. It gets old fast.The premise of the book sounded appealing to me, but I have to say that it fell short in almost every other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that brought me back to zombie fiction","review":"David Wellington's Monster Island first came to my attention as an online chapter project. I waited patiently for each installment. This book single-handedly convinced me that zombies could be as much fun to read about as they were to watch. The story is fast paced and has several unique twists and tweaks to the genre making it a fresh addition. If you have not yet read this book, it is a must for ANY zombie fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good for the genre...","review":"First off I'm not going to say anything that's going to give anything away about this book as that I loath about the average review. All I'm going to say is the first half of the book I LOVED and than it got a little out of hand, and then it got even MORE out of hand and totally ridiculous to the point where I could barely read it to the end. These last years I've been reading a lot of zombie genre so I've read some really great stuff but mostly terrible as that's on average what's available in my opinion, but I'm addicted, but I must say though Monster Island starts off a promising read it ends up falling under the category of mostly terrible. :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid read","review":"Above average zombie read. A different take on a well worn genre. Not usual virus gone wild story. Nice start to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Another bad zombie book in a long line of bad zombie books. The idea was fine, but the writing was dreadful. Hollow characters compounded by a complete lack of style. The author needs to take a few writing classes and work on sentence structure, grammar, and punctuation. I really wish more decent writers would get into the zombie genre. By the way, I would still have bought the book after reading my review since my zombie addiction is so severe. Just thought I would throw that in."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure theres better \\"end of the world\\" zombie books out there","review":"I bought this book after reading \\"I am Legend\\" and after compiling a list of zombie novels for my reading list, this was the only one I could find at a speciality bookstore. I bypassed Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" and picked this book up instead. And I am just a bit disappointed. This books isn't published in great amounts, and that's why the big bookstores don't carry it. The book is full of plot holes, grammatical errors (Don't they read the book before publishing it?) and is just plain silly at parts, where you question the logic of the \\"hero.\\" Usually I'm not that critical, but I regret buying this novel and just want to save you some money. Read \\"I am Legend\\" or one of King's books. Just don't buy this one. And don't be fooled by the high ratings this book has. I was told Amazon ratings can be biased and skewed by the authors and his friends.P.S. I'm not trying to be mean. It's just that I expected a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really.............","review":"I have read alot of Zombie novels and based on the reviews for this I assumed I would like this one. Not the case, the premise was original but the story was not very interesting and the characters flat and I found myself not caring what happened to them. I usually do not drop a book until the end but I could not finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Talent!","review":"I have not read many 'Zombie' tales. But I really enjoyed this take on the genre. I read World War Z and while it was ok, there were virtually no characters you could care about and it jumped around so much that it was just plain confusing at times. Monster Island is a much better developed novel. Wellington really has a knack for helping the reader get to know and care for his main characters without slowing the story down, it really is a gift. Wellington has a macabre view of the world and his take on the end of the world is both poignant and frankly funny at times. If you like vampires too, his novel 13 Bullets is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"New zombies","review":"This was an ok read. It is fast paced, full of action, and sectioned to make for quick easy reading. As far as plot goes it was OK.

Mr. Wellington takes some liberties with the standard zombie conventions -- and the result is a fresh, exciting new take on the genre.Whether you're a fan of zombies, horror, or just plain good literature, this is a book that I highly recommend --- imaginative, engaging, and above all, suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really care for it","review":"This book is kind of a mess. You have zombies, zombie animals, zombie birds, a thinking half-zombie, mummys, a celtic shaman, a U.N. weapons inspector, teen-aged Somalian girl warriors.

There were far too many supernatural powers employed, mind-reading mummies, etc. I prefer stories with virus-infected zombie masses, not mind-controlled zombie armies. It was okay for what it is, but I have no desire to read the other books in the series.If you prefer the classic kind of zombies, I'd recommend World War Z, Day By Day Armageddon, or one of the Morningstar Virus books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombie novel or Night at the museum???","review":"This book felt more like, \\"a night at the museum\\", than a zombie book. It starts out great with real mystery surrounding the Gary character, then it unravels in such an absurd way that it becomes a mockery of the genre. i could care less about mummies, and if I had any idea that they were in this book, I wouldn't have bought it. The other 2 of the trilogy sound equally as absurd..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me kinda sleepy.","review":"I am sorry to say I found this book to be a bit simplistic and lacking in descriptions and explanations. The writing style seemed amatuer and sometimes just seemed too repetitive.

I'll admit, he was great in the movie, playing the various parts. With that being said however, I realized that the main draw of the movie was Eddie. If the family members were played by different actors, this movie would have been terrible. I mean, there were so many stupid scenes in this movie, (The Space Shuttle, Giant Hamster, etc) that it was a pain to watch. The humor relied on crude, sex related jokes and toilet humor. People have been saying that this is not a drama, but a comedy. If so...then where are the laughs? I for one do not find all of the farts that funny..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Many Faces Of Eddie","review":"I don't know how he does this but Eddie Murphy has proven himself to be the consummate dual role + in this movie where he takes on not just 2 but 5 different characters both male and female. He has no equal in the 20th or 21st centuries and can be just as convincing as the cultured Professor Klump as the arrogant, self absorbed Buddy Love.

Otherwise a low blow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Concept, Horrible Movie","review":"I can no longer remember the days when Eddie Murphy has made a funny movie. He is now involved in movies that will appeal to everyone and pad his wallet more than his reputation as a comedian. This film is no exception. The first film made a good anount of money, so someone had the bright idea to make a sequal. That was mistake number one. The second mistake was to take a scene that was funny from the original film, and make it into a feature length film. The scene with his entire family, which was Eddie on a huge ego trip, was taken out, and now has a very poorly written film surrounding it. Janet Jackson may have been a high point, that being that she could actually act a little, but the rest of the movie was displaying what can happen when a star gets too much power, and such a large ego, that it is impossible for the film studio to say no to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny sequel","review":"This movie outshined its predecessor by a mile due mainly to Eddie Murphy. Murphy played his whole family, EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER. His acting is absolutely genius and it leads to hilarious moments. There are many classic scenes, some involving the grandma. The plot is about the professor, who is about to get married but his bad self, Buddy Love, is acting up. When Buddy escapes, there are two professors runnning lose and the professor's got himself a problem. It has many hilarious moments, but is different than the original as it's unrated and has some naughty but absolutely HILARIOUS moments. Strongly recommended for anyone that wants some good laughs or that enjoyed the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequal bites the BIG one!","review":"This movie proves, once again, that the sequal never lives up to the original. The Klumps, trying to ride on the tails of its predecessor, attempts to give the one-dimensional Klump family a second dimension to their characters. FAILED! While the movie is very funny (why it got a second star in my opinion), it tried to take on a more serious family aspect which left the film dragging slowly to the next punch-line delivered by Eddie Murphy in any of his hilarious disguises. If you want a funny movie, I suggest going with the first Nutty Professor where the one-sided Klumps are more suited for their roles, though less present in the overall story line. If you're an avid fan of Grandma Klump and her \\"Cletus-cutdowns,\\" then this is your movie... though I could have done without seeing her making moves on Buddy Love. Enjoy your movie experience! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly disappointing","review":"I, and my family, had high hopes for this film. We had really enjoyed the first Nutty Professor movie.

The language is terrible and I really didn't want my kids to see the shots of swinging breasts and bulging erections. As a family film it is completely inappropriate.

I purchased this title because I have a better than passing interest in and knowledge of the Salem Witch trials. One of my ancestors was hanged after confessing to witchcraft and another was on the jury that sentenced him to death by hanging. I'll guarantee that when he was accused of being a witch my ancestor's eyes did not develop a evil glow that afflicted his accusers. The accused witches that I saw in the short portion of the movie I watched all appeared (at least the special effects suggested) to be casting a malevolent spell. So much for historical accuracy. If you are in to Halloween special effects scary type movies, this is probably for you. If however, you are looking for dramatization that has a reasonable degree of historical accuracy, you best look elsewhere. Frankly, if I was an active witch, I would consider suing the authors of this piece for slander given their special effect misrepresentations of the accused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salem Witch Trials","review":"From a technical point of view it is a very well made movie.

The evolution of blame and hysteria into virtual murder for land, pay back for anything real or imagined, and abuse of political power is well depicted.

Toss in huge amounts of superstition and gossip, and you've got a lethal combination! This film shows quite vividly how religion, ANY religion, can never be used as a substitute for government. Like the Taliban today, the Salem Puritans utilized \\"religious authority\\" to enable them to destroy those they considered \\"unclean\\" or \\"wicked\\" (or simply didn't like), while calling their own homicidal insanity, \\"the will of God\\". SWT is an excellent portrayal of religion-gone-mad, using one of America's most shameful events as a template. This is a cautionary tale of historic horror.

The problem I am going to say is not this product specific.I used water-based finish for several years. Truely the odor is fine while applying coats. Much better than oil-based.But please be extremely careful for the re-coating time. If you re-coating the finish in 2 hours as this product claimed you will have problem. The smell of the finish won't go off in several weeks/months. May be more longer.My suggestion is re-coating it when it's completely dry. One day or more under good condition(temperature, ventilation...). Even one week/month under bad condition.You need to wait enough time to make sure the VOC vapored. Please note this product still has about 250g/L(or 275g?) VOC.

So I checked the measurements listed and the seller says the product is 4\\" X 4\\". NO! It's 3\\" tall!!I'm sorry that I paid almost $14 for a half-pint of a finish that I don't want. It doesn't pay to return it.My advice is to buy a product from a seller who has a good, detailed description of what's being sold.

Still, I'd forgotton (since I don't play vinyl any more) just how awesome B & T were... how precise their guitar playing is... and how flawlessly their silk-and-sandpaper voices blended.

No matter what the lesson of the day, there is something in the OPD that can reinforce the lesson and give opportunity to use the language. I am a great believer in the value of interactivity in the classroom, and the OPD offers many opportunities for valuable small group, partner, and around-the-circle verbal exercises.

I would like it to have the pronunciation on the same page as the word but perhaps it would be too confusing to a learner of English and/or reading.

For bargain Wagner shoppers, the top prize has to go to George Szell & the Cleveland Orchestra on Sony -- Szell's 1960's recordings have slightly more limited sonics, but the performances are truly phenomenal -- the best Wagner orchestra on the planet, and at bargain price too!

Here's the deal. The box comes with a book and a set of cards, each with a word or phrase on it. You pull a random card, look up the card in the book, and the one-to-two page chapter gives you some simple writing tasks and ideas. For example, one card might say \\"Flip it over,\\" and the corresponding chapter might tell you to turn your ideas around, look at the flip side of an issue, see things from another view. A precise task might tell you to write a short paragraph from the perspective of someone completely opposite from yourself or your characters. Not every one works at the time you pull it, but every chapter is chock full of interesting ideas.I can't guarantee anything, but I can say that a ten day journal, pulling one card every day significantly improved my writing.

There are also five additional cartoons produced by Walter Lantz but not starring Woody. These were released in the late '40s through the early '50s.

As a senior archaeologist myself who sometimes does forensic work, I appreciated the efforts of the authors to incorporate scientific methods into the story. It is too bad that archaeologists in Israel are required to immediately relinquish discovered bones to stone-throwing fundamentalist kooks.

Unfortunately the best the authors can come up with is the names on the tomb.

What makes him great as a caddie (calmness, keeping quiet, beeing 100% behind his player, Tom Kite), makes his book boring. No spicy details about the life on tour here. It is very obvious that Carrick did not want to upset anyone, starting from his boss, and the result is pretty boring reading. No funny anecdotes, no peek at what happens behind close doors... This is a book aimed at no one, I agree with the previous reviewer. Seasoned golfers won't get much help from Carrick's tips, they sound like 10 steps to break a 100. And if you are a beginer, my guess is that you will want to learn from a pro, not a caddie (try \\"The element of Scoring, by Ray Floyd, to improve your game)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great Book- Learn the Real Deal and the differences between Pro Golf and Amateur Golf!

This is my third ball from Super Pet, and they all seem to suffer from fit issues. The lids are either very hard to get on, or they fall off unexpectedly. The clear plastic seems to be of the absolute poorest quality and bends and scratches easily. After a week or two of my hamster running around on the tile floor, you can no longer see through the plastic. He doesn't seem to mind as I think he can see through the small slots in the plastic (just big enough to let hamster poop fall out).

But does that mean it reasonable to send something defective to customer? I found a crack on the lid when I open the box, and I just didn't bother to send it back (what if they said I crack it?) ANyways, despite the crack, you need to tape the tip to the ball because it's very loose. If you don't want to risk your rodent friend escape, you should secure it with tape. And.. it's more for bigger rodents like rat. My dward hamster, aka Fatty, is too small for it and he doesnt seem to like it :(And poops do fall out from the ball.

This is from a very conservative, mega-church view. It has some valid points but it is not very positive and we think realistic about what is really happening in the mainline denominations. Service is the key and radical hospitality. Not what this author is advocating. Unless you are deeply committed to and serving in a mainline church, you cannot know what is being offered in the Lord's name. We should have read between the lines and noted the background of the author.

The reason for the low rating is that the show's overall feel and atmosphere has changed dramatically from the first season. The music, camera angles, and direction are more standard '50s science fiction and that makes this and other shows of the second season much more pedestrian. This show's story is good; it's about a soldier that's been transported from the future to the present and he knows only violence, so he tries to adjust. In the right hands, this could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low rent alien dirge, about what you'd expect","review":"51, or Area 51, or whatever you want to call it, is another Sci-Fi Channel co-production (like the cringe-worthy Scream of the Banshee) with this year's After Dark lineup. With that all in mind, you probably already know what you're getting here. Directed by Jason Connery (son of Sean) and featuring genre stalwarts like Bruce Boxleitner, Jason London, Rachel Miner, and John Shea all slumming it here as the fabled military base succumbs to an attack by the aliens they've been keeping prisoner for years, 51 delivers the goods for those looking for low-quality shocks and splatters. It really is better than the sum of its parts however, even with the overly weak acting and occasional unintentional hilarity that arises during some of the action sequences. All in all, 51 isn't the worst flick of this type you'll come across, and that has to count for something I guess in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to be several movies and failing at all of them","review":"Too bad the cast was wasted here, because this movie is trying very hard to be Alien, Hangar 18, and who knows what else...and failing miserably at all of them.

I would award high points for the nice illustrations, colors and symbolism, but I'm dismayed by the lack of originality on the part of the illustrator(this deck \\"borrows\\" A LOT from the Ancestral Tarot). The cards themselves are a nice size and laminated, but the card stock is very thin and raises questions in my mind about durability.The addition of key words to the cards was well intentioned perhaps, but it proves confusing in many circumstances. And the numerology references are VERY distracting.Also, the black and white design on the back of the cards is the most eye-irritating I have ever seen - it was truly unnecessary to put the title of the deck there.Overall, I do like the deck for the illustrations, but if I knew before what I know now, I most likely would not have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Compilation of Historic Photos","review":"And that's how I would sum up this book... a good compilation of historic photos. The title indicates the book is a \\"photographic history\\" so I wasn't too disappointed to see a gazillion old, black & white photos with simple captions. Personally I would have liked to see more information in many of the captions in the way of car models and years for every photo in the book. The quality of the photos seems to be lacking, and I'm guessing it's because a cheaper printing process was probably used. But in my opinion, the sheer volume of photos helps make up for what this book lacks in print quality and information. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a bewdy","review":"This well-written book has a wonderful variety of standards, some funky pop and plenty of great fusion pieces. The ensemble writing was invaluable when I was using these charts in a university jazz ensemble.

Stanley Turrentine's sax is so important to many tracks and drives the rhythm as much as the rhythm section itself but it has lost much of its exquisite contrasting soft/hard expressive qualities, almost like it's been added on top in the new version. Everyone seems to be playing in isolation and the drums are so much louder in the mix I can't believe this was all done with only a 2 track master, that is quite an achievement. Even the organ has lost much of it's \\"watery\\" quality. There's just no space left, most of the exquisite pauses are missing, dynamics and much of the texture are all gone.

If you are still worried about the direction the band is going in then the fact that RATW was just nominated for this year's Mercury Music Prize should calm you down.Do yourself a favour and buy RATW, and buy this single as the B-Side \\"Tradewinds\\" is nothing short of excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miami Vice","review":"I Loved This tv series this was one of the best shows of the 80's if you like action fashion & great looking men & great cars youll love this great show of the 80's it will bring you back to the 80's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I recently bought The Complete Series NEW from Amazon/Respectable Modern Collections.

Once you get past the numerous typographical errors (the difference between wave a and wave A causes much confusion for example) you are dealing with a book that is mostly just a semblence of hand completed charts espouted in any old order the writer fancied. The strange thing is that these charts, and the methods described all date from 1994. Disregard the published in 2001 notice.The author has overcomplicated the method he describes. This has certainly done my trading more harm than good. And I was already pretty proficient in Wave theory! He would have you create vastly overcomplicated charts and overlays to carry out this method. He then has the cheek to show various intraday examples of his work.

I enjoyed this album as much for the beautiful SOUND of the three instruments as for the melodic variations or swing it contains. Mr Mehldau has an exquisite touch - check out his solo on the title track - and Mr Haden, who favours always the low end of his instrument, has one of the best sounds in all bassdom, woody, full, resonant. This is not ground breaking music but a relaxed live recording of a trio of musicians very comfortable with each other and their art. They make it sound so easy.

Perhaps the qi field or third chakra. In any case, I use this light along with a bright white light for a few hours a day and am SAD free.

Wade Cook, in a nut shell, provokes good \\"excuse making\\" folks to quit talking about it and just do it. True goal getting is the act of putting one foot in front of the other and doing whatever it takes to get the job done, no matter how hard. No more excuses. That's a concept. When you cut out all of the fluff, you get accountability. That's exactly what Wade Cook does. He holds the reader accountable. I liken him to a responsible parent or a tried and true friend. Give it to me straight. We need more of that. A good swift kick in the seat of the pants to put up or shut up."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great discovery!","review":"I was in Paris a couple months back and stumbled upon the video for \\"Vivre a Meme L'Amour\\" on Channel 6's late-night video show. I was hooked not only by the singer's sexy voice but also by the very cool black and white video. The next day I went in search of this CD and found it at OCD Records in the Latin Quarter. The entire CD is excellent...full of hypnotizing and moody melodies. Very romantic for background music but great for headphone listening by yourself too. Favorite tracks are \\"Vivre a Meme L'Amour\\" and \\"Le Vent des Vies\\". If you enjoy French music and want to try something different, give this CD a listen...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for everyone!!!","review":"Fun and enjoyable for kids and curious parents!

After learning he had cancer in 1991, 3-year-old Chad Juros spent a lot of time in the hospital with his father, who taught him everything he knew about sleight-of-hand tricks.

This is the best one of the three Warrior offerings and it smokes from beginning to end as well as leaving you wishing it was longer. The band really showed wisdom by having Rob Rock man the vocals, this man does an awesome job. If you like this bands stuff before you best be gettin' while the gettin' is good. If you feel that Firewind and Rob Rocks solo stuff rules then you owe it to your ears to have this platter to feast on too. This is one super duper album, well worth the price and not something to be without...and the lyrics are something your children can learn from...or even your parents if your so inclined to let them borrow it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is war!","review":"With Rob Rock behind the mic,Warrior mean business and their new opus hits hard from the introductory track to the end.It is 'old school'only in appearance;a few spins will reveal the brilliant minimalism of this album,as the code by which quality metal is still created.One of the best metal albums of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your money!","review":"This album has some great songs to remember times gone by. But one song makes the album worth the price. Dennis DeYoung's Desert Moon is beautiful. It is hard to get this song,so placing it on compliation is truly worth the price.

I ended up with 90% charge. Take in minde that it sat in blazzing sunlight for 11 hours (7AM-6PM) with 120mA solar pannels (2X60mA) and a 1000mAH Li-Ion battery, so I think that is a bit inefficiant, especialy when I left the freeloader in my window sill all day and my iPod got only 20% charged.Over all I would recomend the freeloader for camping or a little extra boost when on the go. I also wish it could charge an iPad but it is a small unit and it can only handle so much.In the future I would like to see a bigger battery capacity, a lot bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I am not a sport's fan.

You have to be experienced in sight-reading and piano technique to get the most out of this book. It's pretty advanced and doesn't slow down to teach you where to put your fingers or how to read bass and treble clefs. Goes perfectly with The Jazz Theory Book by the same author, in fact I would recommend reading that book first. Some of the mysteries revealed in The Jazz Theory Book make this book even more useful. As a classical and rock keyboardist, this book has opened musical doors for me, I hope you find the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells you where to go, no always how to get there.","review":"This is a great book. You'll need to couple it with a few other resources to really get it. For example, he tells you to learn all the ii-V-I sequences in every key, but doesn't write them out for you. It's so much easier to have them in a practicable form (try JAZZ CHORD HANON). The book gives a basic overview of theory in the first chapter, but you will NEED to study something beforehand, or you will be lost. Also, THE NEW REAL BOOK contains a lot of the songs that are used in this book. Overall, though, the stuff is all in the book. It just takes some digging to understand it all. I hired a piano teacher to help me with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the advanced piano player","review":"I consider myself to be an intermediate piano player. But this book I found to be very challenging and intimidating. It is only for the advanced piano player. And unless you have an extensive Jazz music collection, you will won't recognize a majority of the songs in this book. So that makes it even harder to play and learn the material.The book would probably make a great reference....but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are already a professional Jazz piano player, if not someone who is already playing in a Jazz trio or quartet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashed Bug!","review":"I was so excited when I ordered The Jazz Piano Book.

This is a book for people who want to play jazz and are familiar with jazz. The book consistently uses references to famous recordings that jazz fans will be familiar with. This is great in that if you know your jazz that you will be able to know what the author is talking about when he explains II-V-I progressions or how a sus chord leaves a suspended feel. Don't get this book if you: don't know how to play piano; are not familiar with jazz; can not read music; don't know all major and minor keys. I am on chapter 8 in this book, and sus chords, phrygian chords, rootless chords, tritonation, and right hand modifications to rootless chords has already been covered. If you are a jazz fan and want to not just play by feel but know what you are doing, this book will suit you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Start","review":"Split Shift uses watery guitar lines - reminiscent of 10 Years and their ilk - to draw listeners in, then hammers them over the head with Stereomud-esque hard rock riffs. The lead singer is eerily reminiscent of Machine Head's Robb Flynn - whether growling or singing - and the songs are never a disappointment individually. As a whole, what the band lacks is the ability to make a consistently great album. That being written, this is a solid blend of alternative metal elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"i never heard such thick guitar sounds ever, and the drums are huge! great songs. you can listen to the cd from beginning to end with a smile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good for first album","review":"ok, I think the course lines are not that good, the verses sound better then the course.The reson I gave it two stars,is because they have one good song that his track 11.but I heard the new materal for thire second album,and thire courses are relly getting better.So I have a good feeling, that thire second album is going,to be 100 times better then thire first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST chess books ever !","review":"I think that this book is the best I have ever read ....If for no other reason that it made me really think about chess...and fed me with many new ideas on how to improve.

R. Cavendish has provided a refreshing and provocative overview of the many strands of thought swirling around the tarot. Along with the beautifully detailed pictures he has written interpretations of the 22 major trump taking into account Eliphas Levi, Wirth, A.E. Waite, Crowley, Jung and others. As the reader you come to realize that there is a rich intellectual history behind the tarot that is worthy of deep consideration. You will also find a rich appreciation of the heavily freighted symbolism employed by the many 'rectifiers' of the tarot over the years. He also gives a good introduction to the Cabala and its relation to the tarot. What I appreciated most about this book was its thoughtful perspective. It is a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for learning or teaching French","review":"Even though this book is now out of print, I have used portions of it for years with my 1st and 2nd year French students.

Even if the book could be trusted on for accurate information, there is not much substance.

The few curse words sprinkled within Circle of Grace did not bother me as they were in line with the characters' makeup. However, the continual references to various \\"higher powers\\" and the underlying message of the lack of true \\"Hope\\" was very disturbing.

I was very dissapointed that this book was even listed under christian fiction. But, I also blame myself for not reading some of these reviews. I think the world would view this as a very non-threating, feel good, semi spiritual book. I am not even sure how this book would lead a non-believer to the truth. It is a book that leads you to believe the way is NOT narrow, it's as wide open as you want. If you read christian fiction to protect your mind from cursing (Jesus' name in vain), or other sexual preferences other than the way God intended it, this book is not for you. True friendship is centered on the one that created it. And grace is given freely when one sees the need for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Case","review":"I picked up this book at the library, completely unaware that it was supposed to be a Christian book. We meet Grace thirty years after college graduation, on the day she discovers she is dying of cancer and has not a single close friend or family member. She was already a little weird as a college freshman, but when she discovers that her beloved father was serially unfaithful to her depressed and depressing mother, Grace's life goes down in an endless skid. That hardly seems a good enough explanation of why she, a trained librarian, is now living in a shack and earning less than $25,000 working in her profession. Still, if Grace is not insane, maybe that's just the way life is around Asheville."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Surprising","review":"I have read many of Stokes' books and have fallen in love with her writing and characters. This book follows the lives of four college roommates through a journal that is passed between them for thirty years. Typical Stokes format, but the similarities stop there.I have come to associate Stokes' writing with the Christian fiction genre. With few exceptions, I read only Christian fiction so the lesbian story line caught me off guard. I kept expecting Stokes to address the issue from a Biblical standpoint, but it never happened. Also, the profanity was completely out of line with what I have previously read of Stokes' writing. The book had ample opportunity for spiritual growth of the characters, but Stokes chose this time to let the pieces fall where they may. I will be more careful when selecting the next Stokes book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed also","review":"i too was greatly disappointed with this book, i feel it fell far short of the standards set by her other writings, of which i have read most. neither did i appreciate the swear words contained in this book. don't buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Christian fiction","review":"I have enjoyed many of Penelope Stokes' books until I read \\"Circle of Grace\\". I often recommend books to my avid reading friends but this book will not be one of them. Although it is classified as Christian fiction, some of the content clearly was not. I was disappointed to find offensive language, subtle references to a lesbian relationship, and references to a distant deity with no clear message of a personal relationship to Him. This is improper for Christian Fiction and would be better classified as regular Fiction. The plot would have been just as good, if not better, without these things. Christian fiction needs to be honoring to Christ in content.

I broke in the Sengoku 2230 by burning .5 gallons in my garage and then dry burned the wick to reduce the capillary action of the wick. When I filled the tank and tried to use the heater in my house, the fumes forced me to open all of my windows to air out the house after an hour. Then, I burned another tank full in the garage hoping the heater would quit producing the strong paint fumes, but it continued to produce noxious fumes, so I had no choice but to return it and continue using my reliable Toyostove because it burns clean.The Sengoku produces great heat but it also generates paint fumes that make it impossible to use inside a house."},{"rating":"2","title":"My discovery","review":"What I like about this book, is that not only is it engaging and a good read, but it actually makes me feel clever!With interesting stories written in highly accessible language, the author doesn't condescend to his reader nor talk over his head. A true teacher, he reveals, explains and encourages, enticing you to read on first, and then continue to make more discoveries of your own by thinking about the implications of what he says.Wish we had more authors and teachers out there like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and mostly good","review":"This book is a refreshing egalitarian change from the kind of history that implies that a handful of geniuses are responsible for most scientific progress. It shows that many famous people were less innovative than is commonly thought, and that science is more incremental than revolutionary (but in spite of the title, it says little about Einstein).But I can't help wondering whether the book exaggerates to make the misleading histories sound more scandalous than they really were. However, I only see one sentence that seems to justify this suspicion. On page 94 (regarding the effects of the great depression on the Hawthorne studies) he says \\"the desperation in these words seems to leap from the page\\". I don't see any clear signs of desperation in those words he quotes. It wouldn't surprise me if the workers were desperate, but the book fails to convince me about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Death and Letting Go","review":"Like so many others, I did not want to read or think about death. Ellen Tadd's book changed that. One short sentence has remained with me ever since I read the book: \\"Light dispels darkness\\" (74). Recalling my reactions, even as I led up to that sentence, my thinking was being transformed to embrace death as an extension of life. In a strange way, I was comforted while I read. Vague childhood recolletions surfaced, how then (and now), I would suppress the onset of an out-of-body experience,or silence the voice of my deceased parents who wished (wish?) to talk with me. If anything, Ms. Taddd account has stregthened my belief in eternal life, moreso in reincarnation.

She was a very private person and didn't allow her friends to be a part of her life during her last year on earth. I would call her at home, but there was always an excuse as to why she wasn't there. Silly me should have known something was amiss. I'd visit her grave and tell her how angry I was with her for leaving and not sharing with me. After I read Ellen's book, I was able to visit her again and tell her that I was OK with her not letting me in. I still miss her very much, but I'm no longer angry with her. I'm grateful to my daughter for sharing her book with me. She knew how unhappy and sad I have been for all these years.I'm going to buy my own copy as I need to read it again in order to prepare for other situations.Thank you Ellen, and thank you Leah (Grasshopper)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"In 1999 I first read Chinese translation of \\"Medea and Her Children\\" and \\"Sonechka\\". I immediately decided that I liked Medea much better. In the following years, I've read all English and Chinese translations of Ulitskaya's works, and I still think Medea is the best.For a foreign reader, maybe Medea is not so sexually juicy like her other works, and I think that's exactly why it is not so popular as Sonechka on Amazon. Medea is a family story, reflecting Soviet history, society and many different ethnic groups' cultures waven together. Ulitskaya loves and respects her characters. She writes clearly and deeply, with some black humor, and not sentimentally. Some heritage of Chekhov and Bulgakov can be found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but...","review":"...this is surely the most b o o r i n g book I have ever read.

Why Carvin Jones is not a household name is beyond me. Maybe he's not the best vocalist in the world, but maybe he IS the best Blues Guitarist with a pulse today. Right down the middle between Hendrix and SRV but maybe with a bit rougher edge. Originals and classics both done extremely well. Carvin is the only person even challenging Walter Trout's claim to the Blues Guitar title (among the living)and this cd will prove it! Get it if ya can, whatever it takes! Woulda been four stars with a slight vocal weakness, but the guitar intensity MORE than made up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took me years to find, the only question now is : WHY!!!!!!","review":"I read some sterling reviews and finaly tracked down this rare cd. No idea why the reviews were so impressive. Someone mentioned SRV and HENDRIX in the same breath - pure insult. His vocals are very poor, but are still better than the frantic noodling that passes for solos on this poor offering. How you can butcher something as basic as ROADHOUSE BLUES is beyond me. His guitar playing has absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sounds ancient. All the solos are pointless finger exercises. There are about 800 or so better players in my collection and this one has not one redeeming feature.

As usual Hamish is caught in the middle of a murder and then guess what---a second murder-----guess who finds both bodies? Beaton has provided plenty of good characters to go with Hamish and it make for a good light read. It won't scare you to death or cause you do loose sleep from fright but it is good. Hamish has to fight the bad Inspector Blair as always. I liked the part of the Smiley Bros. Could they make moonshine and be killers too???? How about Kylie, pretty but has bad, bad boy friends.

Her characters have a deep sense of realism in them that I truly admire. However, I was undeniably dissappointed in this book due to the abusive relationship she displays between her two main characters, Gelina and Conn. While on one hand showing Gelina to be a brave, strong, and self-sufficient woman, chapter after chapter follows the horrible relationship that Gelina is drawn into with Conn. Unfortunately I found I kept reading this book to the end simply hoping to find Gelina coming to her senses and run from Conn's horrendously abusive show of \\"love.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lord of the Rings Type Story, Not Romance","review":"I thought this book was terrible. From the bizarre names, leaders, etc. I felt like I was reading a Lord of the Rings war book. This was not like Medeiros' other books. This book is long too. Way too long. The story drags on and on, battle after battle. The main character Conn likes his foster daughter, then doesn't, he's attracted to her, then he's not. Zzzzzzz. I could only last 2/3 of this book before I gave up. Not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Started off enjoying this book, kept waiting for it to get better, but kept getting worse. The storyline just seemed to disintegrate, like the author was grasping at straws or in a hurry to finish a book she really had no ending for.When Conn turns on Gelina on their wedding day (isn't he supposed to love this woman?)for supposedly killing Nimbus (someone she truly cared for and was her friend), without so much as a why or explantion of motive, is the time I really got disgusted with the book.

I love Teresa Medeiros but if this was the first of her work I had read I probably wouldn't have read any more. The main characters are totally unredeaming! She sheds her vows of loyalty and undying devotion like she sheds clothing. I hate stories of faithless women. She pledges herself to Conn, betrays her brother, when the brother appears again, she betrays Conn, when she's sent back she forgets the brother etc. Conn is no better. He blames her for everything without explanation or trusting her in any way (not that she's trustworthy). Surely this isn't considered a romance! Maybe it got better, I couldn't finish the book.

This book shows a classic example of a horribly abusive mean-spirited relationship. While these two could have had a good relationship, the choices they made and the truly intense hatred they show for one and other would make me want to end up far from seeing them written into a lasting love. I wouldn't wish their brand of love on my worst enemy. Violence reigns in their story.

The only thing funnier is who was on the sub (I won't give it away and spoil your good laugh). And then Clive Cussler shows up in the middle of the African desert.

After having finished it, all I can say is that I am glad I do not have to listen to Tom Wompat try and sound like the sexy Eva Rojas anymore, it was almost nauseating.This is my second Clive Cussler book in the last month and I have to say he is not as good as I remember him.

I thought I'd give Clive Cussler a try since I read Raise The Titanic.The setups in the beginning were long-winded and gave absolutely no relation to the story whatsoever till somewhere towards the end of the book. It served to confuse the readers greatly until strangely and coincidentally enough the Dirk Pitt chances upon them.The book is full of male bravado and machoism. It was shameless in the way Clive included himself into the novel as one of the characters searching for the lost ship. At the same time, the people who seem not to die or get injured miraculously is Dirk Pitt. Everyone else he knows dies.The plot itself was very round about, back and forth and linear.

Cussler does a fantastic job blending an assortment of interesting characters into one incredible plot that takes our heroes on a harrowing journey across the most unforgiving patch on land on Earth.

But Dirk Pitt distracted me from enjoying the book too much. I was very exasperated with the character.When I think about it, I suppose that means I was drawn in by the book enough to be irritated with the character.

It was so bad, I put it down around page 180, only kept going that long because I kept thinking \\"There has to be something to this if this guy's so popular\\".Some people who liked the books even though the writing is bad say the action sequences and descriptions of foreign countries make up for it.

It took a lot of perseverance but I made it. I have been a loyal Cussler reader ever since picking up \\"Raise the Titanic!\\". Although none of his books have lived up to that standard, I have for the most part found them at least moderately enjoyable. I can only conclude that Mr. Cussler has tired of Dirk Pitt and realized the best way to kill him off is with this muddled mish-mash of convaluted nonsense he presents in the form of a novel.

How does stuff like this get published??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"This book was awful I do not know how people can read thisgarbage it has a weak action adventure plot that has been overused bymovies and the publishing companys.

My favorite of all his works"},{"rating":"1","title":"Printing is off","review":"Several of the pages are off center. Either the center is cut off or the outer edge is cut off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at First read","review":"I first read this book in 1993. I haven't stopped reading Clive Cussler since. I really enjoyed how he tied history into a current tale. Though they were some stretchers, I appreciated how he made it come to life.Dirk Pitt is one of the most pre-eminent characters in literature today. The story line is simple, well crafted with believable and creative characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lied about condition","review":"I order a book that said it was USED- VERY GOOD. This books binding is very poor. The cover is bent. The book is not worth the money I paid for. I might try to get a return."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Sahara' got me started reading Cussler...","review":"In '96, needing something new to read, I borrowed 'Sahara' from my roommate. I've been an avid fan of Clive Cussler ever since. The plot and sub-plots in this, and his other novels, are mind-blowing and really imaginative. I highly recommend reading this or ANY of his other books.I was even more intrigued to find out that Clive Cussler lives much the same life as his trademark character. His real-life NUMA organization actually DOES seek and find lost shipwrecks, planes, etc. You can read about those in his non-fiction books, 'The Sea Hunters' volumes I & II. If you're an adventurer of any sort, especially a diver, you'll love those books as much as the novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite the page-turner...","review":"I picked this book up as airline reading over the holidays, due in large part to the fact that a movie based on it was soon to be released. I had never read a Clive Cussler novel before and must say I am a new fan of his work. This is a great action adventure novel that kept me coming back for more. The only disappointment being the lack of strong, believeable female characters. I find it hard to believe that a woman who has risen to the position of Secretary-General of the UN would so casually spill government secrets to someone in the back of a limo, even if that person was a former lover. Additionally, the only adjective to characterize Dirk Pitt's love interest is pitiful. I am sure these disappointing characters will be fleshed out in the movie version, though, and they would not deter me from recommending this book for those looking for a quick and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretches your credulity to the breaking point","review":"Ever hear the phrase \\"suspension of disbelief\\"? You'll need a truckload of it for this book. The story is entertaining enough; I can see why it was made into a movie. But you'll need to turn off the logical part of your brain as the invincible, superhuman Dirk Pitt achieves one utterly implausible escape after another.Cussler finally lost me when Dirk and his pal, after wandering in the Sahara Desert for days with no food or water, discover a crashed airplane and manage to rebuild it into a \\"land yacht.\\" They ride it to safety and are restored to perfect health in moments after guzzling some water. Oh, please ...This was my first Clive Cussler novel, and I suspect it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can anything be so bad?","review":"What a waste of time. Cussler's Dirk Pitt is the most ridiculous character ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting through the book Sahara is like crossing a desert.","review":"I love this book! It is adventurous, and I feel that it kept me interested throughout the story. It is fun to read, especially when it starts to get violent! My dad recommended it to me, I am happy he did. Like I described earlier, this book can get pretty violent. I don't like the technical scientifics that the author gets into. And it can be EXTREMELY boring at some parts. I feel that Mr. Cussler could have cut it short by leaving out all the scientific stuff. Yes, I suppose I'd reccomend it. It is very interesting if you like science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Adventure","review":"I had a lot of fun reading Sahara.A little far fetched, but that'sd Dirk Pitt.I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"his best book yet","review":"This book is my favorite of Cussler's books. It's full of adventure and suspense, and I could never put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Great Literature - But Fun","review":"Clive Cussler's novels are hokey and weird..... but I'm addicted. Where else can you get a shoot-em-up adventure and a way-over-the-top James Bond-esque hero combined with oceanography, history, and archeology? The plot of this one makes you wonder what Mr. Cussler was smoking, but is still delightfully entertaining. Abe Lincoln's body is resting on a Confederate ironclad in the middle of the Sahara desert and only Dirk Pitt can save the day and stop the rich industrialist polluting the oceans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love a good adventure tale...","review":"..but this is not a good one. I can't believe people read this guy's books for enjoyment (escape?). I was going on a camping/hiking trip recently and this book was given to me to 'enjoy' at the campsite. The only enjoyment came when I used it to light fires each night. Luckily, I did bring some other paperbacks that were much better and did survive to pass on to other campers. If you have never read this guy's books, beware. They should probably be required reading in beginner-writing classes as examples of how NOT to write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how I feel about this one.","review":"I don't know how I feel about this one. I enjoyed reading it in the same way I might enjoy watching whatever made-for-tv movie might be playing on USA on a random weeknight. My main complaint about the book was its totally bad way of giving information by way of really bad exposition. Most authors seem to be able to reveal things in a clever way that comes naturally in the story.Often it is the equivelant of writing a character who comes out and says \\"It's good to have you home; I see that you have sucessfully driven to work and accomplished your tasks there. By the bag in your hand I can tell that you have gone to the store and purchased the bananas, tomatoes, and pie crusts that we needed.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"D-uh.....Uh......UHH!!","review":"I've read three of this guy's books- an easy task as they can be smoothly read, but they are also almost interchangeable- the plot seems to be identical once places and names are removed. This is a good book to read while watching T.V. or over a 2 or 3 hour transit round-trip when you can only give part of your concentration to a novel (Like on a summers day, when the other part of a man's concentration, in all probability, would be focused on your scantly clad neighbours)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirk Pitt at his best","review":"With a great historical plot twist, Clive Cussler has gotten back in line with a wonderfully written Dirk Pitt novel. Pitt is back with his NUMA cohorts to save the world from an environmental threat caused by cold and callous human beings. Cussler would make X-Files creator Chris Carter proud with the historical twist regarding the Lincoln assassination. It's a stretch but believable. Worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous as ever","review":"My Grandad got me into Cussler. I'd eagerly wait for him to finish the latest installment, so I could then read it.Now I can buy my own copy and with Sahara, Cussler is as brilliant as ever. Dirk foils a plot to wipe out all sea life, rescues the beautiful Eva Rojas and takes on a bunch of cannibals. It is all delivered with the direct panache of all Cussler novels and even though you know it's all going to end well, its how Dirk achieves it that makes it so much fun. A true thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!!!","review":"the pitcher is defective. It cracked the first time I used it. The glass thickness varies everywhere on the pitcher.

Good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to poke my eyes out","review":"Let me start by saying I did not read this entire book. In fact I read less than 20% of it(I skimmed through the rest). The reason is, this book was so boring and dry I wanted to shoot myself after the first few pages. If you are a science nut or a math wiz, you may enjoy this book. If you are looking for a good, easy to read book giving evidence for intelligent design - look elsewhere. I recommend The Case For A Creator by Lee Strobel or The Origin Of The Universe by Emerson Cooper.

The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier).

Vehicles are a large expenditure these days and most people borrow to purchase or lease the car because they \\"believe\\" that it's cheaper. Explaining the benefits and drawbacks to the decision maker is the key to the sale. This book gave me an easy to follow approach to understanding the advantage of learning the decision makers concerns and doubts and concentrating on addressing them.

It is a pretty good phone. The sound quality is good and I haven't had the battery die out once yet, but I am shopping around for another. For the past month or so, when I'm talking to someone on the phone, the sound will just cut out. The other person can hear me, but I can't hear them. I have to hit the antenna to try and get the sound to come back. It is really annoying. If it weren't for that problem, it would be a great phone. Maybe we just have a bad one, I don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Phone","review":"In the past, I've been happy with AT&T phones, but this phone is really poor quality.

Never has our field seen anything close to this kind of superb thinking, writing, and scholarship. Elliott sets a new standard, far above the weak mush Reimer has always churned out. Still, Elliott gives full credit to Reimer in Music Matters (chp. 2) for Reimer's earlier work in music education philosophy. Elliott's critics conveniently overlook the fact that Elliott gives this credit, let alone how graciously he does it. Elliott's critics also fail to understand what philosophy is: to do Philosophy is to reflect critically on the efforts of other thinkers, past and present. This is exactly what Elliott does on the way to providing a fine alternative to Reimer's restricted aesthetic view; and Elliott does this brilliantly, with excellent logic and clear explanations. In addition, Elliott never attacks Reimer as a person (whereas Reimer is fond of attacking Elliott personally in his MEJ tirades and elswhere)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love HP","review":"My old keyboard was off position a fraction of an inch which, believe it or not, makes it difficult to type.

The color matches perfectly with my tan and blue outdoor rug and outdoor wicker furniture. Following the instructions, armed with my cordless drill, drill bit, screwdriver attachment and ladder, I installed all 3 - by myself - in less than 1 hour - without a mistake!

So far no mold growth, but def check back in a year to see if they're holding up.

However, the design needs much improvement. With the least amount of wind, i.e., breeze, the shade will not properly roll up. Also, the straps holding the pole in place (at the bottom of the shade) easily slip off. The shade and the pole are then free to do as they please; in my case, the pole fell to the ground, and the shade flapped in the breeeze.

When I ordered a couple of Coolaroo shades, thinking I would receive the same quality product, I was appalled when I actually received and opened the packages. I think it would probably work better to go to a local Home Depot or Walmart and purchase some of their shade cloth and tack it over the window. These shades have the same type of fabric as the bulk rolls of shade cloth sold everywhere. It's floppy and does not lie down properly unless it is tightly stretched and fastened down. It will not be possible to view the outside well through these shades. The shades also are cheaply made in every other way. I doubt the plastic parts will hold up well in hot climates. The plastic bar at the bottom of the shade wants to slide right out and the fasteners for that bar are plastic and poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolaroo Daddy-O","review":"I could be my imagination, but I think that this shade has significantly reduced my cooling needs in my south facing back porch.

And some of the same colorful, interesting characters introduced in that book reappear.There are a number of engaging subplots which simultaneously unfold over a very short period of time. Tony uses his brains, brawn, agility, computer skills and marksmanship to save the day on several occasions. Not bad for a guy who, in one more year, will be eligible for Medicare.This is a very entertaining, tightly written novel.

It quickly becomes little more than a list of records, dates and chart placing. I saw Manfred Mann in Australia in the early 60s and they were sensational live. No mention of this tour in the book.

When it arrived, it was inside a bag, and when I took out the bottle, it was wet - it had obviously leaked sometime during the shipment. I was taking it to the sink to wipe it off, when I noticed the warning label. If the product comes in contact with your skin, you must rinse that skin (my hand in this case) for 15 to 20 minutes!

The problem is, the subtitles sometimes disappear completely. I'd scan back and they'd pop up where they were previously missing, very odd and a little annoying. In a few instances, the subtitles appear briefly in Russian. Also, in some scenes, the color shifts without a change in the lighting, possibly a problem with the DVD transfer (just a guess.)Still an enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian making of the English Classic","review":"This a Russian film with subtitles. It is the best and truest to the book version. This film is for collectors and lovers of mystery and the unusual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for pure devoted film buffs","review":"Have just finished watching this movie so this review is based on initial impressions and not with the benefit of some time thinking about the film. For people contemplating purchasing this version of the classic Agatha Christie tale I would say you would have to be particularly devoted, especially considering the price. Despite the film being made in 1987 it is poor in technical quality but gets points for artistic merit. The English translation is unnecessarily clumsy and the quality of the disc replication is also poor. The disc I watched seized in the middle and then sent me forward in time some 20 minutes. So one murder was never seen. I've tried in two different blu-ray players (zone A + B) and one multi-zone DVD player and all don't work.So summing up, if you want a classic, have the $ and can put up with some of what I've described I would go ahead and purchase this film. Otherwise, just pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"very Russian","review":"This program is very Russian. They have taken the Christie plot and produced it in a totally Russian style. The only English things about the production is that some of the men wear vests with their suits or smoke pipes. Also the \\"English\\" subtitles are literal translations from Russian in Russian grammar. These are amusing. The end of the story is very morbid in the Russian style.The only improvement I could think of is that they should have woven excerpts from \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\" into the sound track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Service, order at your own risk","review":"Do not order the movie if you don't have capabilities to play it in the PAL format. The service was good up until I tried to play the DVD on my player. The sender had asked me to sent the DVD back and after several emails with no reply on status of my order i had to request help from Amazon rep. Only after I spoke to the Amazon representative I received a reply from the sender that I am going to be reimbursed not only for the initial order but for sending the DVD back. Note, the description on Amazon doesn't mention anything about the DVD capable of playing only on PAL format. Bottom line, do not order the movie if you don't have the DVD player that capable of playing DVDs in PAL format. Plus, it will take you a while to get your money back. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for completists","review":"A mixed bag. There are a few comic book adaptation of his stories (Halfjack) while others are re-printed with color illustrations. These are quite garish and don't hold up that well on the glossy paper.Maybe for the completist but offers nothing new to those already familiar with Zelazny's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ten Commandments from Ramses' point of view.","review":"Main things I liked about the Ramses series: 1)the story has a very fast pace and is as action-packed as a thriller movie; 2)Jacq's Ancient Egypt is full of magic; 3)the Exodus tale is beautifully rewritten. A few things I disliked a bit: 1)characterization is oversimplified and most characters do not evolve at all during the story's timeframe (over 50 years); 2)conspiracies take too much space in the story and are rather repetitive; 3)the numerous love scenes are neither romantic nor erotic, merely boring and artificial. Putting all together, though, Christian Jacq wrote a fine story which took me in a memorable journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed by the entire series","review":"the series promises much more than it can deliver. there is very little plot development and character development. Ramses is the pharoah-to-be, a morally upright if brash person, and all the people who are against him are evil, the ones for him are the good guys, who have their personal flaws.i agree with the author of the review \\"Just Missed the Mark\\", that somehow, without good reasons given, Ramses always seems to come out on top no matter what happens and despite of all the plotting of his enemies. he's THE only one invincible, morally-upright, just, caring guy with the gods-given authority to lead. no one else gets to win, just Ramses.this series disappointed me. an encyclopedia could have been more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice try but dissapointing","review":"I was hoping for some insight into one of the most fascinating figures in ancient Egypt but instead got a boring and very obviously fictitious, one-dimentional character who I'm sure bears little resemblence to the real Ramses. The supporting characters are even worse.The situations Ramses finds himself in and survives are almost laughable. This is more like the young readers, prime-time TV version of Ramses early life. Still, the book was easy to read and I could finish it in one day. I'll give book 2 a chance before I give up on the series. Maybe the story gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"I was looking forward to learning something about Ancient Egypt, whilst enjoying a good story. Unfortunately the characters in this book are cartoon like. Ramses is brave, strong, handsome, intelligent, moral, honest etc.. he doesn't have a single flaw. Whilst his brother is greedy, devious, unattractive, dishonest, etc.. he doesn't have a single redeeming feature. This is pretty much the way all the characters are painted. The story is similarly simple and unrealistic. I do not believe this is just poor translation, it's too fundamental, it must be poor writing.The overall effect is that of a comic book version of the Pharoahs. If that's what you are looking for, or if you plan to read this to your kids, then it might be worth the money. Otherwise I would leave this on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book!","review":"this is the third time that i read these series and i love it . this book gets you hooked and you cant stop reading it.oh and this is not a history book so dont give it bad reviews because it is not a humdred precent authentic . this is a fictional book"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential wasted","review":"With the cover promising the work of an expert Egyptologist I had hoped that the writing in this book would bring alive the feel of Ancient Egyptian times. In this it fails there is very little description to help the reader paint mental pictures in the way Colleen McCullogh did so successfully in her histories of Rome. Instead we get a soap opera that over the following novels descends into a tale of unrealistic magic and mysticsm. Don't buy this book save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly romantic yet far from the truth!!!","review":"I must say that, the book as a novel, contains a romantic tale eleborated by fictions yet not facts... As I am being an Archaeologist, it challenges my education and imagination, at one point it is unbeliavable to say that Ramesses himself had met the heroes of his age such as Menelaos, Helen... I suppose Jacq must start to be more objective and nonfiction, otherwise he will start writing tales for children. On the other hand, his passion for Egypt has turned this novel into a barbaric source with the way he eleborates the ancient Greece and other near eastern civilizations such as the Hittites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject, one dimensional writing","review":"I was hoping for much more from this book. Well-written historical fiction can be a delightful read, but this isn't it. I don't think you can blame it on the translation; it's really not a close call. The characters are flat and one dimensional, the interplay between them is alternately stiff and sophomoric, and the story is riddled with cliches. In places, it almost reads like a children's book. Jacq apparently is an egyptologist, but this book doesn't inspire confidence in the accuracy of its historical foundation. I don't give it the lowest possible rating because it is based on an interesting subject and on those occasions when the reader wishes to switch off his/her critical faculties (e.g., on a plane or at the beach) it may be a pleasant diversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Unfortunately I read The Memoirs of Cleopatra this Summer and found myself comparing the two books. I spent three weeks with Cleopatra and felt like I'd been transported back in time. I spent three days with Ramses and had to remind myself this is a period piece. The writing was simplistic but I couldn't tell if that was the translators fault. I had plans to buy the other volumes as they were released but now I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip!","review":"This is Volume 1 in a 5 volume series (at $14.95 each). At $14.95 for all 5 volumes, it might be worth it. This is either a very bad translation, or VERY badly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"Ramses, Son of the Light has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. In theory it should be good, with an Egyptian authority as author, and indeed, the detail of everyday life in ancient Egypt seems accurate. However, the quality of the writing, the switching from modern idiom to stilted and dull dialogue, all add up to a very poor read. I think this book may have lost something in translation and I will certainly not be reading the rest of the series. In comparison, Bernard Cornwell's Warlord trilogy (about King Arthur) is well written and convincing in its dialogue and description. Ramses just did not enthrall me with its trite and tedious prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ramses: A book of spiritual growth and transformation","review":"Ramses is a book about the spiritual growth and transformation of a young boy, not only learning to be a man, but a leader of many. Christian Jacq gives the reader every reason to bond with this young man, thirsting for every new quest and adventure, and every new meeting with his father.The book is meant to be a fictional work based on the true character of Ramses, an Egyptian pharoah. Jacq does an outstanding job uniting the fiction and the reality of Ramses life. The reader is enticed to believe the passion between Iset the Fair and Ramses, yet is understanding of the decisions Ramses makes as the more mature and knowledgable man takes over the once free and careless boy.Even without the knowledge of Egyptian history, this is a fascinating, must-read book. This first book will make you want to read the next phase of Ramses journey from boy to man to Pharoah of Egypt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well written at all","review":"I read a lot and I would count myself a pretty good judge of books. I also hardly EVER don't stick a book out. But I really didn't like this book. I didn't think it was well written, and I stopped reading about half way through because I just didn't care about the characters. And I really like historical novels and I am very interested in Ancient Egypt but this book just did not keep my interest. So, save yourself the bother and don't read this book and go read a decent historical novel, by someone like Lindsey Davis or Mary Renault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy reading, but for history buffs has no value!","review":"If you like Wilbur Smith etc. go ahead. But otherwise don't waste your time. I have read the 4 books so far, just out of curiosity to see how much the history was twisted. Ramses turned out to be a super hero and a lot of historical facts were changed in his favor. I wish it would have been a much more \\"factual fiction\\". I enjoyed it as a fiction, but got mad because of contradictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I don't know why this book was an International Best Seller. Perhaps the French know something we don't. I found this book extremelly boring. The charachters were too simplistic and the action was too eratic. I had expected a lot more from an Egyptologist and someone who had been writing books since he was a teen. The setting was weak--I never felt like I was \\"in\\" Egypt. I won't read the sequel. The only thing positive I have to say about this book is that it was simple to read. Unfortunatly, it was so easy, it was like reading a children's book. I don't recommend it. Sorry Jacq!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn! What a disappointment.","review":"I was truly disappointed in this book. I COMPLETELY agree with the reviewer who called it \\"Ramses for Dummies\\". Perhaps it is the translation, but there is no character development, no meaningful dialog, and since any person with any knowledge of history already knows how its going to turn out, the plot really doesn't matter. Furthermore, the language and motivation of the characters resembles too closely those of modern times. I don't know how an author can make such an inherently interesting subject so DULL! I only finished it because I was on a plane and trapped without anything else to read.For those of you who like novels set in ancient Eygpt, I recommend Lynda Robinson's Lord Meren mystery series. These books are infinately more enjoyable, and so well written that I enjoy re-reading them, even though I already know \\"whodunnit\\". P.S. -- For another good historical series, I highly recommend Lindsey Davis' Didius Falco novels, which are set in ancient Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!!; Hard to put down!!! Romance!!! Suspense!!!!","review":"If you like history, if you like Egypt, if you like stories about people overcoming obstacles to become the best they can be, you will love this book. Mr. Jacq creates a believable timeline and provides enough detail to keep you interested. The characters are familiar because of the history, that is part of the charm of the book. You get attached to certain characters, while hating others, and yet other characters perplex you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for those who are curious about Egypt and the Pharaohs","review":"An entertaining tale on ancient Egypt by the time of Pharaoh Ramses II (circa 1200 B.C.).

I was entranced from the beginning to the end. Even my husband (who definitely is not a reader) enjoyed it. His description was, \\"Definitely not a For Women Only book!\\" Christian Jacq's astute ability to make his characters come to life and unique views of tying Ramses II into parts of ancient history was fascinating (even if not probable). I quickly logged on and ordered the remaining series. Now it's a fight of who gets the next book first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"Jacq is a wonderful storyteller. The content may not be 100% historically accurate - but, it is fiction after all! The book was fun and easy to read, and thoroughly enjoyable. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scraping the Bottom of the Pyramid","review":"I totally agree with the reviewer who identifies himself as A Reader From Troy. Cartoon characters exactly. Is it the fault of the author alone or the translator as well? Whoever has compared this author to Dorothy Dunnett should really have his head examined. Second graders would like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A biography of Ramses in a soap opera style","review":"Beyond the fact the history of the Egyptian ancient history is divided in 30 dynasties. I must recognize a shameful lack of knowledge of such important period of time.That said, its obvious that it is almost impossible for me to guess if what we are being told is 95% the fantasy of the author, or if somehow, most of the adventures in which Ramses gets involved, actually have a more less well supported background.Nevertheless, even if the \\"facts\\" of the novel are 100% fictitious, the same is fun to read and most probably you will end buying the other four books (not without feeling like a sucker for falling in such an obvious marketing strategy). It is like being involved in the drama of a TV soup opera. You know that they are extremely idiotic, its doubtful that any cultural growth will be achieved by wasting you time watching it. But there you are wondering who shot JR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a romance novel","review":"After reading Pauline Gedge's books (her books on Egypt are a must read), I was looking forward to more historical fiction on Egypt. However, I was sorely disappointed by this book. At first I thought it might be the translation - at one point Ramses says \\"Right on.\\" One would think he was a modern American teenager rather than 2nd in line to the throne! Reading on though, I realised that it couldn't just be the translation -Ramses ends up in a fight with some grooms in the stables - you would think they should recognize him from his dress and manner! I couldn't finish the book. Unless you like romance novel style books or you are younger, I would go with Pauline Gedge's books - start with \\"Child of the Morning\\" or Lady of the Reeds.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartoonish","review":"I would agree with the other 1-star reviewers when I say that this book is utter rubbish. Apart from the thin plot, poor writing style and erroneous historical facts, my biggest gripe is with the characterisation. The characters are so simplistic as to be cartoonish. Each is either a \\"goodie\\" or a \\"baddie\\" and as such it is impossible to become engaged with them.I thought it pertitent that Ramses should have a friendly, amicable lion as a pet, as at the time I had been comparing the novel to the Lion King and other great Disney cartoons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An after school special in ancient Egypt.","review":"While having a rather animated tone that could interest some that would otherwise run away screaming at the thought of a \\"historical\\" novel, the book carries it too far. Besides the afore-mentioned innacuracies (the contemporary presence of Helen of Troy, etc.)the novel's biggest problem for me was how the characters talked. It was like a after-school special set in Egypt, with Rameses coming off at times like a reject out of Dawson's Creek. Many of the characters were overly played as stereotypes -Seti as the father who never understands, the cranky older brother, manipulative ex, and so forth - to begin with, and sounding like petulant teenagers did not help the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scholastic reading club nominee...","review":"...or at least that is how this, uh, piece of historical fiction should have been marketed. The plot is a juvenile mystery in which the greatest of Egypt's pharoahs (albeit in a younger guise) and his friend, Moses (yes, THAT Moses), are the sleuths. The prose is moaningly bad even for the 'tweens crowd for which this novel should have been aimed, and the characters are riduculously flat and clich��d. It also offers little to no detail of society or daily life in those times thus failing to believably \\"set the stage\\" and transport the reader. If you're really looking for some decent historical fiction, try Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series. Not the same time period or topic, but you adults in crowd will not feel intellectually insulted with each passing paragraph. I rate this a one star only because I cannot leave half a star. Why would it earn even half a star? Spelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trip Back To The Ancient Egypth","review":"When I started to read Ramses: The Son Of Light, I thought the book was a little bit \\"slow\\" but the more I was going on forward reading it the more exciting the history was changing into.obs.: sorry my poor english"},{"rating":"1","title":"The first two were captivating but it's downhill from there!","review":"I bought this book because I'm interested in Egyptology but rather than reading just hard facts I thought I'd make my read a little more colourful. So I started off with lots of enthusiasm as I read the first 2 volumes. Half-way through the third volume and I was beginning to find the story a little over-the-top every time Ramses and Nefertari gazed at each other and felt their love. They kept rediscovering their love and their feeling kept growing the more intense.....it's was just too \\"corny\\" for me to handle. I know the book has a lot of history in it but I'd rather it wasn't told in a too fairy-tale manner. The good thing is that the story moves at a great pace....especially towards the end in the fourth and fifth volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid wasting your money.","review":"If this book took the French Reading public by storm then we must certainly wonder what happened to the famous French intellect. It is too bad that Jacq didn't bother to learn something about Egyptian history -- a university in Memphis?! The son of Seti I being set upon by stable hands?! Ramses needing a 'job'?! Is Jacq simply a fool or is he demented? -- ad nauseum, and that was only the first handful of chapters. The book is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most engrossing book I have ever read!","review":"Ramses, The Son of Light is great.

I can't wait to finish the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do The French Actually Think This Sort of Writing Is GOOD!?!","review":"I guess there is no accounting for taste. I am seeing reviews saying this book is suitable for a 12-15 year old audience. Yes, perhaps ones that are not very well read.If you don't have a good grasp of what good fiction is or what history really is about, these books are fine. However, if you dont want to insult your intelligence, my advice is don't bother with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a comic book?","review":"This book is so poorly written, it should translate well into a comic book or onto \\"the silver screen\\". It is a very shallow, historically inaccurate, trite little soap opera. Doesn't even come close to expectations. The translation must be the pits! Was this dumbed down for us Americans? Why not just say \\"peristyle windows\\" instead of \\"windows set high in the wall, to allow cool air to circulate\\". This book is written at the 12-14 year-old level. Anyone who actually thinks this is an accurate portrayal of Egyption culture is sorely misguided. Try \\"Memoirs of Cleopatra\\" if you really want to learn something. Glad I just borrowed it and didn't waste the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly, unimaginative and unconvincingly dull story.","review":"Written for the 12 to 15 age group, this book is a publishing monstrosity. Jaq makes almost no attempt to provide an Egyptian context for his story of Ramses. Can anyone imagine an Egypt without slavery? Jaq not only eliminated the institution but adds that all workers were well paid! The author's fanciful creation might work if the artifical world he created had believeability--but it does not. The author claims to be an Egyptologist, but if he is, then he has cynically removed virtually all cultural substance for the sake of creating a Hardy Boys view of ancient life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling and Exciting","review":"The Son of Light was a very thrilling and interesing book. This book was nothing near boring. Jacq is a very good writer that makes a person wonder. The Son of Light is a book that Jacq focus on a young man name Ramses. Ramses is a advance young man that is very mature at his age. Ramses explore a lot of diferent series of test to increase his mental and physical powers. Ramses is giving these different test by his father, to improve his stength. Ramses face many situations, such as his first experience with a female and other problems that includes his other friends throughout the book. Reading this book will make the reader want to read the other volumes of this book to see what exactly will happen next. I really enjoyed this book by Jacq and I find the book at a very good interest for anyone to read. This book is not boring at all, its thrilling and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good history; poor writing or translation!","review":"This book, and presumably the series, is worth reading for the history of Egypt from an egyptologist, but either the writing or translation is terrible.

It is written at a grade school level! Nowhere in the same league as other pieces of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Comments","review":"When I first looked at this book in the book shop, I think it is really boring ( because the cover isn't attractive and i think ' Ramses' is a boring topic ) so I decided not to buy it. But my friend say that this book is really amazing, so she lent it to me.After I have read this book, I totally agree with my friend. This book is so romantic and attractive. Although the beginning maybe a little bit boring, but you are unable to put up when you are reading it.This book tells about the life of Ramses and how he could be a pharaoh. The vocabulary of this book is quite difficult, so I think it's more suitable for those who are over 15 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixture of historical fact and contemporary language","review":"I was excited to find a novel based in Ancient Egypt written by someone who has an advanced degree in Egyptology. I was disappointed by some of the contemporary language used in the book. For example, when Shanaar walks into Ahsha's office and makes a comment about Ahsha having been promoted into a coveted \\"corner office\\". This phrase I equate with modern upward mobility, not Dynastic Egypt. This, I realize, may have to do with the fact that I was reading a novel traslated into English not written in English and it often happens that things get lost in the translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of historical fiction","review":"If you are going to read this tripe be sure you first have a background in history so as not to be taken in by this pure fiction.If you are willing to believe in time transporting so Hellen can stop by on her was home form Troy and Homer can lounge around Alexandria while he \\"writes\\" his stories.If you can swollow all that, you can have a ball with the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing!","review":"I picked up the book at a bookstore out of curiosity, and it has led me to an admiration to the style of writting and breathtaking plots.

The author takes alot of time in describing characters, in physical appearance and personality. This lets the reader incorporate themselves in the novel and pick up on their character traits as well as the character traits of others, as compared to Ramsees and his friends. The book also explores spiritualness without making the characters superhuman or unbelieveable as other books about ancient Egypt do. This book is good for anyone on the verge of maturing to adulthood, as well as those who are already adults and need to mature a little more. It shows that everyone starts out as a child, but we all grow up and mature eventually, whether it be in family relationships, friendships, or educational experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, transparent, and predictable","review":"Every author who writes about Egypt, usually renders interesting novels: Wilbur Smith (''River God,, \\"The Seventh Scroll,,) Margaret Georges(\\"Memoirs of Cleopatra,,)Pauline Gedge (\\"Mirage,,)Chalsea Quinn Yabro (\\"The House of LIfe,,). I find it very difficult to think that an author cannot write a decent novel about this fascinating country! Yet Mr Jaqc decided to drag his boring story in 5 volumes. He reminds me of Judith Tarr ( \\"Throne of Isis,, & others) who just cannot write a good novel even if they decided to write about Mars, or The Second Comming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Egypt in Hollywood","review":"Despite my rather disparaging one-liner description, I enjoyed this book. What it lacks in historical detail it makes up for in action and dialogue. It was hard to put down, and I even came away with a feeling for ancient Egypt, its mysteries, deserts and pharoahs. The language is definitely modern, and the author doesn't even seem to attempt to take us back to that time. Still Ramses II, Son of Light was an entertaining read about a young prince being groomed to rule a great kingdom against enormous odds. I will read at least the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramses for Dummies","review":"This book only works for kids (13 at most). Maybe it is translator's fault, but the language reminded me of a comic book. I guess I am used to the prose of Pauline Gedge who submerges the reader into the mysteries of ancient Egypt. Ramses is more of a fairy tale-like simplification with a primitive dialog that can be heard in a modern junior high school. (who could have ever called a royal prince a \\"dummy\\"! ) As I said, it may work for kids, but if you are over 13, don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Very dissapointing. I expected another bright book like Uarda but instead found a writing style similar to that of a 14 year old: poor in vocabulary, depth and wisdom and over-compensating with insignificant episodes one after the other.

And in light of the author's expertise, was disappointed by the amazing lack of detail in describing the scenes,time period, and customs of the people this book was supposed to be about. I generally approach reading historical fiction or a story set in another country with the expectation of getting some of the flavor of the culture and/or time period where the book takes place and this book did none of that. Furthermore, the characters seemed very 20th century in their sensibilities and shallow in their development - we were allowed to get into Ramses's head only to find there wasn't much going on. Was given the very negaitve impression that there wasn't much thought about the book going on in the author's head either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Being There","review":"If you love Ancient Egypt, you will love Ramses: The Son of Light. You can imagine Ramses the great king of Egypt and his wife Nefertari the beautiful queen that Ramses loved more than anything.

Definitely a must read for those interested in Egypt and her Pharaoh's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restoring spiritual sanity to abused Christian women","review":"This book was purchased and distributed by our local Domestic Violence Shelter to women who's faith stood in the way of their safety and sanity regarding whether or not it is God's will for them to live with abuse.

I am a victim and was concerned about what the Bible and the Lord would think about me having to get away of my husband because I was in fear of my life. This book points out specific scriptures of what the Bible says about husband's and wives staying together or apart and why it is okay to get away from your husband if he is abusive. I no longer feel guilty about having to get away from my husband. This is an absolutely fabulous book and I would recommend it for any woman who has been abused by her husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOKS GOOD, BUT VERY UNSTABLE","review":"I bought this Ab crunch and to my greatest dissapointment, I could not fix it without additional tools unlike other exercise equipment I bought at the same time.

There is quite a bit of Blondie and Garbage in this band, but I dont think their lyrics are quite up to par. Once I got hold of the album I noticed a lot of cheesy lyrics on songs like \\"Electro Boy\\" but heard a lot of great riffs that sound like ACDC.

It is not overly long as these authors' book on Bush vs Dukakis '88 election was. Well worth the hassleof buying used.Carter's lack of political instincts and his often contradictory personality (usually conciliatory yet capacle of pettiness and vindictiveness) are well illustrated here. The '80 primary elections are wonderfully covered, even minor candidiates such as Howard Baker and Robert Dole are covered. Teddy Kennedy's only presidential campaign is thoroughly dissected.

My fitness levels have improved drastically, and I have Amy to thank.Amy really is the the best -- i HIGHLY recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout-moderately strenuous for intermediate/advanced","review":"I ordered this because one reviewer claimed it was by far Amy Dixon's hardest workout. This may have been true at the time \\"Super Fit Bod!\\" was published (2009), but as of now, I'd say it's nowhere near the level of difficulty of \\"Breathless Body\\" at level 3. Still, it's pretty good--moderately strenuous for an intermediate/advanced exerciser. I don't use heavy hand weights since I don't want to bulk up my arms, but using them might make it more challenging if you don't mind that. Next time I will try strapping on a 20 lb waist weight for the no-impact sections to see if I can sustain a higher heart rate throughout. Be aware that you need a step--preferably a long, rectangular one, for this workout. Final judgement: Not super-intense as I'd hoped, but I'm glad to have this in my collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Least Favorite Amy DVD","review":"I love Amy Dixon's DVD's and her training style. However, this DVD fell flat for me. First of all, I didn't know I'd need a step bench (I just do the moves without it though), and I didn't feel the exercises were very inspired or fun. I didn't feel as sore afterward as I do with her other DVD's and for some reason I felt maybe the production of this one was rushed or not planned out as well as her others. I still use it, peppering it in with her other DVD's- mostly when I'm tired and don't want as strenuous of a workout- but it's not my favorite or one I'd reach for otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD requires a step bench and there was no warning","review":"I love Amy Dixon DVDs, but this one was very disappointing. There was NO warning anywhere on the DVD that a step bench was required. I like working out at home but I do not want to purchase a step bench to have to do so.

I finally got the thing put together (which is pretty easy), set the computer inside of it and the next instruction is to tighten the wing nuts around the computer. Well that really isn't possible so I did the best I could and it works just fine. I just wish there was some other way that they could build the holder that isn't so awkward. All in all I gave it a 4 because it works, but wouldn't really recommend it, I would look for something that will actually allow you to tighten the wing nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"CPU Caaddy","review":"Product was provided based on all the material I reviewed. I had read several reviews previously for a number of similar products and decided to purchase 13 of these units for a light copmmercial application.

One short coming is the small casters relative to the weight and size of the CPU's being supported.

Made it impossible to attached the wheels securely. I had to go to the hardware store only to discover that the threading in the items was not permitting the wind nuts to screw on fully. I bough several washers and hex nuts and managed to get the job done. Pity. The product is otherwise well make and looks fine and hold the computers well. Not suitable for newer, narrow slim profile desk tops as the minimum width is too wide to hold them surely."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Computer slides right out the back of this holder.","review":"Reasons this doesn't work:1. The holder is too small in length. You have to center the CPU in it and it doesn't stay centered because when you try to move the unit the CPU slides. If you have a small CPU it may be okay..but I bet it will still slide. There is nothing 'holding' the CPU in. Don't be fooled by thinking it will 'clamp' onto the CPU. It doesn't and if it is done too tight...when it slides it will scratch the CPU.2. The CPU when moved slides out the back. Not a good thing to have your system slide out and tilt..this may cause damage.3. Of the 8 wingnuts that came with it only 2 actually fit completely on. The others were manufactured with defects. I guess no one tests that part of the product before shipping. I needed to purchase my own.4. I am now looking for another one and feel I wasted [...] on this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Except for the Wing Nuts","review":"I read the reviews before I ordered this computer tower caddy, so I was expecting at least a couple of wing nuts that didn't fit. There were three, that no matter where I tried them on the various posts, they just didn't fit. I solved the problem by spending $1.50 at my local hardware. I took a wheel with me for measuring and got the right size. Then the caddy went together beautifully.It's very sturdy and easy to wheel. The computer doesn't slide around in it. I'd have given it full marks if it wasn't for the company's inability to include quality wing nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for heavy rigs","review":"I have a decently hefty CPU rig and I purchased this stand to get it off the floor. The stand's concept looks pretty legitimate, but in practice with my CPU it was flimsy and was difficult to fully squeeze to fit the width of the case. I was only able to get the stand to perfectly hold my CPU with the help of another person, however, taking it back out again requires two people as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job...","review":"This CPU caddy does what it is supposed to do. It is easy to assemble, looks good, and works well. I would not recommend paying more than $20 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a piece of garbage Don't buy","review":"The morons who designed this product decided to paint over the threads on the bolts that hold the assembly together. This makes screwing on the wingnuts by hand impossible. So I had to use a monkey wrench. And since the bolts were held loosely into place by the very same paint....the force from twisting on the wingnuts caused the bolts to freak free from the assembly. So now I have the assembly put together but I cannot tighten it to encase the computer. My hands hurt from squeezing the wrench so hard to put on the wingnuts.I think I got a returned product myself because I noticed that someone else used a wrench on my wingnuts - they were all dinged up.DO NOT BUY.

It is nice looking, though polished metal instead of flat would have been more to my personal liking. Regardless, I was able to assemble the stand and then bend the uprights ever so slightly to fit a very low profile PC. It is doing it's job nicely and it doesn't look half bad either. This is the only CPU stand I found that even came close to being able to do what I wanted to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs improvement","review":"The product looks great and functions well. However, putting it together and adjusting it to fit my computer was at best awkward. One of the screws/stems was(were) defective and I had to use pliers to tighten it.

The entry consists of a checklist of 24 chart-based technical indicators or conditions for both weekly and daily prices-- thus 48 items in all. These are explained, sometimes clearly and sometimes vaguely in 19 chapters. Altogether, it is one of the most complex systems ever published. Though it may or may not work, its \\"kitchen sink\\" approach makes it too complex to understand well, and if there is one requirement for a good trading system, it is that the trader should be able to comprehend what he is doing and why at all times.

Then they measure him with a tape measure and put in in a box with a chair, telling him they will send him off. This was bad taste, and disturbing to me and my kids.

That having been said, the gun that was delivered actually looks a bit better than the displayed pictures (the orange barrel is smaller/less noticeable).My overall impression: The gun looks good, as a costume accessory. When you charge it and fire it without batteries, the mechanical firing mechanism makes a decent (if a bit loud) automatic fire sound. But it doesn't fire AirSoft ammo well at all. The gravity-feed design feeds poorly, so any attempts at automatic fire really come out as intermittent sputtering of BBs.I would recommend this *only* as a costume accessory... if you want something that fires BB's, I would recommend you pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Bought this for my 12 yo...gun looks cool and has a nice weight about it.

Looked amazing on our new 55inch Vizio TV. Streamed the movie straight from an amazon app on the tv. Great comedy, would highly recommend to anyone who isn't afraid of a little language, and mature jokes.I also highly recommend his other shows and recordings. Louis CK is totally one of the best out there, and my personal favorite. Absolutely had to support him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louis does it again","review":"Another incredibly funny show by Louis C.K.This show made me realize that I needed to hit up his site and download his other material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"There are very few comics that can do jokes so well that it becomes impossible to imitate them because they do it so well. Louie CK is one of those comics. Through his comedy he talks about being a single dad at 40, the perils of having young daughters and a general disgust with annoying people. Louie CK has the appearance of what a man looks like when he is continuously sighing in desperation. It has been said before that while Carlin will never be replaced, Louie CK is making a real go at filling the void."},{"rating":"2","title":"My family's property is in this movie!","review":"I love this film, partly for its campiness, partly for the fact that it's about my hometown of Northville, Michigan. Well, a very bizarre version of my hometown. Very low budget, and a bit heavy on the \\"generation gap\\" references, but not too bad of a story involving misunderstood bikers, corrupt law enforcement officials, and vengeance. The opening scene is tense but ends in hilarity; there are a couple rather brutal scenes, and there's even a few homages, including a \\"Patton\\" speech in front of a flag hanging in a garage.If you are a fan of campy horror films, or just b-movies in general, this is a cult classic. Pick it up sometime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Northville Cemetery Massacre","review":"I'm not into these kind of movies anyway. Bought the movie because my husband is singing the last song at the end of the movie about truckers. But if you like \\"B\\" movies about Bikers then this is your movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars For Mike Nesmith","review":"The only reason I purchased this DVD was to hear the musical score written by ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith. Apparently, the producers of this low budget bomb approached Nesmith asking if he could create the score for free. He was so taken by their nerve that he agreed. It's the only redeeming aspect of the film. The acting - if that's what it's called - is quite painful as is the plot. The cover of the DVD boldly states \\"the ultimate biker flick\\". Thanks, but I'll stick with \\"Easy Rider\\". Anyway, here's a quick synopsis: \\"The Northville Cemetery Massacre\\" is a terrible movie featuring an interesting music score by the most underrated songwriter of all time.So just roll with the flow wherever it goes even if it rolls out of here.....la de da........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 2nd book","review":"I enjoyed this second book. It was not a disappointment and carried the same fire as the first. Strong characters with a great story and well developed land to have this little series in. These are great young adult reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judging a book by its cover","review":"I hadn't read a real tried-and-true historical romance in quite some time, and I have to be honest - I only picked this book up because of the cover! It caught my eye and I figured, 'why not'? And I'm glad it had such a pretty cover, because it was a very enjoyable read. There was a slight supernatural slant to it (it is the last one in a series about the Talisman Ring), but it was minor and you could really ignore it if you wanted. The characters were wonderful, and the plot (though a predictable romance) was fun and engrossing. Anyone who likes Julie Garwood, Catherine Coulter, Julia Quinn, or Amanda Quick will probably enjoy this book. I'll most likely read more by this author in the future, and would recommend them to anyone who's a fan of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Story","review":"I have been a fan of Karen Hawkins since she started and I must say that this last book is the best one yet. Karen has managed to take the precdibility out of Romance Novels. Granted the main characters always end up together but the road to that end is rarely predictible and usually very humorous. I found this book to be extremely entertaining and just a lot of fun to read and will have no problem re-reading it again and again. GOOD GOING KAREN and keep up the good work. I can't wait to see what you come up with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I had been waiting for this one to come out and complete the series. I was really looking forward to it. Karen Hawkins has a gift with dialogue and witty exchanges between the characters. I enjoyed this new installment in the St. John family series. Still, I don't think this is the best one. My favorite will always be Anna and Anthony's story in An Affair to Remember; that book was Karen Hawkins' best work, in my opinion. She outdid herself with the interactions between Anthony and Anna, and all the children added a lot to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would Marcus have to buy his own ring back?","review":"I shall be brief...why do historical romance authors come up with such stupid concepts for books? Ms. Hawkin's Talisman Ring Series have been hits and misses, the best the first, An Affair to Remember, and to me the worst (prior to this one) was \\"And The Bride Wore Plaid\\" because Devon was, in a word, a cad. Seducing woman (especially one's friends sister) with no plans to marry is in poor taste. In this story, the one that should have been the best and brought all brothers back for the story, is just wrong. The premise, that Marcus wants the family ring back that has fallen in to Honoria's hands, is made unbearable by the very simple fact that Honoria knows it rightfully belongs to Marcus so her efforts to force Marcus to purchase the ring are just morally wrong and there is no way to get around that in the story. That is the elephant in the room. One can not get past that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loving v. Virginia","review":"Have not read the book at all, but I just discovered while listening to oral argument in the 1967 case of Loving v. Virginia, that the Va. Asst. Atty. General used this book to justify a state's right to make interracial marriages illegal. He used this as part of his argument defending Virginia's law under the \\"rational basis\\" test, no less; the easiest level to lose on Constitutional grounds (for a controversial subject, that is; have to show that making the classification makes sense toward attaining some legitimate policy objective).Like the German lawyer in the film \\"Judgement at Nuremburg\\" cited Holmes in Buck v. Bell (\\"three generations of imbeciles is enough\\") to defend German judges' orders to sterilize people, this volume is likely useful at least as history of law and social science, showing us how completely wrong we have been, and the ability of courts to recognize that in real time.The Lovings won, after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance at it's best!","review":"My mother bought this album for me many years ago because it contained my favorite Frank Sinatra song: It Was A Very Good Year.

WRONG!! Shipped much faster than I expected and arrived as if it were new! Thrilled with the product and cannot wait to give it as the perfect Christmas gift!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"September of My Years\\" a truly outstanding recording","review":"A beautiful selection of songs hand picked during middle age as he was approaching his 50th birthday when recorded. Words in any review can't describe how wonderful these songs are interpreted by Frank Sinatra. His voice is deep in color and emotion. He does all songs with a commitment to the lyrics only he is capable of doing as an artist. Gordon Jenkins, as his conductor and arranger, is up to the task for this recording which is his finest work with Sinatra. Just listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Reprise years.","review":"This is without a doubt, and almost by leaps and bounds, the best Sinatra effort of the Reprise record label years. This cd holds it's own with the classics In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning(which is my personel favorite) and Frank Sinatra sings for Only the Lonely. Outside of those two sets, it may be better than any other of his Capital work, which is a very bold statement. Sadly, the only other dics which are on the Reprise label that are almost as good as this one are Ring a Ding Ding and Ol Blue Eyes is Back. If you can get these three dics on Reprise and then buy the Reprise Colection box set, then you will have all the Reprise you need. The Columbia Years box set is great if you enjoy really dated, but beautiful music. Almost anything from the Capital years is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sinatra album of them all","review":"I first bought this album when it first came out on LP in about 1965. I was in my mid-30s at the time. Even then, it moved me and went right to the head of my list of desert island disks. It has never moved from that position, and the older I have grown, the more it has meant to me.This is a perfect confluence of the right singer, the right repertoire, and the right arranger coming together at the right time in the singer's life. Sinatra was the greatest interpreter of American popular song of all time, and in my opinion, at least, this album is quite simply the best thing that he ever did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Sinatra's Top Five Albums","review":"Sinatra's work with Nelson Riddle has always overshadowed his collaborations with Gordon Jenkins, but nothing with Riddle can top the conceptual power of this recording. I first heard it as a teenager, and its wistful, reflective mood affected me even then. It means so much more to me now. Harry Nilsson has said that no contemporary singer could come close to what Sinatra accomplished here, and he's right. If you like the mellow side of Sinatra, you must have this CD. It is, quite simply, a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crooner","review":"What can I say about Frankie that hasn't already been said? Loved to see him in the musicals.

I gave it to a friend and bought the remastered release.I am quite disappointed. The vocal track seems to over-emphasize many sibilants, in particular the T's on the end of words.This is most obvious on the track \\"Last Night, When We Were Young\\" and is quite distracting.

This song left me transfixed and enraptured - I went out and bought this CD the next morning. Start with that song, but give the whole album a listen - it's very worth it. After all, some of the best art in the world is that which takes effort to enjoy. Laughter and Lust fits this bill nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Mostly Hollywood.

(It means \\"table,\\" as in Round Table, and no, it's not an acronym.) Then, you have 12 chapters: one for each month. Each chapter begins with some factual/historical information, explaining the origin of the month's name, when the month was established, and more. Then there's a puzzle for each day of the month. There are 366 puzzles in the book -- one for each day, including Leap Day. The percentage score for each puzzle of how many Mensa members got the puzzle right is a nice touch -- it lets you know how you are doing. The writing is rather dry, so don't expect much humor. Highly recommended for those who want to keep their brains sharp by doing daily puzzles.Word game lovers may seize upon the excellentTHE Book of Word Games: Parlett's Guide to 150 Great and Quick-to-Learn Word Games.

This book is a compendium of numbers and lists as well as fascinating info from this step-child of the WWII theaters. The book seems to give a lot more ink to Australian/Canadian/British forces in the Pacific than any other I have read, i.e. it appears to be a book written by and maybe mostly for our Aussie, Brit, & Canadian cousins - not TOO much, just more than I expected. That was not info that I needed for purposes of researching my Grandfather's service in the Paciifc Theater with the U.S. Army. Also, it did not go into great detail about each island hop in the campaigns as I was hoping, but it does offer lots of information that I have never seen in print elsewhere.

I lost all of Winter, Precious Things, and Silent All These Years within two weeks of buying it. I've had pages fall out of sheet music books before, but this was absolutely ridiculous. I can't even review whether or not the songs contained were well-transcribed or playable, simply because the book didn't remain intact long enough for me to learn any of the songs. I haven't had this problem with any of her other books, and maybe I just had a defective copy, but I was truly apalled at the low quality of the book's printing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull.......","review":"In these four movie sets from The Midnight Horror Collection, there is usually one film thats fairly good, while the rest stink. This set, by far, is the worst collection to date.There are bad movies that entertain, then there are bad movies that never should have been made. That's this set, save for one.The one that's just ok is The Dead Sleep. It's a bizarre story that tends to lose itself from time to time in it's complicated plot. It's about a guy who has been dead for five years that dreams his way back to his daughter to explain clues he left when he was alive and was haunted by his own ghost, which in reality he was being dreamed of as the ghost five years later.

I ordered these based on the picture and they worked beautifully.

I examined the tip, where the prongs join to the shaft. A yellow, thin, PLASTIC housing ferrule joins the prongs to the shaft, and that's what broke. Two of the prongs were mashed against the other two, making it useless.

The zombies in this film are ghosts that are awaken because of a ceremony that is preformed at the beginning. The special effects are some of the best I have every seen. A woman crys blood, another throws up her own major organs.There also is a scene that involves an angry father,a screaming daughter, a terrified and helpless boyfriend, and an industrial mounted electric drill. From what I gathered from this scene, it looks like Fulci actually used a persons head to pull this fx off. It is outstanding. So if you like Fulci, and enjoyed Dawn of the Dead, and Zombie, and can realize that this film can stand on it's own to be totally original, and have nothing to do with the other two prior, then it is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reliability","review":"I bought this drive about 4 months ago.

Also, it is a predictably sleep-induced film involving poor characters, unintelligent story, and \\"yeah, right\\" moments. Everything in Child's Play 2 was nonsense. Child's Play 2 isn't even a horror film at all. It's just the boring same-same from the first part which failed to live up to the circumstances surrounding the events that occurred in the film. Even if Chucky was turning into a human, it would have been more believable that the doll can actually be killed just the same like suffering the effects of getting thrown out of the car windshield.

The original was more of a serious thriller while this one had a stronger approach for the slasher genere. Filled with great black humour and Chucky delivers many hillarious one-liners.

But for children, this concept is truly horrifying. Growing up, I was surrounded with dolls (like Cabbage Patch) that resembled Chucky in some way. The thought that one of these dolls could come to life and steal your body could scare any child. So, I still am freaked out to some extent by this movie. There's a great deal of shock moments, where Chucky just pops out of nowhere. Brad Doriff does a great job voicing Chucky, he's had some great roles, including his antagonist role in Blade.

It does take some getting used to though, especially after 20+ years of pivot head razors that slime your face as you shave. It takes a bit more moisture and some finesse so there is a bit of a learning curve to using it. Things to consider: Trying a cheaper model to see if its for you before buying an expensive model. Trying an adjustable model that may be easier on your face.

I'm sure there are better razors but for the money this one is fine. I used a DE razor years (and years) ago. I had forgotten what a close shave you can get. I did have to relearn patience while shaving and not to just flick the razor across my face. I've only had a little razor burn and that was when I was trying to hurry. If you want an extremely close and comfortable shave, this is the way to go. Disposable razor blades don't even touch this razor for closeness. And I can purchase hundreds of good DE blades for the same price as just a few disposable blades. The razor is well made and is pretty hefty.

I obtained a copy of the book at Dr. Margot Weinstein's book signing at the Ohio State University bookstore. Dr. Weinstein, who co-authored the book with Dr. Norm Miller, provides the reader with practical information on how to break into the commercial real estate field along with comprehensive information on US-based colleges and universities with real estate degree and certificate programs and comprehensive information on real estate trade associations and professional organizations a person can join. The book also contains professional advice from and career profiles of successful realtors like Arthur Adler, Marshall Bennett, Steven Good, Peter Linneman, and Nancy Suvarnamani, to name a few. A general glossary of key real estate terms is also included. You can't go wrong for $20.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Real Estate Career Education & Resource Guide","review":"About 30% of this book is nothing more than one page profiles of Universities and Business Schools that offer real estate degrees. These profiles provide the name, address, and phone number of the school and a paragraph that describes the course of study, and the degree offered. All of this information is easily found on the Internet by visiting the university and viewing the school catalog. About 20% of the book consists of one page summaries of real estate associations and their contact information. About 30% of the book presents resumes' of individuals involved in real estate, and includes a page about their thoughts on real estate. The remaining sections of the book consist of a small glossary of real estate terms, and a handful of pages that describe the real estate career. This book was a disappointment and will collect dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Elementary","review":"The Bennettmarine DVD on Garmin GPSMAP 5xx Series is too elementary to be of any value, I tossed it in the waste basket.

It is a simple way for children to learn how to count and understand many different activities. Because it is illustrated, children can learn what a certain word connected to an activity means. Which would make it great for small children learning how to read or count. Not to mention it's a really cute story and will have parents trying to get their older kids to read it. Example: My mom.

Very nice and still giving you the feeling of the opera it self but in more modern way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all like Trans Siberian Orchestra","review":"These guys are really great, and I would hate to see anyone scared away because a couple other reviewers compare them to the TSO. While TSO deliver leaden, workmanlike readings with average musicianship, the EVOC deliver soulful, virtuosic performances with great flair and finesse. The rock guitarist (Ben Butler) and drummer are superb in EVOC as they truly understand classic rock but have the chops to dliver the opera material accurately. I think Tyley Ross and (especially) Ann Marie Millazza are two of the finest vocalists in any genre I've heard. In addition the arrangements are genius. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this works!!","review":"Kudos to the EVOC! I am a classical music nut, but my first love was RnR (which I still love, but very particular). I was delighted to find that this group's concept actually works very well. Not at all like, say, BOND...who are an insult to both classical and RnR, and to music in general.The EVOC is great fun, yet still beautiful when called for. They really know and respect the importance of artistic interity in music.The array of instruments used is highly impressive. I love the idea that they are introducing this music to many young people who may not have gotten exposed to it otherwise.Another great group who is committed to this cause is the Ahn Trio.I'm not a big opera person, but a great aria can be wonderful.MUSIC IS THE BEST - FZ"},{"rating":"2","title":"East Village","review":"I enjoyed the music and the contemporary style or interpretation of classic opera music as performed by this group. A very nice complement to the same music performed in traditional style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but ultimately unsatisfying","review":"This is unquestionably a talented group, but to what end? There is a surprising monotony to their arrangements of these classic opera excerpts (start softly, build to power guitars, soften again, etc.) They will remind you of Queen.The revelatory moment for me was listening to the La Boheme aria Che Gelida Manina. If you know the opera, a decent recording of this area will move you. I would be surprised if the EVOC treatment had a comparable effect on anyone. It's pretty, but it's not moving. In the end this recording comes off as a novelty, without much depth. Too bad, because it seems like a lot of heart and musicianship went into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"Anybody who likes opera and good voices should not be misled by the title.

Hate, hate, hate this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting Musicality","review":"I picked up this CD after hearing the group on XM's Fine Tuning. The songs were unusual sounding to say the least, but the purchase seemed like a reasonable gamble. Even after receiving the CD, it took some time to get used to hearing classic opera pieces set in a very modern style. Certainly, people used to the \\"proper\\" way of performing Puccini are going to be more than a bit miffed by the EVOC version of Nessun Dorma, but most of us are going to get used to it and will come to appreciate their music quite a bit.I also noticed that his CD garnered a mention in Stereophile's \\"Records 2 Die 4\\" this year. Nice job on producing such a musical CD that interprets classics in such a new way, EVOC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this!!","review":"If you have any idea of buying this C/D, think again. I can say without reservation that this is probably one of the worst pieces of junk I have ever heard. It is clear that this group of no talent wantabes decided to capitalize on the current favor that opera bands are seeing in the music world, ie the only reason I can see for opera company in the album title. A really bad,bad,effort and something anyone who appreciates good music should avoid. It is an insult to the ears and I can now see why they won't allow buyers to listen to tract samples before purchasing...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Gem","review":"Wow, I just re-bought this on CD and I forgot how good this one was. People knock the John Lawton era albums, but I think they are actually better than the final three with David Byron. Heep got a shot in the arm with a new vocalist, and Trevor Bolder's bass work is outstanding. 'Wise Man' and 'The Hanging Tree' are probably my favorites, but 'Who Needs Me' is good also.

It has such a warm, distorted sound prefect for blues music. I bought it to sing out of because I wanted a lo-fi sounding vocal mic. This mic isn't low impedance so not too much power, but once I used a DI box it explodes my vocals. Amazing! I gave it a four out of five just because it's a 1/4\\" instead of a XLR. I know, I know it's made for amplifiers to power it. Nevertheless, this mic kicks ass and is built to be beaten and can take it. I've dropped it a few times.Just a side note, you cannot find a mic holder for it. So, take an old mic holder and melt it to fit the shape of the mic, then use velcro and bands to secure it down.

This is at the bottom of the pile, let me tell you! It's way TOO big and HEAVY to play for any length of time and make the moves that give your playing its tonal range. The earlier magnetic resonance 520D mics like James Cotton used to play, were interesting for their sound quality, but the Astatic D35 and other Shure mics, out-perform this \\"brick\\" by far.....The new Peavey might be a winner...I tried to sell my Green Bullet, but couldn't even get $50 for it on a popular auction site. Now, I wouldn't give you $10 for this \\"collector's\\" gem, it doesn't work for performers, but looks authentic enough ha ha! The joke is on whomever thinks this is a cool mic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for the serious scholar of Roman culture","review":"This is not a book for those mildly interested or even highly interested but untrained in scholarly discourse about Roman culture. The focus is on sexuality and some of the best known and respected scholars have contributed: Marilyn B. Skinner, Amy Richlin, Sandra R. Joshel, and Judith P. Hallett stand out because their pivotal work on Roman sexuality already. However, it is the essay by Holt N. Parker, \\"The Teratogenic Grid\\" that provides the field with an understandable model of sexuality in Roman culture. Most of the pieces focus on men, something relatively new in the ancient field, but there are also a few that deal specifically with women. As in any academic work, there will be theories you love, some you see as valuable, and others you disagree with. But this not for someone unfamiliar with the research and changes in the study of Roman sexuality to dive into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really spiffy music, I liked it a lot!!!!","review":"At sixteen years old I like a lot of different types of music (rock, alternative, country, rap, pop, and oldies); however this CD really suprised me!!!

You dive right into the story, getting a thorough view of the location and meet more than a dozen characters in the first 30 or so pages. The pace really never slows down and you're halfway through the book before you know it. There's just a touch of humor everywhere, and Inspector Sloan trying to cope with everyone's oddities, but it never goes so far into the silly as to spoil the mystery at the center of the story.

He played Charters. I became a fan of his and Michael Aldredge's immediately. Of course since he's British and I'm in the States, I could rarely see any of his TV work, but I've collected his audio tapes/CDs for a long time.There's a cliche about Richard Burton's beautiful voice - he could spellbound people just by reading the phonebook. Robin Bailey is in that class.Now, Stately Home Murder is a slight mystery, with lots of extraneous detail to pad it out. But in listening to Bailey's voice, as he essays dozens of accents, both male and female...it is just a lot of fun to listen to.I highly recommend the audio version of this book.BPYour Government in Action: July 2010 (Miniscule Guides)Your Government in Action: August 2010 (Miniscule Guides)My blogsThe Rush Limbaugh ReportSarah Palin News ReportThe Friends of Mr. Cairo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Bailey Performs The Stately Home Murder","review":"Robin Bailey does a fine job of performing a good Catherine Aird mystery: appropriate and easily distinguishable voices, no difficulty in creating credible voices for both sexes, and quite good characterizations. Catherine Aird's book lends itself to a droll style both interesting and amusing. The mystery is piquant: who stuffed the body into a suit of armor (after killing it).

It featured a slideshow (with real slides--this was 1991 I think) and he joked to the parents that his message wasn't that he was going to steal their kids and bike them across the country, but that you can do really cool, fun, educational, interesting things if you open your mind and dream. It was a good message, and of course my parents bought me the book, which is a great read. I remember being really enchanted with the whole idea, and the story is told with humor and detail. There's a good mix of history and geography, as well as annecdotes in which they meet all kinds of people on their trip. I identified with the kids, but also with the adults as they questioned the wisdom of their idea, making it a good transition from kids to adults books. As a middle-schooler I read it several times, so I recommend it for adults and kids alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good and interesting book","review":"i thought that this book was very good. i liked the idea and admired the courage it took for anyone to attempt such a thing. i would reccommend it to adults and kids both, because it seems like a good way to expirence America from your own home. kudos to John for his good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"I have read several bicyle touring books but this is one of my favorites.

In the film industry, the nicer lenses can be so heavy it takes two people to lift them(zoom/telephoto), let's you know you are handling something expensive and precious.

To me it seemed that the author was jumping around all over the place. Particular annoying are the references to WWII, which don't really underline any of the arguments brought forward.The sketchy characterisation of the \\"swordbearers\\" does not warrant the title of the book, since for lengthy passages the book dwells on the larger events and then halfheartedly tries to return to its intended objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESTROYED after ONE use!","review":"After ONE use, the finish on this pan started peeling off in soft little black balls.

Much to my surprise, used properly and applying only a dab to the inside of a heated shaving mug to build a lather, I am still using the same tub 6 months later. I find the smell very refreshing, with a subtlety that wears nicely through the day. Also, I notice my stubble comes in a bit softer after continued use of this shaving cream.Well worth the money, considering I'd have blown through 3 cans of shaving gel in the same time.

It can be applied directly to the face with the hands and rubbed in, or you can use a badger brush to develop a thick foamy lather.Don't be afraid to use this with your 20-blade super-extra-mach-ultra razor, as you *will* notice a difference in shave quality. Of course, this cream truly shines when used with a very sharp double-edge safety razor.The scent is very mild, and develops complexity as it's whipped into a lather.

At one point the main actress tells the little girl \\"Remember, sharing helps get you into heaven,\\" which is the complete opposite of the true gospel message - that we are saved by faith in Christ, by grace, not by works. Anyway, I don't mind secular Christmas movies - I'm rather fond of White Christmas, Charlie Brown, and many others. I just wish that this movie had completely left out any references to God instead of trying to pander (rather poorly) to a Christian audience and in fact saying things that are completely contrary to the message of Christ and Christmas.

He's actually like a real life cheating husband except worse because after he tries to tell her that all those other women didn't mean anything to him and that it was all just S-E-X he mentions that he only really cared about or had a deep relationship with one of the women he cheated on her with. I wish she could have gotten a divorce from him because I could see her a lot happier with some other guy than forever stuck raising her idiot husband and his mistress's son.

He's like a tiger woods except with a wife that can't legally leave him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stab in the heart - Infant Son from Mistress???","review":"From others review, I thought the story would be great. Dont mind guy who tried to reform or wooed back his wife. As every human are not perfect.I somehow felt SICK when Emma Rawlins show up with his infant son. It is not that I mind John decided to raise his bastard son in the house afterwards. But from my understanding that son was more important during that time, why the writer not have just girl from Mistress and boy from the real wife to compensate the reader's feeling?I could not keep this book (I normally collect all books I like and less like) but this one I donate it to local library the next day after I purchased it (I read through the nite). I will never touch this book ever. I read books for pleasure, not to be left feeling angry for all week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Hero ever","review":"John was the worst hero ever. He did not care one bit for his wife. And yes he cheated and cheated on her. He also have a baby with one of his mistresses. The mistress was the most sympathetic character.If you want a good read about a cheating husband please skip this one. You may want to pick up a good Mary Balogh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheating Rake","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I started reading it, but however all I ended up feeling was anger and frustration.In the story a husband and wife have been estranged for years until the day that the husband, John, has to provide an heir. To achieve this he then seduces his wife back into his bed. Never mind the fact that he married her for her money, lied about loving her, cheated on her with several mistresses, and then never even felt remorse or apologized. Nope that was not enough. He had to have a bastard child to boot. This character and the terrible ending are what made extremely me angry. Viola, the heroine, on the other hand just plain frustrated me. He wronged her so many times but a few make out sessions, blackberry jam, and a poem later she was back in his bed and in love all over again!So in conclusion, please save yourselves the money, time, and emotional upheaval, and just don't buy this book. I definitely wish I would have done just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Horrible Ending\\"","review":"I lot of what I enjoy most about reading romance novels are the happy endings. I was so dissapointed in the story when the mistress shows up at the end. It really took away from the reconcilation that was happening between John and Viola. I think it would have been a better story if the mistress faded out of the story with no attachments. There was a lot of forgiveness envolved in the story....but enough is enough. I don't read romance for that kind of drama. That was a bit upsetting for me. This book is not a keeper. I gave it a two because the ending destroyed any likes of the entire story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first half of the book needs work...","review":"The plot of this book really interested me and I was looking forward to reading this. I think that LLG did a great job with the Hero, I saw definite character growth. Even though he was a \\"cheater\\", he didn't think that he was a bad person, he was just incredibly self-absorbed.I think she could have used the first half of the book for more \\"realizations\\" rather than wasting it with the fighting and temper tantrums (especially the heroine) that weren't sexy, funny or even interesting. I think the heroine did some growing up throughout the book but I felt like LLG flipped a switch and the heroine went from hating the hero to loving him again.The last third of the book redeemed itself and overall I liked the concept, but I think it had more potential. If you can get through the first half, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't. Take. The. Adultery.","review":"It was really hard to read this book because of the husband. He doesn't deserve her, he REALLY doesn't deserve her, and she, despite whatever he calls her - unforgiving ice queen and what else - has the most unbelievable patience and kindness and forgiveness on the planet. It was sickening. And that is not to say that love isn't about forgiveness, but really, if I were her, I would have shot him and been rid of him... the epilogue nearly made me sick. I can't say the writing isn't good, because Guhrke isn't a bad writer, but there's just something so distasteful about the man that it is unreasonable to like him. The last line of the book is about how a man like him could be so lucky - and really, he doesn't deserve it at all. I was left with a very bitter taste in my mouth that the epilogue just cinched, so read this at your own peril - I didn't have a taste for tolerating adultery before and definitely don't have it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaters - not in romance","review":"I do like Gurhke. Having said that this book was one of her worsts for me. The writing style was great but I hate and let me say again hate cheaters. If I pick up a romance book I want it to be about the H/H and not those people commiting adultry. Whats so romantic about that. And John was going to \\"woo\\" his wife to get back in her good graces when did that ever happen. I just can't say anything that I did like about the book. But if you like Heros that cheat then this may be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, fun, and humorous facts about Texas history.","review":"A Treasury of Texas Trivia by Bill Cannon is a great read.

I have about 23 plastic cards and an assortment of paper cards in my wallet, and I am just able to get it to snap shut.I have had my wallet for a few months now and it is holding up well, no torn sleeves from removing and replacing credit cards yet.

These are not sold locally, but you won't find a better value at a local store. Usually these credit card holders last a short time for me in my back pocket.

This is a very good product, and the seller has dealt with me fairly. I recommend both."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD CONDITION WHEN ARRIVE!","review":"I was so surprised there are so many good comments on this genuine cow hide leather credit card holder.Honestly, i don't expect much from something so cheap, but i didn't expect it to arrive scratched and looks used.

The price was right and the shipping was very quick. Have noticed a split in one of the more frequently used sleeves, but I would expect this for the price paid.

Instead the film is edited to cut to a new pose in which the model person magicaly reappears in a totally different postition with a different mat angle and different props.

Plus, the poses do not flow together (which to me is one of the most important aspects of yoga). The whole dvd is very \\"stop and start\\" and really too easy.

The poses are very simple, but I didn't find much of a stretch in them. The biggest problem is that they jump from one pose to another without any transition. One second you are up against a wall standing, freezeframe switch screens, and the next second you are sitting in the middle of your mat. I was constantly stopping the dvd, moving all of the stuff and repositioning every few minutes. Also, there were way too many props needed: mat, 2 blocks, 2 rolled blankets or pillows, chair, etc. I got more of a stretch and workout from moving all of the props around inbetween each pose.

First, the yoga studio is old and really gross, it looks like a moldy basement. For some reason I think Yoga is more relaxing in an open, fresh and clean atmosphere. The photo on the front is certainly deceiving! The other huge problem is that you have to do most of these poses up next to a wall, which I don't have. I read the instructions closely before buying, and you do need a few things like a blanket, etc. I have all that, but no wall! It is annoying. Now I can't use the DVD at all.

My major grievance with it is the ceaseless product placement. There are so many better ways of describing a pair of shoes, a suit, or a wrist watch than the brand name. All that name dropping as an alternative to actual description is just lazy writing. If no one has told John Jeffrey this, someone ought to.

Many of its chapters are insubstantial, bottom drawer stuff, with leaps from one rag-bag topic to another without any coherent intellectual argument to pin them together. The book is also astonishingly one-sided: 'what went wrong' -- a bizarre and patronising concept in itself -- is laid entirely at the door of Lewis's version of 'the Orient' and there is no rational critique of European and American imperial and colonial engagements with its various peoples. Fortunately there are many other books which provide much better critical discussions of the political cultures of the region. At the (welcome) end of this tired polemic I was left with only one question: How is it possible for a man to devote so much of his life studying a culture for which he has such visceral contempt?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OLD STUFF","review":"This is a very disappointing book. It is an anthology of old lectures going all the way back into the 1980s. The material is disjointed with much redundancy.

Only the last and short chapter deals with the subject of \\"What Went Wrong?\\" (Text that was published as a magazine article.)

He spends an inordinate amount of time reviewing the social, economic, artistic, and governmental differences of the Ottoman period but says next to nothing about the early Islamic empire. I was very surprised he did not mention, but for one line, the great Sunni/Sh'ia schism which is fundamental to any Islamic study. Instead Lewis asks a great many questions but gives no answers. His final paragraphs are laden with there-is-always-hope reasoning but that really does not do for what purports to be a scholarly work. All in all, quite disappointing though an interesting read for the uninitiated. Just don't expect Lewis to give you the answers he claims to promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-eminent Authority Examines Middle Eastern Decline","review":"When I saw Bernard Lewis, a Professor Emeritus at Princeton University, in an interview on television, I was impressed with his depth of knowledge of Middle Eastern history, culture, and the Islamic religion. This book was written before September 11th, and the predominant thought I had reading this superbly written analysis of what events and developments had led up to the decline of Middle Eastern culture was: If we had only known... Bernard Lewis, at 85 years of age, has become the most highly sought after authority on the Middle East as a result of September 11th. The book examines issues Lewis deems central to the decline of the Middle East as a world player, and leads the reader into drawing his own conclusions based on a more thorough understanding of the underlying problems. This book is a MUST READ for anyone wanting to know the cultural and historical facts which undoubtedly played a part in the terrible tragedy that resulted on 9/11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not taking sufficient Western responsibility","review":"Bernard Lewis's book is an exercise in blameshifting away from the West and towards the Middle East. He rightly points out Arab responsibility in reaching the current situation, but uses his substantial knowledge to understate the importance and influence of the West in shaping the current and recent political make-up of the region. His description of religious rigidity is overexaggerated and he seems unaware both of the substantial amount of critical Islamic scholars present in the Middle East and the limited influence of religious law in practice in most 'Islamic' countries. His regular thesis of Arab 'rage' and disappointment over lost status is part of an easy thesis that tries to partially simplify the Middle East-West tension to hysterical psychological undervelopment on the part of the Arabs. For people interested in finding out about violent forms of minority muslim fundamentalism, this is a particular bad read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blame the Victim","review":"Bernard Lewis very subtly blames the Muslim World thatit is not like the West, and ignores Western aggressionfor the past 400 years.

In fact Turks and Arabs hate one another. The Ottoman Empire was more the continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire than it was of the ArabStates founded by the followers of Mohammed. The success of the Ottomans was in part at the expense of the Arabs.

They believe they are the recipients of the perfect revelation from God (in the Koran). They can see how wealthy the Western world is, and our wealth, combined with our being infidels (for the most part), makes our opulence difficult to explain. A powerful economy needs freedom, so it can self-sort itself into an efficient arrangement.

It merely says Islamic countries used to be world-leaders, and now they're pretty backward.

It's sketchy, it's theoretical, and there's little filled in the middle of the ideas.It'll say things like, \\"Modernity came from Christendom during the 18th and 19th centuries and changed the very way life was lived in Islamic countries.\\" Then it gives no examples of what it means by that.I applaud people who want to learn about Islam, but I recommend they buy a different book than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"And this is the West's Greatest \\"Interpreter\\" of Islam?","review":"Better start looking a little harder as we're in a lot of trouble. It was bad enough attempting to read this book wading through poor grammar and writing style, but then the worst part is Lewis' attitude itself. He is so condescending to Arabs and Muslims that he loses all authority over his subject matter. Lewis is a classic white Orientalist, in that he exoticizes and infantilizes the \\"brown\\" people he is purporting to study. It is a chore to read a book by someone who holds in contempt the people he is writing about. Reading this book will give a reader with no background in the Middle East a truly warped perspective. The book is wonderful for massaging the racism of its white target audience, but contributes little in depth or substance to the study of Arabs and Muslims.

This book will inform you on Middle Eastern culture, but spends more time talking about subjects such as Western influence on Middle Eastern architecture than on what has gone wrong.

Mr. Lewis for all of his accolades is not a very good scholar or he is more then willing to distort the truth to justify his point.

Corrupt, self-serving leadership, more interested in enriching themselves rather than transparent decision-making.

Unfortunately, before he gets to this soft conclusion he subjects the reader to a really long trek through Middle Eastern ancient history.

He makes the claim that Muslims have been in some intellectual or cultural \\"lack\\" or are \\"inadequate\\" because unlike the hyberbolic \\"west\\", they do not listen to Beethoven or read Decartes. As a reader, I feel that Lewis has missed the mark in understanding much about thinking critically about how polarized the Islamic world has been throughout history. I am sad to say that this text leaves you in the vacous battle of the West/ East or in this case, Islam and the west.

The \\"What Went Wrong\\" in the title could be applied to his doing only part of the job on this subject.He seems to carefully avoid telling his American readers anything that might lead them to examine themselves, their country's policies, etc. In other words, he skilfully points his finger at Them most of the time, and thus avoids the possibility of being the target of any brickbats in an overheated time.

It doesn't analyze the roots of the current gap between Muslims and the rest of the world, but simply gives a series of historical accounts without any clear thread between them.I think Mr. Lewis should have done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The failure of modernization","review":"Lewis is the dean of Middle- Eastern historians. In this work he attempts to understand why most of the nations of the Middle East failed to meet the challenge of Modernity. One major source of this was the traditional relation to Women. Another major source was the closure of Mind which would not admit that the West had developed in ways which the world of Islam could learn from. A sense of defeat and inferiority did not lead to honest introspection and reform, but rather to Denial. The increasing sense of failure enabled the retaining of power by bureaucratic and governmental elites which worked not for the benefit of people or nation as a whole, but rather for their own narrow clan and group interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling","review":"The author obviously knows his subject well, however, most of the book does not really address the question raised. For the most part the book is a history of the culture and political developments of Islamic peoples. For 90% of the book he discusses literature, music, political institutions and military campaigns. The failure of Islam to enter modernity is the same failure that has afflicted other nations and empires: failure to separate church and state, failure to develop capitalism, and failure to nurture democracy. These are the same shortcomings that have brought down or stunted the growth of other nations and empires. Turkey has shown us that a nation that is 99% Moslem can also achieve modernity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free concert is one of the best rock and roll movies ever made!","review":"...if you can call this rock and roll that is!

The workout is a good one, but the trainer doesn't explain what the moves are much or how to do them very well, and a lot of them are squat-based or involve you pointing your head somewhere other than the TV. I kept having to swivel my head back and forth from the TV to me and kept missing changes or not performing some of the exercises right because I couldn't see everything that was going on.I think you'd probably have to watch this entire tape before you tried doing ANYTHING, and that involves more sitting, which is what I'm trying to get away from doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"need to be in shape and have a sharp eye","review":"This video is kind of hard because Kim gets straight into the workout without any instruction on the moves.

First of all, she's narrating most of the video. You hear her talking but when they show her, her lips aren't moving. SECOND.. she goes into moves with no warning or instruction on how to do the moves until she's well into them. This routine was just a MESS! I didn't get 5 mins into before I got frustrated and yanked the DVD out of my player. DO NOT waste your money. Get Kathy Smith, Denise Austin or Patrick Goudeau's REAL step workouts, REAL fitness instructors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recomend.","review":"Anyone who has taken a step class would be very annoyed with this video. The steps are pretty basic but she does a horrible job calling them out. It's a voice over and she call them as they are doing it on the video, leaving no time to prepare yourself for what's next.

There are 140 birds listed, a very small number for Florida.It has a good introduction and adequate bird data. The birds are sorted by their colors only. When the male and female species are significantly different than each other, they are covered in two different pages. This practice makes the book thicker, but also makes it easier to identify an unknown bird. It also has smaller pictures to help identify some of the birds in flight, etc.If you've been bird-watching for a year or so, you're possibly outgrown this book.

Tony (Grint) inadvertently gets caught up in the action and is soon being trained as Victor's prot��g��. The twists and turns this film then takes ends up with some genuinely funny scenes and I was surprised at how often this had me chuckling out loud.Rupert Everett and Martin Freeman round out the impressive cast in this film and everyone manages to pull of the dry humour with ease.

Blunt's character strolls through life stealing and conning everything she needs without ever getting caught. )The comedy built on these foundations just didn't work for me.

His hobbies include learning French, chess, and encapsulating his furniture in plastic.Rose is a light fingered free spirit. She had a copy made of a Rembrandt, made a switch and double crossed a buyer. Victor is supposed to kill her, but after a few failed attempts because of her Inspector Clouseau ability to avoid a bullet, he has become an admirer of the girl and in a twist of fate becomes her protector with Ron Weasly as his apprentice.While the story was humorous, it lacked a certain uniqueness.

Also, The fact the main character (the actual actor) had arthritis and could barely hold a pistol let alone actually aim it long enough to kill anyone was totally unbelievable. It pulled me out of the film. They actually had a hand double in the foot massage scene and one other scene when he was assembling a firearm.

The cast of characters is very diverse and I actually for a minute or two forgot to associate Rupert with Ron Weasley.Quick summation of the plot: congirl tricks art collector into buying a replica of a Rembrant, he finds out and hires assassin to take her out, the assassin develops feelings for her after observing her daily activities (it's pretty funny to watch her pick pocket and steal without breaking her stride), when he fails to kill her the art collector sends his goons after her to finish the job, the assassin sees her about to get killed by one of the goons and saves her life. Then the story gets a lot more complicated and interesting from there. Ok so maybe it's not THAT original.

They may be, or maybe not,it doesn't make any difference. The aggaravation they give their customers make that a mute point.. After the camera arrives, you can use it about a half hour and that's it. Just try finding the parts you need to actually use this camera. I was willing spend hours on the 200 page manual but not hours on the internet trying to find the missing essential parts ( no one seems to sell both the charger and the battery and everyone wants to sell subs.) And Nikon is no help at all. They're willing to sell incomplete cameras through lots of internet suppliers but will only offer guidance to old style retail stores for parts, none of which are anywhere nearby. .tom"},{"rating":"1","title":"dial mode conked out after a year of usage","review":"when i decided to get a digital camera, i went to the camera expert and that for me was NIKON. it was april 2003 when i purchased my first digital camera NIKON COOLPIX 885. after a year of using it, the dial mode just conked out and won't function anymore. i am very disappointed, i had to ship my camera to the only service center in my country. I shouldered the shipment plus the replacement spare part which is going to cost me $100 plus. it has been two months with follow ups in between and i was told by the service center the spare part has not arrived from Japan yet.of course, after only a year of using this camera, i feel i did not get my money's worth.i expected a lot from nikon but they failed me. for my next digital camera purchase, i will get PENTAX, CANON or SONY instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"CoolPix885 - Pretty cool!","review":"I just got the CoolPix 885.

I am getting used to the new world of digital pictures and I have some more learning to do.I would recommend that anyone getting a digital camera (especially if it has movie mode) upgrade to at least a 128MB memory card.

The menu system of the D490 is simpler, but that is because the 885 has a ton more features so more menus. The 885 is smaller, lighter, & fits in the hand better. Finally, I like the integrated lens cover of the D490 much better. Overall: Nikon 885!Pros: Great pictures, 3MP, ergonomics, uses Compactflash cards, USB file transferCons (hence 4/5 stars): (...) for 2 rechargable batteries, recharger, & 128MB Lexar 8X Compactflash card (which I highly recommend, otherwise wait 12 seconds, with a Sandisk CF card, before you can take another picture, instead of 5 seconds with the Lexar 8X)"},{"rating":"2","title":"nikon 885 A great digital camera","review":"I just purchase a Nikon 885 and I'm really happy with it, I bought it at Best buy for 599.00 and they give you 64meg card for free. You can get the camera cheaper online but I prefer to buy items like this site on seen. It's very easy to use the menus are user friendly and the pictures come out great. It's definately a lot smaller than it looks in the picture. I definately would recommend using rechargeable batteries and have a few set aside if you plan on taking a lot of picutures. The 16 meg card is pretty much useless so I would recommend at least 64 megs.

Nice and small, easy to handle and easy to use. It's a great multi-role camera which can handle point and shoot but is great for \\"growing into\\" when you need manual controls or need some creative freedom. The main criticism I have is the stupid lens cap design (should be integrated) and the over-saturated reds (can be overcome in software).

Aside from the introductory explanation of methodology, there is nary a word of English in the book. This encourages students to begin thinking in French, rather than learning to translate to French. Of course, it is not a practical text for someone learning French on his or her own, as it is intended for the classroom setting.

The protagonsit, a reporter, has to deal with the dilemma between his job as a reporter and his role as a citizen. This conflict adds wonderful insight into his character and his relationships with the secondary cast. The book is a fairly quick read, but is well written and definitely gives the reader something that one is not acccustomed to in these types of books.

Instead of focusing on the Overlook Hotel and all of ghosts and with the kid's special powers, he mostly deals with the father's alcoholism and tries to explain why he's acting the way he is, not what I would consider to be scary. You should only read the book to compare it to the movie, which was rewritten by Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson, to see how lame and unfrightening the movie would have been if it was written directly from the book. I would recommend Carrie instead, it is scary well written book by King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have I missed something?","review":"Perhaps the concept of a haunted hotel simply doesn't work for me, but I can't find a single thing I like about this book.

But no single part of this book--the hotel's history, the wasps, Jack Torrance going crackers, REDRUM, the lady in the bathtub, the 'scary' hedge animals--none of it did anything for me. And the thing is King's other books are so scary--\\"It\\" is probably one of the most frightening novels ever conceived.

I have re-read it many times since, and I am glad to report that it is still as frightening to the adult as it was for the child. This book teems with terrifying images and situations which I won't describe so as not to spoil the suspense. This was what scared me as a child. What scares the adult on top of this is the emotional collapse of Jack Torrance and his descent into madness. The relationships in the family triad are brilliantly depicted. This is a novel about the horrors of alcoholism, insanity, and child abuse, which are of course only compounded by the supernatural evil these characters become enmeshed in. This is my favorite King novel and I would really like to know what happened to Danny Torrance when he reached adulthood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXITING HORROR FICTION","review":"I have read Stephen King's novel for a long time.

One of my favorite books for many years now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dang good","review":"King's first novels were undoubtably his best. Out of those, I must say that The Shining is truly a standout. What makes it most chilling is that it's told mostly from the perspective of a child who knows too much. In this book, King is able to give us a fast-paced story without excessive character development. I would call this more suspense than horror. Either way, it's a dang good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic King......","review":"This is a Stephen King classic, and is rendered my many fan's his best work ( i disagree, however, with 'Salems Lot & a few others being his best work IMHO). What is so suspensful about this book is the fact that you don't know when the main character, Jack Torrance, is going to explode and turn into the homocidal maniac Mr. King describes indrirectly in great detail he is. While this is a disturbing and very suspensful, it does tend to drag on and on a bit, sagging the story line - which was the only reason i brought it to 4 stars. Great novel - highly reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"I read a few Stephen King's work such as Carrie, Needful Things, Cell, Different Seasons, Thinner, Misery. I am not sure why I didn't start with some of his stronger work like The Shinning. So, I went into The Shinning with a very high expectation. I am glad to say that it met my expectations and more. In his other works, I find that he is long winded and spent a lot of time on details of each character. And so I was hoping that The Shinning isn't like that. And it isn't. Unlike his later works, The Shinning strike a balance between character development without going into all the unnecessary details. It was so encouraging that I went and bought 'Salem's Lot. I hope this early classic delivers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King at his twisted best!","review":"I must stay in the Stanley Hotel....if one night within its walls inspired this horror classic, then it has to be on my bucket list.

King takes the ordinary and makes it extraordinary.....and it's maddening. You can almost feel the isolation, and your sanity slipping away.

In the movie, Jack Torrence had an ax that he chopped doors down with. In the book he has a croquet mallet. That is another thing I learned...you can hit someone alot more times with a croquet mallet then with an ax....OUCH!

I saved this for later while I was working my way through his stuff (Dark Tower I-VII, Dreamcatcher, Cujo, Needful Things, IT, Tommyknockers, Skeleton Crew, Dark Half, etc).Jack swings from likeable to tragic to terrifying over the course of the story, in addition to the other elements of life in the Overlook Hotel that mirror his inevitable slide into insanity. At times, you identify with his hatred of Wendy constantly nagging him for sins of the past. Other times, you see Wendy's POV as her husband intentionally distances himself from the family.Very few novels today would tackle child abuse so frankly and openly, in addition to the themes of isolation, despair, and a cycle of violent, alcohol-fueled destruction. It's an amazing book, and should be required reading by anyone who loves great characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am 13, and this was THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!!","review":"I have read a lot of books, ranging from Stephen King to John Grischam, Dean Koontz, and many others, however SK is my favorite author, and this is my favorite book. The spooky feeling of getting into Danny and Jack's fellings, and the repettitive rythym of which they drew connections to thoughts the had earlier, was an absolutely amazing asset to the book. Other books I have read by SK include Pet Semetary, and Misery. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Stephen King Book","review":"This was my first full length Stephen King novel, and it was great! The character depth and developement is outstanding, and the slow infiltration of Jack Torrance's mind is riveting with every detail. If you choose to read this book simply to scare your wits out, it might do the trick (Although, after becoming a full fledged Stephen King reader, I have come across scarier SK books), but the real joy of this book is the character development and Danny's chilling experience with the Overlook. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes Stephen King, or wants a scary book with depth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"If you are debating over whether to buy this book or not, debate no further! Buy it, sit with your back against a wall and the door in plain sight! This is the best novel of any genre I have ever read. The development of the characters is phenomanal, and the way Stephen King holds together the compelling story with basically only three characters is the most amazing feat of writing I have ever read.The story of the Torrence family and the ordeal they face at the Overlook hotel is not one you will forget. I borrowed the book off my sister and was so impressed I immediately ran out and bought my own copy.The scene with the hedge animals is one of the scariest I have read. Stephen King creates suspense marvellously and scares the pants off anyone who dares to read it. He also understands the power of a person's imagination and uses this knowledge to pull off some terrific terrifying scenes. Buy it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST IN THE WORLD.....EVER","review":"I loved this book so much because it was exciting and thrilling. When the family has to go up to the mountians to look after the Overlook Hotel for the winter, Danny has visions that things are going to go wrong.

I try for the hook that will make a person want to read this book.A man and his family move into a Colorado hotel in the winter. The man is the caretaker of the empty hotel, and soon weird things begin to happen. King's description of the topiary (sculpted shrubs) is wonderful. A shrub in the shape of a lion keeps moving when the man isn't looking! Talk about a creepy hotel, and every body in the family keeps doing the wrong things.You won't be able to put down this book.

I had first seen the Kubrick movie and I was scared to death. I had to read the book. I was surprised at the differences. As I got further along in the story, I felt I was inside the minds of these three characters. The dillusions, the voices, the ghosts, the masks. When I completed this novel, I was still thinking about it for hours after. What struck me as the most frightening was that somthing like this COULD happen! Not the SHINING that Danny possessed, of course, but the mental breakdown of this man, stuck in a huge hotel for months with no one but his wife and young son. The mind is a powerful force. It can make you believe things that aren't real. You'll hear things that aren't there to be heard. You'll see things that aren't there to be seen. King goes into a lot of reality with this book, and the mind can be the scariest monster of all. I HIGHLY recommend this novel as a first KING read."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Peter Straub says, probably the best supernatural novel..","review":"...in a hundred years.And yet, it is so much more than a horror/supernatural novel.King's writing is excellent, easy to understand, nto overcomplicated, and so you can power through it easily and quickly.The characters are great, and the way Jack Torrance's ever increasing madness is described is masterful. It's a fantastic book. Simply.The mood is distinctly claustrophobic, tethered with hints of dark depression. However, the hope which shines through right at the end is wonderful.The beginning of the book tends towards being a bit slow, but that's fine, as it admirably sets the scene and mood, which is something all books need. And the ending is stunning. Probably the best ending King has come up with. Simply great.I can't really think of how to describe this book...so i won't. Just rest assured that if you like a good exciting read, this is definitely the one for you. Haunting, atmospheric, scary, chilling. Read, read, read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deffinate must read!","review":"The Shining will sweep you up and wont let you down until you finish it.You will find it gripping and hard to put down .King does a great job in this book.His descriptions of the characters and the hotel.I would hate to spoil this book for the readers so I'm just going to tell you read this.You really need to go and buy it or go to your library and read it.You don't want to pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"All work and no play... something something.","review":"Stephen King at his best is cheap, smug insight. The Shining is no exception: alcoholism is exposed as a hidden, world-consuming monster. It's one of King's best attempts to be \\"literary\\" -- many references to classic literature, very effective pacing, and a larger vocabulary than usual -- but many scenes tip his hand and the ending utterly destroys any success the book had achieved.Stanley Kubrick's movie, only very loosely based on the book, is much more considerable, really raising lumps in the throat in some scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"This was the first SK book I ever read, so I was excited to see that it was available in audio. I loved this book. Not so the audio version. DO NOT listen to this book on a long trip. It will make you fall asleep. The story is still awesome - but I would have preferred it be read by someone with a little more interest in their voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"slurp smack gulp snort pop belch wheeze slop moist","review":"I dony like campbell scott's phlegmy, lisping, lip smacking, nose breathing performance. The c, sh, sk, t and p sounds are harsh , shrill and overwrought. The s sounds like a hissing snake. He over enunciates every consonant in a ridiculous manner, placing more emphasis on perfect diction than on the meaning or nuance of the words themselves. overall this recording is a hideous mangling of king's classic. I wish stephen king had read this himself. He always does the best job. campbell scott should never be allowed near a microphone again. actually he should never be allowed to speak to anyone again, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie instead","review":"I read half of this book in 2008 and had to stop because I was so bored. I decided to finish it a couple months ago and wish I hadn't. The decision to finish The Shining led me to one of the gravest mistakes of my life; I read the book IT. I have heard so many people sing the praises of Stephen King that I figured the Shining was just a bad fluke and decided to read IT because of all the regards it has received. The Shining is not a fluke; Stephen King is just a boring author that doesn't understand the genre of horror. Maybe these books were good back in the 1980's when horror sucked. I won't go into the actual details of the book because they are way too ridiculous. Watch the movie instead; Stanley Kubrick actually had vision for this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"G-R-E-A-T","review":"This book was simply 'GENIUS' b/c who had the imagination to think up something this great?? Nobody but the 'THRILLER KING' himself. The only part I didn't like about this book was when Danny was in the maze-thingy and all those bush things came alive that was scary oh and also that part when Danny saw the word 'REDRUM' on his wall. Oh Then there was when Danny went into that room ( was it 207?) and there was that corpse looking thing that was the scariest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"A True Masterpiece. This book is a powerful combination of everything a true horror novel should be. It is written in a unique form that allows you to not only allows you to hear and see what the characters are doing and saying, but allows you to hear their inner conscience and soul feeding their minds with evil thoughts. Jack Torrance's inner struggle keeps you in a state of great anxiousness and apprehension and as the isolation of the hotel has its effect and starts to change him, you find that the more twisted and evil he becomes, the more pity you have for this mere shadow of a men, twisted by cruel fate.An exceptional piece of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Stephen King!","review":"This is a great book esp if you like Stephen King. It's a must read! You will be on the edge of your seat once you get into the story which I must say is thrilling from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic King.","review":"As always; an enjoyable read. King will always keep you turning the pages without stop. Looking forward to my next King book. Fortunately there is still enough to go around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and frightening","review":"Great Stephen King novel. It is different from the (excellent) Kubrick film-- more character development, alcoholism, and abuse. My only complaint is it is a little bit long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Psychological Thriller","review":"This is the best book I have read by Stephen King and it should be considered as a modern masterpiece. As I said in the title, it is not so much a \\"horror story\\" as it is a psychological drama. King takes his time to set the mood and introduce us to the world Jack lives in. At the same time, strange things start happening in the hotel. As these bizarre events begin to unfold, Jack's mental state deteriorates. It doesn't have a lot of chainsaws and screaming women, but King convincingly pulls you into this vortex of madness that is absolutely chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected and more.","review":"I have always been a fan of Stephen King yet never read The Shining. It did not disappoint! Truly a timeless story and one of King 's classics. It fascinated and terrified me at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece!","review":"When innocence recognize the evil, then you are in the world of Stephen King. You can only resist this tale if you have nerves like iron. The film has not much in common with the book. I'd first see the film before reading the novel otherwise you'll get disappointed of the film, which is not bad. You ask why I've given the book five stars? Because there aren't more stars to give! You ask yourself what REDRUM is? READ THIS NOVEL or you'll never find the solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I don't know what to say. Great book, plot, and characters. It takes place in a hotel that a family is watching for the winter. Some weird things begin to happen and before you know it Jack Torrance is trying to kill his family! It starts a little slow, but picks up fast. Many scary events go on inside this hotel, it is guaranteed to thrill you! I highly reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GROWING EVIL THAT DEVELOPS MORE EACH PAGE... SUPERB!","review":"This book took me 2 months to read (it had 447 pages), but it was worth it. There is never a really boring part, but there are really exciting and intense parts. The characters are described and developed to the fullest point and their personality just seemed to click with the story. It is better than the movie. It has a lot more subplots to it. There are more explanations as to why Jack Torrance tried to kill his family. It is not as stupid as some parts in the movie. There is no \\"HERE'S JOHNNY!\\" or ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY. This book focuses on real terror that keeps you wondering what will happen next. The woman in the bathtub in room 217 (not 237 like the movie) is described further, even who it really is! I would reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining-Stephen King","review":"One of the scariest books King has ever written, The Shining is a must read. Ive read this book three times, and always find something new and exciting. The Overlook Hotel holds some of the most sinister forces youve ever encountered. As usual, King takes on the job of not only opening new doors to the supernatural, but depicting the mental demons that chase the everyday citizen. Jack Torrance is an alchoholic father who takes his family to Overlook for a nice peaceful getaway. Little does he know, this will be the setting for the final confrontation against the evil that lurks behind every corner and every suite. Read this book and you get the whole King package: magic powers, evils of the human mind, bloody twin girls, moving shrubs, and ghosts popping up everywhere. REDRUM!! Read with the lights on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but Unbelieveable","review":"I thought this book was interesting in the beginning, but after a while it got a little wierd. The wierd part was the dacing robot, but the book crossed the line into bazzar when the alien spacecraft landed in the suburban community of Shaker Heights, Ohio. Super Terrific, but strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King does it again,DOC!","review":"The Shining is Stephen King's very own pet monster.If Stephen King writes a cinch scarier, I think I'll move toTanjunkarang,where there aren't too many closets, dark corners or graveyards.If you're going to read THE SHINING alone, good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not one of my favorites","review":"I've read many of Stephen King's books, but this is one of the ones that I disliked. The book had a slow pace until like page 300. I mean the book is more about Jack's Alcoholism than the hotel. Also it didn't have that Spephen King feel. The entire book is boring. The kid has nothing to do with the book. So the hotel wants him so what whats the point of that? Anyway this is the worst Stephen King novel I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Of God..","review":"This book is just.. amazing. A masterpiece.. my favorite book by Stephen King and my favorite book ever.. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"I thought the movie was great, but the Audiobook is fantastic. The reader does an excellent job and takes you on an amazing journey. If you like the movie, you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Kings best.","review":"If you loved the movie then you will love the book even more. King creates characters that you instantly fall in love with and care about, no matter what they do. For example, in the movie you do not get to fully understand the love he has for his wife and son. In the book you get to fully experience his life before and after the hotel, and it makes for a much better story.King also creates amazing scenes where you do get scared, and that cannot be found in many books these days, and anyone who loves King books knows what I'm talking about.If your looking for a good story or your a constant reader you need to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book ruled!!! REDRUM, MURDER, REDRUM, MURDER!!!","review":"This is not King's best, it's his third best. When I read this novel I was so hooked that I missed a couple of days from school just reading this book. I, as a big King fan, firmly suggest for you to read this incredible work. But expect the novel to have a different ending from the movie. I could see why King was so upset at Stanley Kubrick for his adaption. I would be upset, too. First of all, the movie was extremely boring, second of all, it seemed as if the movie was a whole different story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The scariest roller-coaster ride I've ever been on.","review":"I've read every Stephen King novel and short story, and, next to Christine, The Shining is one of the best King novels I've ever put in front of my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shining - Excellent, Scary and Spell Binding","review":"You know I have seen both movie versions of this novel, and folks I just have to tell you, they just don't do justice to the book itself. I read this book back in 1977. I was so hooked on it, that I started to read a few pages to my husband one night and it got to the point where he had me reading the whole book out loud, while he sat infront of me with a constant wide eyed look. I strongly suggest that you read the book, there is no comparison. After you do, I guarantee you will not want to waste any time in getting another King book to keep you charged up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love some of King's but not this one","review":"I think S.

If your are looking to start reading his books I would recommend Carrie, The Dead Zone, or my all time favorite The Stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, confusing read.","review":"What a terrible book. There was a lot of pointless, boring drivel in the book. I was actually quite surprised that something so awful could have been written by Stephen King. From October to May, the Torrance family has to take care of the Overlook hotel with no communication to the outside world.. except for Danny's 'shining'. The idea behind the book is pretty good but the story is terrible. It jumps from past to present without the reader even knowing that. I was really disappointed when I read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most primitive writing that I have ever read.","review":"Stephen King's writing has gotten to a point where is obvious that he running out of ideas. He is clearly just writing for the money.

I was home alone and I had to STOP and wait till my husband got home. I'll never forget it. I was with Danny all the way...WHAT A RIDE!Advise: Do NOT even bother with the movie or judge the book by the movie. The movie was a disgrace. Jack Nicholson was perfect BUT everything & everybody else was dead wrong. It didn't jive true with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Normally a big fan of Stephen King's story telling","review":"Something about Stephen King's style of story telling has always drawn me to his work - both the horror genre and otherwise. Although The Shining is one of the Stephen King classics that helped build his fan base, it just wasn't written in a voice that was true to the characters. Much of the story is told through the eyes of the telepathic 5-yr old, Danny. King failed to portray the language and thought processes of a child convincingly. The reader is forced to perceive Danny as an adult's interpretation of how a child would speak and think."},{"rating":"2","title":"book cover","review":"The cover is different then what was received.

The book is a classic,a masterpiece a lovecraftian cry of horror in the unexpected places . The characters are not caricatures as in many horror books,but every-day real-life people . King is playing our chords of fear like a virtuose . He knows where to strike,and knows the impact.If you consider yourself a fan of this kind of literature and havent read this book,then you must have been somewhere in Alpha Centaury the past 3 decades..A recommendation : read the book first!!then go see the films."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most amazing horrors I've read yet","review":"I love this book, there, quick and to the point. I really love this book, the story, the characters, the setting, everything. The first time I read it, I was engrossed from the first word. The slow descent into madness, the way the house was affecting Jack, the ghosts, or were they ghosts? Everything about the story is great. I've read it eight times now, each time as good as the last. I've watched the film and the made-for-TV movie, the first movie is good, the new one is okay, but the book is the best. Great detail, characters that seem real and a story that keeps you going to the very last word, and then maybe rereading it all over again, just in case you missed anything. If you're new to horror, then this is the book to start with, if you've read it before, read it again. But you could never be a reader if you miss this book out, it really is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book ever.","review":"The Shining is the first Stephen King book I ever read, and even after reading many more books--some his, some not--it remains my favorite book ever. It not only scared me, it conected with me deeply. The movie with Jack Nickolson in it is also my favorite movie. I didn't read a new copy though, I read an old one that had a kind of magic to it, which added to the experiance. By the way, my real name is Krag Jerry Kerr, not June Elain. That's just a spoof."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Stephen Kings' Well Written Book","review":"The Shining is one of the well written books but not the \\"masterpiece\\" but ranks up there; with so much suspense and horror that leaves one clinging to this book for it is indeed difficult to lay this one down once one has started to read this novel. For terror lies within and without as Stephen King is known for in his Horror / SyFy / Thriller Novels and Series it is no wonder why this became a movie itself. Of one can attain the original publication as I had which I regret selling it; for it indeed is a \\"Classic Modern Day\\" Horror book that is exceptionally well written where one as implied is unable to lay this book down until the end.If you read many of the 5 star and 4 star reviews; many have provided you the implications of what lurks in the shadows of this novel. A must-have for all Stephen King collectors..."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Stephen King book","review":"This is the first book i have read, that was written by Stephen King. I have to say I was not disappointed, the book gave me something that most horror movies lack these days. A sense of love for each character and a sense of fear. We see the pain and rip in the family, and we feel for Jack even when he has gone insane. The scenes with Danny were creepy, I member having to turn the light on after reading this. While we never truly learn of why the hotel is so evil we do get enough information to feel happy with the ending.All in all i recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Well worth the price for the book.

Everyone thinks that the \\"theme\\" of the book is Jack's alcoholism, and how he abuses Danny, but I don't think that is the real meaning of the book (he hardly abuses him anyway). The meaning of the book? I'm not sure. I think it could be interpreted as many things. Maybe that powers like Danny has can save but also can kill, or maybe only that it's not safe to leave people in a hotel for 5 months! I think this was one of his best books, and if I could finally get through the blasted movie (it's paused before he goes into the bathroom!) it would be better--(the movie focuses on the alcoholism way too much, but other wise it's a fairly good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come play withus danny","review":"This book is excellent.

I thought that the story dragged a little in the middle after they got to the hotel, but before the snow really started to fall. But once the story got going, it was pretty fast-paced up to the explosive ending.There are many King books that I liked better than this one, but this is a good story with good characters and is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love them","review":"My favorite song is for the life of me!It reminds me of when me and my boyfriend were together and he sang it and it makes me cry everytime i hear it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The only reason I rated this 1 star is simply because I liked NONE of it.

I just couldn't believe the change The Wallflowers went from this non-musical talent, to their awesome album, Bringing Down the Horse.This album was so bad, the only thing I enjoyed about it was the dog on the cover. The music sounds like the music from those old black-and-white cartoons, you know, with the pianos, because that was all it was, pianos, and boring vocals.

This first album is a very \\"blues\\" \\"soft rock\\" type, but in any form it is still loveable and danceable. My top song would have to be \\"Shy of the Moon\\": it just has a great sound.

I had to use a sharp knife to open up two of them enough to insert the next track piece. Very cheaply made and not much fun at all. It now just sits half contructed under my son's bed taking up space because I don't have the heart to throw away $20..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy assembly!","review":"I just ordered the ham-trac for my little robo hamster named Einstein, a couple days later it came! I opened it up and assembled it quite easily. I was scared that if I disassembled it, it might break (other reviews have said), but so far so good. The *pegs* that connected the parts together were a little hard to connect, but I managed it. I thought that his ball was a little small for the track because it wobbled from side to side, but I love how he runs lightning speed around and around the track. Another problem is that when he *goes* it sometimes gets on the floor, but I can easily put something under that. THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This was purchased for our Teddy Bear hamsters. It works as advertised and was easy to put together.

She won't run on it for any significant amount of time and runs slower/with less enthusiasm than when she is allowed to roam. It does however, save me from having to hear her run into everything possible,keep her accidents out of unwanted areas, and does to some extent keep her safe (not running into things = guarantee the ball won't break open.)Overall it just isn't the same as running all around out in the open and it is very obvious that my hamster strongly dislikes being confined to a loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and longer!","review":"I found this one online. I bought the ball first. Later I saw a hamstrac in store. So I thought it would be nice for my hamster when I'm cleaning his cage. Now he can run in circle, and I don't have to worry to find him after cleaning. I saw in store that only has 4 pieces, so it's really a circle. But as you see this one has two more pieces in the middle, a little extension for a dollar more.Only you can't put your hamster to long in the ball. At least mine doesn't like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Added Fun","review":"The track is easy to put together & a bit of added fun for a small pet, although in Australia we have Guinea Pigs and they are quite long so not such a good fit for them to be inside the ball.

Not much. The story has been so altered as to take all the life out of it. Supposedly this has been done to make the story more accessible to young American readers. To which I reply, let the young American readers work their way up to Wind in the Willows under the tutelage of parents or teachers who love the real story and then give the original version of the book to the children.

That older version has been replaced by the Miles version, however, which is not unabridged. I discovered this by accident when I ordered it for my classes--believing I was getting the old Scholastic version--and found that the version my students received bore little resemblance to the one I had.

Maybe it wasn't \\"pure\\" reggae in the minds of some people, but it was inventive, catchy, and performed with energy and respect. You can't ask for much more from a band. The songs here were not short pop singles, but exercises in musical adventure and abandon. The band stretched out and got in a groove (\\"Madame Medusa\\" --- oh yes!!!), and then into a dub vein once in a while, and then off into another mezmerizing trancelike sequence of tunes, some with a pop bent and some pure reggae. Many people will say of an artist that \\"Their First Album was their best\\" --- and in this case of UB40 and this album I think that's very true. There were some other very good UB40 albums after this one, but the brilliance of these compositions made it an almost impossible task to top.

Although the logs do not move much during the period you can observe the slowly changing patterns of the flames as they dance over glowing logs. The roar and crackle of the fire just add realism to the fireplace scene. Except for a brief 30 second introduction, the crackling fireplace movie loops continuously for an un-interrupted show. There is no optional music, animations, fireplace screens or other distractions, just the relaxing beauty of a real wood crackling fireplace. The picture quality was recorded at standard definition (320p/420p/NTSC), not high definition (1080p/720p/HD).

I'm not impressed. It sucks. Ben is great, but his albums have steadily gone downhill since \\"Whatever and Ever Amen\\".Unfortunately it all boils down to songwriting. Ben sounds great and the music SOUNDS like I should like it...it just falls flat most of the time.It almost sounds like Ben is trying to be Elton John back in the 70's.

The non-DVD side refused to mount, making it impossible to transfer the songs to my iPod.

Ridiculous! If they can't even guarantee that it will work, why bother selling it?

Although the little blurb is correct, this picks up right where Rockin' the Suburbs left off.Ben exhibits a nack at making almost anything sound emotional and heartfelt. Whether it's calling someone a Bastard, or describing getting wasted, he tacks on a bit of tear-duct to every song.My favorites from this disc surprised me, to be honest. Bastard, You To Thank, Landed...they are all good songs. But the real good songs here are Gracie, Trusted, and Time. I can't describe it really, I just feel it.

So, since this albums release, I sort of expeced the disappointing follow up to a great album that \\"Unauthorized Biography...\\" delivered. I couldn't have been more pleased when I listened for the first time. It's true... this album doesn't rock as much as \\"Whatever...\\" but I wasn't expecting that. It's full of great piano work and Ben's clever, thoughtful, often humorous lyrics. I found myself enjoying \\"Bastard\\" right from the start & each new song as much as the last. The albumn is fast paced enough to keep it interesting and keep it from becoming background music.Most good artists draw inspiration from their personal lives & as those change, so does thier music. The good ones roll with that rather than trying to recapture the sound they had when they were younger. Ben is rolling pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DualDisc technology is LAME.

Folds listeners who prefer his more crazy piano playing may be turned off by his new album, but his piano playing remains magnificent. Landed is the best of example of the gorgeous piano playing skills that Folds possesses. Some other underdog tracks on the album include Prison Food which has a simple yet catchy piano part, and has a great rock/drum set towards the end of the song. Jesusland also has a wonderful piano opening, as well as great background strings. Other noteable songs on this CD include Late(Great song about the late Elliot Smith), Time, Gracie(Wonderful piano), Trusted, and Give Judy My Notice. You may have to listen through this album a few times, but true Folds fans will grow to love it.

The most interesting part of the story is that of Herr Keller, Paul's piano teacher, but because of Paul's inability to consider anything outside himself and his own piano playing, Keller's journey is dismissed until the final pages.In short, unbearably annoying and solely about failure. I only hope to deter any poor soul contemplating buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Australian Gold","review":"I read this book in Year 12 at high school. What I liked about it is the pursuit of higher achievement and the reality that life has its share of victories and disappointments. The fact that the book has a slightly pessimistic ending should not be taken as a negative. The truth of life is that there are endeavours we would have all liked to have enjoyed greater interest and success in, and this book allows for the presentation of the good and bad that is featured in a lifetime. The fact that he has a wandering eye approaching mid-life may only mean that he THINKS his life could be better; an oversight a person can sometimes fall into during stages of frustration.Nicholas R.W.

The sound quality of this live recording is poor, including a constant hissing noise in the background. It sounds like it was recorded from a seat in the auditorium somewhere. Perhaps it should have been donated as a recording to a jazz archive or to Evan's alma mater as a historical artifact, but should not have been released as a commercial product. A much better live recording from a similar period was the Buenos Aires Concert Album. If the Paris One and Two concert albums are ever released on CD, and are produced to audiophile standards, perhaps those would be worth considering, but Homecoming is the low end of the spectrum.Thank you.Steve Katz"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Moment","review":"\\"Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings ... recollected in tranquility.\\" William Wordsworth.This recording allows us to share a singularly gifted player's celebration of the joyful, transcendant experience jazz can be.There are other recordings that offer noteworthy interpretations of the songs or better aural quality and yet, despite the sonic distance of the recording device, you couldn't possibly be closer to the artist.Buy the recordings mentioned by other reviewers for the music.

One also learns about aspects of Western culture one may have forgotten: such as, that musicians were commonly supported in Europe by their patrons who were wealthy dukes or had other hereditary claims. Also I learned that Handel visited Italy spent the latter part of his life in London and grew quite wealthy; that Bach was happily married but never wealthy, and that he lived in many different German cities; that Mozart was not rich at all;that Haydn visited London; that Tchaikovsky was prone to nervous ailments. In the course of reading this book I borrowed the following CD's which assisted me in my understanding, as well as being enjoyable listening: Schumann's \\"Songs For Children\\"; Tchaikowsky's \\"Symphony #6 (Pathetique)\\", several Beethoven piano sonatas including the Appassionata and Pathetique, Handel's \\"Water Music\\"; Mozart's opera overtures, Haydn's \\"Surprise\\" and \\"Military\\" symphonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review for Teachers","review":"I read this book when I was in high school and used it on a few papers.

Author David W. Barber's attempt to show some of the great classical composers as regular guys is refreshing. Unfortunately, his impartiality falters from time to time, such as in the sections on Wagner, opera, and twentieth century music. There are also a couple of factual errors and occasional passing references to a composers without further explanation (such as Mahler), and Barber's penchant for putting most of his funny lines in footnotes becomes annoying after a while.This is not a book for introducing children or students to music history. It would be most enjoyable for someone who is already somewhat knowledgeable about music history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sarcastic.

As pleasure reading, the book offers a number of great details and funny stories from the way-side of history.

In all, a rather frivolous read that music lovers would enjoy and everyone else would likely fail to appreciate.Continued at: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do the \\"boys\\" justice.","review":"Most of this book is limited to very brief biographical summaries of pop culture composers.

Songs like 'Twist Barbie' (a paean to Barbie that pre-dates the infamous Aqua song) and 'Flying Jelly Attack' (with its chorus of 'jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly beans') make up in sheer irrepressible good humour what they lack in lyrical sophistication. But like anything else that's sweet and fizzy, Shonen Knife rapidly becomes cloying.

Advanced mathematics should include rigorous proofs, and never have I seen a high school mathematics student capable of understanding the logical and structural necessities demanded by rigorous proofs in mathematics.

As Usual","review":"If you like Primus or any of the myriad side projects of uber-bassist Les Claypool, you will probably go for this one. Claypool's frenetic bass style turns anything it touches into virtual Primus music, although this album is an interesting twist on the formula. I think it works surprisingly well, thanks in large part to the humble open-mindedness of star musicians Trey Anastasio and Stewart Copeland and their willingness to collaborate/submerge themselves into the Claypool realm.Clearly, some songs are better than others. I really like \\"Armys on Ecstasy,\\" \\"Pseudo Suicide,\\" and I think the biggest downer track here, \\"Shadow of a Man,\\" may actually be the best one - it does admittedly have a real Primus feel to it. Still, you might get tired of listening to the album front to back unless yer really in the mood for it . . .The only Claypool music I can think of that subsumes into someone ELSE'S world, would be his collaborations with Tom Waits (which I love)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The editorial review is right-on","review":"This is a quirky CD that blurs the lines between creativity and absurdity. The tracks sometimes go over this line, and then back again, but one thing remains constant. The level of musicianship is second to none. Sheer brilliance by all involved.It puts other groups known for their musicianship to shame.I think the editorial review was right on the money; a perfect description. However, I have to give it 5 stars because I really, really get off on this kind of stuff.On second thought, there might be one thing I'd argue with. I'm not sure Zappa has as big of an influence on this CD. Certainly Zappa pioneered the genre. That's obvious. However, I'm not sure he influenced the music per se."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing them live makes all the difference","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing Oysterhead in Salem, Or.

I was waiting for it to live up to my expectations, but it never got there. It sounds great, and the playing is top notch, but the songs are so filtered that they never really grab you. It's almost like background music...Buy it if you know you'll like it, but then this review is pointless anyway. I guess what I'm trying to say is borrow it, listen to it, then decide.

The song \\"Radon Balloon\\" stands out as a great work though, and if they would have gone for instrumental solos over it they would have a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy it....","review":"I was looking forward to hear something by Trey again... and i don't know I thought this was going to be a little more like Phish... and it really has a Primus sound.... which personally i'm just not into... i'm glad someone is enjoying it.... you folks have a great time with it... i listened to the cd two times.... and only one song on there in my opinion, that was worth listening to.... and i have no wish to ever listen to the cd again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"When I bought this CD I had high hopes of hearing some great musicians come together to do something different and unique...I was let down. They don't really come together at all. They each have three distinct talented sounds in their respective and former bands. Unfortunately, it just doesn't really blend into a new sound. Each of their styles sort of hang in the air and don't really compliment each other. I give them two stars for the attempt at humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down.","review":"After seeing these guys perform on Reverb I was very interested to hear the rest of their new CD. Especially after listening to Stewart Copeland's playing on \\"pseudo suicide\\" - the song they featured on that show. But now that I've listened to the rest of what they did, I get the impression that they put this album together solely for finacial reasons and not because of any artistic inspiration. Don't get me wrong-I'm still huge fans of these guys as individual musicians, but I found this album to be a collection of very formulaic and unoriginal music. In short, I've heard music like this before - from high school students. Maybe thats who they're writing this stuff for, but I probably will not bother to listen to it very often as it doesn't really inspire me as a musician. I really expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? Were they thinking?","review":"Love Phish. Love Police. Love Primus. Despise this album. There might be some interesting socio-political themes but I wouldn't bother to try to find out. Somewhat spacey but lacking everything that's charming about (for example) yoshima/pink robots. This is a non-concept album.If three \\"un-famous\\" names recorded this, it would never see the light of day. Here is why.Characterless processed vocals. Directionless music. Someone could hear the bass on this? I could not. Dance music for the bedridden. Leon Redbone (or Tom Waits) played at double-speed. The Chipmonks' tribute to the Fugs. Mothers of Invention without Zappa (and certainly without Anastasio). Horribly misconceived.Maybe this is a great album but simply sounds totally unlike my memory of any of the people involved. Maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe not.Unlistenable. Bad trip music. Devo on toy instruments. Gaga for Dada. In-A-Gaga-da-Dada. Save your money, or buy any other album but this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Lord WHY???","review":"Ouch. Claypool, Trey, and Copeland are very accomplished musicians, but this album isn't particularly good. The technical skill is there (Claypool especially, he really steals the spotlight in my opinion), but the songs have little or no hook at all. I did like Birthday Boys, though, and that sounded more like a Phish song than anything else. Better songwriting would save this album. Some folks are drawing parallels between Frank Zappa's lyrics and those on this album. As a Zappa fan, I'm offended by that. Zappa was incredibly literate and it showed in his conceptual continuity - these guys sound like they wrote these in high school. Frank was dirty, lewd, and childish at times, but he never mired in the painfully contrived and/or forced-sounding lyrics found in \\"Weild the Spade\\" and \\"Mr. Oysterhead\\" I'm glad I didn't pay money for this, and I suggest that you borrow it first for a listen as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You People Insane?","review":"This is absolutely one of the worst records to come out in years. It's an embarrassment to the careers of Stewart Copeland and Trey Anastasio (although Copeland has had an equally embarrassing experience with The Doors, and now is suing them). The question begs the both of them: What were they thinking?Les Claypool is a very average bass player with horribly bad vocals and infantile songs.The ONLY redeeming factor of this record is that, if taken and accepted by the listener as \\"an experiment\\" in music, then there are some cool grooves sporadically. These are completely overshadowed by the fact that Claypool has taken too much acid and Stewart and Trey allowed it to happen.Stewart - please try for another Police re-union.Trey - go home to Phish.Les - drive a bread truck or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to Bring the \\"Average Customer Review\\" Down....but","review":"**.5I was unpleasantly surprised upon my initial spin.It falls somewhere between a fair Phish lp and a \\"good\\" Primus rave-up. There's little here that hasn't been done before to better effect on either of the two band's releases mentioned above. Why no new ground was explored here is baffling to me.Furthermore, there is not a single INSTRUMENTAL cut on this disc. Why?With such a plethora of soloing talent and the ability to noodle about in a positive way, it's almost criminal. Instead, we have more silly and self-indulgent muzak.Hopefully, their next outing, if we should hope so high, will have at least some flashes of originality and brilliance.Oysterhead leaves me with the impression that this trio had nothing better to do at the time and just let the tape roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Emasculation !","review":"While this is an excellent book on the Benedictine Way, this is only one part of the original version of Cardinal Hume's book, \\"Searching for God\\".

I have many types of ear buds, including Shure (E2c), Sony (EX51LP), Apple basic ones, Koss (KEB24), JVC gummy's, etc. These sound the worst. It is not simply a matter of fit. They have very poor bass response and mushy middle. These have the poorest sound of any of the models I have tried. Ironically, the cheap Koss model above has among the best sound, IF you get the rubber parts fitting your ears just right.

I enjoyed it very much as an adult reader; I'm not entirely sure that after one read I realy got the author's point, but the writing was enthralling, so I didn't care (sort of like reading Pynchon). The great thing, though, was that it makes a great read aloud book.

The result is a confusing mess with half fleshed ideas that don't mix well.Unlikeable characters, terrible dialogue, plots that don't make sense, and blatant feminism overtones, does not make for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Tale Lends Perspective to Life's Tale","review":"This incredible fantasy takes us soaring to a different time, mindsets and terrains.

The characters were clich��, the dialogue weak at best, the plot so sporatic and wraught with the bizarre that it really made no sense. And, frankly, it was boring.It ended on a lecture that brought back memories of the anti-climactic Socialist diatribe that ended Sinclair's <i>The Jungle.</i> I think it might have been trying to send a message, but what is beyond me.

Now I can't wait to get to Kirkland and Chevy's stories. I pretty much knew that this was going to be good because I've read all of Kim White's other novels. She's really good. I must agree that Sutton is a spoiled woman. She knew that her husband was a cheat, yet she layed down with him and had a baby. She should've known the deal. When Greyson tried to stop her she should've ran like the wind blew. Now on the other hand, I think Greyson is a little too obsessed with Sutton. I don't know but I'd be a little freaked out by a guy that follows me everywhere I go. I mean she's in Ohio and he's there, she's in California, he's there.

This book does a great job of touching on the political aspect of the elven societies.There are countless other things I enjoyed in this book, but if I listed them here I'm afraid I'd post spoilers and I don't want to do that.

The story of this young man becomes increasingly more complicated and interesting as the plot builds. During the trial many new things are discovered. Although throughout the book I knew there was something significant going on, I really didn't guess what it was and was quite surprised when the last critical piece of information was revealed.

A child's advocate is drawn into a criminal case when a student she had previously represented in a misdemeanor case is accused of killing a police officer. The book twists and turns but in ways that are totally absurd. Does she find out the identity of the child she gave aware after becoming pregnant as a teenager? Well, you think so but then she's wrong. Does one of the facts that she and a private investigator reenact when they visit the crime scene turn out to be a critical clue? Well, it seems that they forget what they discussed in an alley. Do the references and inclusion of characters and events from the first book add anything to this story? In my opinion, no.

You'll have to read it yourself if you want actual details of what I'm talking about, but the author misrepresented persons he quoted, he committed strawman and hasty generalization fallacies, he drove a hard line between worship and life (when our lives are supposed to be worship), he drew false conclusions based on unsupported premises, and in all honesty, I despised reading the book.

The underlying theme is that some churches worship the wrong way. Obviously, God appeared to him and told him this. It could not be the fact that he is a bitter man from a failing church. Maybe some churches have just evolved to meet the needs of people in the 21st Century. Now that Christians are no longer executed for their beliefs, we are allowed some latitude without the threat of stoning. Perhaps some churches are losing their message. Who is Mr. Gilley to judge what is the \\"wrong message\\"? I think I know who that decision is ultimately up to. If there is a problem, HE will take care of it. Until then Mr. Gilley, worry about yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to your own market","review":"Why does this author always tear down others beliefs?

The portrayal of Faith, the older sister, is haunting and mesmerizing. The childhood flashbacks of her and her father are painful in their poignancy, and if you ask me, half the story is the complicated, destructive relationship between these two. While I could become exasperated with Pheobe and the direction her obsession with Faith's death leads her, she accepts the aftermath of her quest with such grace it is heartbreaking. Even the finish of her relationship with Wolf, that authentic final telephone conversation, redeems their melodramatic love-affair. The hope and sadness conveyed in the final section of the story is moving in its simplicity, and completey satisfying.It seems to me that this is the kind of pivotal, career-making story that every writer longs for."},{"rating":"2","title":"View of the sixties","review":"Very good read.

The characters lack nuance, what little spark of originality the plot has to offer evaporates before the work even feigns to coalesce.

This novel was full of great language and description, and beautifully expressed the present as well as the sections that were told in flashbacks. Taking place in the 1970s, we meet Phoebe, a teenage girl who is trying to uncover the secret surrounding her older sister, Faith's suicide. She sets off on her own to learn the truth, traveling overseas to places where Faith and her hippie friends once resided. Using Faith's old postcards home as a travel guide, she visits exotic locals like Milan, Amsterdam and Paris.Eventually, Phoebe meets up with Wolf, Faith's onetime boyfriend.

I was hankering after a good read about the sixties; however, I was sorely disappointed. I read on only because I thought perhaps there was something substantive that was eluding me. After finishing the book I concluded that its only benefit was to have learned how not to write fiction. Granted, there are some lovely passages, nice writing here and there, but by and large I found the book as a whole to be clunky, superficial, and contrived.

Wells","review":"This work came to my attention though a brief mention within the text of a book on psychology and so began my love for the many forgotten works of H.G. Wells. The characters are surprising in the extent of their modernity of thought and practices, especially the women. The dichotomy of mysteries behind Christina Alberta's father are subtle and intriguing and are solved in quite a satisfactory manner. Each character comes alive, vividly portrayed. And if reading a masterful storyline is not enough, the underlying commentary on the 1920's treatment for the insane and insightful reasoning behind Mr. Premby's fantasy are strikingly astute. A wonderful read for anyone interested in drama, mystery, romance, history, cultural practices, or the working of the human mind. Even if you're not Sargon the Great, you might be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A user friendly guide","review":"This book is a big help in starting a walking program with (almost) all the information you need.

Actually, my treadmill calculates the miles, distance, pace, etc., making it really easy to follow the programs.

This is a must-have for anyone considering walking - rather it be for health or fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not for total beginner.....","review":"This is a good book for one who is in training already. Yes it does have plenty of workouts and most of those consist of five measuring attributes: distance, walking time, pace, heart zone, effort. Now the first three parameters are quite easy to follow but it is not as easy for heart zone and effort. Of course, book gives you formulas, in order, to measure your max and rest heart rate, but... How do you know what is your heart rate zone now when you are walking? Easy enough-you have to buy heart monitor device or feel your heart rate as professional walkers do. So is it book for beginners. Not a chance"},{"rating":"1","title":"FLUFF","review":"This book is mostly fluff. Everything important in it could be well written in about 10 pages.

It comes with a one sheet documentation . For example: It says how to use \\"Advanced set up\\" but it never writes a way how to invoke advanved mode. It took me 2 hours to figure out how to invoke advanced mode.After all those efforts I was able to use it to scan my 8 x 10 photo graph and the scanning quality seems resonable good. Then I printed the photo and it came out green tainted. I have no idea why this is happening but for sure I am done with this scanner.

The slow-ish tempo, (thought it may annoy some techno types) made me listen more closely and relish every song. Fripp and Trey Gunn are at their best on this album, the strange meanderings add incredible impact to the pure but heavilly distorted riffs.

The author demonstrates his vast knowledge of both programs by walking the reader through Oracle architecture, Oracle programming, and the various ways of connecting to Oracle databases from Visual Basic. It is assumed that the VB programmer has little or no experience with Oracle. It would be ideal for an Oracle novice to obtain hands-on experience in Oracle either through classes or through self-instruction as the author does not intend to teach Oracle in this book, even though there are many examples of Oracle code included in the book. There are two serious drawbacks to this book: first, sometimes the author is prone to \\"overkilling\\" a topic and, second, the reading is very dry. However, I would recommend this book to any programmer who needs to connect to Oracle databases with Visual Basic.

Cecilia Roth plays the role of a mentally unstable woman in her 40s who falls in love with 22 year old Garcia Bernal. The movie fails in giving the audience enough to make the story-line believable. Never understood why/how Garcia Bernal falls in love to a woman that only gave orders, didn't show her face and almost didn't talk. This just an example of many other events that come out of nowhere.

Somebody at Columbia finally had the brains to issue the FULL-LENGTH version of Marlena's \\"Touch Me in The Morning\\" on CD. Until now, this song was repeatedly cropped and butchered in one way or another for whatever reason. Back in 1987, Columbia issued a various artists classic disco 2-LP set titled \\"Let's Dance\\". Liner notes went on and on about how disco had become an oft-disregarded and much-maligned musical form...yet they themselves shortened some of the songs when it was time to issue on CD; they even chopped off almost 2 minutes (count 'em!) from \\"Touch Me In The Morning\\".

Which is too bad, because Dhoni is one of the nicest guys around-- always encouraging his players, leading by example, and modest almost to a fault in one-on-one interviews. I am proud to call him a fellow Delhi-wallah, too. If more had been shown of the boyfriend's cricketing talents, we might have thought better of him-- but naah, let him fester in his sexist juices-- Preity's heave-ho of her boyfriend at the end of the movie was well and truly deserved.

She still hasn't seen this one yet, because she is not into sports. However, this movie is still good,(even for someone who thinks men are little boys because we watch sports), because the storyline is more about the girls he selects for the team, than the winning, or losing. The players have their flaws, but he deals with them.In this movie, he doesn't ham it up, with asides to the audience, etc. But, even though it is by and large not a comedy, it still has its moments.I recommend this movie for its heart, and the girl actors, most of whom I had never seen before.Of course, it is predictable in some ways, but not cloyingly sweet.This movie, nor any other I have seen from Bollywood, is as good as Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

With pieces ranging in scope from fugues to rhapsodies and symphonies this collection highlights Gould's passion for not only the music he chose to record but also the genre's and composers as well. Admittedly Gould can be a bit technical in his discussions of form, but this does not take away from the film's overall appeal...the music itself. A must for any Gould fan, scholar or enthusiast and a delight for those interested in the insights and work of a pure genius. Highly recommended to anyone who loves piano music as well as classical history in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"This was very hard to read due to editing and structure.

If it weren't for spell checkers in the editing process his sentences probably wouldn't have periods.

Steinberg is probably a better Beethoven conductor than Dorati, and, 2. The Pittsburg CD taken from magnetic tape is a different but equally valid and effective way to record an orchestra. Which latter is saying a lot, given the quality of the Mercury engineers' work. Finally I think Steinberg elicts a more stylish sound from his musicians, with the sections blending better - those who prefer their Beethoven a little rough will probably prefer the Doarti. So if you wish an excellent energetic version of this symphony you will be very happy with this performance by Dorati, but you might also consider the more stylish Steinberg perfomance with Pittsburg."},{"rating":"1","title":"...yes, but it's boring!","review":"The nice things that others have said about this book are all true. The characters are real and well fleshed-out. The things they do are understandable. The atmosphere is very evocative, and the messages about personal connection and war are important. The problem with the book is that basically nothing happens. The characters just basically hang around thinking about things like their relationships with each other and their deepest thoughts, and sometimes talk to each other about those things.

It gave me totally separated and long lashes, very natural looking. The brush was key. NOTE: THEY CHANGED THE BRUSH!!! Now they include two brushes that are nothing like the little toothbrush-like one that is so wonderful. They now include 2 mascara spoolies, like you would get in a tube of liquid mascara. THIS DOES NOT WORK with cake mascara and I intend to return the item ASAP. What were they thinking???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny...","review":"I stumbled across this little item while browsing, decided to try it, and I have to say, I don't think I'll ever go back to the tube. For those like me who are not familiar with this type of mascara you should know you have to first moisten it with water. It takes a little bit more effort, and no, you can't put it on fast in the car like you can tube mascara, but that's a minor criticism because the quality is excellent. I use it as a liquid eyeliner and it works great. Like having two products in one. It doesn't clump, comes off easy, and I no longer have to worry about my mascara running out. It's worth all that extra international shipping that I paid for it while ordering overseas."},{"rating":"1","title":"LaFemme Cake Mascara","review":"Actually, I bought this mascara for the brush. When I got it, it was a different brush - not the one pictured, but a standard mascara wand - so it kind of defeated the purpose! The mascara itself is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture does not represent what you will receive!!","review":"OK - First major disappointment with AMAZON. After having received this I NOW understand that the picture of this product shows about thirty bristle discs and a steel mandrel! I had no idea I would receive - for $20 when shipping is included - five slim discs, that when laid atop one another are no more than 1/4\\" thick! And no mandrel. Very disappointed. The description is unclear as well, and the mandrel cannot be found for sale at AMAZON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent souce of bank note information","review":"This periodical is an excellence source for people who collect bank notes.

Mads takes lots of subtle jabs at just about everyone - the locals, foreigners, Europeans, Africans, and the law and those who break it. Hilarious. ...little conclusion at the end however. And the source of his money and presence of the cameraman while people tell secrets messes with your ability to believe it's all true."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reprint of Part of a Very Old Collection of Translations","review":"This small paper reprint comes from a very old collection of translations that contained Gildas, Geoffrey, and Nennius with I believe a section of the Anglo Saxon Chronical. The Translation is rather poor and is from a manuscript inferior to that used for Nennius, History of the British, 1980. This manuscript unlike that used for Myres' edition does not contain the Annales Cambriae. The reason this version is the only one in circulation might be the lack of copywrite protection. Be warned this translation by Giles is not annotated in any way and is in an order not congruent with that cited in most Arthurian secondary literature--following up footnotes will be difficult. If you can get the 1980 translation from a university library or a very good public library, you can annotate this text and correct the the most glaring translation errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Key Document of Arthurian History","review":"Nennius has assembled and preserved some of the earliest accounts of British history in the dimly understood Fifth Century. Some of his sources consisted of earlier writings, and others oral traditions; many would otherwise be lost today. Every student of Dark Ages and early Medieval history should read this classic translation of Nennius's crucial work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super jacket!","review":"I like this jacket very much.

She presents her memoir in a straight forward manner and does not hold back. She had a sexual relationship with her high school coach. She presents her story with all the emotional ambiguity I'm sure it carried. Ms. Heywood later struggled with an eating disorder. Again, this is presented in a very real manner. Ms. Heywood is also a very gifted writer. I found this book a compelling read and it should have a wide audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have to admit i am not very pleased with my purchase. I recently saw this ballet in my country, Turkey, and i liked it so much i wanted a copy of the Nutcracker. However, when i recieved this Slovakian copy, i realized the version i saw in Turkey was a renewed version and way more entertaining. The players in this show dance and act according to the original play written 150 years ago. Plus, the stage and decorations are appalling. There is no fairy coming out of the chimney or there is no christmas tree that is supposed to increase in size in mid-play. (becasue all the actors in the play are actually toys - duh!)Costumes and lighting is not so good either. In the Egypt scene, number of dancers is reduced from three to one. And what a hideous dancer that one is.In short, if you want to see the Nutcracker played good, this one is not it. Scout more and find a better copy. That is what i'll do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"My three year old thinks that she wants to be a ballerina. We've been watching ballet scenes from Hans Christian Anderson over and over and over and... we (her parents) needed a little more variety. Okay, so this video doesn't star the top ballet dancers, but it does display the work of some aspiring young artists. This is a very economical way to introduce the world of ballet to a young girl who wants to be a ballerina today and a construction worker tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"You WILL fail if this is your only study source","review":"-Nothing on configuring Static Routes-Nothing on configuring Default Routes-Nothing on configuring OSPF-Nothing on OSPF Neighbor Discovery/Neighbor Relations-Nothing on OSPF Designated Router Election-No coverage of Spanning Tree commands-No coverage of NAT/PAT [Inside/Outside-Private/Public]-Utilizes the NativeOS 1900 commands; the exam objectives on cisco.com SPECIFICALLY state that the exam NO LONGER COVERS 1900 commands, but now has been updated to the 2950/3550 IOS syntax-Substandard coverage of Remote Access configurationAbout the only positive thing I can say about this book is that it would probably be enough for ONLY the 821 INTRO exam, BUT NOT sufficient for the 801 Comprehensive or 811 ICND."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, and what was that other word, Oh yeah, BAD!!!","review":"This book has a good part and a bad part. The first part of the book contains information that you should already know if you are studying to take the CCNA. The second part, the stuff that supposedly covers the CCNA material - SUCKS!!! And since this book is about earning the CCNA, I can not recommend it to anyone.I intended to use this book to go from the start to finish actually using a real Cisco router.

Had really like Exam Cram 6 years ago so I ran out and bought the latest version. What a difference 6 years made in quality! There are so many errors in the practice tests I had to go through them all, fix the errors and then make another attempt. C'mon guys, the 5TH PRINTING! 2 CCNA's could have fixed all the errors. Have used Exam Cram in the past (up to 5 yrs ago) and they were good. Obviously, the rate at which they churn out these books has seriously affected their quality. And yes, I downloaded the errata. It only covers up to the 3rd printing. One more thing, the cd by PrepLogic only holds a \\"demo\\" version of the tests. Includes 1 55 question sample test and then asks you to go buy the others.I'm off to buy the Sybex CCNA book (Todd Lammle). I had this one 6 years ago and the reviews say its still really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended....","review":"There are errors in this book.Not enough - indeed any - attention is paid to important parts of the CCNA exam, particularly router configuration, WAN configuration, NAT etc, which feature a heavily in the exam itself.It may be OK if you are doing INTRO (821), rather than ICND (811) or the CCNA itself (801), however the book does claim to be for all three.If you get it \\"for free\\" from Safari, it may be worth reading as a primer. Some \\"real\\" books however are recommended instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont depend on this book.","review":"This book is strong on theory and enumerating the specifics of the OSI model. It functions well as a dictionary and thesaurus for the exam. However, it falls flat in that it covers virtually nothing in regards to routing configurations - which make up the critical portion of the exam. Cisco makes ROUTERS after all - routing is amost half of it.If you want to pass the CCNA:1. Get practical experience doing routing and ISP work with Cisco routers. If you can't get that, buy lab time and get the experience there. If you cant buy lab time, get simulation software. NetSim or the venerable RouterSim would be a good start. There is no substitute for practical experience, but extensive lab work might come close.2. Get another book for the CCNA because this one wont get you anywhere. The official Cisco press books are much better, or theones from McGraw-Hill. But for god's sake, dont bet the farm on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a CCNA but a Intro To Networking Book","review":"I thought that this book might be something like a last minute revision before taking the test, more like cram-session as the name implies, but it is anything but that. The order of the chapters is way tooo weird. WAN protocols in Chapter 4 followed by TCP/IP and then switching and routing... WOW!! The author also goes into great details to explain things that arent required for a \\"Exam Cram\\", fails to provide any real examples and overall the material provided in the book is very trivial. This book is for someone who wants to learn a few basics about networking, NOT for someone who plans to tackle the CCNA.I recommend CCNA Fast Pass by Todd Lammle as a last minute revision ONLY after reading Cisco's CCNA Companion Guide (2 books) and Todd Lammle's CCNA Study Guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"I failed because of this book!!!","review":"I made the mistake of trusting this book to prepare for the CCNA. The authors owe me $125.The outdated sections of the book should have given me a hint. I really got slammed on routing protocols during the testDO NO TRUST THIS BOOK.

I got a postcard in the mail trying to solicit for the magazine. It advertised a price of 2.98 for a year and seemed like a great gift for my daughter. I filled out the postcard and mailed it in to start our subscription. Next thing I know I have a bill in the mail for 20 dollars and no customer service number to call. I go online and fill out the form for contact customer service (as they have no phone number to contact) and have been waiting 4 days now for someone to contact me back. I sent in a second request and I'm frustrated by not only the false price but the inability to interact with anyone about my service issue.

Along with that, her arrogance and self-aggrandizement destroy her credibility as a spiritual leader. She overgeneralizes about the boomer generation in many ways.

Unlikely that I will ever listen to her or read her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"i found this more like an upper level history/political science class - way over my head and very frustrating - full of references to things I'm not familiar with - hardly inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little harsh","review":"I own many Caroline Myss CD's and I love them. I enjoy listening to her no-nonsense lessons on the importance of developing an \\"interior life\\" that respects the power and wonder of the Divine. However, she seems angry on this CD. Her no-nonsense manner suddenly becomes harsh and somewhat demeaning and the overall message is redundant. I \\"get\\" what she is saying and I appreciate the importance of aligning yourself with what is deep and meaningful in the Universe and not investing all of your time in gimmicks to bring you lots of \\"stuff.\\" I understood this early on in the CD and did not need her to beat me over the head with it in a condescending, negative way. She also brags about all of her amazing medical intuitive skill and her self-discipline that makes her like a \\"warrior.\\" It gets annoying and is difficult to listen to. I threw the CD out partway into the second one. I recommend \\"Sacred Contracts\\" and the one about intuition but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"More condescension and verbal abuse from Ms. Myss","review":"After reading several of her books and listening to some of her audio tapes, I continue to ask myself, what is Caroline Myss's problem? Why is she so annoyed and who gives her the right to patronize and condescend to her readers and listeners as she so frequently does? If it is wisdom you are seeking, try anything by Jack Kornfield, Pema Chodron, or the wise and wonderful Dalai Lama who has said: \\"My religion is kindness.\\" Myss might have some very interesting and helpful things to say, but that grating and annoying tone of voice diminishes whatever it is that she wants to convey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much that's helpful and somewhat mean-spirited","review":"The information she delivered was contradictory and dis-empowering. Her delivery of her message was sarcastic and condescending. I am SOOOO glad that I got this audio-book for free from my library instead of having to purchase it. It was very hard for me to listen to the whole two cd's, but I did, and I am sorry that I did. I finished listening to these cd's feeling creepy, angry, negative, confused and resentful. If you want some reasons to hate yourself and mankind, this cd is for you. If you want lessons or guidance on manifesting, feeling good, love or compassion, seek elsewhere. If her other audiobooks are like this one, I would never recommend them to anyone for any purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY","review":"Don't waste your money. Ms Myss is rambling and incoherent. Ultimately the content of the CD has very little to do with the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"great message gets lost in the anger and insult","review":"She almost touches on a wonderful topic of moving beyond egocentric manifestation to allowing the wonder of the Universe to carry us. But it is hard to sit though her mocking sales clerks, insulting people who seek her guidance, talking about how greedy and petty humanity is etc. I wanted to put my arm around her and say, \\"honey, why so angry? Take a deep breath, it'll be okay.\\" The message she almost touches on is explored by Ernest Holmes, Emma Curtis Hopkins and Troward if you are interested. The reason I gave it one star was because she really slams people who light candles and use oils repeatedly calling them idiots yet she sells \\"sacred\\" candles, \\"sacred stone necklaces\\" and oil sets for hundreds of dollars on her website. That my friend is low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting Narcissistic Sad Little Person","review":"I made the huge mistake of wasting my time and money on this CD set. She has absolutely no clue regarding the 'law of attraction' and her judgmental, 'you are pathetic and I'm wonderful' attitude was enough to make ask for my money back. I thought of destroying the CD's because like watching a slasher film I don't think they're good for anyone but I simply don't want her receiving any royalties for the garbage she's handing out as truth. If you are interested in something uplifting and something that will teach you about \\"Your Power To Create\\" please look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"I've just listened to it, and it was awful. The tonality of her voice, the way she talks like the listener is an idiot, and lastly, there was absolutely no content that was worth remembering or writing down. Absolute drivel. As Simon would say \\"That was horrible!\\" I would really like my $19.95 back from Borders.What a waste of time and money. I way prefer Abraham Hicks. At least you don't feel like you're being ripped off, and you're actually give a method to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money and time","review":"I feel sullied having listened to this. There is no wisdom here; there is judgment and condescension. There was no inspiration to create my life, there were assumptions and insults about my stupidity and lack of inner strength. Myss is the kind of person who thinks in black and white; there is her opinion and anyone who sees it differently is stupid, or \\"doesn't have the backbone.\\" I can believe this woman accessed certain wisdom at some point in her life, but she has become the shadow of the warrior she probably envisions herself to be - bullying people into submission while shielding herself with thick layers of denial. But this is transparent even to her audience on this CD. When she says, \\"I'm not judgmental,\\" you can hear the audience laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope I don't get lynched!","review":"Where has her compassion gone? Maybe this is a great CD but I'll never know because after the 1st five minutes of ranting about some folk's misguided attempts at spirituality, I turned it way off. Cosmically off. Karmically off!! For the record, I thought I liked Caronline Myss a lot, I'm not having a bad day and life is pretty good. I was looking to make it better ... in the wrong place evidently!!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A warm, lyrical, and marvelous interpretation","review":"For those who know Pierre Boulez's many recordings, \\"warm\\" and \\"lyrical\\" may not be the first two adjectives to spring to mind. The words are appropriate for this recording of Mahler's First Symphony, however. As in other Boulez recordings, the orchestration is transparent and the logic of the music clear. Here he has the advantage of conducting a superlative orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, one with outstanding first-chair players and a distinctive, powerful brass sound. Both these strengths are used to excellent effect in this performance. Though I'm a big fan of most of Mahler's later symphones -- nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and \\"Das Lied von der Erde,\\" I never warmed to Symphony #1 until hearing this performance. I am now a fan. Both the symphony and this performance are enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic and Fun!","review":"I am not a classical music expert by any stretch of the imagination. I am merely someone who enjoys listening to it, without any special sort of training or background in it. And I am only beginning to explore the music of Mahler.But nevertheless, I would like to say that I find this CD delightful. It sounds as if the musicians got together to play this piece for the sheer joy of making music together. It is filled with energy and happiness and I find it to be exhilirating (and addicting) to listen to.I love the brass section of an orchestra, and this CD has truly bad*ss horn playing!!! Bliss!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic historical romance","review":"Robertson's series is rich with history, intrique, romance and time travel.This is a fabulous series with lovable time traveler Robyn at the center of it all along with her prince charming, Edward. Robyn meets Edward in a field as he's being chased down by the bad guys. Not thinking he is truly not of this time, she plays along with what she thinks is an intricate delusion of a very handsome young man.Robyn travels back in time to meet the young Edward and they fall in love immediately. She works her way through this era making friends and even more enemies. She is rightfully accused of being a witch and her escapades in the tower of London are so frightfully realistic you can almost smell the stinky dungeon she's occupying.The entire series is amazing and I miss Robyn and Edward.I am anxiously awaiting another book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"historical yes, fantasy yes, romance NO","review":"The plot fell flat for me. There was no spark or chemistry between Edward or Robyn at all. No build up of their romance or attraction for each other. They just loved each other at first sight? Not believable.Collin was not likable at all. Jo barely, Joy less so. Deirdre was fun but underdeveloped as a character. The reader never knows whether to like or distrust these characters, it was frustrating. I didn't feel I knew anyone, even Robyn very well. They were all paper cut-outs or comic strip charactersAgain, the premise gets 4 stars, but the story itself was weak and the love story even weaker. I didn't sense any of Gabaldon's famous passion between this author's hero & heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to read this one slowly...","review":"...because I didn't want to miss out on any of the descriptions of the people and places of the War of the Roses. The author really knows his stuff and it was just fasinating to me. This is the kind of history lesson I like. He didn't even need to include the love story, but that was an added bonus. If you love The Outlander and the following books in that series, you should like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clueless Meets Harry Potter","review":"Not only is the main character of this half baked story lost, but the author as well. What started out as a funny and interested story, quickly disintergrated into unimagnative silliness after the first 50 pages. The rickety witchcraft premise for this story have no power to transport or teleport the readers. Those who find the history of the Medieval period fascinating should stay away from this nonsense, better to read Michael Chricton's \\"Timeline\\". It has its problems too but nothing like this \\"Errant Knight\\", more like \\"Errant Author\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Like Outlander - Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I picked up this book in an idle moment while waiting for the sixth Diana Gabaldon installment to come out. Was I ever disappointed! Edward, the hero, is a cardboard character who despite leading a sucessful rebellion during the War of the Roses) seems to have no more purpose in this book than wearing handsome clothes and smiling at the heroine. Their love story could not be more unconvincing, and the way that the heroine willingly blabs her status as a time traveller to anyone she meets is absolutely maddening.If you must read this book, get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Time travel!","review":"First of all, let me state that this is NOT some... gushy romance with no plot except lover's problems that no one cares about. This is an adventure story, about a woman named Robyn transported back in time. Her friends (and enemies, sometimes) are reincarnations of people she has known from her life in the present. I got this book out from the library, suspicious it would be a fluff book like most romances are, and imediately went out and bought it once I finished it. Robyn travels back and forth, from the medival ages to the present, several times. She travels all over the place, including to a much smaller Londen, and gets to meet imporent historic people. Read this book! ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Knight Errant","review":"The first few pages grab my attention however the story involved far too much historical information and description.This writer loses his reader by not bringing the hero back into the story almost at the end of the book after a long absence. The hero was the main reason I bought the book in the first place, he didn't reappear for almost three hundred pages later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knight Errant in more ways than one!","review":"After reading this book because it was written \\"in the tradition of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series,\\" I am vastly disappointed. As an avid reader of historical fiction, this one was just silly. The heroine in this book was mindless, aimlessly babbeling on to anyone with no consequences as to how she may be perceived. Being accustomed to a lot of details in historical fiction, there was a lot missing from this book. Pairing actual persons to fictional ones is tricky when it's done well, but missed the mark here. I'm sad to say I wasted my money on the hardback book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"This book had a great idea, that never turned into something wonderful. I think if the author would have left out some of the dukes, earls and other so not important people and let the reader draw on thier own imagination, this book would have been much better. I cuouldn't keep track of who was who and, I really stopped caring. The characters were good, but they left alot lacking. It was something I read and almost had to force myself through it. Alot of the extra fluff should have been concentrated on the main characters. There was no real emotion. I like to expirience a book not just read whats infront of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Like the previous reviews, I too purchased this book based on the cover's blatant reference to 'in the manner of Diana Gabaldon'. Well, this author is no Gabaldon, Edward is most assuredly NOT Jaime, and the heroine is a pure senseless ninny. I felt no connection to the time period or the land, no sense of history, no emotional connection to the characters.....in fact, what I most felt throughout the entire read was robbed! It's trite, poorly constructed and even more poorly written. A ...attempt of the Outlander success. Save your dollars, this one is surely a no buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok piece.","review":"I like this piece well enough, but I'm only going to give it a 4 out of 5 because off the picture.

Both of them are good and good quality, but something about the Glass M. DVD was lacking in terms of the drums power. You could hear the drums...but the bass drum was almost non-existent. And the DVD was delving TOO much into the really weird, psychedelic period of BIlly Cobham (which is cool, but gets tiring quick). I was also sad that it didn't have Red Baron and Stratus. NOW I'm happy.This new DVD has better quality (filmed a decade later), the band is top-notch, Billy is straight having fun and doing some of the most complex I've seen him do (and I've seen him live and spoken to him), he even winks at the audience with a sly look on his face that says, \\"yeah, I know I'm the best...don't you just love it?\\". And best of all, he plays Stratus and Red Baron! YES!Buy this DVD RIGHT NOW if you are a Cobham fan. The Glass M. is good, but this one is the best out so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this if you like Billy Cobham","review":"This DVD is a much better recording than the Glass Menagerie DVD. There is a great line up of players and they even remembered to turn the snare drum mic on. Good chemistry between the players. Billy is on top of it and looks like he's having a great time.

The show must be written by some of the most intelligent people in the country. I am absolutely amazed that anyone with a mind is still writing for network tv.

My only complaint is that the original episodes from \\"The Practice\\" that served as an introduction to BL were not included in the release.I guess that's unless you were lucky enough to get there before they sold out and had a promotion that included those episodes on a sleeve inside the box. I had to wait for the next shipment, which of course didn't include those episodes. I feel like I got shafted by the store or the studio and will be far more careful in the future. I guess now I'll have to wait until the final season of \\"The Practice\\" to get them. If this review sounds a little angry at the situation, that's because I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Oak Yngwie","review":"There are moments here in which Yngwie Johann Malmsteen plays so fast that the strings don't have time to resonate. His guitar sounds like a washboard.While I admire his skill, I think his vision falls a little short and doesn't do the washboard justice.A true washboard player can keep going for hours and hours. Getting those clothes clean, as anybody who's been in rehab knows, is spiritual training. Wherever they're from, the great washboard players have mountain eyes.One-handed stroking, a cello player or two, Tokyo, and in-law problems might be the beginnings of wisdom, but not if pride--\\"showing off,\\" as Ritchie Blackmore said of Yngwie--keeps rearing its head.A sense of humor wouldn't hurt. Or a pilgrimage to the hills of Caroline.Given the many rock-band-with-symphony-orchestra pairings of late, it's about time that Jim Dandy Mangrum took what remains of Black Oak Arkansas and showed young Yngwie how to do it right.From idiot to savant is sometimes only a motion away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring to listen to.","review":"Again another album with unbelievable reviews. YGM has always regarded himself as a modern day Paganini, but even Paganini was never as repetitive as this. Uli Jon Roth is the king of this kind of 'orchestral music making', check out his recent 'Legends of Rock' album and you'll see what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fans Review","review":"I\`ve always thought Yngwie\`s style and technique would blend well with a symphonic arangement. Though I enjoyed the Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra in E Flat Minor Op.1, I felt the overall production was a little dense and Yngwie\`s guitar was a little buried in the mix. That\`s why I like this live version with the new japan philharmonic so much more. Even though it\`s live, the Orchestra performance is cleaner and more powerfull, yet it never over powers Yngwie\`s guitar. His playing on this night was fantastic as well as flawless. You can clearly every note and the two encores(Blitzkrieg, Far beyond the sun)hold up pretty well with a symphonic arangement.This CD is more for a big fan of Yngwie\`s Neo Classical Style than of casual fan more familiar with his Rising Force CD\`s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Czech vs. New Japan Philharmonic","review":"To me, the CD done with the Czech Philharmonic is superior to this one with the New Japan Philharmonic because of the audio mix. I feel the Czech one is more balanced whereas this one has Yngwie's playing mixed a little too strongly and occasionally overshadowing important aspects of the orchestra. However, if you are more interested in hearing his guitar work, then you would probably prefer this version. Actually, since the only DVD of this work is of this performance with the New Japan Philharmonic, I got it on DVD and got the Czech version on CD.(NOTE: For those interested in the DVD, it is quite hard to find since it comes out of Japan, but can usually be found on Ebay.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is redundant","review":"I am a fairly avid Yngwie fan. I love his instrumentals, especially the concerto with the Czech orchestra. This recording with the Japanese orchestra is unnecessary because it sounds like a replica of the studio recording with minor differences. The main minor difference is poor quality recording. On some songs the volume swells. Some tracks are louder than others. Yngwie and the orchestra make rhythmic mistakes. Don't get this cd only for the extra encore tracks Blitzkrieg and Far Beyond the Sun. I imagine the DVD might be worth purchasing because there is novelty in seeing. C'mon, seeing yngwie shredding with an orchestra would look so cool. I really enjoy watching his fingers move. But, this CD provides no novelty compared to the Czech studio release. It's just worse quality. I highly discourage you from buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Classical Inspiration","review":"As in all concerto suites, there is a soloist. I believe that this is the first time a rock guitar player has done this. Malmsteen wrote and performed this live in Japan with the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra. It is truly a classical revolution. The bottem line is that Yngwie is one of the only real vituosos on heavy rock guitar, and his classical style works perfecly in their arena. I am not sure wheather to review this from a classical view or a rock view. Either way, the combination is perfect. The music is beautiful. Malmsteen gives his heart and soul in his best and most unique work ever with an unforgiving one time, do or die, live recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Level","review":"This cd takes Malmsteens own music to a whole new level. It has its flaws like all LIVE cds do, but this cd is diiferent. I guarantee it will put a chill down your spine by the time you hear the first kettle drums roll.

Of course, I guess different people think differently in terms of what makes a good log book. For me, a good logbook is one that is minimalist on the pictures (none the better) and quotes and mainly with space to write down the interval training, long distance runs, pace, heart rate etc. that are essential in a log book.And the other thing about this book is that it's format is too huge.

You see a movie starring actors that you know and like. You have never heard abotu the movie before. What happened? Did it fall through the cracks? Was it one of those early movies? Or is it just not very good?In the case of this movie, choose the last option. This movie was made at a time when Kevin Spacey could do no wrong. He was the great one. Before Pay it Forward and Superman made him seem like a terrible hack, he was making this dreck. This is essentiallyArthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (Bloom's Guides)without anyone dying. OrGlengarry Glen Ross: A Playwithout balls. Three salesmen gather together and try to sell stuff. One of them is a fundamentalist Christian who keeps talking about Jesus Christ. The other two get really mad at him. In the end, being a sales man is a very sad experience.This is a tired drippy movie without much to show for itself save a lot of tired speeches about being a salesman. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked that Spacey executive produced this dreck","review":"I was seriously shocked by how bad this movie is. I am a big Kevin Spacey fan (everything from Swimming with Sharks, Usual Suspects to American Beauty) but even he cannot save this movie. The entire plot of the movie revolves around the fact that Peter Facinelli's character would rather talk to clients about Jesus than doing his job and selling them things. Spacey and DeVito are mad at first, then grudgingly accept this crazy diamond. Cue the sunscreen song. The end.Also, I must point out that when the Don't Forget the Sunscreen song plays a central role in your movie, you're in deep, deep trouble. The film basically abdicates any responsibility for coming to a conclusion and plays that song instead.Mind-blowingly wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try, but no sale","review":"What is it with Kevin Spacey and food? First he went gloriously ballistic with a plate of asparagus during his Oscar-winning performance in American Beauty, and now, in The Big Kahuna, he launches into a raging fit over canap��s.

Perhaps you have to be of a certain age to fully appreciate what DeVito and Spacey are going through. The young Facinelli just doesn't get it and I have a feeling that many young people will not. As DeVito says in his brilliant \\"speech\\" to Facinelli toward the end of the movie, until you have lived long enough to realize the disappointments and regrets that life inevitably hands out to us if we live long enough, \\"you can only expect to go so far.\\" I have watched this movie several times and never fail to emerge from its spell and say, \\"Yes, that's it exactly.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A story about people...","review":"There's no mistaking this for a big budget Hollywood movie -- quite frankly, it says too much about people.

The interplay between the investigating officers was not realistic at all, and the parade of suspects muddies the waters to no good effect. The officers also seemed to have a surprising lack of insight into the workings of the criminal mind, an unforgiveable sin in these days of psychological profiling.

Id give it 10 stars if it would let me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Bloody Fun","review":"All the hate for this film is not necessary because I wanted to see this for a few months and then I did, and one of my first thoughts was that it is more brutal than Deliverance. THAT doesn't have more than one person murdered within the first 5 minutes. The beginning is very good. A redneck clown named Captain Spaulding has a place with a murder ride. 4 people go there and on the ride he tells them of famous cannibals/psychos/killers. The only one they are all really interested in is one named Dr. Satan who was said to have a mission to create an army of superhumans which aren't human. The rest of the movie is pretty neat if you're a hardcore horror fan. If you don't like it, then horror must not be your thing.

Why he does, I'll never know- because just about everything in this schlockfest has been done much better in other movies including Hooper's.There are really no scares and no buildup of suspense- the action and ending is almost a foregone conclusion. Along the way we're treated to various dismemberments and murders which lack any atmosphere to really hold our attention.There are a few moments of amusing comedy, including a parade of some funny t-shirts worn by various players and a rather strange clown who owns the shop where the journey begins and who may or may not be directly connected to the main band of fruitloops who inhabit the house of the title- watch and see.Overall however there are far better (or worse, depending on your leanings) B-movies to expend your time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The horror!!","review":"I'll get right to it: I found the script clunky and awkward, the acting over-the-top, and the gore factor pretty lame, considering all the blood n' guts promised in the trailers and critics' reviews.

That movie [was not good] and so does this one and in almost the exact same way. Chances are if you like this movie, your drug use is beyond recreational. Rob blew it with this one, big time. Although the character of Capt. Spalding just about steals the show, and is the funniest guy in this movie, this isnt even a good splatter-fest flick. The directing seems pointless as this is a non stop screamfest heavily edited so the very purpose of the movie is obsolete, this flick was labeled a stomach-churner. On that alone some horror buffs like myself were attracted to it but it doesnt even deliver that. If your looking for a movie to get drunk and party to than this is it.

It's movies like this that remind me why i am losing interest in the horror/gore/shock genre because they have no real value. I mean, watching a girl run around screaming for two hours (give or take a little more) can be fun...for the first 5 minutes, but then it just becomes annoying and you want to turn it off, but, you wait, in great hopes, that SOMETHING exciting will happen...and it never does.

What a mess. Since I am quite aware that Rob Zombie has been struggling for over two years to get this movie by the ratings board, I can see that the finished product is a \\"chopped-to-pieces\\" mess. I suppose Mr. Zombie got tired a fighting the censors and caved in to their demands. And that's truly a pity. The movie had limitless possibilities, but it never really carried through on any of them.So, if you want to see schlock for schlock's sake, this might be your cup of tea.

The movie was so long and the whole time I was stuck waiting for a reason that the production company paid money to put this on dvd... still wondering. The only highlights were Baby being SO fine and Captain Spaulding having a great personality (he was only in about five minutes of the movie though). Finally, I came to the conclusion that Rob Zombie made this film as a joke so that when people saw it and said that he had no business in Hollywood, he could surprise them with a better film on his next try... then I saw the Devil's Rejects and I'm just left scratching my head. What were any of these people thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...","review":"Now this movie wasn't exactly horrible, and I could've enjoyed it more if the ending hadn't been so bad. (Spoiler) I wanted the last character to make it out so bad, and it led me to believe she actually would... but Rob had to go with the stupid cliche ending that totally ruined my respect for the plot. (End spoiler) He does a good job of creating a sadistic family, and the first half hour is good, but from there it's just a bunch of death/torture scenes. I couldn't stand how the characters did practically nothing to help themselves besides the last girl. The two police officers were complete morons. They basically lined up for their deaths. I know this wasn't made to be an awesome movie, and it shows. It is half-decent. There was something about it I liked, probably because I felt for the characters... but I honestly feel watching this movie has made me less humane. If you aren't a fan of Rob Zombie or you're unsure at all, please don't see this movie. And keep it away from kids too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MOVIE THAT WILL SCARE YOU TO DEATH","review":"An Awesome/Gory Horror Movie that will have you wondering what is going on until the end.

Although this movie kind of replicated The Texas Chainsaw Massace (in the sense that it was about a demented family that enjoys torturing helpless teenagers in a \\"middle of Nowhere house\\"), I believe that Rob Zombie did a fantastic job on his first movie and I cant wait for the sequel (which I have already read is in the works) to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Cult Classic?","review":"I personally loved this movie and had a great time watching it.

I could have spent the 2 hours I wasted on this movie with my nose caught in a large man's behinde, who hadn't showered for a week, and it mabey, by a hair, House of A Thousand Corpses would have had some redeaming qualities.If you liked this movie...well, I bet you are really, fat, ugly, or stupid, most likely all three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"This was, without a doubt, the worst movie i have ever seen.

I am very forgiving when it comes to plot, script, etc when it comes to horror, however, the shortcomings and failures of this film go beyond the usual ...

Although made out to be extremly gruesome, this movie is actually rather tame, compared to many of the banned horror flicks of the 70s and 80s. However the film uses many variations of technique to get it looking creepy and spooky.I wouldn't say that it's scary, but it has a sinister feel from start to finish, which makes you feel uneasy. The family of cannibal flesh eating psyhcos is obviously inspired from the texas chainsaw massacre, they appear so nice and friendly, yet, unlike their victims, the viewer knows what they are capable of.If you want tonnes of gore, your best off watching Rob Zombie's new movie The devil's Rejects, however this is entertaining also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cult classic with great characters","review":"Rob Zombie did an excellent job in developing the characters and had me routing for the bad guys to win.

I would love to hear what Rob Zombie has to say about the engenderment of this movie? What is the point? I watched this film twice, both times searching for some trace of meaning or poignancy, some hint at a reason for the production of this movie. I could not. The gratuitous (or not gratuitous, depending on your point of view) violence seems totally devoid of a purpose other than that cliched \\"no purpose\\" sentiment. There could be some semblance of a shot directed at the pathetic and insignificant serial killers that have \\"plagued\\" our society; however, they are mentioned only briefly and given cursory descriptions and quickly loose any effect that they might have had.The movie seems trite and banal-i don't know what else to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible movie!!!","review":"In terms of horror movies, this one doesn't cover any new ground.

Shock rocker Rob Zombie has created a stylistic homage to films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as he turns the sadistic brutality dial up a notch.The plot was actually better than I expected. Four 20-somethings come upon a store that sells Gas, Food and Murder. Upon hearing of the local urban legend of Dr Satan, who performed grizly experiments on his patients, they decide to do some research on the subject. Bad mistake.This movie is sick and disgusting and almost makes you feel dirty after viewing it. In other words, Zombie succeeds in doing what he intended to do(Disturb you)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooooorrrrriiiiiingggg.......","review":"This is just a very sad rip-off of so many other films.

It had one or two funny and/or disturbing scenes in it, but for the most part, it sucked. I didn't like the use of satanic rituals in this movie. It really bothered me, and I know that the scene was probably meant to do that, but still. If you're the kind of person who is sensitive to that type of material, then stay away from this film. I have my reasons for feeling the way that I do about that.This could have been a fun movie, and I was a bit disappointed.

Its trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title says all","review":"Two ill-fated couples travelling across the American country side stop at the off-beat Captain Spaulding's Museum of Monsters and Madmen and learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. This ultimately leads them to become prisoners at a house full of murderous crazies. Directed by death-metal rocker Rob Zombie, he shows an obvious soft spot for horror films with his consistant homages to genre classics (most noteably THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), but there isn't a scare to be found, only a showcase of typically expected gore and a flavour of twisted black humour. Most of the fun is saved for the end climax, by then things get really sick! Zombie's insertion of old-fashion film clips quickly becomes monotonous."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCK. ASS.","review":"This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I have officially lost all respect for rob zombie. The movie is crap to begin with. It's just a bunch of hicks who somehow manage to capture tourists and kill them. I don't even know how they couldve pulled off anything they did even if they combined brain power. And the people being tortured, well, in less than 5 minutes you wanted them to die, cuz they were just as freaking stupid as the hicks.

Well, this movie has little going for it and it's obvious within the first few minutes. The plotline of a deranged, inbred family that thirsts for tourist blood is worn thin, and there really is nothing shocking and remarkable about this movie. In the end, it's nothing but flashy imagery used to try to trick the viewer into thinking it's something more than another Zombie music video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie!","review":"I saw this movie on opening night expecting to see a horror movie in the vein of all the great horror movies of the 70's. Do not let these other reviews fool you. This movie is just an hour and half gross out. The characters are not engaging nor is the \\"plot\\". If you get off on scenes of sadistic torture then you will love this film. If you like horror movies that are not only gory but are actually exciting then save your money. This is just scene after scene of despicable things happening to helpless people that you don't necessarily want to see tortured but don't really have any feeling for either. You know that things aren't going to turn out well for them so you just don't care. It's just shock for the sake of shock and takes the viewer to the limits of depravity. I am a huge fan of the horror genre and it truly disturbs me if this is what today's horror fans have been looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of 1000 Disappointments","review":"Despite Rob Zombie's efforts, this movie was a HUGE disappointment. For the true horror buffs out there, House of 1000 corpses is nothing more than an entirely unoriginal conglomorate of horror films rolled into one trite, over-the-top and overly long presentation. It was basically a pumped up version of Mother's Day, a horror film written and directed by Charles Kaufman in 1980. Don't waste a precious moment of your life on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a build up and let down","review":"I also waited a long time for this movie to come out. Maybe I had high expectations but, I thought Rob Zombie was a little more original than this. I have read the reviews where people call this movie a welcome throwback to 70's horror. I call it a rip off of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre without the feeling of terror. When Massacre came out it was original, shocking, and a shot in the arm to the horror industry. This movie is none of that. The best part of the Movie is when we actually get to see Dr. Satan, but sadly it comes late in the movie and only for a brief moment. If they would have focused more on Dr. Satan and less on the inbred [...], maybe I would have had better things to say. I can only hope and pray that Rob Zombie will redeem himself with a \\"directors cut\\" dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"just. not. good","review":"theres nothing scary about this disjointed gore fest. i was interested in the beginning but after the hour or so of \\"creative\\" video editing and the inverted colors, the continuous semi-understandable chanting and random addition of characters, zombies,etc it just made me feel stupid even watching this film, if you can call it that. i think that if you could cut this film down to 5 minutes and put it to some of Zombies music it would be a mediocre music video, but as a movie it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORSE MOVIE IN THE WORLD!","review":"This was the worse movie I have EVER seen in my entire life!

The only part of this movie that was interesting was the last 20 minutes when you get to see the catacombs. The first hour or more is boring and stupid. It is Rob Zombie's style to mix hillbillies, carnie folk, and some disturbing aspects. The only \\"cult\\" thing about it is that Rob Zombie did it. If anyone else were to have done it...you probably would not have seen it at the theater...it would have gone straight to video like many other B, C, D or F horror movies. Worth renting just to see it and say, \\"ya I saw it, big deal,\\" but definetly not one to have amongst your DVD collection...unless you picked it up at Blockbuster for $1.50, even then."},{"rating":"1","title":"This did not accomplish what Zombie wanted.","review":"Zombie wanted the audience to sympathize with the killers. These killers are the most unsympathetic group I have ever come across in a movie. Not only was there a total absence of a plot, but it was just gory (which is why I rated it two stars instead of one) and unrealistic. There needs to be a story told about the characters. There needs to be a purpose. Not just some annoying hicks who enjoy torturing innocent people. That doesn't make the audience like the characters. Sorry Zombie, you failed. The best part of both movies was the end of the Devil's Rejects, only then does the audience sort of like the killers but then they get killed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long wait...Big Disappointment","review":"This movie was absolutely horrible.

Finally, returning to the realm of REAL horror, a splatter film in the post-Scream world. I waited for a nice, dark night to sit down and watch it, all a jitter. It starts out wonderfully, the blend of dizzing direction and music lets you know you're in for an awesome experience and when the four hapless teenagers take in a hitchhiker, I was ready for the carnage to begin. So, what happened?Shallow characters? Sure, but that's a horror movie for you. Plus, the Firefly family is fun, grotesque, exciting, disgusting all at once. And then the movie just kind of fizzles due to overly-pretentious direction and confusion. As a fellow reviewer pointed out, it degrades into how many horrible ways you can torture unsympathetic teenage characters and for what?

Pretty much none of this movie is likely to happen at any point in your life, but it can very easily have an influence on your dreams.So there's this gas station/horror house.

I loved the Evil Dead series, and I considered \\"Freddy v. Jason\\" one of the best ideas anyone has ever had for a movie.

The 'story' is wayward; it weaves around the movie like a drugged and drunken pirate. It's so bad that it cannot, by any rational means, be dubbed charming, obtuse, avante-garde, or for that matter, bearable. And, to be perfectly morbid, the deaths they bothered to show were blahze in the extreme.I honestly felt like mangling something when the film was FINALLY over--perhaps the title was meant to indicate how many people died of boredom, or killed from frustration, after watching this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A true waste of time","review":"I borrowed this DVD from one of my nephews.

The movie had so much unnecessary and very explicit violence and gore. The chick that was masterbating with the corpses didn't help the movie either.

The movie starts out fine, after all it is hard to be completely original in the genre. However near the end of the movie it loses it's way completely, editing becomes quick and Zombie seems to be desperately forcing in one tribute or clich�� in after another. There's nothing uniquely scary and any disturbing element comes from \\"what the hell is he going to cram in next?\\" not from worthwhile plot twists or story elements. The heroine / victim runs through a plot that seems more like a spooky horror ride from a carnival or midway than a frightening, horrific situation. Try again, Mr. Zombie. You can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should only be shown in ROB ZOMBIE's house.","review":"Pretty much unwatchable. Loud, silly, and filmed in that amateurish music video style that is becoming so utterly common that it should have a genre of it's own, HOUSE OF 1K CORPSES was made by rocker ROB ZOMBIE obviously for ROB ZOMBIE. All shlock, no shock and certainly not scary, skip this hoaky hommage to 70's horror movies because it just doesn't work. Watch the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE again and revell in a more accurate view of horror in the 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombie's Homage To The Classics Falls Miserably Short...","review":"I really wanted to like this movie. I REALLY DID!But...unfortunately I was very disappointed. Rob Zombie attempts to pay homage to the REAL greats of the slasher/horror genre like Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, and Wes Craven but fallls miserably short and also steals much from other older, better movies of this type. A rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House On The Left, The Hills have Eyes, and MANY, MANY other cult classics.More disgusting and trashy doesn't mean better, Rob. BUT... If I had to say something positive about the DVD...The disc features are so banal and trailer-trashy, that they are almost WORTH RENTING (not BUYING) this DVD. Really, the ONLY reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1... Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Quit Your Day Jobs","review":"This isn't a good movie. This isn't even a good cheese flick. This movie is the crappiest waste of celluloid I've seen in a long time. Don't subject yourself OR your worst enemy to this filth.This film isn't self-depreciating, it isn't even funny in it's grotesqueness.This movie is just BAAAD! Bad acting, bad editing, bad rehash of an old concept. Texas Chainsaw Massacre with trailer trash running the show. By that I mean the cast AND crew.The only thing even remotely creepy is Sheri Moon's portrayal of a psycho just a little too well. It's not a compliment. Rob, just because you've decided to shack up with your go-go dancer doesn't mean the rest of the world is as smitten as you. Keep her in the cage or in the nudie mags, but not EVER on the screen again!Horrifyingly Disappointing, this movie is the first to get my Seal of Disapproval. Stick to music, Mr. Zombie. That's definitely what you do best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Zombie - I thought it was just a gimmick","review":"Rob Zombie of the former heavy metal group White Zombie has made a living off of horror. He injected his music with it many years ago, and rode the wave to fortune, and fame. I always thought it was just a gimmick, until I saw this movie. It flashes in and out from scene to scene with more camera effects than a kaleidoscope. With cheesy hicks setting the stage for a blood bath, you'll soon realise what I did. Rob Zombie is a schizophrenic. I think he really sees all of this jacked up stuff in his head. Is it too many years of drug abuse? You make the call. After watching this film though, I felt paranoid, depressed, and every other emotion in the book. If you want to have a very bad trip without taking any drugs, watch this movie. Some of the images will haunt you for quite awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Rob Zombie music fans!","review":"I'm a pretty big fan of Rob Zombie's music and I wanted to like it but just couldn't. As would be expected, the music/soundtrack was pretty good. However, as a movie it left a lot to be desired.Rob just couldn't find a \\"tone\\" or mood and stick with it. For a lot of the movie, especially in the start, it was more \\"backwoods\\" funny than scary ( I kept on thinking Tales from the Crypt\\" crossed with \\"Deliverance\\") By the end it was more on the creepy, psychotic feel to it than anything else (think the Cell with J Lo).But overall, Rob just couldn't pull everything together. It not that bad for a first try though - maybe if he had a little more experience he could come up with a film that would be a little more well received. But I think he should stick to what he does best music - and maybe music videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sickly Beautiful","review":"There is one word to sum up this movie...beautiful. I did not know what to excpect at all. After the movie was finished I was in awe. I wish the legend of Doctor Satan was true. This movie was disgusting, it was disturbing, it was absolutely PERFECT. What an enchantingly vivid mind Rob Zombie has. Not a movie for little kiddies. I loved the torture and the horrifically dazzling costumes. A great All Hallows Eve classic. I don't understand why people do not enjoy this movie. Violence and blood galore what more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT MY 93 MINUTES BACK!!!!!!!!","review":"Luckily I rented this movie, because it sucks! I would ask Blockbuster for a refund, but I would much rather have the 93 minutes back that I spent watching this trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a complete turkey","review":"This movie actually starts off well. The spooky funhouse/freakshow is a good idea. Unfortunately, it ends up being one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.The most striking flaw is that it's a complete rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Group of young kids, travelling through an out-of-the-way country town where the folks are a bit weird, come across a hitchhiker and end up being slaughtered by a family of cannibals/satanists/something. One of the bad guys even makes a mask out of a dead guy's face. Tobe Hooper should be paid royalties from this movie. Can you spell P-L-A-G-I-A-R-I-S-M?From there, it goes from being a bad rip off of Texas Chainsaw to being just plain stupid. It makes no sense, you stop caring about any of the characters and what's happening, and it's not scary in the slightest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rob Zombie Owes Me 10 bucks","review":"This was the most horrible movie I have seen in the last 10 years. It was boring and painful to sit through, even though the running time is under an hour and a half. Stick to music and cartoons, Mr. Zombie. Not everyone can make a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry Mr. Zombie","review":"but your movie is just lame. I wanted to badly to love it as i have your music, but oh my how i was let down. What was with all the flashy, nonsensical editing and all the wannabe arty junk, huh? Why did you remove every bit of emotion or tension for the sake of technical glitz? you know, if you wanted to harken to the oldies then why not learn from them first? this piece of dulling cinema was not worth my $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROB ZOMBIE, OPUS 1","review":"**** 2003. Written and directed by Rob Zombie. Four young people lose their way and drive finally to the Firefly's, a family of vicious killers. Rob Zombie's first movie deserves our utmost attention as it reveals a true filmmaker that will confirm his skill four years later withHalloween (Two-Disc Special Edition). Highly recommended.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"R. Zombie + horror = Awesome","review":"This is an amazing film from Rob Zombie. I do feel that it must be watched with the sequel or you may lose some of the of the great aspects of a Rob Zombie movie. It it probably in my top 15 horror movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Halloween Fan's Dream","review":"House of 1000 Corpses is a halloween fanatics wet dream and a must for any horror freak. Rob Zombie has created a truely disturbing story that is unmistakingly genius. The depth of the main villianous characters is one of the elements that make this special. You almost want these twisted guys and gals to win. Mr. Zombie has created a family that lives, breaths and kills together. They are the best example of black humor. You can't help but chuckle at the sickness behind each and every line and scene. Any Halloween fan should run to the store and buy 1000 copies of this movie. It is a living and breathing haunted house unto itself. Some have called it a rip off, some cliche. I call it an homage to all things horror and of the seventies horror genre. Well crafted and unforgettable. You will not be let down by this film if you are a true horror fan.Cheers!!!F.U.B.A.R."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either I'm stupid or this movie is....","review":"I'm not discounting the first possibility, but I'm not sure I got the point of the movie.In the end, were the Fireflys survivors of Dr. Satan? Beats me. I kind of felt like the whole movie was one series of horror videos loosely (very) tied together with random camera effects (solarization EVERYWHERE, twists, pulls, flashes) and jagged editing.The acting was horrible, although Karen Black used to be a real actress. In this, she's just a large, leering figure who sole purpose is...beats me. She's kind of the 'mother' to the bunch, but beyond that...I dunno.Baby was the only one I really liked and I wished they focussed more on her. Her cackling giggle is completely irritating but at least she's reasonably easy on the eyes.I wasn't scared. I wasn't even disgusted. What I was left with was mild curiousity about the ending. As I understand it, Zombie is working on HO10KCorpses 2. Lotsa luck with that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an excuse to be violent.","review":"I enjoy Rob Zombie's music a lot! But this film was horrible. The writing is terrible. The acting is not very much better. And yes, I do know about the supposedly great cult actors in the film. But come on, folks. There's a reason why not many people know about them. Because they're not that good. Explain more about the psychotic villains, too! That would have made the movie a lot better.Style-wise, I thought it was up to par with any film out there today. And that's solely because Rob Zombie, successful musician that he is, can afford to finance a project like this and spare little to no expense.I understand what he was trying to do (recreate an old fashioned-looking, 70's-style horror movie). But stick to music, man. And please; spare us from the inevitable sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could NOT Play it:o(","review":"The ONLY reason I gave THIS 1 star was the Disc would not play on My PS3!!I live in Australia & the Disc warned Me that I need to check My region to play Disc!Besides that, I would of gave this Film 5 stars!!I LOVE HOUSE of 1000 Corpses!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Seen It","review":"I was extremely unlucky enough to of seen this movie at a horror convention a while back. There is really no surprise at all as to why this movie has had such bad luck coming out. To put it quite simply - It is awful. Disgustingly bad. This movie is a sure fire way to have your intelligence extremely insulted. If writer/director/two hit wonder Rob Zombie had intelligence of his own, then maybe he would've made a movie that was actually worth seeing. This movie delves right into all the typical cliched horror junk that he always says he hates. The plot is very predictable. One we have seen a hundred million times. There is nothing new here folks. Nothing exciting. It's sick and twisted, and that is not something that really flies nowadays. If you are intelligently challenged, then this is for you... F+."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time in my life that I walk out of a movie theater","review":"I can NOT believe what I'm reading. When I saw the movie, I thought I was being robbed. This has GOT to be the dumbest and stupidest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I walked out, for the first time in my life, in the middle of the movie (35 minutes). Characters, script, story, everything about this movie is not scary, nor was it entertaining.I thought, movies like this shouldn't even be allowed to play in theaters... bottom line, worst [money] I've ever lost in my life. (I didn't walk out earlier, because I wanted to finish my pop corn)...I feel sorry for the poeple who give 4 or 5 stars to this movie,; they should be sent back to the year 1623( you figure it out why I wrote 1623)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"It's a shame that an actress as talented as Karen Black had to reduce herself to performing in this crap. What's more, it is the cheapest ripoff of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre I have ever seen. Come on Rob, can't you be a little more creative?I have seen a few of Zombie's movies, including the Halloween remake. He should really stick to making music and not boring us senseless with this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be sorry!","review":"Don't waste your time on this pathetic pile of crap. I can't believe any studio would fund this joke. I'd say its equally as bad as Return to Horror High. Don't waste your time its not funny nor scary just stupid and it doesn't make any sense. I beg you not to buy it or rent it theres so many better movies out there. I reccomend Ginger Snaps, Leprechaun, the Sleepaway Camp series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was ...","review":"The movie lacked any real coherense and seemed to be lost for what it wanted to be. Did not disturb me or make me laugh. All it did was waste 9.50 of my money and 2 hours of my life. The audience making fun of the movie during it was more entertaining than the terribly boring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depraved murder/sex/filth scenes, nothing else.","review":"Just because a movie has an edgy sountrack and good cinematography does not make it a good movie. If you like scene after scene of disturbing murder/torture then get it I guess.For the people raving about the movie: quit kidding yourselves and admit that the only reason you enjoyed this film is because you get your kicks from filthy torture/murder scenes. You love it, and this movie gives it to you extra-value-meal-style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Rob Zombie needs to stick to his music and B horror movie collection as opposed to making them. This movie was a total let down and a complete waste of time and money. Not even worth waiting for the made for tv version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"Although all of Rob Zombie's musical ventures are on the lines of absolute crap since he obviously cares more about his image than anything else, I decided I'd one day go with my girlfriend to the movie theater and see if it lives up to the hype of \\"most gorey movie ever\\". Man, what a waste of $7!!!The movie had absolutely no relevant plot, the \\"horror\\" scenes were in the vein of the typically corny slasher movies of the 70's and mid-80's at best, and the fact that there was a somewhat cartoonish vibe to all the violence only made the movie all the more cheesy to tolerate, oops, I meant watch. I'm not lying when I say that half the people seeing that movie got up and left half way through its running time, so I guess this was one of those wierd times where everybody's right about Rob Zombie being completely inept at writing music as well as directing films. Do NOT see this movie unless you want to waste both your time and your hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy Splatterfest never better","review":"Not since Texas Chainsaw 2 has there been a better Cult Horror flick. Rob Zombie has rejuvinated the horror industry with this new cult classic. The unique characters and sweet catch phrases will have you rootin for the bad guys in no time. This is how horror flicks should be done. I can't wait to see The Devil's Rejects, his second film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a cross between Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Easy Rider","review":"I just watched this movie yesterday and I was disappointed after all the hype I read about it. The plot offers little new or particularly suspenseful and the special effects were just gratuitous...only there for the shock value, which was minimal. The Ed Gein-inspired cannibalism and wearing clothing made out of people has pretty much become a cliche that's about as amusing as Elvis-is-alive jokes. It seemed like Rob Zombie was a little too stoned when he wrote this one--it just rambles on. I was encouraged at first by the Marx Brothers' reference to Captain Spaulding and the family name Firefly. The Agatha Crispies was funny too, but the humor wasn't really paced out in the kind of way that makes for an effective build-and-release of tension in a movie. The Easy Rider-like segues between scenes was interesting, but it didn't add anything to the movie. It's probably a lot better if you watch it under the influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing to say the least","review":"I couldn't wait to watch this film......then I did.I could have sworn I saw a similar movie to this one before.It was much better and it was called Texas Chainsaw Masacre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheasy, Not Scary, But Full of GORE!!!","review":"House of a 1000 corpses is chop full of gore and loveable characters. The movie won't scare you as much as it will entertain you with delightfully detailed sets and well acted characters that you love to love, or love to hate. The movie is just a gore bath, fun to watch. One of those movies you show to people who don't normally watch horror movies to see how they react!BUY THIS MOVIE! BUY THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"House Of 1000 Re+@rds","review":"What the HELL was this??? Atrocious directing by Rob \\"the hack\\" Zombie (who seems to think this is a 2-hour music video based on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). A brainless script that is neither smart nor fresh. An amazingly moronic plot that's neither entertaining nor clever... Rob's first effort in the way of directing failed miserably. Not at ALL what I expected. You'd think such an inane piece of drivel would at least satisfy gore-hounds on account of there's nothing in the way of a refreshing plot. Ho1000C is about as gory as A Charlie Brown Christmas. Terrible, HORRIBLE movie. No wonder so many studios dropped this piece of 5h!+"},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful blood vehicle","review":"Zombie attempts to glamorize his gore-fest by saying it's a tribute to '70's horror flicks, but the movie is the trashiest, most god awful waste of film I've ever seen. I regret even thinking Zombie had made a decent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retreadsville...","review":"This film had nothing new. It ripped off other films and had no gore whatsoever. And the bad 70s rock video \\"special effects\\" were just plain ridiculous. There was no plot, it wasn't scarey and the dark humour was too predictable.The best part about the DVD was the menu system.The movie itself sucked ass.Zero stars should have been istigating for this stinker..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should have rocked--what happened??!!","review":"I love horror films and enjoy metal music so I should have been happy with this film. The DVD is great, in essence, with the menu intros and the hidden features but that does not make up for a bad movie. I have seen worse but it seems that Rob Zombie needs to work a little harder. The beginning was great with Captain Spaulding and the ending, with DR. SATAN, was interesting, but the middle just lagged. It would seem Rob wanted to pay homage to his favorite gore flicks from the 1970's but it just fell so short and seemed to have no real direction. I felt no suspense and I really did not feel the urge for the victims to escape or for the villians to win. I just really wanted it to end. I borrowed this film from a friend and I am so gald that I did not actually purchase it. I have heard that he is working on a follow-up to this movie and I hope it is better then this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's horror is back","review":"You can only classify this movie as a classic 70's, campy horror flick. It's simple plot, blatant sexual content, scenes of unadulterated violence, and barrage of grotesque video clips makes this the best horror/thrillers I've seen in years. DO NOT expect a pretty, special effects filled film. If you're looking for realistic, yet stylish scenes of anguish & torture, this is for you. I also enjoyed the artistic shots in some scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long awaited and unfortunately dissapointing.","review":"I just returned from watching this movie, I've waited more than 2 years to see. I expected so much more from all the hype.If you're a fan of Rob Zombie, If you've been to any of his shows or his old White Zombie shows and you loved their stage act you will love this movie. Tons of over the top melodrama, unbelievable characters, gore and confusion reign in this film school dropout's version of texas chainsaw massacre.I hate to say this about a musician that I respect and who's music I enjoy, but if you aren't a [real] fan I suggest you wait until it hits the pay channels. There is no plot to speak of and no characters to identify with. Sid Haig's character is th only one that is engaging and he has a bit part in the film as the proprietor of a creepy gas station. If you are looking for an intelligent horror film that will keep you guessing and interested this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can This Be any More of a Texas Chainsaw Copy? (Inferior)","review":"In essence, this is a Texas Chainsaw remake, but here's the difference, and why it's far inferior. I don't care one iota for the \\"victims.\\" I can barely tell the females apart. The guys are so obnoxious, I look forward to them dying. Unlike Texas Chainsaw (parts one and two, horror masterpieces!), this movie shows the \\"psycho family\\" (hmmm... kind of like Texas Chainsaw?) far too much. A little goes a long way, too much? OVERKILL! Many plot holes, and take away the music, there was some really bad acting. It gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style, and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed. But in general, Rob Zombie should not get writing credit for this. It's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only nowhere near as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Me","review":"Aight.... I was waiting for something that will knock me outta my seat. PUH-LEASE. Whatta waste of tape! It wasn't scary at all... the only thing that came to my mind was annoying. I swear I could hear that blonde chicks laugh in my head days after I watched the movie! I wanted to spoon my eyes out. If you see this movie on the shelf burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"Well, I must have seen a different version of 1000 corpses than the other people here.I was expecting something so intense and graphic that no major company(universal,mgm,etc.)could ever touch.boy was I wrong,the reason no one did is because it stinks! I want my money back,because its not what they promised.There is a reasonable amount of violence,but hardly any gore,no nudity but a out of focus nip shot that gets your hopes up but goes nowhere.All of the praise the actors give the movie,calling it a real horror movie,made my stomach turn.They sound like smart people,but this aint real horror. No graphic violence ,no gore,no nudity,DOESNT SOUND LIKE A 1970'S HORROR THROW BACK TO ME.Ive been cheated yet again."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure psychotic","review":"The movie was great. I loved every minute of it. For the people who gave this movie bad reviews, they don't know what a good horror movie is. Rob did a great job with this movie. I can't wait until the sequel.

This movie has finally been what I've been looking for. I wanted a really gory, unbeleivably shocking movie that I didn't even think could be released because of its extreme sentiment. This is it! I've seen the trailer for Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the NEW one), and heard a lot about it, and yes, this movie is identical to it. A bunch of people get lost, go to a house, get chopped up and all die at the end. But its so elaborated and detailed, its gruesome! If you're looking for a REAL scary movie that will actually scare you, Rent this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre rubbish....","review":"I generally enjoy films that are deliberately trashy and schlocky, however this film was truly amatuerish and just plain pathetic. The film lacked any real atmosphere and tension, and so I found myself looking at my watch for the entire proceedings."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Basically the movie is just people running around an expensive haunted house. Not that bloody or gory either, so if you were looking for that, you'll be disspointed. But if you were just looking for pointless, bloodless, abuse of Scooby Doo horror cliches (yes, I know it was homage to classic horror like TCM, but seriously, it's boring and an overkill that didn't need to be made), then I guess you'll enjoy it. Me personally I'm open to all horror, fom exploitation to the occult, and this one just didn't satisfy me. This is just Rob Zombie trying too hard to prove to the world that he's the biggest fan of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which was an okay film, although gets overrated for being gory, hence why it's laugahable when people deduct this movie to be gory just for the association with TCM)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashamed of Rob Zombie.","review":"I am so ashamed of Rob Zombie. I'm surprised he didn't get sued by all the other movies he ripped off to make this debacle. It has little imagination, and is basically a rip off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a few other horror movies rolled into one.

Don't waste your time watching this stupidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"Now we know why Riff Raff didn't get his own movie 30 years ago.

What it needs is a shot in the head. This has got to be the worst movie ever written!! The movie is disjointed, there is absolutely no plot, and it continually wastes your time with these \\"Oh, I'm so clever... look-what-I-learned-in-film-class negative exposure shots.\\" To top it off, the credits end with \\"The End?\\" which couldn't BE more fitting considering that \\"Manos: The Hands of Fate\\" ended the same way (by the way, how unoriginal).

Here's a guy who's love for that \\"time\\" in history for movies of this nature propelled him to do something about it. He borrows from everyone who inspired him and doesn't try to hide it. Of course, the first movie that came to mind was \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\". Throw 10 others in the stew and you have a killer, nostalgia drenched ride that is as silly and stupid as it is fun.

Rob Zombie's art used to be making songs about cheesy horror flick type stuff and that was awesome but this movie just showed that he also has a new art(making incredibly stupid,unarguably cheesy horror flicks).What the hell was he thinking?Despite the review Tobe Hooper gave him, this movie is nowhere near as good as Poltergeist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre(those movies kicked ass!).Personally I think Tobe Hooper should have kicked Rob's ass for making this garbage instead of giving him an undeserving round of applause.This is the worst movie Ive ever seen next to Tim Burton's atrocious Planet Of The Apes remake.This sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombie made a mess and it cant be fixed","review":"being a Rob Zombie music fan I watched this movie. by god it stunk, im sorry but it did and you all who liked it can kiss my ass. nothing was good about this movie. the horrible dialouge and gruesome characters only make this a bore beyond the bore margain. a waste of time for me. if you want horror rent something other than this one. one of the worst movies of 2003"},{"rating":"1","title":"GRAVELY DISAPPOINTED","review":"Rob Zombie better stick to his music, because this piece of work was shelved and tossed around by studios for two years before it was finally released, where I will now shelve it for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money!!!","review":"I am a fan of 70s horror and this is no tribute.

At one point I switch from this movie to watch baseball. Nothing original....nothing suspenseful,...nothing that reaches into you mind to make you think or worry or fear. Just random images of gore.

I watched this movie just last night, and what a waste of time. As a music video, this would have been great. It was definitely a visual feast and was artfully crafted--to be played along with heavy rock or techno music. The dialog was trite, the plot (what plot?) was lost amidst the imagery. And as for gore, this movie was not the life-scarring blood fest it was reputed to be. I'm rather glad of that, actually. When it was all over I actually wished I had better spent my time ironing or washing dishes. It's probably worth a look, but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rob Zombie Fan","review":"This movie seemed to be aimed at shocking and horrifying people rather than actually giving anyone a good scare. I couldn't believe something this grotesque could come out of one persons mind. I can only count two times in this movie where I actually felt scared. I can't, however, begin to count the ammount of times I felt appauled and disguested. I'm a horror-film lover, but this passes the limit of being tastefully scary and dives into insanity. I give this movie a 2 for effort...but it just went too far. If these are images into the brain of Rob Zombie, I'm thinking a psychiatrist is in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tommy Tucker!","review":"A bag of [stuff]!I missed this at the London Frightfest in August 2003 and should have left my curiosity there. No suspense whatsoever, resulting only in a torrent of annoying, unfrightening characters.

Couldn't have ripped off TCM and TCM2 more without bringing out a chainsaw. Visual style was also a heavy rip of Natural Born Killers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humor-value earns the 2 stars","review":"While this movie doesn't exactly revolutionize the horror genre, it does persevere through horrid moments by use of humor. Unfortunately, this humor is really childish in some places.If you're in to campy horror, give it a shot. But even then, don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like anything filmed, avoid at all costs!!!!","review":"Likening this to an already outdated music-video expanded into an inept idea is being nice. Pointless, not scary, not sexy at all, and BLAND - this fails as an even basic horror film.

All I can tell you is it's BIZARRE! It's very dark and grainy and seems to be filled with torture, bondage, and just outright lunacy...it's totally what I would expect from Rob Zombie. Any fan of his music is going to like this movie, and if anyone has their doubts about it, listen to the song, it sets the stage for the film. RZ is probably the biggest horror movie fan there is, and I can't wait to see how twisted his own movie is going to be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie stinks rob zombie is a fake and a fraud and a hack!!!!!!!","review":"rob zombie has proved that he is the worst director in hollywood this movie is only focused on shock value not scares or chills or thrills rob zombie is seriously is one terrible film maker and he puts his wife in way too many of his movies i never liked rob zombie to begin with his music is ok but him in the directors chair well lets just say he is the worst movie director on earth this movie looks and sounds like one big epic rob zombie music video which = lame and uber boring and stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE FOR THE STUPID","review":"Moronic non-director Rob Zombie has apparently confused himself with earlier entertainers with actual talent. He has arrogantly filled this ugly, excrable \\"movie\\" with references to Helen Kane, Slim Whitman and Groucho Marx! No doubt Zombie's fans are too ignorant to recognize any of these luminaries. Indeed, it's hard to believe any fan of this film could summon up the intellectual energy to dress himself. Let them wallow in their gross stupidity, which they've so glowingly illustrated in their drooling, idiotic posts for this film. Save for Sheri Moon's figure, this entire waste of celluloid is a cynical excercise in how to make money off of stupid people. Enjoy it, morons..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Yawns For This Bluff Flick","review":"The story is a monument of clich��s; the acting is forced and amateurish; the plot - if you can call it a plot, is so predictable it feels like a 2-hour d��j��-vu trip; the whole thing looks more like a music video than a real movie. In other words, Rob Zombie should stick to his music antics and spare us the cinematographic nonsense. A horror movie? My heartbeat didn't go above 65. Only redeeming value: the visuals, for which I will give it a star.

Nothing scary. Nothing suspenseful. Nothing intelligent. Shock value for 18 year olds that live in trailer parks drinking Coors in their tank tops and underwear.

Piece. Of. Unbelievable. CRAP.I had the highest of hopes for this movie. (Not high expectations--come on, Rob Zombie's not going to come up with a new 'The Haunting'.) But I was hoping for a thriller along the lines of 'Texas Chainsaw' (the original, not the god-awful remake).Instead, we are presented with this. It makes a student film with cinematography by Stevie Wonder, a script written by Forrest Gump and a femme fatale played by Geri Jewell look like 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Who was holding the cameras--a wall-eyed spastic? Karen Black is the ugliest woman in creation (hey, speaking of wall-eyes) and she could have done more here, but you only see her for a total of about two minutes.I can't even write. I'm flabbergasted, flummoxed and flapped to flinders by this flotsam. Rob Zombie is the ultimate retardo king of the Universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie.. Zombie is a genius!!!","review":"I love this movie!! I think I have watched this movie about 1000 times since I bought it. Its scary, but at the same time its kinda funny. All the characters say the funniest things. Sig haig is the best!! I would def recommend you watch it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a twisted mind imagines","review":"This movie is definitly one of the most sick and funny horror movies i have ever seen. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was definitly a classic because of it's raw depiction and i think this movie ranks somewhere close to it. On top of just being sick and twisted it is also funny. What kind of person can get to the point of being the way these people are in this movie. Rob Zombie has one hell of a imagination. This movie shows it in graphic detail. There were no elaborate special effects in this and that is what makes it better in my opinion. I give it 4 stars because with everything else it was kinda corny. But nonetheless worth having if your a horror movie fanatic like iam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash!","review":"If I could get away with it I wouldn't even give it 1 star. I wouldn't even let my dog see it. Please do not waste your time and money on this pieace of trash. Anybody who would like this movie, and find it remotely any good should consider seeking professional help. This movie was very disturbing and distatefully written. I think Rob Zombie should stick to the music business. Although he isn't any better at that either. If you want to see a really good horror movie, I would suggest a really good Stephen King movie. Rob could learn a few good lessons from the master of horror movies,Mr.Stephen King. I strongly urge you not to let children view this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"This movie really, really sucks. Rob Zombie is a disturbed man. It's definitely not worth watching if you have to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"Rob Zombie, what in the world were you thinking? This movie isn't worth the dirt from my shoes. It's just a waste of money. That guy wearing the clown make-up in the movie is just beyond stupid. And that girl with the long blonde hair that lives in the area of Dr. Satan was just flat out annoying. Every time she laughed I just wanted to smack her. This whole movie is completely stupid. What happened to the real horror films, like Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream, Carrie? Those were the best. But this movie deserves half a star. Please don't waste your money on this movie, it's defintely not worth it. Rob Zombie, here's a piece of advice, stick to making music, you don't know anything about making movies except how to make ones that suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I cannot say much more about this movie other than it is completely, and utterly INSANE!!!!Knowing Rob Zombie, it doesn't surpise me in the least that this was created out of his strange and bizarre mind.I seen it once, and that was enough.Too crazy for me. If you have not seen this film, please take anti-psychotic drugs before watching. I am sure this would be a complement to Mr.Zombie, but it isn't meant as one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Great Piece of WORK!!!","review":"This IS a great movie. This IS a horror movie the way it should be. very funny, but it could have been more gory. sucks that it's rated R but it is still worth every penny spent on buying this dvd. hopefully they will put out a director's cut. if not then it is still worth the watch for laughs and enjoyment. THIS ISN'T your average nowadays TEENY BOPPER horror movie, THIS is a REAL piece of ART!!! So teeny boppers, stick to scream and I know what you did last summer because you probably would not like this movie. but for real horror fans, this is a bitchin' movie!!! Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best horror comedy sice Evil Dead 2 5 for being so funny.","review":"This was much funnier than scary. Not much of a plot, just people getting tortured. The acting strinx, but Captain Spaulding and Dr. Satan make up for all of that. The ending was a little freaky, but overall this isn't that scary. Still this is the thought that pops into peoples mind when they think horror film. A movie with blood guts and gore and sinceless killing. Pure fun cuz after all we think the sight of people dying and being tortured is funny and amusing.lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie EVER.","review":"This movie was possibly one of the worst I have ever seen. I didn't go in expecting too much more than a cheesey horror flick, and was disappointed even then. The acting was atrocious, the special effects were vaguely good. The plot could have been very good, but it's execution was horrible, and thats being nice. I would recommend that NOBODY buy this movie ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"When is the sequal !!!!","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I first saw the previews of this movie. I knew I wanted to see it but I didn't know it was going to be that heavy. If you don't mind a demon or a tortured soul or two this is your movie. Im sure the next time you see a chicken & gas stop on the highway you will keep on rolling and fill up somewhere else. This movie isnt for everybody so put the kids to bed pour yourself a sophistcated drink and enjoy the horror and demonic House."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is a fantastic and classic horror film. The reason I saw this movie is because I enjoyed Rob Zombie's music {White Zombie and solo} and I thought it was cool that he was taking a intrest in love of horror films and he was actually going to make one and knowing from the music videos and cd's I knew it was going to be good and I was right. I'm a not fan of more recent horror movies {except for the remake of the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\"} cause I think the horror film genre has went down hill after the 80's. I really enjoyed this movie cause its like a classic horror movie and its set in a cool time peroid and its not one of those horror movies that make things so techinal. This is one of the most original horror movies that I have seen in a long time. I just hope the sequel is just as good.DVD: The DVD was alright but I would like to see the unrated version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal yet entertaining....with a stupid ending........","review":"Zombie pretty much ripped off several horror movies, mostly Texas Chainsaw 2. It has the gruesome feel and nasty scenes that any horror movie should have, yet they are just not original. It was a decent movie to watch until the ridiculous ending with \\"Dr Evil\\" in the basement. I pretty much took this movie from a 3.5 star horror to a 2 because of the cheesy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful Crap","review":"What a horrible film to have been waiting for. Since I first saw the trailer in theaters, what, 3 or 4 years ago, I have been dying to see this movie. Finally it comes out and it is savagely abusive to my psyche - not because it's violent, not because it's foul, not because it's so in my face, but because it just quite literally sucks. The violence isn't even that gratuitous: what they show is conveniently hidden behind set props and shot with home video or with photographic effects. I hope to everything holy that Rob Zombie releases a director's cut on DVD because I know this can't be what he had envisioned. The few high points in the film, such as Sid Haig and a memorable shot or two (high-angle execution, for one), are overshadowed by the plodding, incompetent \\"plot\\" and the altogether unsatisfying experience you get out of the movie, among other things. Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unflinching Horror","review":"This movie is violent, entertaining, well shot, and it has a strong cast of characters. Rob Zombie is great at staging a scene and his screenplay, while lacking originality of concept, makes up for it in execution. Features a strong cast of genre character actors including Bill Mosely (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), Sid Haig (Spider Baby), and Karen Black (Trilogy of Terror). It also includes the ultra hot Sheri Moon (appeared in many of Rob Zombie's music videos)."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK........Disapointing","review":"OK. I have seen every horror movie under the sun and this one was sad. No horror no suspence and bad scripting. Rob did a great job directing but the problem is the people didnt fit thier roles. But it does have some interesting parts like people being stabbed in bunny suites and girls cutting up a guy to disco funk music..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of ...","review":"Another rip off of Texas Chainsaw massacre and an excuse for some gore and a sequel. What is the point of this film? There is no plot and the characters are all one-dimensional and predictable. I suppose this is one of those adolescent films kids talk about at school. Probably appeals to those who still have a childish taste for gore - grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to your rock and roll Zombie...","review":"This movie annoyed me, I couldn't follow it. I mean, I got the whole story but there was a story being told only to be interrupted every 5 minutes by Zombie showing off that he knows how to use a Super 8 camera and add effects to it. Woooo!! Scary!!I think Zombie should stick to rock music especially if he thinks it's worth it to produce and direct a 120+ minute rock video."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!! SORRY PEOPLE!","review":"Wow, this was the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Terrible acting, to much gore, hated the storyline! It was dumb.It was about a group of four people whos car breaks down and they end up going to this house filled with freaks. Little did they know that they start disappering one by one. Getting tortured by freakish looking people who don't give a dam if your alvie or dead. And if your alive, you won't be if you stay with these people.Now, Im a Texas Chainsaw Massacare fan and i hated this movie. It was to gory for me, the plot was stupid, and and i don't recommend it to anyone.(0 stars, actually)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! What a crappy movie!","review":"When I rented this movie, I was expecting a scary film that I would enjoy. However, I ended up getting...something...that had absolutely NO plot whatsoever, or any rational components. It was literally a jumble of random events and film clips that, while at first bad, appeared to be leading somewhere, however it did not. The beginning was confusing and pointless, and even though I hoped for conclusion in the end, all I found was more film clips - in negative form - as well as random, inexplicable characters that served no purpose and settings that did not make sense. My advice to anyone is not to rent this movie, unless you want to mercilessly mock a truly horrible film and waste a couple hours. In the end, all I can say about this movie is...riiight. Whoever thinks that this is art should really get checked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst [movie] I've ever seen for years and years","review":"I'm usually too lazy to write any reviews of the movies, but the House of 1000 Corpses is just so bad that I had to write a warning to the potential audiences not to see this [movie]. This movie basically is a C- class production with no plots,no twists, not wits, no CGI special visual effects, poor ligting, costumes, and bad acting. I wonder how could it been ever released to the theater. Don't waste your time on this ... low budget [movie]. If you really enjoy horro movies,go to see final destination1,2, or even jeepers creepers is n times better. Save your time and money, or you will end up like me, throwing my shoes to the TV screen at the end of movie. I would have rated this movie zero star if I had that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Sick, Disturbing Movie!!","review":"For those of you who are into sick, disturbing images this movie is for you. Rob Zombie you are one sick individual! You did a very good job at distorting my vision by brutal violence, sick, twisted family values and nothing but pure filth. I am no saint, but the root of this movie is pure evil and is directed toward satanic values and beliefs. I have watched a lot of horror movies and I have to say that this is the only one that left me wanting to run out of the theatre and say \\"who gives a ... about my $$$!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"I'm a huge fan of Rob Zombie's music,unfortunatly I can't say the same about his movies.One of the worst horror movies I've seen.Not worth the price of a rental.If you must see it,get it from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a classic","review":"This is one of the worst horror films ever made. This movie is a sloppy mess about a deranged low life killer family that wreak havoc on travelers. This movie could have been entertaining instead it was dull, very poorly written, and had a very poor plot and almost no special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"If your looking for high budget special effects, this one isn't for you. But if you want an amazing plot and scary as all hell characters, this is a must own. The B style psycho killer story will burn haunting images into your memories for days to come. I am still waiting for the director's cut version, but until then, by this now!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"Since so many people have written what this movie is about, so I won't go into it. While I was watching this movie, I became very annoyed with that blond female. It seems like only roll in this film and that Devil's Reject movie (I think it's the same girl) is for her to just shake her bottom. She certainly cannot dance very well! She really annoyed me, so I was hoping that somehow she'll be just gone from that movie later on, but that didn't happen. Why can't Rob Zombie make a movie with decent actors and actresses who knows how to act?! Why can't he make a movie that aren't always degrading women?! If that blond is the one he is married to, then who is that dark hair girl with the braid in his video? Anyways, if you want to see a good horror film with good acting, well this isn't it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my Lord...","review":"I watched this as a favor to a friend. 88 minutes of my life I can't get back.

Clearly, Rob Zombie was trying way too hard to try to show he knew some film techniques and he went way overboard with them. The last 15 minutes were just over-the-top ridiculous, with some brand new monster coming out of nowhere. When the DVD's main menu commentary is the highlight of the product you've got a real problem. See Wrong Turn instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"stripper zombie killers","review":"I enjoyed the spliced in Bettie Page impersonator, and the soulful rendition of \\"I Wanna Be Loved By You.\\" I appreciated the gore. And yet, I didn't think this qualified as a feature film. A two-hour Rob Zombie video is more like it. It was about 115 minutes too long. The spastic editing made the movie hard to follow. The scariest part about the whole film was that so much money was poured into it. See it if you want to, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucktacular...","review":"I'm a huge cheese-horror fan, but this movie is just dull.

It's so delirious!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you, like a Fungus. Crazy, Bizarre, and Wicked.","review":"I passed this up, many times, when I worked in a movie store. The cover was freaky, and the special packaging was gruesome. I never rented it. However, I watchedThe Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), and loved the movie. A coworker explained that this was a \\"part two\\" ofHouse of 1,000 Corpses, so I gave it a chance.I not only enjoyed the movie, but I must admit that this is now one of my faves. I also purchased the following items related to this flick;House of 1000 Corpses (Soundtrack, Explicit Lyrics),The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), and[[ASIN:B0009SCUXIThe Devil's Rejects (DUALDISC, EXPLICIT LYRICS, SOUNDTRACK))].After seeing the Rob Zombie films, the soundtracks have a life of their own. I've become a big Rob Zombie fan over the past few years, and I recommend his stage performances, as well as ALL of his CDs and DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Don't get me wrong, I give Rob Zombie credit for writing and directing his first two films though they could've been alot better. I'm all about the campy and the gore but, this one as well as Devil's Rejects, didn't really have alot of depth along with the fact that there was excessive profanity. Same with some of the ludeness.I'm still anxious to see Rob's take on Halloween and I understand that sometimes a first time film maker has to experiment till their films get even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Zombie did good.","review":"Rob Zombie did a great job on House of 1000 corpses. If you like cheesy, gory 80's horrorflicks then you will like this movie.

It seemed like a HUGE Texas Chainsaw Massacre rip-off if you ask me. The clown at the gift shop was the most entertaining character in the whole film. I love how the DVD has him introducing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is pretty good, loved the Baby character","review":"I can't beleive some ass clown here insultet Baby's laugh saying it was irritating!, I loved it!, I can't get enough of that laugh!, plus what a cutie (mr Zombie is a lucky man), this is a pretty fun movie to watch. although it gets a little confusing towards the end. I was'nt scared, although thats not Rob's fault, I never get scared by horror movies, but I guess the would terrifie the teenyboppers that are used to Scream and such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"I love Rob Zombie's music. So when I first heard about this movie and how he was having problems getting it to theaters, I figured this must be one gruesome and disturbing movie. I really did enjoy it. My girlfriend thought it was morbid and disturbing. But, I thought it was a little tamed to what I had expected. Infact I don't understand why it was so hard for him to get it to the thearter. But, I did enjoy it. And for those of you who enjoy a good ole bloody movie should give it a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill...","review":"House of 1000 Corpses is a horror film that takes the word overkill to the literal meaning. Two college couples are on their way home to the father of one the girls when they find out about a local mass murder of innocent patients in a mental hospital decades ago. Their curiosity wants to take them to the tree where the killer, Dr. Satan, was hanged, but instead their car breaks down. Soon they find themselves among insane people who practice witchcraft, cannibalism, and murder for pleasure. As a cinematic experience this film offers some interesting shots, cinematography, and editing, but this too seems to be driven to overkill and makes the story a feast in repetitious carnage. Thus, the story seems lost, but the violence keeps the audience's attention due to its graphic and abnormally painful nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarassment to Horror Movies","review":"The only way that a person could actually like this movie is if that person was on heroine. This movie is pathetic, and I encourage NO ONE to see it! It makes no sense whatsoever, and it is just plain stupid! Rob Zombie is a crackhead and shouldn't be allowed to make movies, because he really sucks at it! DO NOT see this movie! This movie doesn't even deserve one star. It deserves no stars at all, it's THAT bad! I am offended and embarrassed as a die hard horror movie fan that this movie was even allowed to be released, because it gives horror a bad name! Rob Zombie, go back to making music, you are a pathetic director!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better","review":"I just saw the movie and am not thrilled. The first half was okay but towards the end it struggled. Rob Zombie tried to hard to go beyond the norm and gross the [...]out of you. It just became stupid. The very end though was a cool twist.

This movie is supposed to pay homage to the scary movies of yesterday, but after watching it you start to realize, that its just an excuse. It is horrible, I expected so much more from this movie. There was so much potential, come on ..... Rob Zombie... Horror.....It should have mixed well, but it was a disaster. I do have a friend who just loves this movie, but he and probably anyone who adores this movie, is someone who always tries to be different. Even if it means having to add this worthless piece of junk to your DVD collection. Don't get me wrong I really hope it goes better for Rob the next time around, because this mixture could have a great outcome.

What gore? I know ol Rob was paying homage to campy old movies, but gawd man, come up with at least a new angle. This is a direct \\"rip-off\\" of Texas Chainsaw franchise and some zombie movies. All done before and not even remotely scary. Thank god I got to borrow this from my library, but in my estimation is a complete waste of my time, money and the DVD is was printed on. I fast forwarded so often (because it was BORING), It only destroyed about an hour of my life.I also am not one of those snobs.

There is NOTHING redeemable in this film. Zero reward. Zombie should stick to making his music. No matter how big a fan of the genre, he is NO movie maker. And certainly no HORROR movie maker. I've read that he truly believes that this is his \\"gift to the genre\\". Delusional as are the fans of this empty, worthless, flick.

Even before I read her afterword, where she said she went the way of this pilgrimmage as part of her research, I thought that she had. There is such a wealth of detail in each of her books. Her characters too are very real, and there is a lot of character development in this particular book. In this book Catherine and her Edgar set out on a pilgrimmage to St. James tomb in Spain. They hook up with a bunch of fellow pilgrims and stay with that group for the duration. Catherine's father, uncle and cousin are also part of the group. Along the way, death seems to be following a certain group of elderly knights, and it's up to Catherine and Edgar to determine who among them is killing off these old men in such bizarre and violent ways. And why these men? This is certainly a motley crew of pilgrims, and the reader really gets to know them in this story.

The screen MFG is not at fault though."},{"rating":"1","title":"slightly damaged during shipping","review":"I will echo the previous reviewer's sentiment to say that this item was damaged during shipping.

The George White Scandals was a top notch variety show and the 1934 movie of that name described the show quite well indeed. This version is hackneyed and grossly unfunny.

It's well written, is quite self-contained (contrary to other books, it does not rely on knowledge of something not actually covered in the exam) with no obvious loose thread and does not leave you in the dark about some of the subject matter.Not only it's not bad overall, but on top of this, it's cheaper than other 70-215 certification books.

The book only summarizes topics which will be covering for the exam. For example, it explains Active Directory in ten pages. If you are an expert on Windows 2000, you don't really need this book.

Watching them talk about people behind their backs, be rude to them in person, have ego driven diva meltdowns it all makes me SICK. Remember the lesson the director of Fashion Week taught us in Season 2? Designers should treat people with RESPECT and that over the top behavior does not belong in fashion (at which point Daniel V. makes a big point to stare Santino down). The way a few of the designers disrespects Heidi in the workroom was unforgivable! Who are these people and why arent they on meds? Get some therapy and work on yourself and try and behave like an actual human being. If I had behaved this way in public I would be mortified, die of embarrassment, etc. They're so nasty to one another that by the time we get to the runway show I'm too upset to care about the clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Turn Off","review":"I've been a great fan of Project Runway, seen every episode several times, bought every season on dvd & watched them several times. I've recomended the show to anyone who'd listen. There have been good & not so good seasons, good & not so good judging, but season eight was worse than the worst that preceeded it. The judging was totally inexplicable & inexcusable. People were kept on the show who never should have been on the show at all. The final winner was a jaw dropping shock, one of those \\"what were the thinking?\\" moments. I was so put off by season 8 that I have no intension of buying it on dvd. More, I was so disgusted I may never watch upcoming seasons. Tim Gunn was the only one to come off well & the only reason I may relent & watch future shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"Just finished watching an episode per night of Season 8 and ultimately feel quite turned-off by the whole thing. The no-longer amusing bitchiness of Gretchen, Ivy, etc., the arrogance and superciliousness of Michael Kors and much of the manipulation and slickness of the production left us with a certain feeling of time badly spent and having been had. What was really offensive was the sadistic exploitation of poor Michael Costello and his meltdown when he lost - on and on mercilessly humiliating him and us. Ugh! Tim Gunn remains very special and endearing, but it's not enough. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional rollercoaster of a season.","review":"This season, more than others really challenges the viewer into looking at themselves in terms of how one treats their fellow human being.Although the designer's skills seem a bit weaker than previous years, the emotional impact makes for a more heartfelt season.Nail biter to the last moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong cd that mixes Mid Eastern sounds with classic rock","review":"This Tea Party cd is a must have for any Zep/Doors/Queensryche fans who love layered music and incredible musicianship.

Highly recommend this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dip into the lambryth of exotic music from Canada","review":"This is my favorite Tea Party album.

I've picked it up again over the years and I'm listening to it again today (digital format, of course). I have to say that this album is timelessly superb. I would assert that if do not like this album, then you don't like rock. Yes, it's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Debut","review":"I probably would never have discovered The Tea Party if I had not moved to NW Washington state in 1996. I was in the car listening to Vancouver, BC radio and this amazing sound was coming out of my stereo. What is this?!!! Turned out to be \\"Sister Awake\\" from Edges of Twilight. We went to Vancouver (couldn't find the CD in USA) that weekend and I bought Twilight & Splendor, and been hooked ever since. Splendor is more \\"dreamy\\" than some of their others, but an amazing/unique effort for a debut album.Didn't see them live until Transmission but it was worth the wait. I have yet to see a band as precise in their timing/transitions as they were. Hard to believe all that sound was from 3 guys. Jeff Burrows is probably the best \\"unknown\\" percussionist out there. Like Peart for Rush, he is the power behind The Tea Party. Would love to see them get back together if their differences can be sorted out."},{"rating":"2","title":"East meets West","review":"The Tea Party are an amazing combination of elements. With a sound that mixes Zeppelin and Doors with their own edge and top notch musicianship AND great songs, it's almost impossible not to like these guys. Especially interesting on this release was the use of some Eastern / Arabian keys in songs like 'Save Me'. They put the average \\"rock band\\" these days to absolute shame. Buy this CD. And look at \\"Transmission\\" and \\"The Edges of Twilight\\" too. They kick!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Indie/Canadian Sound From Excellent Canadian Band","review":"The Tea Party makes use of over 200 instruments in their albums. Their early records (SPLENDOR SOLIS, Edges Of Twighlight) are more mellow and artistic, compared to the more digital and rough sound of Transmission. The deep throat sound of the band gives them an edge, while their Canadian heritage tops it all off. Over all a must buy to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must get something great but way off the norm.","review":"This group is facinating with their lyrics and sound. Many will notice that this group is a combination of Led Zeppelin and the Doors but in their own way. They continue to amaze on each of their albums, maturing with each album. A must buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Zeppelin-esque blues rock","review":"The Tea Party's major label debut is an example of blues rock at its best. Lead guitarist Jeff Martin shows his talent on songs like Sun Going Down, a classic blues rock song, The River, a hard rocking masterpiece, and Raven Skies, a middle eastern rock song. Also, Winter Solstice is a beautiful acoustic song that you can put on repeat and enjoy for hours. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who likes Led Zeppelin, and also for anyone who enjoyed the Tea Party's two later albums. You can really see the evolution from album to album."},{"rating":"2","title":"the beginning of a great band","review":"This album is not as good as their later ones but for a debut album only a few come to mind that are better. This album mixes blues, rock and Jeff Martin's eastern influences to produce a musically diverse and ingenius piece of work.

The format of the book where each group member comments on different subjects from their early experiences in post-war Liverpool playing in the \\"bombies\\", the bombed put areas around the city to their first impressions of the U.S. works well. The reader gets a sense of the love and comradarie that helped them to become successful.

Good pictures, good stuff. I urge all Beatlemaniacs! Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"This is it - The Beatles, in their own words. If you're a Beatles fan, and you're interested in the ideas behind the music and how the Beatles developed personally and artistically through the years, Anthology is for you; it doesn't get any better than this. It's an intersting story and a great read, but what makes it special is its authenticity; you know you're getting the real story because it's the Beatles themselves who are telling it. If you only have a casual Beatles interest, you may not find it quite as enjoyable, but for true fans the book is a fantastic treat. A great pleasure to own & enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got to Get This Into Your Life...","review":"Just got the \\"Anthology\\" yesterday, and let me throw a few words at you:Hefty. Dense. Comprehensive.Pictures? It's crammed with them.Is it readable? While most books made up of interview quotes can be frustratingly Helter Skelter, the quotes in \\"Anthology\\" are edited so that the book flows in a highly readable narrative style.I feared that this book might be a cheap cashing-in. Rather, it's a beautifully mammoth effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"War and Peace\\" of Beatles Biographies","review":"Wow. First off, one can't help but marvel at the fact that this book is HUGE! This makes every other Beatles biography look rather pathetic in comparison. The sheer number of superbly reproduced, and more often than not never-before-seen, photographs is mind-boggling. This is the absolute definitive story of the Beatles, as told by them, so all the speculation and conflicting stories that have surfaced in previous books is completely irrelevant. If you are a Beatles fan, then this book is an absolute MUST. And believe me, once you buy this book, you will be able to retire any and all of your existing Beatles biographies for use as coasters, placemats, puppy training papers or the like. I also strongly encourage you to look into the new CD, \\"Beatles 1.\\" All 27 of the original number 1 singles have been digitally remastered (spectacularly, I might add!) and the sound is unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh memories.","review":"I've just begun to enjoy reading and paging through the new Beatle's Anthology book.

I have never found a Beatles book as boring as this one, I found myself praying the book would end. Paul can put you to sleep with one paragraph, Ringo is forever trying to defend himself as a great drummer (He wasn't even the greatest drummer in the Beatles) and George is so pompous that I stopped reading him about halfway through to get to the end more quickly.Anyone who wants to know the real story of the Beatles would be far better served by \\"The lives of John Lennon\\" by Albert Goldman."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate chronicle of the Beatles.","review":"This book is like a huge scrapbook of the Beatles. It has pictures, and quotes (from interviews) from Paul,George, and Ringo, and... which makes this really out-of-sight, someone went and looked up quotes of John Lennon, and included them, in context to the subject, as if he were there, being interviewed with the other three Beatles.Another great thing about this book is that it is in complete chronological order and is accompanied by more pictures than you'd think ever existed of the Beatles.There is also an index to subjects and songs/albums mentioned in the book. Also included with John,Paul,George,and Ringo's input are quotes from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Neal Aspinall, George Martin, Derek Taylor, Mal Evans, Stuart Stutcliffe, and Brian Epstine. (those quotes are used sparingly, but effectively)This is a perfect chronicle of the fab-four because it is written by the Beatles themselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why expect anything less","review":"I would have happily paid twice the asking price.

When I do, I read something new each time due to its colossal size!If you want a collection of great photos of the Fab Four, then this is for you! Makes a great coffee table book...On another note... If you read and play music, get the Beatles Complete Scores! One of the coolest things you can get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And I love them!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I read it from cover to cover although you really don't have to. Pick it up and open it up randomly and I guarantee you won't put it down. What I especially loved about the book was how John Lennon was represented. His viewpoints and recollections about the topics at hand are presented alongside the others' seamlessly. The book is truely a work of art. This book and the whole 'Beatles Anthology' project prove that the Beatles were, without a doubt, a class act."},{"rating":"2","title":"....and whence the Stones","review":"OK. Now that the Beatles are out of the way, when can we get a similar, excellent chronicle of the Stones? \\"The Rolling Stones: A Life on the Road\\" was great, but not nearly enough new stuff, and virtually nothing for Stones fans already in the know. We Stones fans need something like \\"Anthology\\". Leave it to the Beatles to get their first, though. As usual....."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAB AND GEAR BEYOND ALL AND ANYTHING BEATLES","review":"I was recently hospitalized for almost 3 weeks and dreading the impending boredom, I brought the Anthology with me. I admit I've had it since the day it was released and only scanned the photo's. Well needless to say, I read that book every day and was completely blown away. My life has been the Beatles for the past 35 years and this was the freshest Beatle experience I have ever had. The fabs have been reborn unto me and I can only say you will have the best Beatles experience in your life. (Unless of course you've seen them live)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any Beatles fan","review":"As the group of the century, the Beatles are too much for simple words.

It's absolutely fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book was always checked out of the local library by my son.

The plot itself is no great shakes -- it's not bad, as such, but you'll know where it's going long before it gets there.Still, I'd rather read 100 books that are as well-written as this one than read a twisty turny novel with all the depth of a puddle of water.

This video paints a good picture of how mathematically improbable biological evolution really is. A little like putting a bullet into a million different boom boxes and expecting one of them will be an improved boom box. Some evolutionists confuse changes brought about by natural selection and genetic diversity, and then call that evolution, when it only proves adaptation. It is certainly a valid scientific endeavor, to explore the possibility that biological systems came about as a result of intelligent design, rather than random chance. The real question is why do some people view the idea of an intelligent design so undesirable?

It took courage & humility to revise their conclusions in light of new findings. Survival of the fittest doesn't explain the arrival of the fittest.

As Darwin's theory is the predominant 'religion' of the academic/scientific communities, lots of this is a response to that. The commentators consist of molecular biologists and various others.They make the case with several pieces of evidence, any one of which can raise major doubts about Darwin's work. Some of the powerful arguments made include: Irreducible Complexity, biological machines and their rather obvious design features, the incredible complexity of DNA and the problems that creates for those arguing against design, and several others.I strongly recommend this. I also recommend that anyone interested in this subject read several books on the subject.

There are too many mistakes and due to these mistakes, Spanish language students will suffer the consequences by not having the correct information. The layout of the book is also confusing. Vocabulary lists are provided at the end of each chapter. This means that anyone who is working on a particular exercise must constantly page back and forth. There are also a lot of grammatical elements that appear in exercises which students have yet to cover, thereby leaving the student confused and misguided. The glossary is also poorly designed. Anyone using a foreign language textbook should be able to look in the glossary for vocabulary that had been covered in the book. Instead, one must refer back to the chapter in which the vocabulary appeared. Such a task has proven to be fruitless and exasperating. Why make the process of learning and studying a foreign language more difficult than it already is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great combination of grammar and vocabulary!","review":"Trato hecho is a revolutionary book that combines vocabulary and grammar in a wonderful, meaningful way.

A great way to introduce grammar instead of just explaining a point and do meaningless and mechanical exercises on it.This is a perfect book for long classes (one hour and a half or so, per episode).

Not her professional achievements? Not the birth of her children? And she can't feel good about herself when she merely DOES good? This is especially warped, considering that Estrich was never any bigger than a size 12 or 14 to begin with.Eating right and exercising regularly are both very good things that are well worth pursuing, but one's body size is a very shaky platform on which to base one's self esteem.My advice would be to eat healthy foods, engage regularly in some exercise you enjoy, and read \\"Self Esteem Comes in All Sizes\\" by Carol Johnson instead of this book.

Speaking and writing was a little hard to me, so I needed to practice a little more, but a got 95. A score of 95 studying only this book is good. Don't you think?

A Travel Kennel Big Enough for a Dane!","review":"I looked and looked and looked for a travel kennel that would be tall enough for our Great Dane. They're hard to come by! Hauling his wire kennel with us just isn't feasible - it's huge. This was plenty tall and easy to set up (once we realized the poles are in a pouch in the bottom). I like that he can see what's going on outside the kennel (unlike some that just have a small mesh window). The first time we used it, we took our dog to a friend's cabin. It did the job. He did try to dig his way out of the front and there's a little wear and tear. I could see where that would be a problem if your dog really wanted out - but no travel kennel is going to withstand a dog with separation anxiety or severe boredom.I'm really glad we got it - this is a life-saver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Jerome Dickey - Naughty or Nice","review":"All of Dickey's books are fun to read.

We are taken into the hearts of these young women as they struggle to make sense of their lives, their shattered loves and the loss of their loved ones.The sisters draw strength from past memories of their beloved mother and father and even though they might not want to admit it, they learn how much they need each other, and how deep the bond of sisterhood goes.At times this book is quite spicy and intense as we invade the lives of these sisters, and the author shows that in a family each can be different, with different needs and desires, however, the end result for them was a deeper commitment to one another and understanding to what is important.Sex, love, hate, and life all tangled up in this steamy read, unraveled for the reader as they learn the bond of sisterhood.Shirley Johnson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Whenever I go to the bookstore, the first thing I do is check to see if EJD has any new books. I would buy the book without having read the synopsis at the back. But i must say, this book didn't quite do it for me. The best thing about this book was the pretty cover.

I like Dickey so this one didn't disappoint at all, but it didn't have that WOW factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Christmas Tale","review":"I am still undecided as to if I am a ejd fan or not. This book was interesting though it was slow making it difficult to continue reading. i feel that ejd's books may be geared more to an older audience (i.e. over 30) than myself. I enjoyed the drama and the suspense that was evident in the story, though I would have liked to see more suspense, etc. I t was an okay read. I will be reading more ejd books...i just don't think i have found the best one yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Is the Ending?","review":"I own each and every book EJD has ever wrote, because I honestly believe he is a genious in his field. I can not put any of his books down, and this book was no exception. While this book (Naughty or Nice) is a great and fluid read, the ending left MUCH to be desired. While I have never seen EJD produce a sequal to his books, this book needs a part two....simply because too many things are left up in the air. Too much is unresolved, and it made the book unrealistic. Like I said earlier, the book is good, the endings are bad. The characters are highly developed, and then....nothing, just an abrupt ending that leaves questions that should not have to be asked. With the great development of the characters, I wanted a sense of completion, resolution, but there wasn't...just the end. Maybe there is a sequal in the works, but with an author of EJD caliber, I find that hope highly unlikely. Overall, good book, just not complete...in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I just finished this book, and I must say...I am truly disappointed.

I thought it was really dramatic, and that it was a good story, but maybe not for the BSC series. This incidence, (being stranded on an island) would be hugely impactful in someone's life, but none of the children or baby-sitters involved seem to be affected in a big way.

Ultimately the author tried to do too much and so her many themes trickle through like so much sand. But what themes they are - the role of women in the early Christian church, biblical archaeology, the search for the Holy Grail, how technology is changing global communication, and how ultimately, religions teach the same thing.

The endless digressions into tales of Old Testament priestesses grew weary after a while and served to dilute the questionable suspense of the archaeologist and priest on the run. Not very compelling. The pursuit was midly interesting, but fairly derivative considering other such works. What I expected to be a fascinating story about Millennial fever ended up to be an unbelievable tale. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does faith mean to you?","review":"A suspenseful novel, impossible to put down. But this is more than a story about an archeologist and her amazing discovery. What makes this book so unique is the profound message of the scrolls.

Barbara Wood did a good job building personal discovery within a setting of material discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Profound Read","review":"The Prophetess tackles a deep and fascinating subject. Although it is somewhat outdated now that we have already crossed the Y2K barrier, it still is a wonderful read.

With the millennial Zeitgeist at full throttle, the scrolls hold a pertinent message about the world on the threshold of the 21st century.

I think it's hard to do, especially if you're relying on the quirkiness of your character to bring in the laughs, and especially if you write over 220 pages.Quirky and cute, yes but after a while tiresome, this character is. I lost interest in her at about page 120, with 200 more to go. So then I've got to rely on the plot, which is not that compelling or believable.

Gotta say - I like K Gore's literature much better than A Gore's politics. Thankfully, other than for some transparent jabs at the current administration, the book is bipartisan for the most part.

Her neurotic behavior and good intentions give other 20-somethings trying to be real grown ups hope. While Sammy's incidents are more public than most of this age, it does give you some perspective when you find yourself in an embarassing situation. A great book for young people making that transition from \\"trying to get by\\" to \\"trying to succeed.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful First Novel","review":"I read so many good reviews of Kristin Gore's first novel and I was not dissapointed. Not since Bridget Jones' Diary have I found such hilariously quirky characters. I found myself laughing out loud at several parts and was reluctant to put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a light read and a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I started this book on Friday night, and I must say I put off a few things on Saturday so I could finish it. Sammy is a hilarious character. She has noble intentions and is dedicated to her work as a health care adviser to an Ohio senator. Unfortunately for her (but luckily for the reader), she is not quite as together in her personal life. This book is not perfect, and some of it is a little formulaic, but it's very entertaining. I enjoyed living the D.C. singles scene vicariously through Sammy. Plus, it's interesting to think about what experiences Kristin Gore might have had that translated into some of her writing. I think I read that this may be made into a movie, and I can understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a break from all the chick fluff!","review":"FINALLY, a book with a female character in it that isn't shopping! This book is a WELCOME reprieve from the chic-lit, obsessed with shoes and men genre. I'd been looking for a story about a woman- ANY woman, with ambition, heart, maybe even (gasp!) a career! This book has all three.The author does a fabulous job of making you fall in love with the main character, a quirky hypochondriac named Sammy. Sammy is an ambitious public health advisor to a junior Senator on Capitol Hill. The author creates such an enthusiastic main character that I found myself collecting ambition to accomplish my own personal goals once I had finished the book.I could barely put this book down and I'm VERY glad I bought the hardcover. It's a keeper. I tried to read it slowly so that it would last longer, but nothing doing. I have my fingers crossed that Ms. Gore writes a sequel- and SOON! Fabulous, fabulous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The print equivalent of political fan-fiction","review":"The Portland Mecury called Sammy's Hill \\"workshop quality writing,\\" but I'd disagree. It's actually closer in quality to that of really, really bad fan fiction. The story has absolutely no character development, nothing that makes me like the characters, and no compelling plot. All that really happens are a bunch of cringe-inducing \\"aw, shucks!\\" moments that make the main character seem like a complete moron, not someone who's worked their way to being domestic policy adviser for a Congressman.How did this book even get published? Talk about nepotism, sheesh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i laughed out loud way too much.","review":"let's make this clear first: i'm conservative. i thought it was wise of gore to keep out party names and labels, but it didn't take a genius to see which parties the heroes belonged to. that didn't make the book any less enjoyable. some of her vitriolic attacks on \\"president pile\\" (bush, anyone?) were disconcerting but funny (i do have a sense of humor). i agree with some other reviewers that sammy had perhaps too many quirks for one person, but at the same time, she reminded me ridiculously of myself in that sense. so don't jump to conclusions and write her off as unrealistic. the book flowed well, kept me laughing and interested, and was honestly one of the most fun books i've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"This is a great book, and it depicts life on the Hill incredibly accurately. It is humorous, yet also informative as it illustrates what life on the Hill for a staffer of a Senator demands. It gives us valuable insight to the world of politics while being hilarious from start to finish.I was an intern for a Senator and the terms like Blackberry, Hart Building, and Union Station bring back many good memories. D.C. is brought back to life for me, and for anyone who has not yet visited or lived in this fabulous city then by reading this book they can become acquainted with the United States' capital."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breezy Charm on Capitol Hill","review":"Kristin Gore has penned a likable novel in Sammy's Hill. Samantha Joyce, the heroine, is an attractive 20-something who serves as a policy aide to an Ohio senator.Sammy's quirks are legion-- she worries incessantly about contracting exotic ailments, has trouble caring for her Japanese fighting fish, and nurtures friendships with telemarketers. And yes, she becomes embroiled in numerous romantic confusions of the type that one might expect of a young, smart, but slightly naive Senate staffer.This novel works because of its goodheartedness and the sympathetic portrayal of its heroine. As one might expect, Gore (the daughter of former Senator and Vice President Al) also does a nice job with the Capitol Hill setting and the depiction of a presidential campaign.Recommended as a light page turner that will serve readers well on planes, beaches or after a difficult day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"chick lit\\" book I've read","review":"Despite the title of this review, I almost hesitate to classify this book as \\"chick lit\\" as I think that somewhat denegrates it. This is one of the funniest, intelligently written and heartfelt books I've read in a long time. I laughed out loud at least once in every chapter. I received \\"Sammy's Hill\\" as a \\"secret santa\\" present from a colleague who knew me to be an avid reader. It was one of the best gifts of the holiday season. I just wish Kristin Gore would publish another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard...","review":"I kept convincing myself that this book was going to get better. Instead it was just one cliche' after another and it seemed like Kristen Gore was throwing everything she knew in this book hoping some of it would be believable- or funny. The result however is a flat story that should have been written as a screenplay instead of a novel. At least I know now know that I won't be seeing the movie. I've already seen Bridget Jones' diary and Legally Blonde and this novel is obviously trying too hard to be just like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I couldn't relate to the character, really. This book is for those who are into politics and frequent the bar scene.A 'Brigit Jones' of DC is not the same as Brigit Jones of London. It's better to stick with the real thing. This book is more like a substitute. It will only go as far as being compared to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Funny As I thought It Would Be","review":"I'm a Republican, so I have no use for the politics of the Gores. However, being a big fan of the television show Futurama (which the author wrote for), and political fiction, I thought I'd give this a try. I gave it as much of a chance as I could. I hobbled through the first 150 pages or so before putting it down. Maybe I had trouble reading it because I have trouble relating to a main character who is a woman. Maybe it's because she's a writer on Saturday Night Live, and I find SNL to be compltetly lacking in himor these past few years. Whatever the reason, I can't bring myself to pick this book up again. I probably will one day, when I've read all of the other books that seem to be piling up next to my desk. I have a feeling that it won't be any time soon, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly slapped together","review":"This book contains the sloppiest prose I've ever read. I'm glad Kristin Gore has worked on SNL and sitcoms, but she needs to learn how to write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's almost as funny as her old man!","review":"What Sammy's Hill lacks in comedy (and it lacks considerably) it makes up for with its profound moral message--no, nothing about healthcare or politics. The moral here is: don't have one drink too many and offer a book contract to the child of a famous person.It's sad to think of all the good--or, Ok, even MEDIOCRE--novels out there that will never see the light of day while this swill was published. Nepotism shouldn't have to be this painful... give Gore a plum job and a corner office, fine. But please don't inflict any more of her literary efforts on the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I like the Gore family, even voted for Al in 2000, so I really wanted to like this book. It was weird, though, and the humor was forced and it just never took off. I wanted a Bridget Jones goes to Washington and instead I got a bizarre, rambling, mess.Skip it and read a Jane Green book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure","review":"Simply put, a very fun read. Kept me engrossed till the last page. I just found out Sammy's House, Kristin Gore's second novel, is now available. I'll be picking it up this week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bridget-Jones-wanna-be","review":"Although the book at first kept me interested, after awhile I realized I read this story line before. It is closely modeled after the much better-written book Bridget Jones: the quirky, funny, awkward-yet successful girl falls for a gorgeous man who seems perfect in every way but has an underlying mystery and untrusting way about him. She ignores all the signals of his bad-ness and as the story unfolds she realizes what a total creep he really is..... meanwhile, the guy who is \\"perfect\\" for her is right under her nose all along and she mistakenly thinks he has done her and others a terrible injustice when in fact it was the \\"creep\\" all along who was behind these acts. Forget this book, read Bridget Jones - it is much funnier and original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book about a spoiled brat","review":"I kept waiting for Sammy to mature and do something interesting or worthwhile in this book. I wonder what the point of writing the book was. The main character was a shallow spoiled brat who did not mature in any way by the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, forced, and unsatisfying","review":"Sammy's Hill lacked a compelling plot (or any real plot for that matter) and the insecure, over-analytical personality of the main character made this book highly unsatisfying to read. Despite my attempt to approach Kristin Gore's book with an objective point of view, perhaps it was my political ideology that had a subconscious effect on my negative opinion of her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and fun!","review":"I thought this book was funny! We read it for my book club (which is predominately made up of conservative women). Some thought that this book was definitely taking a \\"shot\\" at conservatives, however, if you don't take it too seriously it is just a humorous, fun book, irregardless of your political views."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I was pleasently surprised by \\"Sammy's Hill\\". It is funny and sweet and an all around excellent read. I was sorry to see it end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer reading","review":"This book is a refreshing combination of \\"Sex and the City\\" and an afternoon spent watching C-SPAN. While I admit I was bored in the beginning by the somewhat clunky writing, the characters quickly grew on me. Although some of the discussions of health care policy or Sam's idealistic exclamations (\\"I'm so happy to make a positive difference in the world!!) are forced, the book is overall charming, fast-paced and enjoyable. Definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I started to write a review after reading the excerpt in Glamour magazine, but decided to hold off on judgment until I read the full book. I was not disappointed. This book is hilarious, funny, and friendly. I could easily relate to it through myself or my friends, the lead character suffers from about every neurosis I had ever heard of it and describes everything perfectly. I would recommend it to about anyone...although it is almost like a chick flick in words...it was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what you know, it's WHO you know....","review":"I (tried to) read the lengthy excerpt in Sept. Glamour Magazine--that was more than enough! The first few silly paragraphs were so poorly written, it was painful to continue. Three words will explain why the book was ever published: \\"Al Gore's daughter.\\" Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing","review":"Sammy's Hill caught my attention in the first pages when the slap stick Senator's aid was practicing to use her left arm in case her right arm was eaten off by a tiger escaping from the zoo. After that it was all downhill. The writing was trite and took pages to get to the point. The characters were shallow and the inditement of many of our political leaders was thinly veiled. Reading this book was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a different kind of chic lit. Very funny too!","review":"I bought this book by chance while waiting at the airport and since the first pages i absolutely loved it. I do like chic lit (big sophie kinsella fan), and i really enjoyed this different type of chic lit: a quirky girl with the awesome job she's devoted to (i enjoyed having a peek at the world inside the white house from the author's point of view).I'm very partial to her kind of humor too. Absolutely loved it.I have to say i was surprised when i found out it was al gore's daughter! (yes, yes very prejudiced of me to think a famous person's offspring can't write).i bought sammy's house as soon as it came out and loved it too. i'm waiting a third book is in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMMUNICATION","review":"I LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO READ IT AND UNDERSTAND IT I USUALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND THINGS THAT I READ BECAUSE OF MY LEARNING DISABILITY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Text","review":"The author's style is more conversational than most statistics books I've read. He makes complex concepts relatively easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A test of will","review":"This books is a test of the will, as well as one's desire to become anything like a linguist. If you picked up this book to gain an understanding of assyrian in a sense of fluency, well, there are reasons this book only costs eleven dollars. I have never seen another easily accessible guide to assyrian, and was forced to buy this book for want of a competing volume. It is arranged poorly and one gets the impression it is the product of some editor stealing an assyriologist's notebook. It reads like an archaeologist's private joke, and could turn many people off to the language as a whole. Another word of caution: the triliteral roots used in the back only make sense if one has a solid grounding in ancient hebrew. My own skill at the language is spotty, at best; I eagerly await a better volume for instruction in what I cannot deny is an overlooked and fascinating language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I was searching for a reference that could help me learn the fundamentals of the Assyrian language.I also found the format to be a little confusing. It appears as one long index. If you want to view the old Assyrian or Aramaic characters and language, this book may be a start. However this is not a grammer, phrase or vocabulary style book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book in my library...","review":"This is by far the worst book in my library. It should actually be entitled \\"How to put off Anyone from Learning Assyrian\\". I bought it because I found it - untouched - in a used book store. It was untouched for a reason. Unless you are already fluent in Semitic languages, particularly in Ancient Hebrew, it is entirely worthless. The dictionary is ordered according to Hebrew letters, thus making it virtually unusable. The cuneiform and transliterated texts don't match. The grammar is written for hard-boiled grammarians. Then again, it does look good on a coffee table and will baffle your guests. Unfortunately, it will also baffle you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Anime Classic for all the wrong reasons","review":"The Premise is typical of anime. Kids are elected to fight aliens. BUT one of these girls is a cry baby, not just a cry baby but she's so weak she makes Bella from Twilight look strong. In short Alien Nine is Frustrating I found myself screaming at the TV for Yuri (the main character) To just DO something all she did was cry and let her protector helmet do all the work.The Election process for the Anime's \\"Alien Club\\" is never fully explained but why kids would choose somebody so timid and weak to protect them does not speak well for said process and the end is a mess, just some whale like alien and more crying.The Art, Premise and theme song are all good but I have never seen an anime where I hated a character so much because of their own weaknesses. Shinji from Evangelion was braver than Yuri YEAH!.If you are curious check the show out, if you are easily frustrated or have a background in Psychology look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Band that really gets it.","review":"From the first note to the final word, this is one band that really understands how to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is very bad","review":"I had this machine for two years. The first year was great. Now, it gave me all kind of the troubles. The worst one is the paper jam. it will jam even you only put one page in the paper tray.It also has problems with paper setting. It will give you error messages even when you have the correct setting.Horrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK-IN-A-BOX","review":"The one star is for the pretty box. The new machine inside was dead-on-arrival. Called Canon for help. They spent twenty minutes trying to help and gave up. Invited me to accept a refurbished model in exchange. So much for public relations. Returned unit to store for full refund. Will not deal with Canon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot Use With Windows 7 (64bit)","review":"I have used the MF3110 for several years and have enjoyed the laser printing qualities.However, I just bought a new computer with Win 7 (64 bit) and per conversation Canon thisprinter will not run with this OS, nor do they plan to update the drivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're happy with this printer","review":"I would say it jams only a little more frequently than I'd expect, which is mildly annoying, but overall this is a great printer for the price, especially with the ability to create pdf documents included. The image/print quality is good. We use this as our main office printer and scanner and probably print 50-100 sheets a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasonable performance but durability lacking","review":"The performance of the MF3110 is okay (especially for the price) but I found that the durability was lacking--my died after 5 months and it would cost more to ship it and get it fixed than to buy a completely new one. Also, the output is not the sharpest compared to other b/w lasers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good so far","review":"This printer has all the functions I was looking for. I did have to call support to customize the paper due to the fact that I need to print a special size that is not configured in to the printer and they were very helpful and resolved the problem quickly. I am dissappointed a little with the scanning properties. It is very slow and there seems to be a lot of steps to save files.Overall, a great printer for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than inspiring","review":"I bought this CD because I thought it would be a good refresher on the French I learned in high school. I also thought that since I have been known to sing along with the radio or even to myself that I would be singing along to the songs on this CD. Unfortunately, I found the music less than inspiring, and I also doubt that one would learn much if you did not already know some French - the CD jacket has the words of the songs but nothing else. This CD definitely lacks joie de vivre. Good idea but poor execution. I feel I wasted $18.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"My students adore it!","review":"As a French teacher, I've been using this CD set for the past four years. The CDs are designed for middle school-aged students, but I can use several songs for my 4th and 5th graders. The tunes are catchy and the students love them! I dress up like a rapper (not a pretty sight for a middle-aged white woman) and sing along to \\"Me Voici\\" in the beginning of the year. \\"Moi, je fais ma valise rose\\" is a fun way to teach possessive adjectives. The creators of the CD offer a bulk discount, which I offer to the students each year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of Information","review":"Incredibly researched history of American professional football.

The drawings are small and difficult to decipher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for Volume Two","review":"I won't write a book here, but this so far is my favorite of the Bellydance/Workout variety. I have about 7 or 8 of these type of videos. I liked the way everything was explained up front, then the dancing was continuous. I liked the moves themselves and the music was refreshingly good quality. Nice introduction to stomach isolation moves and turns, also. I would say this is intermediate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Que horrible!","review":"I can't believe *I* spent money on this! One of the worst belly-dance videos I've seen, and I've seen quite a few. Rania is stiff. No flow there. Her background dancers always seem to be better than she is. And who filmed this one for her? Her husband? The camera moves back and forth and in and out at such a rate near the end that I became seasick. Plus, how is anyone going to learn the steps if the camera is constantly focussed on her enhanced breasts? I was very diappointed in this video and found it unusable and a total waste of money. If you want better instruction and better quality better to go with Dolphina, the twins, or Suzanna del Vecchio's tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I paid for this!!","review":"Unfortunately I bought a package deal containing nearly all of her videos. She is stiff and I found myself watching her background dancers who portray by far better dancing abilities the she does. I was surprised as she has won awards yet the dancing I see is not the style of dance that I classify as belly dance, let alone what I know she is capable of. If she were to package it as aerobics and leave out the \\"belly dancing\\" it would be more accurate. Yes it will get you sweating and give you a nice little workout but there is little fluidity in her 'dance'. It is misleading to think you will actually learn anything from her....although the background dancers...hmmmm...watch them and you may find yourself at least learning a little. I'll stick to Delilah, Atea, and others whom know how to really dance as well as teach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased another video by Rania not on Amazon yet","review":"You might want to second-think carrying this video or any others by this woman...she is beautiful and sexy, but her dancing is laughable...which I would have done, exceptI actually paid money for this video. This is one of the worst instructional videos I have EVER seen! Two of the background dancers are MUCH better than the \\"instructor\\".The Veena & Neena videos are high quality with only a couple of questionable techniques...the \\"Goddess\\" instructor is a yoga person who took a few bellydance lessons...she sucks at bellydance. The Rania videos are a rip-off to the dance community. Even if I knew nothing at all about bellydance (I've been bellydancing for 25 years),I still would have been horrified by the stiff jerkiness of this woman's dancing. She has no business passing herself off as an instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb 50's Jazz","review":"This is a great album. Baker's voice and horn are each superb. \\"I've Got That Old Feeling\\", \\"There Will Never Be Another You\\", and \\"Let's Get Lost\\" are each worth the price of the album.If you like sweet, smooth jazz, this is a great example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly geatest hits","review":"Had to get this in cd since my original cy was on cassette tape.

For example, the narration was talking about fighting but the screen was showing some royal figures walking or riding!PRO- The picture is a vintage film.

Their music is so good that it is easily accessible to anyone with ears, but they are a band that is loved and admired first and fore-most by serious audiophiles and actual musicians. If you were to base an album review on the quality of the song writing, singing, musicianship, or even production values, packaging, or price...I can't think of any explanation as to why anyone would write a negative review of this album. This is an excellent addition to Chicago's discography. It easily ranks above 13 or Hot Streets, and is definitely their best since 17"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Classic","review":"Chicago is back!!! This album has something on it for everyone, longtime fans and New. A Modern and Refreshing return with great Harmonies and that great Chicago horn section. Don't miss the great ballads such as \\"King Of Might Have Been\\" and \\"Caroline\\" and of course the classic Chicago sound on songs like \\"90 degrees and freezing\\" and \\"Come to me do.\\" And don't forget the new single \\"Feel\\" which is destined to climb the charts. This album has hit potential written all over it. Don't Pass This One Up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I LOVE CHICAGO\\"","review":"I really like the new CD Chicago XXX because the quality of the music is great and I expecially like the singing. When Jason Scheff sings those love songs his voice thrills me. His voice is very smooth, soothing and sensual. I find this extremely hot.The only problem is, I wish he would do his own original songs. On his next solo album, he could not only do what Chicago does but also eminate like Usher and Mario. Like do something for the younger people with Hip Hop and R&B; flavor, by mixing the two syles together.Do any of you have information about the possibility of Chicago performing in Northern CA, like around San Francisco. Please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME - BORING - PLEASE PUT THIS BAND OUT OF ITS MISERY","review":"I can't stand this any longer. 37 years I've been following and loving this band.

I was disappointed. It is much sound here, but very little substance and good melodies. The best songs on the album, in my openion, is the single Feel and the second song on the album; King of Might have Been, feautering Joseph Williamson on background vocals.

I even liked Chicago 17. There was still enough rock and upbeat jazz (We Can Stop The Hurtin; Stay the Night; Along Comes A Woman). Oddly enough, sap songwriter Cetera leaves the group but the sappy stuff not only survives, but it dominates.No more jazz. No more R & B. Just pop music for the masses.Since it's been 15 years since the last \\"new\\" release, I guess I'll be dead (or close to it) before the next one. As far as I'm concernced, their best work is way behind them.So long Chicago."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great album!!!","review":"This long awaited Chicago release is absolutely great!! The vocal harmonies and horn arrangements are some of the coolest and hippest I've ever heard. And the production work is second to none. DO NOT listen to the negative reviews that some are writing about this album. They can't see the forest for the trees. Put this CD on and listen. Some complain that this doesn't sound like \\"the old Chicago\\". Folks, it's not 1969 anymore. Great musicians and music evolve. They're not stuck in a time warp. If you want 1969 Chicago, listen to a greatest hits record!! Pop music has been the pits for years. There is nothing out there this hip or cool. Name a band or artist that has been around as long as these guys that can still sound so new and exciting!! I am a long time fan of this band and this is a killer record."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK - But not classic Chicago","review":"I agree with a previous review - start at song 7 till the end and you are as close to CTA as you can get.

Imagaine how disappointed I was when I popped it into the CD player. It sounded like AMERICAN IDOL FINALISTS WITH HORNS AUGMENTED IN AS A AFTER THOUGHT!!!!! They are not very progresive or imaginative anymore. I'll stick to the real Chicago of the sixties and seventies. This band as they are now have no right to call themselves CHICAGO!!! You would think that with Walt, Jimmy, and Lee still in the band they would release somthing with substance. Personally, I would be ashamed to be associated with what is being put out now by this not quite Chicago band. They are not what they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"...these guys moan and complain about being pigeonholed as corporate/ballad band and then they release something like this. And why do they need 5 other keyboardists and guitarists when you have Robert Lamm, Bill Champlin, and Keith Howland in the band? When you listen to a pre- CHICAGO 16 album you know pretty much who's playing what. I've heard that they are coming out with a new album in 2011. Let's hope they get back to the basics and be great BAND Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of their better efforts.....","review":".......I confess I'm more a fan of their earlier, more progressive material, but I did enjoy Chicago 16 quite alot. I tired quickly of the cookie-cutter pop they churned out afterwards. \\"XXX\\" is, unfortunately, much of the same, only not quite as good. It's not terrible, it's just miquetoast Chicago-lite. Can't wait to get my mitts on \\"Stone of Sisyphus\\" coming out via Rhino Records!! Now, THAT'S the Chicago I know and love!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"XXX - Ignore the Dissenters","review":"This album really brings Chicago up to speed with it's dedicated fans. After snippets of new stuff in the 90s this culminates years of work with well written, thoughtful and catchy tunes. Don't listen to dissenters who couldn't write a lick of music. Ballads are core to Chicago's work. Jason Scheff did not produce this album. Guest artists have become the mode of hyping an album by artist(s) who have been around for decades.The music is tight and well composed. The lyrics range from strange to cheesy to edgy while always remaining fun and exciting. Anybody complaining about wriing should look to a wide range of people who contributed to the album.To sum up... I am only 23 and Chicago has a decade and a half on me age wise but when I hear an album of quality from this guys I know it. Don't listen to people expecting some kind of epic piece of work after such a long studio hiatus. This is good, strong music."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD!!","review":"THE BEST BABYS ALBUM - I WORE MY OLD ALBUM OUT YEARS AGO.

The way Mr Jacq portrays Ramses was very unrealistic, he was a god in his own right but the man was still human! It seemed throughout the 'books' that Pharaoh was \\"perfect\\" and \\"could do no wrong\\" but the characters around him were flawed. I think this five part \\"saga\\" would have been more believable if its main attraction had showed some frailties along the way. For example. the relationship Ramses has with his wife, Nefertari appears to be untouchable. What married couple has a \\"problem-free\\" relationship?

I got the 1st season of Dead Zone with the booklet that goes with it, but to my disapointment, it had 2nd season discs in the box set. When I went to check the lineup for the 1st episode online for the 1st season, it should have the title \\"Wheel of Fortune\\", that's the one when Johnny wakes up from his coma, and not \\"Valley of the Shadow\\" (from 2nd season / 1st episode). And the 1st season should have 4 discs in the box set not 6. I don't know how a box set titled for first season got mixed up with second season discs in this set.

I also noticed in the \\"Tal thanks\\" section of the CD liner that he thanks Jeff Lynne even though Mr. Lynne's name doesn't seem to appear anywhere else on the liner...but as you listen to album you can here a little bit of that magic... almost as if Jeff is just whispering in Tal's ear to add a suggestion of strings here or a lilting sigh there.... it makes for a wonderful album and I'm sure it will remain within easy reach for many months."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the songs from the first time I heard them.","review":"To me, 'She's So High' is the best song in the whole Cd, with Darker Side of Blue not far behind.

I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it is a good, solid album. Unfortunately Tal seems to have fallen into the same trap that Duncan Sheik and Shawn Mullins fell into. One decent turn of the century hit for an earnest singer/songwriter which got overplayed at radio and overshadowed any possibility of a follow-up hit.I am not sure I agree with some of the reviewers who seem to think Tal is heavily influenced by ELO. There is some similarity on songs like \\"Romanticide\\" and \\"You're my Everything\\", but those songs are also reminiscent of Badfinger, and quite logically The Beatles and George Harrison's solo efforts which inspired both ELO and Badfinger.

The literature that we perform is challenging enough that because I'm not a native euphonist, I still need to practice our music on my own time. This Denis Wick practice mute does a great job of suppressing the sound coming from my instrument so that I don't disturb the neighbors. From my experience, pitch does go a little high when playing with the mute, and while resistance is not a problem in the mid and upper ranges of the instrument, the stuffiness in the lower register naturally makes it more difficult to center pitch.If there are facilities that are available to you in which you can practice freely, then by all means use those. This mute is for those of us who reside in apartment buildings and shared living arrangements and do not have a viable alternative.

As a teacher who has also been a foster parent, I have been witness to some very disturbing situations, and I am still not sure what is in the best interest of the child, long term. Murphy's use of humor certainly helps deliver this message, and I would recommend this book to anyone who works with children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwanted aren't always on welfare","review":"Unfortunately, this author fails to include unwanted children that even come from wealthy families. Unwanted children of wealthy families often end up in similar circumstances. Even though the focus of this book is primarily for families in poverty, the author fails to realize even further, that often times, children from wealthy families end up with NO HELP and NO RESOURCES for their plights, in contrast to programs specifically designed for those in poverty. He fails to recognize the value of programs as a universal ideal, as does the Federal Government.It is too bad that the author places the stigma of being an unwanted child based upon class. It is a sad enough dilemma in itself, especially when children are victimized and used as scapegoats, no matter what their class background may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great snacks but overpriced here...","review":"You can get a 12 count box of these exact snacks at Costco for $5.65, so they are way overpriced here.These things are delicious though."},{"rating":"2","title":"great healthy snack, crispy and salty","review":"Some days you want a sweet snack, and some days something salty and crispy. This is a healthy substitute for chips and fried salty snacks. It does have a slightly fishy taste which I like but some may not. My only complaint is that the first case was awesome but the second one was very oily in each package.

He loves them just as much!), so that's only 15 cal.! The only problem is that, they are so light and airy, we (between my husband and myself) ate 3 pkgs in one sitting! We'd have eaten more, but... that's all the store had at the time! :-(We're planning on buying a whole box (24 pkgs) of them, but that will probably last MAYBE a week, at the most.

Not at ALL what descriptions says! and not returnable!","review":"Yuk! First of all, NOT crunchy, as someone mentioned. Little green slips of seaweed smashed into wafer think pieces of what looks like litmus paper. I suppose they could melt on your tongue if you could stand the taste. I did not expect seaweed to taste good but I did expect it to be crunchy, as described. There is literally nothing that can be done with these floppy pieces of yuk. Why put them in snack type bags if they are meant to be used in Miso Soup? Before you buy, I suggest trying a sample. I'm stuck with a case of 24. If anyone wants a free bag, email me your address.

I failed to notice they were dated in 2009 and it may be the recipe has changed since then.Irregardless, these chips are not salty, sweet and nutty tasting. They taste like the bottom of a fish tank smells.

Made in Korea, they taste comparable to the Japanese ones. But the quality control seems non-existent. We order a box, and have gone through half of it now. Just half of the box, one packet was already moist upon opening, meaning the seal had been compromised. Another packet was just empty. I mean EMPTY. No seaweed. Not even a grain of salt. Just a clear plastic holder was inside the wrapping. This is seriously screwed up.If you live in a large metropolitan area, you can easily find some seaweed snack with better quality control and better prices at any East Asian grocery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to these but Amazon charges too much","review":"These are just pure seaweed and salt, with no MSG or sugar. The body craves whatever nutrients are in this, because my entire family including little kids with fussy palates LOVES these. We fight over each little green sheet. I so hoped we could have ordered these in quantity from Amazon and would have done so if the price had even been the SAME as the healthy grocery store's. But alas, they cost $0.75 at the store, so we will still have to go and buy whatever they have on their shelves. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canola oil missing from ingredients","review":"I ordered these based on the ingredient list as posted. Turns out they have canola oil which I try not to eat.

Now I am stuck with these as I doubt they can be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes great, but not what I'd call low-salt","review":"I really like the taste of this Roasted Seaweed Snack. But I would not call it low-salt. You can taste the seaweed, but the predominate taste is salt.Each pack has a little plastic bin holding the paper thin slices of seaweed plus a silica moisture-absorbing packet. Each pack weighs only 0.17 oz - so the silica packet and plastic bin are most of the weight.In other words, there is not much to this snack. It's packaged very well, so that the thin slices are intact and dry. I like the taste, and the seaweed does have vitamins, especially vitamin C. But there is little volume to the snack in one packet and yet one packet has 50 mg of sodium.Granted, it's low salt in terms of mg. But it's not low salt in terms of percentage of volume. This isn't a snack to stave off hunger - there just isn't enough of it. But it is a snack that is tasty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids snacks!","review":"My son LOVES to eat this seaweed as a snack esp. with rice to roll up.

Funny thing is, earlier in the day, I'd sampled some Milk Bone Dog Biscuits (at the behest of a very cute little grandson).The Milk Bone Dog Biscuits definitely needed some salt and a little more flavor, but compared to these Seaweed Snacks, the Dog Biscuits were \\"de bon gout\\" (that's French for delicious).As an experiment, I threw one of these snacks on the floor for my Sheltie, and she looked at me with sad eyes as if to say, \\"Really? Why are we torturing the puppy?\\"In all seriousness, I like to try new things and organic food is good food, but this particular \\"gift from the sea\\" should be thrown overboard.Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!!!","review":"I threw out the whole box!! - Amazon would not give me a refund - Couldn't stand having it around - went into the garbage within seconds of opening the box!!Truly dissappointed in Amazon for not letting me return this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously crave-able","review":"These had to grow on me, but after a couple of packages of them, I have to say they are now my go-to treat when I want something crunchy and salty. They are lightly salty, and also have a hint of sesame flavor which really puts them over the top.

It was cheap and delicious. They're by no means filling but a great little treat for the price. I didn't find any of the cloying fishy taste that I'd expect from a seaborn snack. They are a lot like paper thin chips. Directions encourage using them as a topping. Have not tried that yet and probably won't. The flavor, I think, would get lost on other food. I eat them straight from the container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt like the taste and yes, Canola oil is in these","review":"I wouldnt call these a snack at all, its nori sheets with salt. Didn't like the taste it does contain canola."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious addictive snack","review":"I'll agree with the other person who commented on the packaging being too much... it is and that is the only reason I didn't rate it a 5. These tasty snacks are delicious and healthy. Usually I can take or leave seaweed but it's never something that I craved until now. These are addictive little snacks that go great with beer or as a pre-lunch snack at work. I hope to see larger packages with less packaging down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Delicious - Not salt shy though!","review":"I love Roasted Seaweed and I usually buy from Trader Joe's but I wanted one without fake stuff in it and this Sea's Gift Korean Seaweed is only salt and oil, simply like that.The packaging is brilliant and the seaweed is great for snacking, cracked on top of rice and fried tofu w/ pickled ginger and a side of soy sauce... I added to my miso soup.. I have it on its own..They are addictive for sure so just try to hide the box and keep a couple out for your week haha!Highly recommended.Only thing I wish it was a tiny bit less salty, but I eat every low on salt so it's maybe my palate :)Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as delicious as other brands","review":"I was looking for seaweed as delicious as the kind they use to sell at my local grocery store. I thought I had found an amazing deal on amazon with Sea's Gift Korean seaweed. I was wrong. This is drier than other brands and less salty. The more delicious ones are 20 more calories per pack but worth it. These are still healthy and a better alternative to chips but i have to keep looking for the exact brand I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great nori snack","review":"I love snacking on sushi nori sheets but sometimes they seem to be lacking just a little. These are great! The added sea salt takes it to another level. I wish they would have a little better packaging (a lot of waste), however for throwing into a purse or lunch box it does help protect the sheets.I will be ordering this again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Very Good Deal Afterall...","review":"Decent quality roasted seaweed snack compare to what you can get from Asian Markets and Trader Joe's. I didn't realize that they're 0.2oz size bags when I ordered. Even with the 15% subscription discount, which bring it down to $0.67 per bag, it's still cost 50%+ more then Trader Joe's (they sell a 0.4oz bag for $0.99). With that said, it actually cost $4.19 more to buy at quantity. My conclusion: if there's no outlet anywhere near you to get them, go ahead and give it a try. It's a healthier snack option. I will not order this again but rather buy a 2-3bags at a time from Trader Joe's in the area instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"YUM.","review":"Crunchy and salty. Obviously, you should enjoy the flavor of seaweed, or there's no point.

Great flavor, good nutrition and will definitely be buying this product regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS PRETTY GROSS","review":"Not good at all. I am comparing these to the Trader Joes seaweed snacks. These are texturally similar, TJs are a bit crunchier. The flavor on these is pretty gross though. They do not taste fresh and crisp, they have this weird gross dirty seawater flavor. I would avoid these and try another brand. I wish amazon will allow a return, but it is food so highly unlikely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have had many types of roasted seaweed--this one is pretty disgusting! STAY AWAY!","review":"I have been eating rosted nori all my life. I have to say this is a big disappointment. The seaweed tasted stale and disgusting. And this is not because I am not used to seaweed. Quite the contrary. I am even more disappointed when I tried to return this to Amazon, this item is actually not eligible for returns even though I just received this item. I don't understand. Basically I paid full price for stale food!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected!","review":"To be fair I had never tried seaweed in this form before. I had a much different idea of what seaweed in this form would taste like... It was awful! And, what's worse I can't return it and am stuck with 23 unopened packages of the stuff.

I don't know what kind of \\"chips\\" these people used to eat, but this seaweed is no substitute for chips of any kind. I bought into the idea that eating seaweed is healthy so I decided to order. It's not bad to put in stews or sprinkle over salads, but I cannot just eat them like they are chips. That's just a crazy concept. You get several packets of seaweed crisps-but it's more like thin crinkly paper that falls apart when you touch it. It tastes like you would imagine seaweed would taste like. Am I any healthier for eating this? I am not sure. Would I buy this product again- probably not. But I can't fault the product for my purchase of it. I got plenty of it and it will last me for months.

COME ON...Ms. Pettersson writes like a 5th grader. I mean...blind date?!?! Disinherited ?!?! GIVE ME A BREAK.... I mean, if the heroine is so bad-as* why hasn't she ever told her jerk of a \\"father\\" to go jump in a lake?! So she can keep living on his dime and not get a job? That way she can continue wandering the streets of Las Vegas every night. Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it , I really did","review":"Honestly, I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so and thought it had great promise. The the major plot flaws started popping up. Top secret information available in the form of a comic book? Hiding the main character's identity through major (whole body) plastic surgery? And why couldn't the bad guys figure out her identity? Seemed like it could have been figured out with some basic logic. The Zodiac? A bunch of fools. I'm rooting for the bad guys this time - or I would be if I planned to keep reading.By the way, this has the distinction of being the only book that I've ever given up on with only 30 pages to go. I just couldn't make myself care enough to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Worst Complete Waste Of Time, But Close","review":"Ah, the paranormal combat genre. Such wonderful names can be included here: Laurell K. Hamilton, Jim Butcher, Simon Green...Vicki Pettersson will not be added to that list. The writing is more suited to a Harlequin romance, the plot has more holes in it than Swiss cheese used for target practice, the characters are barely as two-dimensional as the page they're printed on, and the overarching concept completely fails to live up to any reasonable expectations much less the high hopes of the author.If you're looking for nothing more than a quick airport read, this will be a better choice than James Patterson. For any other reason this side of the recycle bin, I recommend staying away."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Very good....and it was free.

It has a strong heroine, just enough romance to not make you want to puke and once you pick it up, you will not want to put it down! Would highly recommend to anyone! Made me want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and Remarkable","review":"Vicki Pettersson's debut novel is cousin to the Kim Harrison, Carrie Vaughn, and Kelley Armstrong series of books. A more educated and original thinking cousin. Petterson's heroine occupies a world where good does battle with evil, but there aren't any vampires; there are supervillians and superheroes. The storyline is highly original, and the twists and revelations that are revealed throughout the book will have you turning the pages as though you yourself had super speed. Taut pacing and excellent dialogue abound.If you enjoy your heroines tough, and your settings supernatural, you won't like this book.You'll LOVE it. A remarkable read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Keeping in mind that I have read all the books in the series, they are definitely not too bad. However, I personally find the characters a little bit on the whiney side. But that could just be me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked by the end of the first chapter","review":"Oh my! This book had me so hooked by the end of the first chapter that I couldn't put it down. Before I had reached page 50 I had cried, laughed, and fallen in love. At one point in the first 1/4 of the book I thought I had figured out a key part of the story and got really angry about thinking that the author was going to kill off Ben. Fortunately V Pettersson did not fall into the easy author trap and kept me happy. This book had me on the edge of my seat at all times. I found the book to be full of adventure and intrigue, a little romance, and realistic dialogue. I'm very glad that I purchased the first 4 books of the series all at one time so I don't have to wait to receive book 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"Pettersson is a new writer and it shows. While she has moments of seamless and clever narrative, these moments are sparing. The heroine has all the earmarks of science fiction, from a practically divine birth, to extra special super powers, to model-esq beauty, to rugged toughness. She is just a terrible genre clich��, who struggles to be, but ultimately fails to overcome her meager 2 dimensions.Instead of showing the reader Jo's attributes, she tells us. Over and over again. If a character has protective or philanthropic characteristics, there are better ways of letting us know then having yet other characters just blurt these titles out.I think that Pettersson shows serious promise, but she needs more time to develop her craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I so wanted to like this series! I love this genre and the cover looked amazing! I started reading and could not get through the whole thing. It seemed to have every ingredient in the books I devour but this one unfortunately did not stand up to some of the other greats. The characters seemed a bit flat and the writing on the mediocre side. If you are looking for a great read I would stick to Kim Harrison, Kelley Armstrong, Kelly Gay, Stacia Kane, Kalayna Price and Diana Rowland to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scent of Shadows mini-review","review":"While the story has its flaws (and is down-right non-sensical at some points), the voice with which the writer tells this story is truly phenomenal. Any and all problems one might have with the plot and how it flows are easily overwhelmed by fully realized and relatable character who is constantly able to pull the reader back into the story. This is a truly talented writer who merely needs some practice constructing and executing plot-lines. Overall an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad.","review":"I was led to try this book through Kim Harrison's recommendation. That's the last time I'll do that. A risible mishmash of comic-book superheroes, heiresses, and evil fathers, it features a heroine who's a) traffic-stoppingly beautiful b) the Savior The Whole World Has Been Waiting For, with superpowers likely to be Greater Than Ever Seen Before and c) a survivor of abuse and violence. All together now: \\"Oh, the poor little chick!\\" Oh yeah, and her (devastatingly handsome) childhood sweetheart stays in love with her even after he thinks she's dead.The Zodiac concept would have been entertaining, and Ms Pettersson's writing is extremely good on the prose level. But her unsympathetic heroine and eye-rollingly far-fetched setup place this book beyond redemption.Memo to the author: Having characters repeatedly make the sarcastic comment \\"That's so Star Wars\\" will not distract readers' attention from the fact that your plot is, in fact, a rip-off of Star Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Keeper Shelf Material!","review":"This is one of the best first novels by an author that I've ever read. The writing is extraordinarily good, and coupled with the originality of the plot, it's simply a winner for all readers of the paranormal fantasy genre. Remember the first books by Laurell K. Hamilton? This makes them look like jr. high school writing. While Hamilton has improved her writing skills, Petterson has no need to do so. She has stepped forth with remarkable skills from the get go. What a treasure to find a new author like this!I cannot wait to read other books in the series and hope that Ms. Pettersson has 12 books and other series in mind. I'll be in line for all of them. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book started out with some interesting ideas and character development but fizzled quickly. In the first few chapters we are introduced to Joanna who is coming of age in a supernatural way. Then, she hides out in a sanctuary for nearly the entire remainder of the book! Basically talking incomprehensible mytho-babble and contemplating her navel. I couldn't even finish the book - I was so bored by the time she finally planned to face the bad guys that I didn't even care how \`the big battle' turned out and I just closed the book without reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Comic Books","review":"I coudn't suspend my disbelief. The heroine is sent to a kids store to learn about herself. Here kids write the comic books about the events as they occur. Are the kids pyschic? How else could they do that? Alternate worlds. Superpowers and immortality --but you age? They somehow can't figure out who the heroine's real identity is but it is obvious she is one of 2 sisters and one of them is dead???? This book sucks. Women readers and Comic book fiction do NOT mix. Unless you're 13. Sad because the writer can write --she just needs a good storyline to go with. One that appeals to grown women. We need more women who kick butt stories --just keep it within the realm of beleivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing, Awful Story","review":"If you include the truly awful title, The Scent of Shadows, is a pretty lame story about a girl with mysterious powers who comes into her own, after nearly being killed by the bad guys who can smell her psychically or some such hogwash. This was excessively violent and I completely lost interest when the heroine stops by a comic shop to do 'research'. I've done tons of research in my life, and none of it was gleaned from comic books. My recommendation is, don't bother with this. There are plenty of good books, or even just better books out there and you don't need to use of precious seconds of your life with this drek. I only give it two stars because the writing was good. Plot and storyline were ludicrous, even for fantasy--or whatever you call this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful story telling","review":"The first part of the book was exciting and had me thinking that this could be an interesting superhuman book.Then the clumsy writing, a bit of deus ex machina, and a deplorable hero got in the way.After the first 20% I just wanted it to end, which it did, but unfortunately left the story open to sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Magic Girl","review":"I decided to take a chance on an unauthor. Wow! This is an awesome book! I can hardly wait for the 2nd!Joanna reminds me a lot of Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake, in the first books. She was sure of herself and tough as nails. Joanna is the same way.Then Joanna's sister dies and she discovers her real purpose in life. There are enough twists and turns in this one to keep you entralled until the end. And then make you beg for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm, free and better than anticipated","review":"If you have a Kindle, this book is free right now. I scan through the best seller Kindle list about once a month and grab a few books to try.....well, not a few, a LOT of books really. This book I did like very much, and am right now pulling up the rest of the series to give it a look-see.....might try #2 today.The writing style was a tad jumpy which is fine with me.....being bored by mundane details is a nightmare. Overall....Amusing, with likable characters, and at times a bit touching, believe it or not. Good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible, but extremely annoying.","review":"This is one of those books where it should be wonderful, but it isn't. None of the characters made sense-not the heroine, not her sister, not her ex-boyfriend(but almost), not the villians, not her Obi-wan advisor character, NONE OF THEM!It was confusingly and poorly written, what with the extremely abrupt twists and turns and moments of \\"Hey, waitwaitwait-EXPLAIN THAT.\\"Even though it isn't worth reading, it's very hard to stop and say, \\"I quit. This isn't worth my time.\\" And you have to have enough respect to tell yourself that.I got midway through the third book in the series before I realized that it was not, as I was expecting, going to get better. (I might have been slightly upset)Save yourself the time and money. If you want to read it, just check your library. You won't miss much if they don't have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this different from the other same season item?","review":"I'm seeing that this is 255 minutes at $23 and the other is 275 minutes at $28. What's the deal? what's the difference here? Is there reall a missing 20 minutes on the $23 version? Why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure i was going to finish the movie...","review":"The acting was quite bad and the script unimaginative. I was looking forward to watching this movie because it had some good actors. Unfortunately it sucked. The concept was a good idea but the execution was awful. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst movies ever!","review":"I'd give this movie no stars if possible. What a waste of time watching the first hour. I'm a big fan of Drew Barrymore, but nothing can save this movie. Not even Christina Applegate. This story has been done before, and a hell of a lot better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1-Star Reviews are 100% on. I lost brain cells watching this film!","review":"Acting is pretty bad. Plot is pretty poor and so, so overdone it's like watching a re-run of countless other 1990-2010 romance movies. Language between main characters is dreadfully lousy. Cliches are so, so over-used, I was annoyed every time one was used. 110% predictable storyline which left nothing for the brain to do over almost 2 hours... hence the lost brain cells. Sorry, this movie was a waste of time after the first 10 minutes. Drew Barrymore didn't look so good, wasn't funny, and is clearly in the wrong film genre now. Sorry to say... she lost her cutesy charm and spunk. The drug usage was just plain dumb and the characters looked absolutely stupid smoking the bong. Not romantic at all. Besides a few minutes of scenes, barely funny at all. Save your time and money and rent something a little better with Drew Barrymore like \\"The Wedding Singer.\\" Okay, out for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long drawn out","review":"The previews looked like this would be a funny movie. Yes there were funny parts but the plot was not highly developed and it dragged on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above par BUT ...","review":"... it's still what you expect it to be, and the ending really is a bit unrealistic (even if you remove the film from the economic headlines we all read every day). Up until the end though, the film avoids most of the cliches that lesser rom-coms would walk right in to and is carried along on the journey by a strong supporting cast including Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis (comedy pros Jim Gaffigan and Rob Riggle also get a few good jabs in in small parts) but in the end the ending is the let-down here. However, up until the last five or ten minutes GOING THE DISTANCE seems like it really will, well, go the distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"video quality awful..could not finish it...","review":"the whole movie was in fluorescent andy warhol color that blanked out half of the scenery including the faces which were all a bright yellow blur....and when the texting part started could not read anything so I just stopped...as far as the movie, the small portion I watched, there is no chemistry between them....may finish it when it makes it to regular tv...probably won't be renting any more videos from Amazon....but I love amazon for shopping otherwise...great company."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!!!!!!!!!","review":"Quite simply this was a piece of trash. I had no idea Drew would be a part of something so degrading to the human race. I did not finish watching this. There was no message just the vile dumbing down and disrespect for anything significant in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"17 minutes of commercials and then nonstop cussing.","review":"First, there should be a boycott on product from Warner Brothers. When you insert the DVD (and every time thereafter) you must endure 17 minutes of trailers before the menu comes on. Warners has disabled any ability to go directly to the menu or skip through the trailers. 17 minutes worth!!! What brilliant executive decided that. Shame on you Warner Brothers. I'll think twice before ever buying another one of your products. Then already ticked off we started the movie and were greeted by 10 minutes of constant foul language. Alert to film makers, in the real world people don't talk like that all the time. It is not funny. It is not entertaining. After 37 minutes of bad/violent trailers and foul language we turned it off. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"LANGUAGE! CASTING?","review":"I was so turned off by the language I had to take the DVD out after the first couple of conversations. I KNOW it's rated R (now), but that is not the point. The cursing was excessive and seemed to be in place of any real dialogue. I was actually confused as it seemed like they were trying to make a statement...or something???And I love Drew but she seemed too old for her guy, and he seemed too old to play his part. Just a mess, thank God I picked this up at the library. I will definitely pay more attention to ratings from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"get a clue film makers. the f word is not funny or romantic","review":"boo!! super disappointed in drew. i wish hollywood would grow up and turn down crap scripts full of filth. i don't mind a well placed curse word, but good grief! my hubby and i did the right and smart thing and turned this movie off within the first 15 minutes, for that we give ourselves 5 stars ;o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies of the year.","review":"Sorry, but this is one of the worst movies of the year. Bad script. Mediocre story. Bad acting. Mediocre camera work. Cruddy as a chick flick, too (via wife). Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This movie has toooooo much cussing. They also had sex on the brain!!!!!!!What is this world coming to!!! It was a VERY disappointing movie. I was very disappointed in Drew Barrymore. She has done much better in previous movies.I will be very hesitant to see her in any other film. It wasn't very funny. NOT a romantic comedy...maybe a stupid one. What a waste of money... your loosing your imagination to have made such a movie as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"LDR","review":"Love this movie!! Very honest and actually accurate. I've been in a long distance relationship for 5 years now and it ain't easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche, but has it's moments","review":"There didn't appear to be a lot of chemistry between Justin & Drew, but the story has a couple of really funny parts. It won't go down in celluloid history as one of the great love stories, but if you can live with a handful of laughs, you should get this dvd. The dining room scene alone is worth purchasing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious!","review":"My husband & I both loved this movie. We found ourselves laughing hysterically periodically throughout. If you need a good laugh watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope. Sorry.","review":"Going the Distance was a huge disappointment. I usually love anything with Drew Barrymore in it, and I adore romantic comedies. It just didn't do it for me. It seemed slow moving and the dialogue was lame or just awful. Some scenes were so off-putting I just couldn't stand it.I watched it all the way through with other people, only to discover at the end that we were all just being polite, thinking that others were enjoying it. It's unaminous: this is not the finest hour for ordinarily fine actors.Not worth a second watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful movie","review":"I ordered this on VOD and stopped it once and then tried to give it a second try the next day. No go. What an awful, awful movie. No redeeming qualities. Just full of vulgar and sophomoric dialog/situations; nothing short of soft-core pornography in some instances. What really makes me angry? That the producers didn't even have the guts to \\"own\\" this film. Instead, it was marketed as a Drew Barrymore \\"romcom\\" and not the crass movie that it is. Ms. Barrymore seems to be entering that stage of her career where she feels the need to break out of a mold and be \\"edgy\\". Usually that leads to disaster for good comedic actresses (see Meg Ryan and Jennifer Aniston) and \\"Going the Distance\\" is no exception. And, sorry, no matter how hard Justin Long tries to reinvent himself as some sort of player, it just doesn't work to play that far against type. Silver lining, I paid $1.99 on VOD, rather than $12 at the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy","review":"This movie isnt meant to be an oscar winning disney film. Its hilarious and well written. The characters are crazy and unexpected, which is fantastic. Just take it for what it is, an opportunity to laugh alot and really hard and not take things so seriously. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"I wish this movie could have gotten way more attention than it got.It is such a great movie. Very well acted, written and directed.I laughed, I cried and laughed some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"it had some funny scenes but was too dirty and predictable!","review":"The movie was too dirty it had way to many jokes and scenes that were not necessary their is no problem with mentioning sex and being funny but when you take it too far their is a problem. This movie went too far their were jokes about sexual things and even a scene with the justin long naked which was also disgusting and unnecessary. I understand in hollywood their is no morals and no christian values but at-least make the movie better. The best thing about the movie was Charlie Day he was funny but everyone else was not that great especially jason sudeikis who is just not funny! the casting was an overall B- but the dialogue and story was an D-!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid romantic comedy","review":"A young couple hooks up, and then they begin a relationship that lasts the summer. The woman has to return to California for school, thus they commence a long distance affair. The usual problems arise, forcing them to determine where they are going and if the relationship will endure. This is a well-cast romantic comedy, with excellent chemistry between the leads. At times, the viewer feels as if they are sitting in on real conversations between a burgeoning couple, rather than a scripted film, as if the scenes were developed by the actors. Going the Distance is funny, moving, and feels genuine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute and funny movie","review":"I actually was pleasantly surprised by this movie--it was quite humorous (at least certain parts were) and had a nice storyline. I definitely enjoyed it. Would probably fall into the \\"chick flick\\" category; however, my boyfriend watched the second half with me and definitely had a couple of good laughs. Definitely recommend it and I will be purchasing it once the price goes down a bit in a few months. :)r"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A TRAGEDY","review":"A brilliantly written, well acted film that was ruined by immaturity....What could have been another 'When Harry Met Sally' was ruined by the adolestent over use of the 'F' word...Over 40 times, this trash was added to what was otherwise a great script...I wasn't 'shocked' I was BORED....It reminds of the the little boy who discovers the word 'Poo Poo' and says it over and over again....We've had the X Generation, the Y Generation, now we have the 'F' Generation...this word adds nothing to any script yet these 'professional children' feel a need to use it needlessly..Hugh Prather said,\\" When you use an obscenity, you stop 'saying' something and you 'become' something...You take attention off your 'thoughts' and put it on your 'words'..what a great missed opportunity"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel to top the first one...Outstanding job!","review":"Volume II in this series apparently has even better quality foodstuffs, and Zipern has indeed improved her knack for capturing the spirit of a Grateful Dead show, from the culinary and social angles to boot...great pictures too...your bound to see \\"that couple you bought those amazing brownies from back in '94!\\" Have fun with this one too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Worthy Sequel","review":"I'm sorry- I loved the first book (Cooking With the Dead)- reccommended it to straight friends, bought extra copies, still cook from it, but the new one is some serious barrel bottom scrapings.Truly, we sound like idiots in this book.

Specifically, I asked if these products could be from the millions of chickens they have had to kill due to avian flu. He said that not only could they very well be from those chickens, but that chickens from China used in pet foods contain an excess of lead. There are no regulations screening imports of chicken for pet food.

Actually, it's a variety of levels, which is totally fine by me. I enjoy more difficult puzzles when I have time to sit down and work through the whole thing (sometimes 2 or 3 times, if I mess it up), and I enjoy easier puzzles for coffee breaks and other times when I only have 10 or 15 minutes.These are hand-developed Sudoku, and they actually do feel a little bit different to work out than computer-generated ones. In any case, this is a great collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"nto worth the money","review":"This book only has 100 puzzles, and for the $8.95 price, it's just not worth it. The puzzles are all levels, not just the more difficult as the title implies. You can get twice the number of puzzles (100 difficult and 100 very challenging)for $6.95 from \\"Let's Play Sudoku - Over the Edge\\" by Will Shortz. If you want simpler puzzles, there are 2 easier books of 200 puzzles each in the Will Shortz series, both for $6.95 each as well. I've learned that when a book item description like Grand Master Su Doku doesn't list the number of pages or puzzles, that's a red flag that it's not a good value. If it was a good value, they would list it as a selling point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed with caution.","review":"Slow, laid-back orchestra interpretations of holiday tunes. Really slow. The well-known traditional pieces are fun, but it seems like half the album is obscure (to me, anyway) stuff included because it has either Chirstmas or holiday in the title. The liner notes paint a picture of relaxing in front of the fire after hosting a christmas party while enjoying the album. The music does live up to that, but the style begins to wear thin all too soon - I couldn't even finish listening to the album. In addition, the \\"remaster\\" either was too faithful to the original or maybe the original wasn't all that good to begin with, but the listening sounds pretty low-fi. I'd say the album is worth having for four or five of the pieces, but not at full price.

Just more of the same old same old.I recognize that there is a lot of violence by men toward women.
