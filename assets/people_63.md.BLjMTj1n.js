The battery life on a full charge is no better than 6 hours.The biggest nuisance is getting to your music. You can scroll one song at a time which takes too long (as it is it takes a few seconds to go from one song to the next). The easier way is to make subfolders. I made mine by artist.

Too often, deacons get wrapped up in the budget and the building--because those aren't as difficult as people.But deacons are called to serve people: widows and orphans. We must love the forgotten and thereby reveal Christ's compassion to them in the midst of their hurting.

Her voice doesn't appear to be as strong, or her range as vast as some of the other more well known female voices in the genre of Middle East/World Music, it is none-the-less an immensely enjoyable exotic sound incorporating all the traditional vocal nuances that one would hope for.While the upbeat, festive tracks like 'Inspiration' and 'I Won't Forget My Roots' are a nice change of pace, I think the poetic, melancholy love songs like 'Honeysuckle', 'There's Worse' and my personal favorite 'Why Is My Heart Sad' are Souads' real musical strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mara tania","review":"Once again Souad Massi ingeniously manifests her masterful and beauteous voice through equally transcendant lyrics and music.

The recorded sound is immediate, live and convincing. The orchestral playing is superb, and the vocalists in the aggregate are first rate, with momentary exception. The only recent, competetive Zauberflote of modern instrument variety is Solti's with Sumi Jo as the Queen of the Night. That performance also has a special place in my heart, but this newcomer sits on the shelf next to the Solti recording.

For some of us,too young to be in Saigon,or preoccupied with the latest dalliances of Lisa Hughes,(As The World Turns)Walter Cronkite was the eyes and ears of perhaps the most turbulent decade of the 20th Century. In I Can Hear It Now,we are given a review through Cronkite's narration as well as through the CBS News Archives, of the 1960's. How many people were tuned into AS THE WORLD TURNS November 22,1963 when the fateful bulletin from Dallas flashed into our living rooms? This CD brings you right there.Perhaps for some this is the defining moment of the sixties,but I Can Hear it Now brings you ALL of the voices and events of the time...King,the Beatles,Rachel Carson,Neil Armstrong.

It was $18.00 a packet and not worth it. They wanted me to buy a lot more, but I didn't and also the muscleease oil. Still not sure if I will buy that after I read the other reviews.

First off, the flames on the torches body do not really look that good. The flames on his head look like he has a big yellow-orange hairdo. Then there are the black lines that are painted all over his body. I realize in the comic these lines give his body some definition. However, it just makes the toy looks silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Toy Biz hit big with Spiderman Classics. They hit big with Marvel Legends. Here comes series two.Series two is not nearly as cool as series 1. Human torch, an awesome character, should be extremely cool in this series. It's not.HT barely stands on his own. Certainly wont stand up straight. It's nice to have detail, and all the points of articulation. However, does he REALLY need to have two places to bend in his torso? That gives way to his instability.I gave this toy a 5 star rating for education. It's sarcastic, because figuring out HOW to keep it standing, and display it, is a real education.I was highly disappointed in this figure. Inside the package, he looks cool. If you want to enjoy this figure, keep it inside the packaging.I give this figure a 2 1/2 star rating. 45 on a scale of 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disappointing","review":"The entire series is highly disappointing. However, the Human Torch, is most annoying, and disappointing. This particular figure is best left in the package, where it looks its best. Outside the package, frustration sets in, as the body is incapable of holding its posture, and the flames are a pain. I like the figure, but, only inside the package, where it receives stability. By far the worst of all the figures in the entire line. Because of the poor design, this item receives 1 star. 5 stars for education, because you definately get an education, if you try to display this outside it's packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL Recipie for Spiritual Awakening!","review":"I LOVE this book! It's clear, concise, beautifully written, easy to read, and entertaining. Jerry Bartholow gives the reader all of the ingredients necessary for living a life filled with peace, love, and joy. He makes spirituality both simple and fun. Like Ram Dass' immortal \\"Cookbook for a Sacred Life\\" published as part of BE HERE NOW in the early 1970's, this wonderful book lays it all out . . . but in contemporary language that is both easily understood and fully accessible to everyone. I'd gladly call it, \\"The BE HERE NOW for the New Millenium!\\" It's one of those rare treasures you want to carry with you and read over and over. I predict it will become a classic!

With dead blooms and brownish tone (lacking the rich green in the leaves) its future is very uncertain.

I recommend buying a smaller size along with the gallon so you can refill it and easily move it from room to room - much easier than lugging around that heavy gallon bottle. The lavender scent is evident, but not overpowering. It leaves behind a pleasant relaxing fragrance - all natural of course.

This book will actually damage you if you try to use it to learn how to be a counselor.Skip this book and read something that is actually informed by the developments from the last 50 years.

It's about a teenage boy who has to quit school and deal drugs so his classmates feel content having their fix. The problem? That's pretty much all that happens, other than several parties and a few sex scenes. Only one particular shooting scene caught my attention for the shock value. It's so much a teen flick that an adult wouldn't be able to sit through this plotless nonsense.

I agree with him that what we see out in space is a reflection of who or what we are. The Bible and other books of wisdom are really teaching the same thing, only that what has come down to us have been simplyfied and waterd down to where it becomes too confusing to the average seeker, the author is right that science will be the tool that will prove many of what we've wondered about God and the meaning of life. This book is also full of reference to other works by other people where at times I wondered if thats the format he originally wanted to convey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"It is clear from the range of reviews that I'm not the only one confused and disoriented by MR. Harper's rangy, disjointed lack of style. This is one of the most difficult to follow books I have ever held in my hands. It is not for beginners. If you have little or no background into new age thinking, stay away from this book.The five star reviews must have come from people with a vast background of knowledge on the subject to begin with, or who are mentally ill.References to other people's work abound.

For some time now, we have needed an informed survey of the *new* cutting edge, and John Jay Harper offers this in Tranceformers. Not only that, however - with the voice of an old friend he also draws us into his own transformative journey and invites us along on a search for meaning, sorting through a proliferation of books, theories, visions, and otherworldly experiences.

From the zero-point-field, the mind of God... to the innate Christos we all are to become... This book says it all. It is on ongoing initiation as you read it, for you will never be the same once these revelations dawn on you.Mr. Harper has obviously distilled decades of research and analysis within the pages this Magnum Opus!

Heard the same programs that we've all heard. This is book is 'derivative.' The only difference is that Mr. Harper has taken the time to consolidate it all into one source and add HIS own opinion about 2012.His opinion is not wrong nor is it right. Who the heck knowsBut, they are his opinions.I know nothing about his experiences but his credentials lend nothing to his authority. He offers nothing from deep and dedicated scholarship (the academic sort) but rather anecdotes and assumptions he has arrived at himself from the information freely floating about.Read his book if you want to hear another opinion but try doing something else. Find your own opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I had great hopes for this book, because I am studying Shamanism and trying to adapt it to modern life. This book isn't about Shamanism. It is about text-bites (53 attributed quotes in the Introduction alone) and a bunch of rambling new-age ideas that boil down to: 1- We're destroying the planet; 2- Our negative thinking is destroying us; 3- Prehistoric cultures were much smarter than we are now; and a miscellany of unproven new-age assertions, such as Florida is a Hurricane magnet because of the negative thinking and karma of all the military bases down there; Our DNA serves as a \\"communication interface porthole to every species in our universe, serving as a radio-TV-computer-like chip implant.\\";and Angelic beings from Orion are our overseers. If you are looking for a vast compilation of short quotes from other authors, this is your book. Otherwise, keep looking. There are many better, more focused books that cover the ideas with greater depth and clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it - he needs an editor","review":"I purchased this book because I enjoy JJ Harper's interviews on Coast2Coast and the internet. I wanted to learn more about shamanism, ETs and indigenous wisdom as he's very informed on the subjects during his interviews. He is also genuinely concerned about where our civilization and planet is headed if we don't change our consciousness and actions.That being said, I couldn't get through the preface. It's a poorly written book and lacks basic grammar and punctuation editing. I'm perplexed by the many intelligent and well-written reviews of this book and only a few mention the lack of editing and poor content organization. I'm also disappointed that a publisher would print this book as it's currently written.Like some of the other reviewers recommended, please try other authors such as Terence McKenna and James Gilliland. If you want just shamanism, stick with Harner, Wesselman and Cowan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good topic, poor writing style","review":"I am a longtime student and practitioner of the type of material covered in this book. While the author does highlight some good nuggets of information pulled from the research of other people, in general I found it to be way too disjointed. It seemed like every page had several references to other works and this constant referencing really distracted from the points the author was trying to make. Also, for me personally, there were far too many things presented as \\"truth\\" and not enough encouragement of the reader to think and investigate for themselves. If you do get this book, get it as a reference compilation on topics like: enlightenment, shamanism, ancient cultures (mayan, egyptian), and near death experiences. Its best use for me would have been to skim through and see if any of the topics were of interest and then go off and get the source works the author refers to. I do not recommend reading it cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"I put this book down for good about 3/4 of the way through. Most of the information is quotes, references to other authors' work, or NDE narrative. While this is interesting, it seems to me that the only contribution the author made was stating his theories here and there. He claims that these theories are true, but does not provide any explanation to help the reader understand his train of thought in order to arrive at their own conclusion. Theories are great fun, but I am turned off by someone who tells me what there theory is, claims that it's obviously true, but doesn't tell me why. I rarely leave a book unread, but just couldn't finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A passionate but poorly organized and over-written work.","review":"I wanted to like this book because I think the author, John Jay Harper, is a nice, smart, honest man. However, the book was grueling to read, and quite confusing. I think Mr. Harper might have benefited from a really good editor to help him present his ideas. I think he does have valid ideas and insights but they were so badly presented that it was nearly impossible to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch closely and it will become obvious.","review":"Given the talent of leads Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond, I settled in to watch this movie with high hopes. The ensemble was comprised of over the top characters, which draws even more attention to the smaller details and more grounded characters. There was a flaw in the third, maybe fourth, scene that made the ending predictable. That said, it was a story I kept watching simply because I had not seen characters like this before who were so unapologetic in their deeds and responses. Though it is not a movie I would recommend or purchase, it was no doubt memorable in its performances and its grim hopelessness. This is another movie in the fast-rising genre where extreme violence passes for horror. Unfortunately, Surveillance never rose above that nor took advantage of the unique qualities it did possess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Bad","review":"This is an inane excuse for a film. I am in disbelief that Julia Ormand and Bill Pullman consented to or wanted to be in this ridiculous movie.

For the rest of the world, do yourself a favor by not wasting a couple of hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitously violent","review":"I don't usually say that, either.

This is an example of the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing considering the actors","review":"Wow, this movie was pretty poorly put together. I like Julia and Bill, but this movie did neither of them justice. I found the movie to be pretty predictable and did not like it at all. It left me wishing I had the time back I had wasted on watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUper Boring!!!","review":"This movie had the worst acting i ever had the chance of watching, I didnt think Julia Ormond would ever do a bad movie, or even Bill Pullman...but they did! I guess someome was trying to do a Pulp Fiction type ripp off, but did not succeed....DONT watch this movie...I love a good action flick with a twist at the end, but the twist at the end of this picture was nothing to wrtie home about."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative stars","review":"With different direction, use of the alternate ending, and with the fine acting abilities of Pullman, Ormond, and Pell James, this could have been an excellent movie.Instead it was a horrible waste of time, slow to develop, silly, disgusting, confusing, annoying and frustrating. One of the worst films of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not any good","review":"I had hopes for this movie, because I am a Bill Pullman fan, but there was only one even halfway likeable character, and that was the little girl. It was partially told through flashbacks, which would work in some films, but just made this one seem endless. I could not work up any sympathy for anyone, except the kid.And the mystery wasn't that great, either. I had it figured out well before the halfway mark.Very glad I didn't pay any more to see it at the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bloody Awful Mess","review":"This is not disturbing it's laughably bad.

Y'ever watch a movie and see the twist at the end coming and wonder, \\"why?\\", all the while realizing that the author probably put the twist in to try and make a complete pig of a movie 'unique' enough to gain financial backing? This is that movie. The opening murder is grotesque and gruesome enough to qualify as \\"horror\\"-grade schlock. Pullman's had enough chances. I'm done with him.If you insist, rent this dog first; you'll probably agree it's not worth owning and thereby save yourself a few dollars. You can't have your time back, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this made by a high school kid?","review":"This movie is about the excessive lengths David Lynch went to so that he wouldn't have to tell his kid that she has no business being a film maker. I can't imagine what he must have paid Pullman and Ormond to go along with the gag, but since I haven't gotten any checks from David Lynch yet, I'm free to warn you not to see this ugly little pile of boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, horrible story, horrible dialogue, just horrible. A waste of time and money. Absolutely horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I'm up for a B movie. I like Bill Pullman and French Stewart, so I decided this was an ok way to spend an hour and a half. I followed the gore and hollow dialogue for an hour and 20 minutes until it became clear that there was going to be a Karla Faye Tucker moment. Even people who make movies should have some decency. Kent Harper had the arrogance to write, direct, and act in this piece of garbage. Even in the name of \\"creative expression\\" or \\"art,\\" this is a piece of junk. If you'd like another look at a piece of junk, take a peek at Harper's [...] bio. He wrote it himself. Makes himself sound like Aaron Spelling.Please don't watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Worser\\" than Worst","review":"Flag my attention with Julia Ormond.Take a mediocre plot, twist it like a piece of taffy (so that it just offbeat enough to appear barely \\"cool\\" enough to keep watching), and then load it down with gore as a reward.David Lynch indeed has come on hard times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of precious time","review":"No, we long time movie goers are not psychic, but after so many years you can see the plot turns coming. The plot errors were readily apparent and I knew \\"who dunnit\\" within the first twenty minutes. After that, all that was left were the details and some hope for a point to the story. Now to be fair, I've only seen one other Lynch film, Mulholland Drive. I came away from it with mixed feelings, but decided to give this film a go, as I like Ormond. As a result, I am no longer ambivalent about Lynch. I officially hate his work. This film was a waste of good talent, resources and film stock. It was gratuitously violent and prurient, only serving to encourage the current taste for the pornography of death. Sorry folks, nothing redeeming, enlightening or informative here. Just a peek at Lynch's generally low opinion of humanity and determination that all women are drug addled, stupid, evil or psychotic. Save two valuable hours of your life and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really work for me","review":"The film draws you in for the first half of it. But then it took a turn to \\"not bloody likely\\". Even with me thinking Julia Ormond is super hot, I couldn't get into the ending of this film. And, for a suspense drama where it builds up to the ending, the end of the story is really the whole point of the movie. The truth of the crime turns out to be way to complex to have pulled off except in the most usually luckiest of situations. And, since this is a planned crime, it just doesn't hold water. If you can turn your brain off the second half of the film, I suppose this movie would be entertaining, but I wasn't able to manage it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISBURBING AND INTERESTING AT TIMES, BUT UNEVEN! 2 1/2 STARS!","review":"I caught this film on HD Net and while the film starts off with a bang, it quickly looses steam as this crime drama goes into some long and tedious scenes where we learn very little. I like a good mystery as good as the next person, but I need some information and this film just doesn't give it up fast enough.The scenes where we are taken back to the events of the murders are interesting, but when we are subjected to huge doses of \\"surveillance\\" camera interrogations, this film really meanders. While I didn't figure out the twist right away, I did figure it out long before it was revealed.It's a shame because this film had some potential and I think with some better editing and writing this could have been an excellent film. As it is, it's an OK watch for fans of disturbing crime dramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't care for Gore then don't watch these movies..","review":"I just have to say... reading all the one stars..

I have thought it crafty with a demented twist.. like myself.. I tend to watch again just to see the fun parts... ^.^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid movie","review":"I thought this movie was delivered great. The way it was shot was really gritty and made me think of the end of Se7en and also the cover of latest Slipknot album (I know, really random).The acting was solid and as usual Pullman played a quirky dude (prob signed on because of David) really well. There were parts where the dialog was a bit awkward and the story stalled but lets be honest, the director is the daughter of David Lynch...you cannot say there have not been slow/awkward scenes in Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive, etc.I thought the twist was great and the ending was fantastic. Not a 5, but definitely something I will recommend to fans of movies like Se7en, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, etc. Beautifully dirty movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"deliciously demented","review":"I think a lot of the reviewers missed the point with this film.I believe the director(David Lynch's daughter)simply intended to make a fun,twisted flick with a surprise twist to the end.You may or may not see it coming,but,I don't think you'll get it exactly.I wasn't expecting much,was thoroughly engaged until the end.What more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lynch Doesn't Fall Far from the Tree","review":"A quirky procedural on the surface about a pair of FBI agents investigating murders in the American southwest, \\"Surveillance\\" turns expectations on its head with one unheard whisper from a child victim. You might quibble with the timing of when director Jennifer Lynch's truth is revealed--I didn't see it coming until shortly before the moment--but you can't argue with the performances, especially Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond. Not for the squeemish, and the contradictory recollections of the victims and perpetrators as the story unfolds is a nice touch. A much better effort than her last feature, \\"Boxing Helena,\\" \\"Surveillance\\" actually tries to lead you down a twisted path that you can follow. Kudos to her for also following her story to the unsettling end rather than looking for the easy way out for audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I should have known the film would be gory with Jen Lynch as director, but my love of Julia Ormond outweighed my reserve in buying this film. I will say if half the gore were eliminated, it would get more stars from me. The story has a really terrific twist, and I personally preferred the alternate ending. One can see that in the bonus material. This is not a movie I would watch again. The gore and horror of it will stick with me for a long time. I still love Julia Ormond, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Entertainment","review":"This movie was disturbing to watch because the content and plot were filled with twisted and deranged intent. It was unfortunate that we purchased it instead of renting it because we threw it in the garbage. The actors Julie O. and Bill P. are actors who have a great reputation and we anticipated enjoying their performance. The movie went from sick to perverted and left not one redeeming quality. This type of movie is not entertainment and we take full responsibility for watching such a disgusting movie. We will tell everyone we know to stay away from this movie and we will now spend the next few hours working hard to rid our minds of the horrible scenes we viewed. We did not want to give one star above for the rating but I couldn't figure out how to leave a negative number of stars. Please protect yourself from being part of promoting such awful movies and do not watch Surveillance."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty pointless....","review":"I really didn't see a point to this movie. I didn't find it entertaining although I am not a big fan of love stories. And from what I get this is just a love story with a brutal murder that took place. The \\"brutal twist\\" becomes predictable especially when the FBI agents discover nothing new in the brutal murder investigation. The dvd does have a few deleted scenes and an alternate ending which I preferred. The deleted scenes weren't anything that interesting...just a goopey kiss scene where the two characters are going at it like two carps trying to eat eachother and a couple trying to escape from unknown tormentors....oh and the brutality mentioned in this movie isn't especially brutal. Infact, it is rather tame. The only entertainment value this held for me was a few one liners Bill Pullman's character speaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"easy installation, good fit, nice looking. would highly recommend these and will purchase same brand and style for other vehicles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the ingredients or effort!","review":"I took this book out from the library because of the reviews given.

Because I am already familiar with Hungarian, I recognize the shortcomings of the lessons. The Language 30 tapes race through the lessons with no regard for this unusually difficult language. The words and phrases are spoken too quickly and the listener does not clearly hear the intonation and enunciation of the Hungarian words. The words and phrases are then quickly repeated so there is not enough time for the listener to attempt to repeat the words without talking over the speaker. A word or phrase should be pronounced slowly the first time, in order to capture each sound. Unfortunately, these tapes do not emphasize a critical element of this language. Americans who want to learn basic Hungarian words and phrases are at a definite disadvantage with the Language 30 tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak the Right Way ...","review":"As someone of Hungarian origin learning the language, I am painfully aware of how important it is to pronounce words correctly. The Language 30 tapes are an excellent way to learn words and phrases with the correct pronunciation so Hungarian people will be able to understand you! This is also the only Hungarian language cassette series that my mother, an educated Hungarian, has not scoffed at. Highly recommended and thank you Language 30, because I now excel in at least the basic Hungarian phrases!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple List of Phrases","review":"I did not find this book and pair of cassettes at all helpful in learning Hungarian. The book consists of a list of Hungarian phrases, and the cassettes are just a reading of the phrases in English and then Hungarian. The phrases are read too quickly to understand, and the next English phrase is read before you can even think about what you just heard in Hungarian.If you were learning Hungarian and wanted to hear how a phrase was pronounced, this system could help, if you could find the phrase on the cassette! But they are just read one after the other with no guide to which cassette has the phrase or where on the cassette the phrase is located.It would be easier to go to Hungary and ask a Hungarian how the phrase is pronounced."},{"rating":"1","title":"to fast...","review":"this program goes way to fast.

Calvin Johnson from Dub Narcotic sound system does a lot of lead vocal work on this while Spencer shouts in the background in agreement to Johnson's ramblings, giving encouragement in his Elvis in heat vocal style.Johnson's vocal style is more out there in fact that it doesn't work but it does, you know in the context of this album he is a good singer his deep voice goes with the vibe. You may remember his collaboration with Beck on One foot in the grave his voice was put to good use as it is on this album where we get a kinda Johnny Cash kinda thing going on in tracks like Love ain't on the run and Fudgy the whale.

The entire design makes this one much easier to use than those comprised of a single continuous piece of plastic. The rubber bottom is much easier to compress than many of the others which have much harder inflexible bulbs, and we have found that it works more effectively on our baby.Another advantage to the design is that the entire product can be thoroughly cleaned because it comes apart easily and is easily reassembled.

Borowitz's GOVERNOR ARNOLD will lift your spirits to new heights in these weighty, troubling times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, Unfunny","review":"Good political humorists write in such a way that readers will laugh, irrespective of their political affiliation. Michael Moore and PJ O'Rourke are examples of such writers. Unfortunately, Borowitz lacks the tact, wit, and sense of humor to write true political satire. His attempts at humor usually elicit groans unless you already agree with his shrill left-wing point of view, in which case you're only reading to reinforce your narrow point of view. Borowitz's humor is neither intelligent nor thought-provoking. If the book actually zeroed in on the Governor's shortcomings rather than reduce him to the simple-minded stereotypes that are common among the intellectually uninitiated Left, he might have actually had some fodder for political humor. The book is boring- a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Valve Stem","review":"Note to tube manufacturers: If you sell a tube specially designed not to leak, charge a few pennies more and use a metal valve stem. The tube may be fine, but I'll never know because the valve stem is cheap. After two rides, the stem developed a leak next to the wheel hole, even though it was almost straight. I've never seen a valve stem leak at the wheel that was as straight as this one, and I've seen a lot of tubes last years with much more angle on the valve stems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This tube is very high quality, but do not use as a back up while riding. The hand pump I used was not enough to fill the thick tube so I had to walk the bike home and use my compressor to fill it. I ride at night and drive over all kinds of glass and nasty things that are hard to see and it works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, these tires are thick.","review":"I wanted a tube that would not let me down with a flat, but didn't want goo that could settle after being stored. These tubes are much heavier than the standard tubes. To ensure the tube slips into position correctly I always coat the inside of the tire and outside of the tube with baby powder. No problems with installation and even joked about riding these tubes without tires as they are much beefier than standard tubes. That said, if you carry a spare, these are bulky for that purpose. I carry my old light weight tube for a spare, but you could probably run these home flat if need be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty bicycle tube","review":"I have not used every bike tube out there, but these feel like they are built \\"Ford Tough\\". To describe the difference, I will compare them to plastic gloves. Your regular bike tube is like the cheap lunch lady type of plastic gloves. These tubes feel like the gloves that your dentist might use. If you want a stronger tube, think about giving theses a try. They are considerably heavier than a standard tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thick tube","review":"This tube was much stronger and thicker than I expected, and that's great. I'm not a racer, so it doesn't matter that it's a few ounces heavier than my old, thinner ones. After a few weeks, so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunlite Thorn resistant Bicycle Tube","review":"This tube is very Heavy Duty yet it mounts easity with a little air it first. The stem is a little stort for my 700C deep rims but I pinked up some Stainless Steel valve stem extension from the local automotive parts place and that took care of that miner problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!","review":"I have purchased three of these in the last two months. I only get a few rides out of them before I get a leak right at the valve stem. My local bikeshop installed the first time and after the first leak I went back to purchase another tube and showed them the problem. They said that I must not have had the correct tire pressure in them while I was riding. Everytime since then I have confirmed the tire pressure before the ride. These tires clearly have a design problem at the valve stem. They aren't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty valve","review":"My tube lasted less than 3 months on my bike, not because of the tube itself but because after about 3 months, the valve, for no reason, simply started leaking air. Ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin spots in rubber","review":"Item arrived on time. Pumped up a tube to 30 psi; I noticed it didn't inflate evenly, so the tire blew within 15 seconds at the weak spot. I cut the tube open to look at the uniformity. Just a thin spot in the rubber about 3 inches long. Wish I'd had some ear plugs in.Fortunately, I bought 3. If the other tubes do well; I'll write another review, but for now these tubes were manufactured poorly. I wouldn't think it would be difficult to get rubber to a uniform thickness with heat.Jokes on me......they got paid anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Valve Stem","review":"In all the tubes I've bought and repaired while cycling through Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, and Nevada I've never had one that did what this tube did. I installed it and not a day later my tire was flat. Upon close inspection, the valve stem had busted open and was leaking air like a sieve. I attempted to patch it, but patching a rubber valve stem is trickier than I thought, so the tube remains useless. In summary, DO NOT BUY THIS TUBE IT HAS A CHEAP VALVE STEM! Unless you are good at patching valve stems, which never having had the necessity to do so, I was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even last as long as my non-thorn resistant tires","review":"I am sure I don't know as much about bike things as a lot of the other folks who have posted here. All I know is that I paid a bit extra for a \\"thorn resistant tube\\" and it didn't last as long before my next flat as my other \\"normal\\" tubes. Don't think I'll purchase again. Doesn't seem worth it. Statistically N = 1, but I don't have the money or patience to do any more sampling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Before I bought these, I was going through tubes like the dickens. Since I started using these, I haven't even had to think about them. Totally worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Pre-blown for your convenience!","review":"I bought four of these... two for each bicycle. Well, two of them went flat within days. One split on a seam (no corresponding hole in tire), and the other split at the stem (same as above). My tire sidewalls specify 50 - 75 psi, and we regularly run at 70 psi. We ride mainly on streets, sidewalks, and paved bike trails.They are awkward to change out, as they are so stiff. It would be well worth it, if they weren't falling apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 failed in same spot after less than a week","review":"tldr: Hole around valve on both after a few days each.I bought 2, as I like to always have one as a backup. Installed the first one on my rear wheel (with a new tire). Just 2 days later, it was flat. So I remove it and see that there is a large hole on the rubber that joins the valve to the inner tube, which, examining the construction, looks like a weak spot. I figured maybe it was a bad one, or maybe the wheel cut it there (which has never happened to the 3 or 4 tubes on before it), so I put a thin coating of rubber sealant on the metal valve hole on the wheel, then put on the second one, and inflated it (both to suggested pressure by the way). The next day, that one had a hole in the same place.So I go buy a cheaper one from a local store, and that has been working fine for weeks; no issues.Seems like a manufacturing defect, either with that batch, or the whole line.

I would love to direct Ms. Carpenter, just to utilize her bitter comedic talents, something the director and crew did not care to explore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for somthing more.","review":"Low budget British film with an all English cast except Charisma Carpenter.. This could have been so much more.. with a script written beyond an elementary school level. My biggest regret is that they did not come even close to bringing out that Charisma Carpenter is capable of being attractive by almost any standard.. In fact it is arguably her stock in trade signature. Not so in this film. This has got to be one of the worst examples of cinematography I have seen.I used to think that soft core porn was poorly written, the simulated sex scenes in this movie ( and the photography )are a step down from even that standard. They couldn't even get it right on the cover art.I would hope that the script writers, director and producers would have learned from this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charisma still gorgeous...but don't let that lead you to buy this movie.","review":"I am a huge fan of Charisma Carpenter, ever since I saw her on Buffy. I haven't seen her do much since Angel finished. I enjoy horror movies, even the bad ones. Some of the reviewers here list the movie as having gratuitous nudity. There are a couple of semi-quick scenes, but I was expecting much more based off of the reviews. The acting isn't great by any means. I wish I had rented this instead of buying this (i got the Instant Video version for my Kindle). I tend to buy movies instead of renting, due to having a toddler running around, I don't want to spend $4 for a 3 day rental and then not being able to finish it. The production values are about what you expect for a direct to video film. I won't post any spoilers here. As i said, I often enjoy bad horror films that others do not, but this wasn't worth the hour and a half, even if you are a fan of Charisma."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cult - Ceremony","review":"I think I own every CD The Cult ever made.

While I found it to be an apt description of the quality of this album I can see where the powers that be may have found this insulting to the waste of the aforementioned musician. This being said, I still find it hard to review this album without using scatalogical terms. Let me compare this album then to a coprolite (look it up). While a coprolite may look like rock, it is not and neither is this album.

I must have played it hundreds of times before I started to get tired of it. No other album by The Cult has ever affected me as much as this one.

I'm not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo, as it's difficult to find a good conditioner to match it's peppermint scent, however, it's really nice to use as a face and body wash. As a shampoo, it tends to dry out my hair a little too much, also. As a face and body wash, I haven't noticed any effects of drying out my skin, and while the scent is strong initially out of the shower, it softens nicely when dry.

When purchasing this soap, I was looking for soap with natural ingredients that would not dry out the skin and that would be consistent. Some other natural soap I've tried will be good for one body part but not for another body part, i.e., it would be good for the body but not for the face or for other sensitive areas. Dr. Bronner's soap, however, is consistent and it is natural. One disadvantage of this soap is that it does leave the skin feeling dry after showering because it has no moisturizing ingredients. Adding some jojoba oil or almond oil to the solution helps with the drying though. I would recommend this castile soap to individuals looking for a safe alternative to the traditional soap with harsh chemicals that are so plentiful at the grocery store."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE GOODNESS","review":"I love this soap. its great for hair and body. lasts a long time. great lather, and the smell really wakes u up and gets you alert which i love. l could really do without the strange religious ranting which seems like nonsense from a madman that covers every square inch of the entire bottle, but i just ignore it and cant deny its a great product, since i have started using it i have been so pleased i will not use anything but this and will remain loyal. cant beat something all natural!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for you skin gentle","review":"I have had a life long allergy to almost all soaps.

Al soaps have either Lye or lime (Not the fruit but the chemical) two of the worst things anyone could ever imagine putting on their skin.I can attest that this product is not made with any of these harsh ingredients. It cleans wonderfully and lathers up to an amazing degree. Just a note: \\"The two other soaps and shampoo I can use are \\"Lowilla\\" bar soap (about $5. a bar) and \\"Neutrogena\\" Bar soap (About $3 a bar) and \\"Neutrogena SHAMPOO\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helps","review":"I would have to say that all the research I completed before buying this product was worth it an it did a great job cleaning my skin . The smell is awsome, once out the shower I felt super clean and relaxed. How ever you will have to dilute the product down some it is pretty strong. You also may want to put on lotion for it tends to dry the skin a bit. Other than that this will be my soap for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I'm really happy with this soap. I love that it's concentrated and will last almost forever. Also great that it's all natural. Can't wait to try some of the crazy uses for it other than in the shower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells great","review":"I used this as body soap for its gentle cleaning and I like the almond fragrance. Too many soaps are designed to remove all the natural oils from your skin but we need those to keep the skin from becoming too dry. I would have liked to see this product be a bit more viscous so that it doesn't just run off of the loufa. Overall this product i recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing soap!","review":"Have been using this soap since the early 70's....still the best. It leaves your skin tingling and smelling great. Just don't get it in your eyes! Arrived promptly in fine shape. Very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just started using it today.","review":"It just came in the mail today and I've used it as a Shampoo and body wash. I love it! For hair you need a conditiner with it though because it's kind of drying. My skin is soft and happy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you not love bronners?","review":"Great product for a shower gel and baby shampoo. I feel very comfortable using this product because it only contains ingredients that I recognize as being natural. The almond soap would be better for a baby shampoo, but we used the peppermint when our daughter was young, with no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should last me a year","review":"Great product, but a little pricey. I might try making some myself as all it takes is lye and oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love dr bronners","review":"I like dr bronner products....but after a long while i noticed when i use it as a body soap that it starts leaving a ring of scum in the shower- probably due to the oil base. I tried it in homemade coconut shampoo and only used on my scalp-but found it to be very drying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tick control on dogs","review":"I have a weird dog. He can't tolerate the pharmaceutical tick control formulas-- just runs out of the house and rolls in the grass and whines. This, in a bath did the trick, though. He didn't mind the soap (I found that it even smelled pleasant) and he didn't run out after the bath to roll in the muck. I also found no ticks or fleas. Used it every three weeks or so and never had a bug or dog problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soap","review":"This is our main soap. Unscented is great for those of us with perfume allergies. I dilute this 1:1 or so with water for hand and body soap. Haven't used it as a laundry soap yet but plan to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soap Packaging","review":"The soap is great. The packaging was not as great. The container came with the lid screwed on crooked and the soap had leaked into the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best soap ever.","review":"I love this soap because it is all natural, clean-rinsing, non-drying, smells lovely, and you use very little water with it. It has many other uses as well, depending on the dilution ratio.I recommend Dr. Bronner's other products as well. The tattoo balm is the best I've ever used, and the lotions are wonderful, too!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the bugs away","review":"I have used Dr Bonners soap for 30 years.The Eucalyptus seems to keep the bugs at bay. I sit outside in the morning and in the evening. The bugs bother my wife (She doesn't use it)butNOT MEIn the winter I use peppermintI also use it on my dogs, Very good at repelling fleas and ticksThank you Dr Bonner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic soap","review":"I purchased this item for a better price but still thought I'd leave feedback. I have to admit that I love how 1-2 drops lathers sooo well. The minty scent is refreshing and it tingles which I love. As soon as you rinse it off the peppermint smell fades significantly but you are left smelling clean so that's nice. I pour about a tea spoon in 16ounces of water and make a hand soap for the bathroom. It's great to rinse Veggies with and cleaning surfaces. I am looking forward to using it as a bug repellent(spiders hate peppermint) I have not used it as a detergent yet but I will be trying that soon. The only thing I do not like is the message on the bottle. They take up soo much space with all that mess written there promoting their message instead of all the things the product is good for. I had to look online to find out what the various uses of this soap is for. I think everyone at least needs the small bottle of this product in their house or emergency supply kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is Dr. Bronner, It is great!","review":"I have used Dr. Bronner Peppermint soap since the late 1960's as part of my bath arsenal. Lately I have been reading ingredients of the other soaps & shampoos etc., and find several things I don't like in all of them, so I have switched to Dr. Bronner (with an occasional bar of Ivory for hand soap) for all my bath & shower needs. I am even using it as my sole shampoo and it does great. I am a guy with medium length hair- if I had long hair needing conditioner etc. it may not do the trick. I feel much better not covering myself with lauryl sulphates and parabens daily (both possible carcinogens in most regular bath products).Also, my lady says I smell great using the Dr. Bronner peppermint.I hope they they make this stuff forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This purchase has lasted a long time. It has a nice scent but I still cannot find a Dr. Bronner product that doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy and tangled. It works for everything else though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean","review":"I haven't used this specific one yet but I've enjoyed other Dr. Bronner's soaps and look forward to using this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this soap","review":"If you've never used this product before, you'll be amazed at the tingly, super clean feeling your skin gets after washing with it! Although I've tried buying other peppermint soaps, I've never found one that had quite the same effect. The peppermint scent is wonderful, and it's still present when the soap is diluted for hand soap dispensers. I decided to buy this big bottle because it's more economical than the smaller bottles at Trader Joe's, and the shipping is so cheap (at the time of this review, it's .99 cents). Shipping was pretty slow, but time was not a factor for me, so I didn't mind so much. I will say that the bizarre philosophical and religious ramblings that fill the bottle's large label gave me pause, as if I might have accidentally funded a cult somewhere, heh. But I think that's probably harmless hippie rambling. I do love that the soap is organic, fair trade, not animal tested, and comes in a recycled bottle, so there's a lot of good things to support there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Bronners' Soaps","review":"Good stuff! I use it for a lot of things! The fragrance is super. I also got the lavender & the green tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soap.","review":"It washes away quickly, leaving a feeling of cleanliness behind if used in the shower. I've used this particular product for everything from shampoo and body wash to washing clothes and dishes. Folks say you can brush your teeth with it, but I've never gone that far, lol. It really is a great product with low environmental impact. Great for those with a sulfate allergy, too, as it contains no sodium lauryl sulfate. Good stuff. I like the earthy, tea tree scent best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing stuff!","review":"This is just about the only soap that I use on a daily basis. I love the scent and it's nice and gentle on the skin. It can be a little drying on hair, but in general it does a great job. Try the peppermint for brushing your teeth or any of them for doing dishes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It takes a little getting used to (not as much lather) but once you do...i believe it will be a staple for a long time around here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Soap","review":"After reading about Dr Bonner's magic soaps I was a tad bit skeptic, it states this soap can be used for almost everything.. Well, well, well folks Dr Bonner's wasn't fibbing it absolutey can be used for any and everything. I use Dr Bonner's peppermint liquid soap daily as a body wash and with every wash I feel cleaner than the first time. I now have my entire family washing/cleaning with Dr Bonner's Peppermint soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle","review":"Overall, I love this soap. It does have a somewhat \\"medicinal\\" smell, but I might add some mint to soften it. If you are used to highly perfumed body wash, or if you aren't familiar with the smell of tea tree, you might prefer to try one of the other DB scents."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE","review":"Excellent, multi-purpose household soap. We use it in our foam dispensers at a ratio of 4 parts water to 1 part soap, feels clean, smells good and is natural. I buy 1 gallon jugs of this stuff regularly since we use it and love it so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL","review":"As a novice vegetable gardener I purchased this soap to mix with water and cooking oil to use as an organic pesticide. Naturally after reading the reviews I wanted to see if it was worth all the hype. OMG! I'll NEVER bathe with anything else besides Dr.Bronner's Peppermint 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint Soap! My skin has never been so CLEAN and FRESH!! The smell and the tingling sensation only intensifies the experience, it's AMAZING! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! You won't be disappointed. You'll need a loofah to get it to lather due to it's lack of chemical lather boosters. I'm back to order more, this time adding the lavender soap as well!! Can't wait to try it on all the other suggested uses I've read about in the reviews here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Doesn't hurt the skin and hair like some harsh soap products. It's good smelling soap that I will likely use forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liquid Gold !!!!!!!!!","review":"this soap is AMAZING!!!!!!! it does soooooooo many different things, but I prefer to use it as a body wash. Great on skin, really wakes you up on those sleepy mornings, great for releif when u have a cold, & will keep you 100% fresh ALL day long even in hot summer months the peppermint is a natural deodorant, i always have this on hand. iherb has it for $10.29 when you use the coupon below.$5.00 off your first purchase (No Minimum)OR$10.00 off your first purchase when you spend $40.00 or moreUSE CODE: JFD670"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin and watered down.","review":"I had just finished my bottle that I purchased at a retail store and opened this 32 ounce bottle to use today. I am beyond disappointed this this is a watered down version of Bronner's soaps! Unfortunately the window to request a return has elapsed, but I want to advise those who consider purchasing this soap from this vender to reconsider. I could have paid more locally and enjoyed the thick soap that I am used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"They haven't messed with a good thing","review":"If you want to avoid all the gimmicks of modern day marketing and simply want a good concentrated liquid soap look no further. The first bottle lasted about a year. A few drops goes a long way, so in the long run this is very economical. Don't let the price tag for buying in bulk confuse you on the true cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome soap","review":"my dad has been using this soap for years and gave me a bottle as a present a few years ago. i've been using it since! my favorites are peppermint and tea tree. recently took it on a camping trip and it was the only cleaner i needed - dishes, clothes, me! the gallon goes a LONG way. i keep a small decorative pump soap dispenser in the shower and just put a couple of squirts onto a sponge. not digging through multiple bottles, it cuts my shower time down, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantly Surprised","review":"I researched the hell out of Dr. Bronner's when I wanted a more natural shampoo/soap, and it received nothing but positive responses - so I bought it in Peppermint. The smell is lovely, but it DOES NOT wash my hair, though it is advertised as an 18-in-1 magic soap - shampoo included.Let me preface by saying I have VERY thick hair.The first time I noticed that it wasn't clean was while I was camping. After a shower, the back of my hair felt wet and heavy for WAY too long, so I checked it out in the bathroom, and it looked like my hair was greasy and filled with residue. At first I dismissed it based on the water pressure from camping.When I returned home, I used Dr. Bronner's on my hair two days in a row, taking special care to make sure my hair was completely rinsed. By the second day, my hair was gnarly and matted in the back.Unfortunately, even using this as a body wash makes my skin feel tight.I REALLY wanted to like this shampoo. I was hoping it would change my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent body wash; great price","review":"This soap is wonderful...no chemicals and no parabens...which you find in many other \\"health-natural\\" brands. Peppermint is very invigorating...it's my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody's Fault Exactly","review":"Product arrived with a faulty seal. Fragrance had dissipated. Only a vague resemblance to the quality I know and associate with Dr. Bronner. Nobody's fault. Things happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never ever ever again...","review":"The fragrance is wonderful and I feel great that it's natural, but I hate this soap. First, it does not lather, no matter how much you use or rub. Second, it is so liquid that you can't really use it in a pump because when you pump it will spray out and make a mess. I just don't feel clean after using. There are too many better organic soaps out there. I never tried the other options for Dr. Bonner, so perhaps it's just lavendar.On the positive side, it does smell nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment and wasteful spending","review":"I really love this peppermint soap for many good reasons and use it for various things. Finding it online at that price was great...only to have it delivered and upon opening the box find that the company sent me a baby unscented fragrance-free bottle of Dr. Bronners! The box and packaging label said peppermint. I tried to return it but UPS never came to pickup and so I refused to do the back and forth over such a small item. But I won't make that mistake again. Target was very sloppy on this one, Amazon never followed up and UPS was as usual unconcerened about customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Bronner-Org Castile Soap Peppermint","review":"Despite all claims, I was not pleased with this product as a laundry soap. While it filled the laundry room with a wonderful aroma, it did a poor job of cleaning my clothes, leaving them dingy and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Product but doesn't reserve 5 stars.","review":"Good product and skin friendly. But doesn't have the luxury feel to it. I have used better soaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross residue","review":"I bought this product to help transition into a \\"no poo\\" routine. It worked well the first day but the second time I washed my hair with it my hair felt so dirty. The only way I can describe it is that it felt like I had gone swimming in a chlorinated pool. It wasn't greasy but it felt grimmy and was completely unmanageable which really doesn't help when you have to go to work. There is a light citrus scent so I am going to try and use it as a body wash and I will update my review if that works out well. Keeping my fingers crossed it doesn't make my skin feel like chlorine."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINGS EYES BADLY!","review":"Whatever you do, don't get this stuff in your eyes. And remember to dilute it for showering/shampooing. I got it in my eyes, full strength, and I spent the next hour wondering if I would need to go to the emergency room. Fortunately I had some eye wash on hand--a lot--and used it constantly. This is nasty stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved the smell of this soap but the suds would last for a minute or two & then you were left with a yucky looking water.Oh, for a product that would suds, be safe & do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't irritate my hand eczema","review":"I could go on and on about how much I love the soap, but one of the things I hand't originally thought of when purchasing this was how it'd affect my eczema. Don't know how it is for everyone, but my hands take to it very well! I feel like most soaps either don't clean my hands well enough, or strip too much moisture. As long as I get the moisturizer on after drying my hands, I've never had a reaction from the soap.And as a side note, I love how long this stuff lasts! You hardly have to use any to lather up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dandruff shampoo I've ever used (tea tree)","review":"This is regarding the tea tree version. It is the best anti- seborrheic dermatitis shampoo I've ever used, with the possible exception of daily use of prescription-strength ketoconazole 2% shampoo (it works better than the 1% Nizoral AD). I was also hoping it would help with folliculitis, but as that's an intermittent problem to begin with, it's difficult to say. It's either helping slightly or, at worst, not making it worse.Some have complained about the smell of the tea-tree oil version. It's definitely a medicinal smell, sort of like menthol and eucalyptus. It's a bit strong when you're applying it, but it rinses away quite thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eucalyptus soap","review":"This soap is fantastic.....works just like the others but smells like eucalyptus. Wonderful smell and perfect for the winter. Normally I use peppermint, but it cools you so much it's not good for the cold climate so i switched to this and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best soap on earth!","review":"I love this soap!Unlike many commercial \\"soaps\\" which are actually chemical detergents, this is actual, old fashioned soap, made with a fat combined with a lye just like in the old days. Because of this, it doesn't dry out your skin like most commercial soaps do.It's amazingly gentle on the skin, but highly effective at cleaning. A little goes a long way with this stuff and although it's a lot of soap to buy at once, it will save you money. You can use it for all kinds of tasks - cleaning yourself, cleaning clothes, cleaning other things, or even getting rid of bugs on your radishes in the garden. Look up \\"uses for Dr. Bronner's soap\\" to see what other things you can find.Even the crazy writing that covers the entire bottle is quite charming (and fun to read in the bath tub) Thank you Dr. Bronner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Castile soap with tea tree is fantastic!

This is the only so I use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can't you wash with it??","review":"I was very skeptical of this due to all the \\"Hype\\" But I was pleased to be wrong. It works wonderfully.. I got the peppermint which should come with a will \\"tingle\\" or even burn sensitive skin.. Tip for ladies, a few drops in a cup of warm water makes a great makeup brush cleaner..Tip for the guys, 10 to 20 drops in a bucket washes the car amazingly.I love it at a face wash that tingles and makes your skin feel so clean. I use it with my clarsonic face brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this soap","review":"Dr. Bronners Magic Organic products are the best.

I never felt clean using this because it doesn't lather. I would use some with a loofa, and I'd have to add more 2-3 a shower session. I was going through way more of this than I would regular body wash! I'm sure it was cleaning just fine, but I have oily skin and need the \\"reassurance\\" soap lather provides.Basically, if you have OCD like me you may want to avoid this soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tea Tree smells bad","review":"this doesn't smell like tea tree I have used in the past.

Quick shipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best soap on the market!","review":"I've been reading some reviews claiming that Dr. Bronner's is now diluted and not as strong as it used to be. I haven't noticed a difference, but even if it is true, I still think it is an amazing value! I use this soap for everything, even on my face. Of course you want to DILUTE! DILUTE! especially if you want to use it on your face or other sensitive areas. I use only one drop, then fill the palm of my hand with water to dilute and make a bubbly foam. My face feels clean, tight, cool and fresh thanks to that peppermint oil! A couple of drops with some baking soda make a great scrub for sinks and tubs, and super diluted (5 parts water to 1 part soap) is great for dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soap","review":"This is a great soap.

Only takes a little bit to make lather and the lather last. leaves you squeaky clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Castile liquid soap-","review":"I decided to try this simply b/c I wanted to see what the rose soap was like. First it's not only Rose, but also hemp- thus the scent is not purely \\"ROSE\\". That being said, it is still a nice scent. The liquid is VERY thin in consistency, unlike another brand that I have tried. It is a Very good soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use unscented version now","review":"I have MCS (multiple chemical sensitivity, aka environmental illness, aka environmental sensitivities, aka sick building syndrome). Dr. Bronner's is what I use for EVERYTHING: body, hands, kitchen cleanup (when detergent not necessary), shampoo, mopping floors--everything soapy! I used Dr. Bronner's peppermint for decades, then switched to the unscented version when that came out a few years ago. Both products are GREAT. The peppermint can be a bit strong--stings my nether regions a bit, or fumes can sting eyes a bit when using full strength when cleaning. (at least that used to be true--some folks are saying the new formula is toned down a bit). Anyway, GREAT product. All you need for everything except severely greasy pots & pans--for that I use 7th Generation dish detergent."},{"rating":"2","title":"CASTILE SOAP","review":"I LOVE SHOPPING WITH AMAZON.BRONNER CASTILE SOAP IS GREAT.

The soap is strong and needs to be diluted but it also lasts for months.

The lather is good and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, you can use it for anything","review":"I've been using this as a face wash. You only need a few drops for a cleansing lather. I've noticed that my blackheads are a lot less visible and reduced and my skin has really cleared up! I've also diluted some as a body wash, shampoo, and hand soap. I would suggest diluting for a body wash and soap because the soap is really concentrated and it leaves a \\"waxy\\" feel to your skin when it's wet. I've used this for handwashing clothing, too. The scent sticks to the fabric pretty nicely. The earthy floral scent is wonderful. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous...just fabulous","review":"This is the best, most versatile soap. It is organic and sustainably made. All of Dr. Bronner's products get five stars. This works as a body wash, facial wash, dish detergent, and much more (for me.) The Hemp Almond is my favorite. Eucalyptis is great for invigorating your senses and opening up those sinuses.Try it! If you're not in awe then it's not for you. You don't have to be a hippy to use this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a loufa","review":"This soap is great stuff, but you'll want a loufa to get a good lather.I got the peppermint and almond, and I'd recommend both.The peppermint is pretty tingly when you wash the right areas, if you know what I mean. Just a fair warning, but it is a very mild effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Natural Soap But Liquid Form is a Pain.","review":"I like the ingredients of this soap and it does get your hands clean but it's a pain to use in a soap dispenser. This stuff shoots out like a firehose in my Williams-Sonoma soap dispenser and then after awhile, it would clog up the dispenser pump. I tried diluting it but this didn't help much. I found it works best by just using it out of the container it comes in but then the lid gets all mucked up with soap residue. My recommendation is to go with Dr. Bronner soap bars instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets out every smell!!U","review":"I saw a review on yyou tube and decided to give it a try.

It's an honest product with powerful cleaning abilities.

My only problem is that whenever I have a cut anywhere, the citrus in this soap stings me. I don't have this problem with the bar soap version. I usually have either the almond or lavender liquid soaps as well so that I can switch them out when this happens. Also, none of these works well as a shampoo so I wouldn't use it for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic soap","review":"Love this stuff, not overpowering scent at all, but a little bit in the shower, in the wash bucket, or laundry gets things clean and leaves everything smelling fresh, whether me, the floors, or my clothes.

Just look at the list of ingredients and you will see why it is so wonderful. This is a true soap made from the process of saponification of all natural oils. This version includes tea tree oil, which is a natural antibacterial and antifungal medicine for your skin, you can use this soap on a daily basis to prevent and treat of a wide variety of skin issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this despite my skin reaction","review":"I used this as a body wash and originally it was fantastic. It felt very weird going on the skin at first. But once I dried off my skin was left soooooo soft! Unfortunately the soap made me break out. I tried to use the soap for over a month to get my body used to the soap, but my skin continued to be irritated. It wasn't the almond, I drink almond milk daily. Once I stopped, my skin went back to normal. I am very sad because I couldn't get enough of this soap. It smells wonderful and really made my skin feel like velvet (despite the bumps and rash) but we were not meant to be. I ended up giving the soap to my parents and they love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"we didn't want to use the regular dish detergent for our baby bottles and got this. this is really a great product to use. someone said it has a smell but to be honest it doesn't smell that strong or at all to me.would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and lasts forever!","review":"OK, maybe it doesn't last forever, but a bottle sure does last me a long time! I will admit, I wouldn't use Dr. Bronner's in every recommended category, but there are certain things I love it for. I've had good luck with it for the clothing I hand wash, and it leaves my clothes smelling fresh but not overwhelmingly so. I don't tend to be a fan of strong scents, and Dr. Bronner's scented soaps just smell good (especially the tea tree!) It's also a very mild and gentle soap, which has worked wonders for my sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this soap.

Scalp did not break out in acne.Cons - do not wash face skin or any other skin with this soap. It makes me breakout in acne on face & back. Makes rash breakout on legs and arms.I wanted to love this product. I spent a lot of money, $10 for a liquid soap, hoping it would be good for everything.

Then a few more for my legs, and the rest of my body. Odd to use if you're not used to watery liquid. The scent is definitely almond. I expected less of a drying effect since I read reviews that it wouldn't dry your skin. However, even the little bit that I used has made me itchy and dry, and I've used it once a day for 2 days. Certainly clean, but I'd rather go back to a soap with moisturizers/lotion in it even if it isn't 'natural'. At least I'm not dried out. All that hype about using natural products if getting over rated. I find they never work as well as commercial brands. I'll be going back to oil of olay, and return this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Scent, Gets You Clean without Drying","review":"Dr. Bronner's Rose Castile Soap is really great stuff - while we haven't used it on our laundry for house cleaning purposes, we have used it for all sorts of personal care cleaning purposes, including to use to wash our hair, faces, and bodies. I'm not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo, as it's difficult to find a good conditioner to match it's rosy scent, however, it's really nice to use as a face and body wash. As a shampoo, it tends to dry out my hair a little too much, also. As a face and body wash, I haven't noticed any effects of drying out my skin, and the scent is not strong enough to overpower, but strong enough so that when I get out of the shower that I am lightly rose scented. The scent is not chemically or super girly smelling - my husband even likes using this soap! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for hands and that is it","review":"This is fine for hand soap but don't believe the people who say it works as a shampoo.

So far I have used it as a body soap, hand soap and dish soap. Overall it cleans fairly well. However, as a body soap, you will really know it if you get it in your neither regions... very tingly. As a hand soap I have problems with dispensing the soap. I use a standard hand soap dispenser but the end of the dispenser is constantly getting clogged with gooey soap. The clogging is not enough to prevent dispensing the soap but it does cause it to spray wildly in all directions. I've even had it spray in my eyes once. As a dish soap it works very well.The label has some bizarre little statements all over it. After reading these statements, I now understand why the inventor was once committed to a mental hospital.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross, dry film - Buyer Beware!","review":"Bought both the Peppermint and pure castille soap and was looking very forward to a clean shower. Used it first as a shampoo then a body wash--gross on both accounts! It became very difficult to move my fingers through my thick, curly hair, and afterwards hair felt coated in dry roughness and was unusually frizzy. Also used as a body wash, same effect. The water beaded right off my skin upon exiting the shower; I felt like someone had dipped me head to toe in dried wax. My skin was very tight and uncomfortable afterwards. I didn't experience the tingly sensations others mentioned, just a nasty film that coated my skin and stayed. I'm really disappointed in Dr. Bonners, since I've been making the switch to organic and harsh-chemical free products, I really expected to love this stuff. Instead, it clogged my pores and just made my skin and hair feel awful. After experiencing a terrible effect on skin and hair, I'm very hesitant to use it on anything else in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me Itch","review":"I purchased this yesterday.

I could not get it to go all the way on my scalp. And my hair felt almost sticky and my hands would not glide over my hair. Even when using a conditioner afterwards, it was just too frustrating to use all the time. It got worse the more I used it.I would only use it as an emergency shampoo.It did not work well for shaving.

They did soften my skin, but I wanted something that would just clean without drying. This product has lived up to the reviews, and the Vitamin Shoppe price is the best. I don't clean my floors, windows, dishes, etc. with it, nor do I use it as shampoo or toothpaste, as some other reviewers have. I never intended to. I just wanted a good bath soap that wouldn't dry my skin and this soap does exactly that. The peppermint is so refreshing, and my skin is simply clean. I can rub my hand over my skin and it doesn't \\"skip\\" as it does with some moisturizing body washes. My skin is clean, soft, not dried out, and it just feels healthy. I did heed warnings from other reviewers and I haven't used it on the uh.. more delicate parts of my body, due to the peppermint.

It was recommended in some insecticidal soap recipe reviews I read.The good news is, it works. After spraying in the day, the bug zapper is strangely quiet that night and for the next night or two.The bad news is, a few days later more hordes of leafhoppers take their place.This would be perfect if it repelled the bugs or had a residual effect on new bugs instead of just killing the ones it touches (I'm still looking for something that does that).Another good point is that since you only have to use a 1% to 1-1/2% solution (1-2 ounces per gallon), this half-gallon lasts a whole lot longer and covers a whole lot more yard than any typical lawn insecticide you can buy in any store. So it does the same thing for a fraction of the cost.Plus, it makes the yard smell great!Until I find something better, I will continue to use this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get the hype","review":"I didn't understand why everyone was so excited about this soap. I bought it for the sole purpose of using as a hand soap. I couldn't find anywhere through the company an exact measurement for the dilution parts, but found it through other's recommendations on line. The dilution was 10 parts water to 1 part soap. That leaves me with water that smells like peppermint. It squirts everywhere out of the soap dispenser and is not even a tiny bit thick like normal soap. It also left a white film/residue in my sinks that were tough to clean out. I might be the only one, but I didn't \\"get it\\" on this soap.

While the product works well as a body soap, I use it to clean everything around the house - dishes, counters, laundry, floors... I really do mean everything. This soap leaves whatever you wash smelling minty fresh and clean. When used as a shampoo, the soap will thoroughly break down oils - which means you should use a natural conditioner right after. Because it's so gentle, Dr. Bronner's Peppermint soap makes a fantastic dog wash. I feel great knowing I'm not exposing my dog to any synthetic ingredients that might irritate him.

I bought it for him to help with dandruff, which it gets good reviews for being effective at, and it hasn't done such a great job.

Since my husband doesn't like it, I've been experimenting with it for other purposes, and even as plain old body wash I love it! It's very mildly tingly and I personally LOVE the smell of tea tree. (I know some reviewers have complained about it but it's a very herbal menthol kind of smell which I find pleasing.) I even wash my face with it once in a while and it helps to keep it clear.For other uses, like cleaning counter tops, I haven't really used it because I find the fact that you have to wash it off afterwards to be too much work. I like to just spray and wipe!But all in all, it's very good, versatile soap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smell great and clean well","review":"I love all of Dr. Bronner soap.

I got out of the shower after using this, then a good moisturizing shampoo, and then a conditioner and my hair felt really weird.. like it almost had this wax feeling to it.

Just my luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY hot but bonds really well","review":"This glue gun works better than the three I've had in the past and I think it's because it gets so hot, the glue stays sticky longer and has a chance to really bond things together. But there's a downside to this if you're not really careful. I was making a wreath with this glue gun today. I had glued an item to the frame and waited for what seemed like ample time--probably 30 seconds or so--before picking up the frame under the spot where I had just applied glue. Some glue got on my finger and burned it to the point of blistering. Just be really careful if you're not used to using a glue gun that can get as hot as this one does.Also, the little plastic stand is pretty lame; it folds back in about 8 out of 10 times when I set the gun down after glueing something.But I'm giving this glue gun four stars because stuff really does together when I use it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke first use","review":"I bought this based on the price and I have good success with Stanley products in the past.

The second time I had to force feed the glue stick through the gun. It seemed that the trigger stopped working.

The problem is you need to have a warrior hand to operate it. The button to be pressed would get so stiff my hand was getting a work out. I found it a bit clunky to work on my craft projects. Particular for finer work. Theres just not enough flexiblity to be had with this glue gun. Also the glue would not come out at times. I would have to place it on its stand, for a few minutes, then use it. As a doll crafter I want to keep going. Just like other crafters. I am keeping the gun for big repairs.

Unfortunately, I was EXCESSIVELY mistaken! There was no depth of character or maturity found within this book. The sentence structure was often incomplete making it almost impossible to understand what the author was trying to express. The Characters had no soul. They were mindless caricatures fulfilling wanton lusts and desire without reason. Who but a madwoman would swoon at the sight of her intended conquest on the arm of another woman-then pull her own hair out and tear at her own face. You may enjoy such as this,but I do not!

The story telling is by no means raw...it's sparkling. It's the material and the way Llywelyn presents it that gives it this intriguing quality.This book is the typical epic adventure found so often in fantasy. Yet the author finds a way to infuse it with good original elements. I found myself feeling the very breath of characters as they spoke.As good as this book's story telling was, however, there was somthing about the plot that wasn't quite as fulfilling...this is why \\"The Horse Goddess\\" does not get all five stars. Maybe it was some of the cruder elements in the storyline or maybe it was the typical tried and true adventure through different lands, but the plot was the only unsatisfying thing about this book. Otherwise, I would recommend this book to anyone who asked but wouldn't present it as *the* book to read to anyone who was asking for suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is very rich and engrossing --- it blew me away!!","review":"I have followed Morgan Llywelyn's work for several years now and finally, I got hold of The Horse Goddess. It did not disappoint --- Ms. Llywelyn has a way of taking the reader away, and making her feel and share in Epona's and Khazak's life and adventures. It is a wonderful story, exploring the beginning of the Celtic ways and traditions, even before the magical Irish and British Celts. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Since finding Bard, I'll read anything Llywelyn writes, including this book I found with a gold cover trying to sell itself as a romance novel (ugh). It wasn't, thankfully, but it seems an early work. The historical information in the novel was, I am sure, up to par with her other works, but the story itself was pretty shallow, staged, and craftless. Not my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, annoying, fun...","review":"Morgan Llywelyn writes in a colorful way, but I kept wincing as I read. The Celtic pantheon (shown here as being historical human figures) is reduced to hash: the author seems to have little knowledge of, or respect for, actual Celtic mythology. She also makes statements like \\"She rode on the horse's bony rump\\"--yeah, well, she doesn't know much about horses, either! (For those of you who don't know, the part of the horse you sit on is the back; if you sat on the rump, you'd fall off before it took a step.)This book has convinced me never to bother reading any of her other stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this grater has no base","review":"The description says this has a \\"black rubber base.\\" I took that to mean a removable solid base, so that the cheese stays inside until you remove the base to empty it. That's the kind of grater I need. Instead this just has a black rubber rim around an open base, so the cheese falls onto whatever work surface you are using. That may be fine for you, but the description should have been more specific.

Yup, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album, but certainly not their best","review":"For some reason, when they made this album, they really wanted to make fun of themselves. \\"Light,\\" \\"Drug Against War,\\" and \\"Sucks\\" are all about KMFDM, and do not treat the band favorably. It's hilarious in how consistently and thoroughly they can deprecate themselves.Anyway, as for the album, there are a lot of great songs on it. \\"Light,\\" \\"The Problem,\\" and \\"Sucks\\" all have great beats. However, \\"Drug Against War\\" is an awful song. Why is this a single? What is it but an annoying guitar riff played over and over?Concluding, despite the fact that there are some really great songs on it, Angst is merely a good album, not a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic deserving of more notoriety","review":"I just recently put this back into my CD player after a bit of an absence and I was struck by how fresh the album was. It really has withstood the test of time, the real challenge of any good album. I came to Angst more from the metal side than the techno side, although I still love bands like Godflesh and Ministry as well, and metal fans are encouraged to pick this up, they will not be disappointed. There is a good mix to the tunes, power, humor and mindless fun. From start to finish the album is outstanding and there are no weak spots. Anyone even remotely interested in techno who does not have this album as part of their collection is missing one of the great works in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best KMFDM album to date...","review":"After following KMFDM since the 80s, I would say Angst is one of KMFDM's best albums of all time. In addition to a great mix of dark techno and meaningful lyrics, the actual number of members in the KMFDM band contributes to their great musical talent. Along with KMFDM, the band: Killing Joke (specifically the album, \\"Pandemonium\\") is worth a listen if you want similar sounds. Other similar bands; Gravity Kills, Stabbing Westward, White/Rob Zombie, Frontline Assembly, Front242, and Juno Reactor (not as dark though)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song","review":"The only song I like is \\"The Problem\\".

My answer is: yes, definitely. In fact, I'd recommend that you read this as your second Pelecanos book. I'd recommend The Big Blowdown as your first because it is set in an earlier period. There are some key characters in this book who show up in later works and I would have enjoyed having read this for background about them.Generally, this book has the standard qualities I love in this author's work - gritty crime stories, interesting characters and great scene development. Besides that, this book would be worth reading for the Johnny McGinnes character alone. He's a sidekick rather than a main player, but he is one wild and crazy and hugely entertaining guy. Check him and this book out if you like crime fiction. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"characterizations and setting save this Pelecanos novel..","review":"'A Firing Offense', as judged by many amazon.com reviewers, is not the most thrilling of crime novels by Pelecanos. In fact the criminal aspect of this story, which only comes to light towards the end (..no spoilers), is somewhat thin. However this book simply oozes with atmosphere. 1980s wasted youth, drug culture, with the lead character (Nick Stephanos) definitely in a \\"desperately seeking something\\" mode. I felt transported back in time to a different place. There is something also of a Jack Kerouac feel to it also as much of the book takes place on the road.Bottom line: perhaps not a stellar Pelecanos novel but I enjoyed the ride.

I couldn't say on the oral, we haven't done that with these, and we don't risk relying on them on the actual day of ovulation, but overall, I have to say, wonderful product, no risk, no problems, comfortable, easy to insert and remove.

My boyfriend had no luck either, and the entire ordeal was awful for both of us. I ended up going to an emergency clinic (because we were out of the country) to have it removed. When it came out it was torn in several places. The gynocologist who removed it for me (with some difficulty) said she's seen them get stuck before but never tear. I then developed an infection because not all of the pieces came out.

Here's my rant ... I find it VERY odd that the company who made the deal to take over from allendale pharmaceuticals retooled the packaging to appeal to a younger market but has recently filed for reorganization under Chapter 11. And NOW, when we're sent to links to buy the sponges online in the US, we're asked to pay varying exhorbitant prices including $130 for a box of 12 that used to cost $35!!!!?????

For one, this does not protect you from STDs. Just have to throw that out there. But if you have a steady partner, it's not great either. If you have had children, the rate of protection goes down SIGNIFICANTLY - to the point where it does not feel like it is a safe option, even if it is just for birth control. And last - and the strongest reason I can think of not to use it, is the spermicide is a bit numbing, for both men and women. And if there is oral sex involved in your fun, then there is this highly unpleasant numbness for the mouth. There are far more effective options out there.

It is incredible how he switches from one topic to the next in an unpredictable way, but nevertheless this book is a single speech. It is written in ONE sentence. OK, Hrabal uses question and exclamation marks from time to time, but these do not really end a sentence, no, it goes on and on...

Then he puffs it in the faces of his friends. His friends decide that they don't want to play with him anymore. Dexter becomes very sad and runs into the cornfield. He falls asleep there and when he wakes up, he is surrounded by popcorn... I liked this book for two reasons: the pictures and the moral behind the story.

When I mentioned this to my daughter's preschool teacher, she recommended \\"The Popcorn Dragon\\" as a way to introduce dragons to our son in an age-appropriate manner. He LOVES this book.

I was considering dumping it halfway through the book, but I stuck with it. It doesn't get any better - there is hardly any action only a couple of interesting plots. Apart from that, it is pure money & sex - a Jackie Collins novel with a Mafia family here and there.If you are looking for a good Mafia book, stay away from this offering from Puzo.Re-read The Godfather!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Having loved the Godfather, I have continued to read each book written by Mario Puzo and I have continued to be disappointed. The pre-publication hype for The Last Don, saying that Puzo was getting back to what he knows best, again made me hopeful. However, the new book can't hold a candle to the Godfather. I guess Mario only had one book in him. Still, I probably be in line when the movie opens"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in comparison with The Godfather","review":"Every gangster story written by Mario Puzo would probably be compared to The Godfather which is an all time classic. This comparison may not be fair, but since I read The Last Don immediately after reading The Godfather, I cant help but compare the two. Compared to The Godfather, this book is a meandering and contrived story that failed to arouse my enthusiasm. The ending is predictable and the book gets more boring as the story develops. I would not recommend this book unless you are a Puzo fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOONG TEDIUS READ","review":"This book seemed like it took forever to read.I bought this book because it claimed to expose the underside of movie making and Las Vegas. There were probably 5 pages all together about runnig a casino and what goes on behind the scenes in Hollywood.The story itself was very lame. The mafia in this book was just so unbelievably omnipotent. The love interest was also entirely too perfect.The storytelling method used in this book got old very early. A major plotpoint would happen and one important point would obviously be left out and not addressed for hundred of pages later. An example of this is when the \\"hero's\\" father was killed, and the killer was expected by the father and the father even talked to the killer but we are not let in on him for several hundred pages. While this was supposed to make for nail biting suspense I just found it annoying as hell.Do not waste your time or money on this book, if you must watch the tv movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera about mob","review":"I love \\"The Godfather\\" movies, so I decided to give this one a shot. I'm sure now - those movies are great only beacause Coppola directed them.Puzo is an average writer. He knows who to tell the story fluently and that just about wraps it up. Everything else in this book stinks - annoying larger-then-life characthers, bad dialogues and predictable plot. After reading 1/4 of a book I knew what will happen at the end, and I am no Einstein, I admit.Soap opera about mob, is my definition of this novel. Easy to read, beyond belive and sometimes irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully, this IS the last don","review":"Round up all the usual 'dis and 'dat mugs and attempt to beleive that Mafiosos are cool guys.

I haven't read it since (yet), but I'll be surprised if my opinion will have changed when I do. Most of the books I loved then still hold up to a more mature re-reading. So what is with everything else Mario Puzo has written? I tried The Sicilian and thought it was laughable--something early he unearthed for his publisher when fame struck. I tried The Fortunate Pilgrim, after reading glowing reviews about his true \\"masterpiece.\\" I thought it was pretentious and boring. Then this book--it reads like a novel written after a teleplay to capture a miniseries audience of non-readers. Don't bother--it's not even any fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow read","review":"This was my first Puzo book. I was expecting an entertaining read. Instead, I found the book to be a confusing chain of family dramas involving numerous un-engaging characters, plodding towards a conclusion that was less than exciting. Paricularly annoying were the in-depth, opinionated (introspective?) analysis of the world of hollywood film making.Maybe the choppiness and numerous twists and mini-dramas is just the nature of mafia stories. Maybe I am just reading the wrong genre.

I think that there is no doubt that the mafia has gone legit, which is the underlying theme of this book. If we wonder about some of the actions of Corperate America, this book may well explain them. Also, at one point, the Don discusses the running of several State Lotteries in a way which is frighteningly authentic. There is so much money in crime, especially drugs, one has to wonder where it all goes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzo's Worst","review":"As someone who has truly enjoyed the works of Mario Puzo over the years I was terribly disappointed in this book. The book reads as though Puzo has taken bits and pieces from previous books and pasted them together. The only thing saving this from 1 star was Puzo's incredible command of language.

But now, all these years later The Last Don represents the full circle of Mario Puzo. Did I say full circle? I don't think he's moved anywhere actually. The Last Don is a bad Godfather clone, period. The sad part is of course that it comes from the author of that blockbuster. It pains me to see Puzo ... like this. But hey, the guy needed money I guess and figured he ain't writin' too many more 500 page novels so he might as well cash in with this and the inevitable TV movie. No secret who the Ernest Vail character represents: a bitter, disconcerted... Puzo. Hopefully this is The Last Puzo as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolerable if you're in an airplane and REALLY bored!","review":"The Last Don by Mario Puzo is typical Puzo. His big bestseller, The Godfather, was gripping once you had seen the film, but the truth is that Puzo's style is clumsy. His sentences are unwieldy and boorishly contructed, as if he were a foreigner. I could wipe my arse with the plot, which is, to say the least, terrible. The story doesn't hang together. Puzo seems to throw a million different things together in total chaos. This book may be tolerable for lonely housewives, but for me, I'd only read it if I were really lacking amusement. I sincerely advise you not to purchase it. By the way, the TV series were even worse than the damn book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, not even on a dare.","review":"I had a number of problems with this book. First, the characters weren't believable. Each character was 'perfect' for their part (the brutally efficent hitman, the brilliant and wise don, the beautiful actress). No character inspired interest or empathy. It also seems that Puzo has had a very bad experience w/ Hollywood (specifically books being turned into movies). He uses a subplot to expound on the evil of Hollywood producers. It's interesting, but he should have made it a bit more subtle, rather than using 3 pages of mainly canned dialogue to get his point across. The plot in and of itself wasn't too hot either, and the subplots were only marginally related to the main plot. When the big secret is finally introduced, you can't help but think 'Oh. So what?' because the build-up was so poor. Finally, the ending of Cross' confict w/ Loddstone was too simple... too 'deus ex machina' for my tastes. Not worth your time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mafia-Hollywood crime drama","review":"Another engrossing Mafia fiction from Puzo. Perfect for a flight from Philly to Dallas. It grabbed me from the first chapter and kept me going. The tales of Pippi De Lena and his son Cross and their efforts to co-exist with their uncle the Last Don of the title, and head of the Clericuzo crime family made for a fascinating family drama. I had already seen the mini series awhile back so the story was vaguely familiar to me. A definite 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I don't get it. Why are Americans so enamored of Mario Puzo's books? Why would anyone want to read a book that romanticizes the culture of criminals?

The characters are so comical (come one... what funny names), under-developed, plot (what plot?) unconvincing. This book does not even come half an inch near the greatness of The Godfather.

I've been a Simpsons fan since the very start of the show and could watch most episodes up through this season and not get bored with it. Although I would recommend ANY season of the Simpsons to someone not as familiar with the show as I am there are definately some seasons that are better than others, and this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always love the show!!","review":"I have every episode on tape of the show.And, I just purchased this DVD package & have all the previous seasons on DVD.My favorite Christmas episode is from the 9th season, \\"Miracle on Evergreen Terrace\\". I just love when Homer goes to the store on Christmas EVE & how he did NOT have to stand in line or fight the crowds!! Classic in my mind.Several good episodes in this seasons. \\"Realty Bites\\". Marge is my LEAST favorite character but it is scenes with the other characters that make this episode stand out. \\"The Last Temptation of Krust\\" very good, Krusty being one of my favorite characters. No one knew who jay Leno was.A must for any Simpsons fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm expecting Seasons 1-6!","review":"I might be too harsh on the producers of The Simpsons but for me the lean years were 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Perhaps they just did too much of the same-old-thing but it just didn't sing like the first few although after 12 got about halfway through I felt as though the writers got back on track and rememebred how to WRITE FUNNY LINES. I never gave up on The Simpsons, even in the depressing Season 9, and I'm glad I didn't but I wish gthey would have tried harder for this set of shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best seasons!","review":"Being a die hard Simpsons fan I must say that this season falls in the top five easily!

The author I think lives in Vermont, and is Buddhist, but that doesn't detract from what she has to say. There are a number of interesting ideas in this book.

Sure, there are a few grains of traditional Cherokee teachings in her book, but it is not her right to show them off as \\"traditional/kituwa\\" teachings. This book is an expression of her own belief system and NOT THE CHEROKEE PEOPLE. There are already too many misconceptions floating around about \\"authentic\\" Cherokee culture/religion; this book just adds to the confusion. If you are interested in learning about Cherokee culture, frequent the pow wow's or stomp dances in your area. I hope this discourages anyone from making the same mistake I did.Wado/Thank you, and Happy New Year 2000!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat lector!","review":"Once again, we have a situation where a white person is claiming to be something she is not. Ms. Ywahoo is *not* on the Dawes rolls, and is not a member of any recognized tribe of Cherokee Native Americans. Her teachings do NOT meld with any of the antiquities which have survived over the years from Cherokee ancestry - crystals and flame medidations of the type she describes are NOT part of essential Cherokee spirituality.In a recent discussion I had with Wilma Mankiller, former chief of the Cherokee Nation, she mentioned that Ms. Ywahoo has been \\"a thorn in the side of the Nation for many years now.\\" While some of the new-age concepts Ms. Ywahoo puts forth are interesting, peaceful, and appealing for their purity of thought, this book is NOT A REPRESENTATION OF TRADITIONAL CHEROKEE BELIEFS.

Given space constraints, the issues are well treated. The treatment of pricing strategies may not be as in-depth as one in a text on finance or accounting. But there is enough detail here to be understandable and useful if your background is marketing.Unsurprisingly, he gives a good discussion of marketing on a global scale.Over all, Discussion is too lengthy but authors are good and their approach is reasonable as well. Authors approach situation to convince readers with appropriate theory and examples.- Good book but it requires lot of patience to go through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really what i expected","review":"I purchased this tea/coffee maker to take with me to the office. The tea and coffee choices at the office are horrible and I thought this would be the perfect choice.The first couple of uses were fine, but as the plastic edges of the seal seemed to be used it got looser and pieces of loose tea would seep through.I would clean it right after my tea or coffee use but it still held on to the smells of whatever I made. I could never make tea after I made coffee after that or the tea tasted of stale coffee.In theory the cup is something that would be great to use, but it just felt cheap after a few uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - design needs some improvement","review":"Love the idea of just dropping in your coffee grounds/loose tea, pouring hot water - and then leaving the house. So far, I can successfully filter coffee/tea about 1 of every 3 tries. The rest of the time, I'm drinking grounds/tea leaves. I wish the mouth had a mesh strainer (like our French press) - this takes care of any small bits that sneak out of the filter. Or I need to perfect my super-steady, super-slow pressing technique. But I'm not really the type of person who has that much patience - I mean I bought a to-go cup because I don't have time to drink at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough, plastic a problem.","review":"I'm giving this product 4 stars because it does the job it's intended to do, but the plastic really bugs me.Not that it doesn't do the job, but plastic just makes me uncomfortable.Other than that, I find perfectly function-able if all you want is a cup o coffee and have time to mess with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept - Poor execution","review":"I've owned this mug for a couple of years and used it primarily for camping. Dan from Rochester got it right with his commentary, so I'll add just a few points.The concept is ideal for camping and reduces the effort to make really good coffee. However, the bad points regarding the plunger not going down far enough; leaking lid; etc. are all right on. Also, the cup is double-wall plastic for insulation. The inside sleeve on mine cracked when I poured boiling hot water in it!I would certainly purchase a similar item again, though not this one. Bodum just needs to increase the quality. I would pay twice the price for higher quality.Overall...not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"on the go","review":"This is extremely convenient for me. Plus there's only one container to wash.

I'm sure it would do the same with coffee"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted...","review":"For 5 months I thoroughly enjoyed this mug, making 2-3 batches of coffee a day, and the occasional tea. But, the other day, the inner wall cracked (I assume accumulated stress of rapid expansion from pouring in boiling water.) Slowly warming the mug, say, in a hot water bath, may avoid this problem but seems to entirely counteract the point of having a convenient travel press...Also, it seems the plastic expands just enough to make it difficult for the threading on the lid to catch. I had a few mishaps spraying boiling water over myself when I forgot to double check the lid.I will next try a steel travel press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love the concept & got it for my birthday. The press function works pretty well, but in the end I think it's better to make even a small amount of coffee in a bigger press. The bigger issue is that it leaks pretty badly. Don't know if it claims to be leakproof, but it's a farce if it does. Also, when mine arrived, it was partially broken. And though it claims to be dishwasher safe, condensation builds up inside of the insulation if you do go with the dishwasher. Overall, it's a product I can't recommend, as much as I wish I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"You WILL Be Crunching on Coffee Grounds!","review":"The other reviewers have properly characterized this product. I like it, but it has that one fatal flaw..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought one of these at my local Starbucks (same brand, same mug). It is the biggest piece of garbage. I am a big tea drinker. Even the large leaf teas sneak through the sides of the plunger. The rubber ring around the plunger gives too easily. I thought what a great idea, I can brew right in my mug rather than through my tea filer and transfer it to a travel mug. No go. Not worth the aggravation.I couldn't imagine how many coarsely ground coffee grinds I would have in my mug when I have a ton of large tea leaves.I am surprised, since I have other Bodum products that are actually very good.Do yourself a favor, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!!","review":"This travel press coffee cup is not a well made item. Before I even used the cup, the lip that covers the top broke off and could not be fixed. Then when I went to wash the cup, the filter part unscrewed from the Press. When I tried to make coffee, first you screw on the top to press the grounds down. Then take the top off to add your milk & sugar - now screw top back on...... I am not happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay Attention To The Reviews","review":"I read the reviews and bought this anyway (not on Amazon btw) and am really, really disappointed. The first one had the press stuck in the bottom and I had to exchange it. I finally got all the stickers cleaned off the second one and tested it. Look, I know how to use a French Press coffee maker, I know what grind to use and how to use it. You still get grounds with this mug. I'm going to keep it but not to make coffee, just to keep the coffee hot after making it in something else. A nice travel mug; a lousy French Press!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Coffee Press","review":"This was an impulse buy at Whole Foods a couple of months ago. I am so sorry I didn't come to Amazon ahead of time to read these reviews; I would have saved myself $20. This Coffee Press STINKS!! I use it on a medium grind coffee, and have tons of coffee grounds in my cup of coffee EVERYDAY. I hate it! I have tried every different way of plunging I can think of, but grounds still escape the filter. I don't even drink out of the plastic cup. I add the coffee grounds, then the water, let it steep and then pour it into a regular coffee mug. I then scrap out as many \\"floaters\\" as I can manage and still end up with a cup full of coffee grinds.Very poor design execution. Please save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't filter coffee grounds well at all","review":"I bought this expecting it to work as well as other Bodum products and boy was I disappointed. It really doesn't filter the coffee grounds well at all and my coffee ended up with a ton of grounds in it. I am very very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"Given the reputation of the Bodum press, I am extremely dissapointed in this product. The press has a weak rubber gasket that does not seal well. You will definately get a big swig of grounds if you chug the last bit...quite unpleasant. I also have the Big Sky Bistro press (bought at REI for about $20). It is a FAR SUPERIOR product.Starbucks is currently carrying this model on the shelf for about $11."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible french press, but hey, it's plastic","review":"This is definitely the worst french press I've ever used. There are no handles, and the plastic gets too hot to hold, so you have to awkwardly pour by the top. The normal un-screwing of the top can also unscrew the bottom part of the plunger, which is then very hard to get out. For reasons I can't explain, the same coffee in the same sized press tastes significantly worse from this press when compared to my normal glass Bodum press. But the worst part is that plenty of grinds manage to squeeze around the edges of the plunger and end up in your coffee, no matter how careful you are.Basically the only good thing about this press is that it is made from plastic and is very durable. You can just toss it in your bag (or bring it camping) and not have to worry about it. Mine was a returned item, so I got it for $5, which is about how much this thing is worth. Every other press I've ever used works better, but at least this won't break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodem Travel Coffee Press","review":"I was a bit disappointed with the travel cup. I use a French coffee press at home and am used to strong, grain-free coffee. The travel cup does not provide that. Yes, it is convenient and I can easily take it with me; but the coffee contains grains regardless of how the press is positioned or the quantity of coffee grains placed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"french press to-go cup","review":"the cup was quite a bit scratched on the outside and i paid too much for it. You can buy the same thing at starbucks for $12.99!! so, bad buy here in amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double-wall is the only good point of this mug","review":"I got this mug at Target because I drink a lot of loose-leaf tea, I mostly was drawn to it for its double-walled construction.The seal for the 'plunger' strainer is not tight enough, and only the chunkiest/largest leaves will stay at the bottomThe plunger doesn't go all the way down.. so what am I supposed to do... put 2\\" of tea leaves in there? Don't try green or white tea since they are so sensitive to heat and grow bitter the longer they steep.. you have no way to get them out once the steeping time has passed.The lid... oh yeah. The lid leaks, don't think about holding it upside down or even tilting it to the side with the cap closed.To sum it up: DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS. I'm really disappointed in Bodum, I have some of their mugs/tea pots.. but this is a sophomoric effort at best."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"Pros:It holds liquid when sitting on tabletop.Cons:-The plunger does not work well to keep coffee grounds, or tea from floating up into your drink.-There is no seal or lock to keep the plunger fully depressed-- liquid might not leak from the drinking spout, but it will spill everywhere out of the plunger's hole.-Does not keep liquids hot very long.Don't waste money on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biking to Oulipo","review":"This book is a little gem. Good writing about bikes, cycling, the Tour de France, racing, growing up in Loire, riding in Paris, etc. I can't recommend it highly enough.

Paul Fournel is a member of Oulipo (Ouvroir de Litt��rature Potentielle) along with other writers such as Raymond Queneau, Harry Mathews, George Perec, and Italo Calvino.A good writer and a good publisher.

Around that time electronic artists were creating fantastic music, like Autechre, B12 and Black Dog on Warp, and The Orb elesewhere. It was a heyday, now sadly gone, but this compilation remains as a reminder of those times.I usually don't like compilations, so it is a sign of this compilation's quality that I rate it so highly. There isn't a bad track on here. If you like Warp, or IDM, or electronica or have the barest liking of electronic music, you really need to own this CD.The cover art is even magical, everything about this compilation has an air of quality and magic about it. They sure don't make them like this no more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and ahead of it's time","review":"I discovered this title in a public library back in 1995 and took it home, discovering what to me was a whole new musical experience.

Definitely recommended for first-time electronica listeners. Good title to get your toes wet before diving into other electronica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I wasn't very impressed with this book. There was lots of general common sense statements that don't need to be said. The author glosses over installing MySQL from source. The majority of the book deals with version 3.2.

What I have heard from them, however, is the music they wrote for a Super Nintendo game called \\"X-Kaliber 2097.\\" I doubt many of you have heard of it; it's a rather obscure title-- a side-scrolling sword combat game in the vein of Strider and Run Saber (although the main character is somewhat less acrobatic than the main characters in said titles). The music for that, however basic it was, was magnificent, and I recommend anyone who enjoys Psykosonik's music to give it a listen, as you can find rips of the music from the SNES cart online (legally).The game is great, too, by the way. I recommend it to anyone who wants a fun (but very, very difficult) SNES actioner with great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hidden Gem Techno Award","review":"A consistent spin on our CD player (mine and my wife's).

It has a veriety of songs (some are more hardcore than others, some are slower than others, and there is one that is just an instrumental) that maintain the same awesome sound. 3 years have passed since I bought this album, and it is still the best techno cd I've ever heard. I've been listening to techno for years-from the oldest techno to the newest techno. I've heard cd's from Prodigy, Lords Of Acid, Moby, The Chemical Brothers, etc.; but this album is the best.

The self-titled album on the other hand, is so not like Unlearn....it's a completely different genre. It's very PWEI, old school brit house sounding with an old school rave flare - if you like early 90's booty dance music, then this is for you. There maybe one or two songs that I personally can tolerate.My apologies to those who really do like it, I dont mean to be offensive.

I tried a sampler pack before of many different brands and the Illy and Lavazza pods had the most consistent least bitter taste. Lavazza pods have nice creme. The water flows faster compared to the Illy pods so need to run the expresso machine for a little less time. The Illy pods are probably a little better quality - but at twice the price are not worth the additional investment. I would strongly recommend these.

When those ran out I researched online and ordered these pods. First of all the pod is not tightly packed and has a looseness which makes the fit in the holder improper. As a result sometimes the illy machine keeps on going and overflows the normal quantity which an espresso cup would hold.Secondly the flavor body and aroma are diffuse and not good for espresso.

I do not recommend Lavazza for espresso on an illy machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loosey goosey.","review":"Easy serve espresso pods, or ESE pods are supposed to be a consistent size, weight and tamp. But as a machine manufacturer I can tell you first hand that the coffee brewers intentionally modify the ESE spec to make their pods more likely to work well in their machine. ( and not so well in a competitor's) You see, in Italy, the coffee biz is like the cell biz here. Buy a contract for two years of monthly pods and we will throw a machine in for free. They don't want you using that machine with OPP (other people's pods). So they take a perfectly good standard and tweak it so it is no longer a standard.

I thought the pods would offer some convenience when in a rush to make espresso in the morning when heading out to work. Wrong move. They work poorly - I tried them in three different high quality machines, all with the same results. Poor, uneven flow with not enough substance to give a smooth shot with good creme. Frustrated, I decided to just open up the pods and put the good stuff in a can for proper use... that's when I discovered just how big a rip-off these are. Buying Lavazza in the can is about $7.00 for an 8.8 oz. can on average - I bought 150 pods for about $55 and when I emptied out about half of these into a can I got just that - 1 can. $27.50 per can.

To remove the old ones you just first remove a few thumb screws, unplug the modular electrical harness and lift them off -- just pay attention to how the side lights interconnect as you remove the original modules and that will help you put the new ones in. To install the new ones, just ensure that the 4 install points line up as you slide the modules in and you should have no problems.

The bra is very pretty and the band size is consistent with my other Wacoal 32D bras. The disproportionate length of the wires makes the bra too uncomfortable to wear. I may try to return it, but I don't think I will be able to now that I have worn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"angela","review":"I was extremely dissappointed with this bra and consequently had to return it.

THEN, they came out with a canned version with terrible ingredients but STILL made the superior sauce in the bottle. They now did away with the superior bottled sauce and only sell this canned version. The bottled clam sauce still had the great indredients and no chemicals like MSG etc.Their present canned variety is horrible. The old one had ALL Olive Oil, not just a little added so that they can say it on the label. The old version did NOT have MSG and all the other chemicals that this one has.

She is truly a remarkable woman, still hearty at 75, with a wit and intelligence rarely scene in real life. She told us she reads numerous (sometimes hundreds!) of history books before writing each novel to make sure that nothing in the novels contradicts anything from known history. She has created in the Lymond Chronicles the best historical fiction I have ever read, and the most compelling fiction of any genre I have ever read. When she does her book tour for the final Niccolo book in 2000, be sure to go see her--it may be your last chance to see one of the most remarkable women authors of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting. Each book as engaging as the first.","review":"In The Ringed Castle, Dunnett expands her screen. The 16th Century was a time when the world was tittering and swaying on the edge of a global world. Lymond, in Russia, and in his relationship with Chancellor seems to be aware of this and be reaching for something much bigger even than Russia. They both seem to be sailing into the age of Englishtment and the voyage is lethal and dangerous. Within 100 years, that complex world they know will be utterly destroyed and replaced with something much more grim. In this book Lymond finally falls in love. (I also wish Dunnett would include translations for her non-bilingual readers.) I, personally, don't think I have ever been more enthralled by a hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanting writing, indifferent proofreading.","review":"Although I would unhesitatingly recommend Dunnett's Lymond Series (all of her work that I have read so far) to any fan of either historical fiction or clever, subtle writing, I want to protest the undefensibly sloppy proofreading evident in the kindle versions. It is not unusual to encounter one egregious error after another, errors that would have been readily caught by even the most casual perusal of the output of the sad device that produced the text. Dunnett's writing and we, the paying customers, deserve better than this contemptuous treatment by Random House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the effort","review":"Not the easiest book in the six Lymond Chronicles, but The Ringed Castle more than rewards the reader, and anyone who has made it this far in the series will undoubtedly persevere. These books are so awash in swashbuckling one is unaware of how much history one is learning. I can hardly wait to re-read them all to pick up some of what I've missed. Dunnett is a superb writer of entwined fiction and history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do-it yrself Immigr. Kit:How to apply for a fiancee visa","review":"I thought this book was fair, but had most information already available by the INS. Some information was not accurate such as e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and fees involved by U.S. Embassies overseas. It still left questions unanswered, but was good for someone starting without any knowledge of the fiancee visa process. I expected it to answer issues left unclear by the INS, but had to go to the U.S. Embassy website for Russia in order to find accurate information about the process and fees. By itself it is only enough to do the application which could be done by INS instructions. It was not really worth the cost, but was good to have to show the documents that your fiancee will receive overseas. I wish it would have been more up-to-date as far as overseas fees such as the medical exam fees, the visa fees, and what your fiancee must do. It is a good reference, but not complete enough in content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but very sloppy","review":"I bought this when I was first learning about the fiancee visa process, but have been disappointed by it since then. It is a comprehensive guide to a complicated process, but it is not as well-organized as it should be. Also, some of the information is flat-out incorrect. For the price, the AIN Inc. staff really needs to do more checking and updating. However, for those who are not newsgroup and on-line form inclined, it is probably better than trying to learn about the K-1 over the phone or at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful, answered all my questions","review":"I was going to hire an immigration attorney to get my fiance over from Russia and I just bought this book to get a general idea of the process.

The prayers which are common among the mountain churchs and peoples are so true to their faith, they give such simple but direct meanings when explaining thier belief in God.The picture history the book contains can depect the poverty of a third world country, however, it shows the hope of the Haitain Christain in his or her \\"child like\\" faith. Many of these pictures are a testament to a people who are encouraged that thier faith in God keeps them strong day after day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topo maps yes, but hard to use and outdated.","review":"This is a useful volume for back roads and trails, but I was very disapointed with the \\"topo maps for the entire state\\".First, while they are topo maps, there is little altitude information on the actual contours- you can only determine altitude by finding a peak or opther point with a stated altitude, and count the contours to your point of interest.Second, these topo maps have NO lat/long information. In todays world, where many folks have GPS units in their car, RV, or backpacks, this makes no sense at all. This is a serious failing and why I feel the book is outdated."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for hikers, fishermen, hunters, 4-wheelers","review":"if you can afford 100 geological survey maps, get those.

This story of marital infidelity, spousal abuse, and eventual heartless abandonment by a cruel husband seems grim, but her achingly honest talks with God transform her trials into heart rending prose.

She should have known better than to use a deceptive title given the nature of the book but probably didn't want to limit sales. Shame on her for lying and deceiving her readers.Besides the obvious hypocrisy the issue is that when men escape from abusive, sociopathic women and then buy this book they're traumatized by feminist \\"men can do no right; women can do no wrong\\" dogma. The author, given her background, knows this; she just isn't willing to lose sales to prevent it. Maybe she'll insert herself as a case study into the next edition.The reason I didn't give this book one star is a lot of the information is really good.

Being nice to some women and treating them like a Goddess doesn't seem to work with some women. And being oversensitive, I'm now just a statistic in her life.

It's the story of Matt, a young man who, faced with death, refused to quit living. Matt wasn't a hero, and the writer of his story doesn't make him out to be one. Six Months to Live steers clear of the cliches and catch-phrases we often use to help us \\"make sense\\" of terminal illness. Instead, the book is realistic: it shows us Matt's darkest hours as well as his triumphs; his doubts as well as his faith. That's why, at the end, the reader is not left feeling Matt's life was \\"wasted\\"; rather, that it was used for a cause bigger than any one of us. We're all dead men, the movie Gladiator reminds us. Like as not, we don't get to choose how or when we die. But we all can choose how we meet death. Six Months to Live can help us choose well. Thanks to Matt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Job well done","review":"I enjoyed this video so much that I had to do a search for ever Happpily Ever After video ever done.

In late 1800's Montana, lady doctor Olivia is abducted by outcast Gabe to save his twin daughters from diptheria. Of course, when it's time to go home, a convenient landslide traps them for the winter.This is a very solid romance read. A pragmatist might find it a bit contrived.

They work ok on a training manequin but they are not super sturdily built so there is the potential for breakage with multiple uses. This is not a real detractor because, in real life, these would only be used one time before being discarded unless you are operating in a 3rd world country or a survivalist scenario where medical supplies are not readily replaced.

Although I believe that many are not out to simply get you in surgery, I'm sure there are a good portion that are and this book will give you cues on how to spot a happy cutting surgeon. This book will also awaken you to the fact that the doctor is merely a human being, sometimes making educated guesses into your condition.I love the author's approach and direct writing style. This book gives some information about virtually any knee problem that can arise. Most likely it will affirm you to wait, try some exercises and see how it feels. It will also give you ideas on questions to ask the doctor, as well as give you a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the knee (as of 2002)."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent Informative book, Thanks Dr.Grelsamer!!!","review":"As a former thorobred racehorse jockey I know about Knee Pain and injury, Dr. Grelsamers book was informative and answered alot of questions I've had about surgery and alternatives.

Simply put, this album is seriously the band's greatest!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"KMFDM has had several incarnations, with the coming and going of various band members and contributors keeping its style from stagnating over the years. But for that classic \\"KMFDM sound\\" of ultra-heavy beats, monster guitar riffs and raging vocals, NIHIL is the band's truly standout album and should be required listening for any fan.\\"Juke Joint Jezebel\\" is the best-loved song from NIHIL (and the first KMFDM song I ever heard... must be 6 years ago now). Other than that and perhaps \\"Brute,\\" I wouldn't name any of these songs as my particular favorites, but as a whole the album is unbeatable - you won't find any filler here.For people who are new to KMFDM and not sure which album to buy first: This is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KMFDM AT THEIR BEST:","review":"Well even if you did not get a chance to catch them during their beat by beat tour in 95' you cans till relive it by buying this CD.

There are a few songs that have some great instrumentation but I couldn't stand the vocals OR I love the vocals but couldn't stand the music. I'm not going to admit to having an objective opinion when it comes to KMFDM as this is the first thing I ever purchased from them and was really disappointed. So you might like it, you might not. It's not my cup of tea and I can't say much about it. I found it bland and unoriginal, just a bunch of noises lumped together mingling with horrible vocal treatments. Skinny Puppy is better..ahem.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen To It and be Annihilated","review":"Out of KMFDM's nine albums this one gives a new twist to their sound. Their new stuff is more dancier and you'll have the lyrics stuck in your head for weeks or even years! A prime example is \\"Juke Joint Jezebel\\" which you can listen to a sample of above. Every track is really pretty good with only a couple downers (search & destroy) but if you're a KMFDM fan or you've just become one pick this one up immediately. Unfortuantly the following album \\"XTORT\\" did not live up to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doin' it again and again and again ...","review":"This release shows a bit of a turn in KMFDM's sound, one that has persisted on the group's latter two efforts as well. The industrio/metal/funk group essentially ups the production, making the songs thick and multi-layered, like it never has before. Lyrical genious it ain't, and musical innovators they will never be, but a truly enjoyable feast it is. KMFDM don't inhabit a complex world of duality or etheral musings, (you won't find any NIN-help-me-i'm-so-miserable rants on this album) and they make no bones about it. KMFDM is a punk band at best, and just a bunch of punks at worst. If you like massive beats intertwined with metal riffing, crooning female vocals and aggressive male shouting and grumbling of degradation at its finest, than dig in. Welcome to the world of KMFDM, where the black and white only greys when trying to make sense of their album covers, which are great by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"KMFDM seems to cause a distinctive love-or-hate relationship with its listeners. I'm on the \\"love\\" side.This influential band might as well be called \\"AC/DC of industrial\\", because all these years they basically play the same thing over and over again, yet manage everytime to twist it into some new form.To me, KMFDM hit the highest point of their career in mid-90s, and \\"Nihil\\" is their finest hour. The music is IDM with big guitars and a light metal feeling to it.While I'd say there are no weak tracks on this album, still I find \\"Juke-Joint-Jezebel\\" and \\"Disobedience\\" to be the best. Perhaps the absolute best KMFDM had ever written.If you want only 1 KMFDM album, then \\"Nihil\\" is your choice, have no doubt about it.

Recognized the first track, \\"Ultra,\\" right away when I saw a trailer for Manga and just had to start dancing. \\"Disobedience\\" has to be my favorite track on the album - truly unique for KMFDM's style, but certainly a treat, accompanied by brass instruments and an amazing guitar riff that knocked me flat on my back.

It's worth its money."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ULTRA heavy beat","review":"KMFDM has pumped out 15 full-lengthed cds in the past 20 years. Out of those 15, this cd is a must have.

This is my favourite album of all time, my desert island disk, everything. Ultra is the best song they have ever done and my favourite track of all time too. Just watch it being played on Street Fighter 2 (the animated movie), when Chun lei battles Vega. It's totally phenomenal, the atmosphere, everything. The track Juke Joint Jezebel gave them a big name too, as it was featured in the Mortal Kombat movie and being a tremendous track too. All the other 8 tracks on this album are killer too, you just can't go wrong with this album anyway shape or form. Do yourself a favour and buy it, you won't regret it if you have any taste.A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple","review":"If you like symbols, you will love this album.

In most situations I had to refer to the Pro Tools reference guide to get a detailed explanation in order to do what needed to be done. Yes, the reference guide is 650 pg plus. But you can easily browse through bookmarks to find the topic you are looking for.I guess, if you have no idea what you are doing, and don't know what to look for in the reference guide in the first place, this book could direct you there when needed.I have also taken some on line Berklee Music classes with this author, but that is a completely different structure. Great class if you can afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad dog !!","review":"...The reason I bought the book was because the manual provided with Pro Tools is a reference manual and I was in search of a \\"how to\\" guide with useful examples and real-world applications. And I'm still looking! This book simply mimicks much of what is convered in Digidesign's supplied reference manual and adds little additional content except for an odd emphasis on the producer and engineer's role in the preproduction and production process. And frankly I bought the book as a Pro Tools primer, not as a generalization of the production and engineering process---there are books far better than this which are dedicated to those topics. Additionally, the \\"bonus CD\\" included with the book is the equivalent of a \\"bonus\\" copy of AOL --- nothing more than a copy of Digidesign's \\"Pro Tools FREE\\", available as you would expect FOR FREE from their web site.

If it walked you through doing a track, how to patch sub-tracks, more in-depth of editing tracks, \\"bouncing\\" to CD, what to do, what not to do... it just was not what I expected.

I ordered this book for a college project on video game rhetoric. I was reading through the book, only gleaning occasional useful information. Finally, I struck a gold mine in Ch 10, which very explicitly focuses on how simulations can persuade. I finished the end of the chapter, thrilled to continue on to the next two chapters, which from the titles looked to be just as useful. Unfortunately, THEY WEREN'T THERE! The next page after 234 is page 139. Again. Over forty pages of the book are duplicated. If that isn't enough, when it finally gets back to the right page, it picks up on page 267. So not only was I ripped off for thirty pages of the book, they just so happened to be the chapters I needed. Just my luck. I want my money back. More importantly, I WANT TO READ THOSE DANG CHAPTERS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary for everyone","review":"I can't really sum up this album easily. There are too many incredible things about it. A definite influence from TKK's headman Buzz McCoy on Ride The Bomb and Conquer Your House II. Rev A. Chester's rant on Worship Me reminds me of Sublime's album with Raliegh Sakers. Conquer Your world starts out akward but picks up tremendously near the middle of the track. Blow Your House Down's intro shows more of that Tkk influence and continues on with some great bass and drums. To Death II is dark and has great drum loops backing up some good winds samples. Finger On The Trigger features great drums by En Esch and wonderful guitars by Gunter Schulz. A great buy for those fans initated during the Naive-Money-Angst period. Also a great example of how Sacha collaborates with other bands. All n' all a must have for fans of either KMFDM or MDFMK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly impressive.","review":"I ordered the Tribeca 2 GB flash drive to supplement a 1 GB flash drive, used primarily for photo back up. Because of its thickness, I had to remove my other USB devices from the over/under USB ports on the front of my machine.

I'd recommend this to anyone who likes romance and has a drivers license. To the readers who thought the ending to volume 2 and 3 was gross then you might want to check out a different series because you might not be mentally mature enough for this story (it goes along with little kids saying \\"EWWWWWWWW!\\" when a kissing scene comes on the screen but when they get older they're like \\"whatever\\". This story may have been done a lot before but Rie Takada adds her own twist to the story and makes it her own. If you like this story check out other stories like hana-kimi, wild act, kare first love, paradise kiss, kare kano, hot gimmick, etc. (most of those are for 16 yrs. and older)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda Love it","review":"The ending makes me jealous, but the rest of the book is fine!The second book's ending grossed me out.

Would like to see a better cap and something you can move around to clean out once in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids...","review":"This book is only so-so as a drawing book, whether for beginners or more advanced artists. The pictures are weird, and not aesthetically pleasing, even for monsters. However, this is definitely not a book for kids. The pictures are frightening enough to give kids nightmares. Think horror. Not a very useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves a much wider audience","review":"The relative obscurity of this major talent is yet another demonstration of the arbitrariness of success in the music business. Perhaps the problem with this excellent CD is that there are no songs on it that fit easily into the hit radio format. Unlike so many better-known singer-songwriters, Joy Askew doesn't write jingles with \\"catchy\\" choruses -- in Tender City she's crafted an album of sonic landscapes one can listen to all the way through. Stylistically reminiscent of an edgier Sarah McLachlan, Joy Askew should appeal as well to audiophiles, as this is an extremely well-recorded CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, amazing music","review":"I LOVE this album and have played it hundreds of times.

I was excited about my Kitchenaid purchase and I was looking for a cookbook that would provide recipes that would help me use the mixer. I don't have the attachments and don't think I will be purchasing them so I feel that I wasted my money on at least half the book. I may change my mind after I try some of the recipes but I am not impressed by the recipes I've read so far. Not worth the money I spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased as usual","review":"Bought the mixer Bible as a gift and quite frankly had a hard time giving it away.

From pasta to apple sauce, I had no idea there are so many wonderful recipes that can be made with a mixer.

I found it both educational and entertaining, and I can thank Mr. Greenberg for helping me pass my Abnormal Psych exam (I got an A-, not too shabby). This isn't a book you should want to have, it's a book you need to have. The last time I have been so impressed with a book was The Great Gatsby. The time before that, it was The Prince of Tides. This is now the third time I've been wowed by a book (not counting Cat in the Hat, but I was three)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phobia-Inducing Fun!","review":"Cleverly hidden under a bland, clinical-appearing cover, the contents of this book jump from the pages to startle even those with steelier nerves. I was impressed by the well-designed pop-outs, which are vivid, detailed, and often incorporate motion into their design. There's bound to be at least one page that will spook you! Makes a great gift, or a fun coffee table book to entertain an unsuspecting guest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most clever and funny book I've read in a very long time","review":"Beautifully illustrated and written with razor sharp wit, the Pop-Up Book of Phobias is so funny that you'll develop a fear of reaching the end of the book. It's great fun to turn each page and watch several differant phobias come to life right before your eyes. This book will make a great gift,it's probably the most enjoyable coffee table book ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scaredy Cat?","review":"I didn't even have to see this book to know that I had to have it. I heard about it from a friend and ran to the bookstore to get it. When I opened it up, it instantly brought back all those wonder childhood phobias that terrorized us when we were younger. I love bringing this book out when I'm having a party just to hear all the comments made about it. Everyone goes wild to just see the book and it's pop-ups. This is definately a great coffee table book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, but has its flaws","review":"This book is really cool. That's the best way to describe it, I think. The images are clear and the pop-ups are fairly intricate. I really enjoyed the interpretations of the phobias.I did not like the quality of the construction of the book, however. The brand new copy I purchased began to fall apart during the first reading. The binding is not very good and the cleverly done pop-ups simply won't hold up with any sort of regular use. I was also disappointed that the book was so short.In the end, the book was nifty and makes a good gift. Just don't expect it to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is hysterical","review":"I bought this book for my ex some years ago for Christmas. I hadn't thought about it in ages. Someone mentioned it recently and I thought I'd see if it was still available. Imagine my surprise to see that it now sells for $429 new, $125 used. I wish I'd bought a couple.

This, however, is definitely not a book for the younger set, although they would enjoy the amazing pop ups. Your worst nightmares come leaping off every page in an artistic display the likes of which I have never seen. Congratulations to everyone involved in the production of this gem,which should now serve as the benchmark against which all other pop up books will be measured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inventive, Creative, and a little Macabre!","review":"We gave this as a gift to a family member who is a therapist. He absolutely loved it. We sat around and looked at it together and got lots of laughs out of it. The unique perspective of the artist, portraying anything from clowns to germy bathrooms (don't worry, the toilet isn't TOOOO gross if you know what I mean....) There is one page that makes you feel as if you are standing on top of a very tall building........it's very macabre, very hilarious, very intelligent, and yet not the least bit disrespectful of those who actually have the fears. There's one that opens up to a microphone and an audience all staring at you. On the podium is a \\"to do\\" list that has everything checked off EXCEPT \\"write speech.\\" Absolutely hilarious.

Her voice is the same strong yet supple instrument familiar to her fans from other recordings. But on this CD, her distinctive style is submerged beneath the weight of overly busy arrangements, blaring horns, and a less than stellar choice of material.The one exception--and even here, Alexandria has to work overtime to be heard through the band's pyrotechnics--is the first cut, the quirky and challenging \\"You're My Thrill,\\" which a singer of Alexandria's caliber should have been able to make into a classic. It's interesting but, sadly, no more than that.As with the vastly superior \\"Lorez Sings Pres,\\" another King label reissue from the 1950s, this CD comes with no liner notes and no identification of the personnel (though in this case, that's probably a wise omission).I'm sorry to have to report that this CD is for diehard fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all UNION fans","review":"I bought this one on a chance because John Corabi(vocals), Joe Lynn Turner(vocals) and Bob Daisley(bass) were on this. Funny thing is, my favorite song on the cd, \\"I'll Lay Down\\" doesn't include any of them and has a killer guitar riff that is very catchy. Lots of different performers on this cd, usually means it is going to be ok or not so good. Not this time. Even though I'm not rating it 5 stars, it is close because for some reason I just keep putting it back in my car cd player to hear it again. It's nice to have a good rockin cd with alot of different singers, guitars, etc, and have it all blend together nicely. I think if you are a UNION fan you will also like this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Intelligent Tennis, by Skip Singleton","review":"This book reads like the first half of a tennis instruction manual. The author describes basic principles for improving your tennis game, but none of the details of grips, tactics, and other practical guidance. Some chapters read more like philosophy than nuts and bolts instruction. Illustrations are few and not particularly helpful. The most useful pages provide an opponent analysis form and a match critique sheet. By itself, this book would not be a sufficient basis for self-help in tennis. Overall rating: two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay Jay the Jet Plane--Jay Jay's First Flight","review":"Terrible.

This book was a complete waste of my time. It offers no test preparation whatsoever, so prospective CNEs should shop elsewhere. The first 8 chapters of the book are space-wasting drivel that have nothing to do with learning this OS or preparing for these tests. The chapters that claim to cover specific tests instead seem to cover the more obscure facets of NetWare. I have passed 4 of the 6 tests needed to become a CNE and I have done so without any assistance from this book. I suggest people read the CNE Study Guide for NetWare 5 by David James Clarke which is admittedly very corny and reads like an advertisement for Novell at times but is still packed with way more usable information than this book has.

It's kinda hard. too, to find words for how silly this project appears. When these pseudo-monks pick folk hits like \\"Scarborough Fair\\", \\"Don't Give Up\\" or even \\"Tears in Heaven\\" they lose the rhythmic drive of the original, and as they include songs of erotic longing like \\"When A Man Loves A Woman\\" and \\"Save A Prayer\\" (Duran Duran, :-) ) the mix becomes more and more absurd. What kind of monks would possibly sing this selection in real life?

The third edition touches upon non-traditional project management. In other words, project management in real life as opposed to what is in most every textbook.To me the value of the third edition lies in Robert Wysocki's recognition of projects where either the goal is clear but the methods aren't, or where even the goal is unclear. These types of projects seem to predominate in IT. This book is worth purchasing for the insight that the authors bring into the non-traditional non-textbook real-life projects.The prose is clearly written and reads very tightly. Contrast this to the random collection of thoughts in Kerzner's book. This book is written for the practitioner, though someone taking a college course in project management would also benefit.Excellent book, at an excellent price. You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down to the earth","review":"The knowledge offered by the authors is easy to read, yet structured and very applicable in today's chaotic project environment.

Enjoy it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakira, what did you do?","review":"Shakira's first album (PIES DESCALZOS) was really great: feel with emotion, honest, genuine and without any fear of failure... which made it succesful. She now seems to have sold out to the most popular pop styles going on at the moment, forcing her voice excessively and manipulating her latin roots to attract the main commercial market: the USA. Her singing does not sound good in English and she sometimes appears to be a Jewel or an Alanis Morissette wannabe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guilty pleasure","review":"I really don't care much for pop music, much less latin pop music when that crossover explosion happened (which I completely blame on Ricky Martin for creating) but I'll make an exception with Shakira's \\"Laundry Service\\". The first time I actually heard her music was when the music video for \\"Whatever, Whenever\\" came out six years ago. The song was pure ear candy with its infectious pop hooks. So I eventually bought Shakira's \\"Laundry Service\\". Much to my surprise I actually enjoyed the cd. The music is filled with catchy pop/rock hooks without being overly polished. I think the songwriting is kinda weak and at times silly. I thought Shakira sounds the best singing in her native tongue than in english but that's just me. Another flaw is Shakira's vocals which is somewhat shrill at times but otherwise this album is a fun, guilty pleasure of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS","review":"I agree with \\"lima-bean\\", this CD is HORRIBLE.

She's about as comfortable singing in English as Christina Aguliera is singing in Spanish. Proof positive that a woman with a tight stomach and blonde hair can do anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naturally Spanish is beautiful and English is ugly","review":"Shakira was in over her head. She may have had such a tough time turning pretty Spanish into pretty English that this cd lacks the idomatic elements of language and sound that makes English Pop-Rock-soul music the most popular music in the world.Since English uses consonant clusters it is not posible to produce the beautiful sounds that a vowel based language like Spanish permits. Native English speakers and singers use the harsh grinding sounds of consonants to produce rude rock and crude pop. Sonic perfection is not the goal!Sakira will only get better once she understand that noise is what drives English popular music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call it what you want, but it's not music","review":"Shakira's voice sounds like a combination of Buffy St. Marie, Ren Hoek, and Ethel Merman. She obviously doesn't have a clue as to what the lyrics of her own songs about, because no thinking human being could release \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" with a straight face. Anyone with an intellect can figure out that Shakira is just another hot piece of a$$ that's going to be bare-bellied and exploited till the cash cow runs out. Plus, she can't sing. And don't counter with the fact that she's sold 16 gazilion albums in her native language--excrement is excrement...earplugs, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhh....","review":"Ok, this CD is awful! It was given to me as a birthday present and I never had heard of her so I gave it a try and listened to it, and after hearing an entire minute of the first song... I immediately stopped my CD player and took this piece of garbage out. This sucks! I couldn't stand listening to it, mainly because of her awful annoying unattractive voice! she sounds nothing like how she looks. You'd expect her to have a nice sexy, soothing, pretty voice, but sadly she doesn't possess that. someone should put a muzzle on her, seriously. Don't waste your money on this crap. She may have looks, though evidently doesn't have the voice to match!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Shakira...BUT.....","review":"I'll have to agree with Orlando29(reviewer)...this in fact is Shakira's worst album. It's great that she decided to cross over to English...but the music just isn't the same. The lyrics cannot be literally translated. The emotion and passion is completely GONE. The entire album sounds like any generic female artist (you have to admit, some artists are just a bite off other artists). Her voice doesn't sound as beautiful and unique in English as it does in Spanish. Even if you don't speak or understand Spanish, you'd be able to see the difference. The album cover isn't too original either. Guess I'll just have to wait for another Spanish album."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so into this...","review":"ok i dont mean anything bad about shakira... i mean its just an opinion about her music im not here to criticize her or talk bad about her. but just like some1 before me said, its really true that her music sounds better in spanish... in all kinda ways... im not even into this kinda genre of music, but i just had to put my review here after seeing a video of hers now on tv (poem)... ive heard her album 'laundry service' too, and honestly it wasnt that nice (for me)......."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame...","review":"Shakira has done the worst thing she could ever do. Sing in English! Throughout \\"Laundry Service\\", it's clear that Shakira doesn't have a clue what shes singing about, therefore it's pretty emotionless as well as totally boring.

I don't see the merit of selling to the Anglo world if you're going to wear such a mask and in the process deteriorate your music to the point of not being recognizable. With the artist she was before, she already had more than enough. Shakira's real gift can be heard in Pies Descalzos and ?D��nde est��n los ladrones? \\"Suerte\\" is the only good tune in this album. This album freezes her natural gift and turns it into pre-fabricated radio material. I hope Shakira goes back to making music soon. Also, what's with the look? Her black hair was so beautiful as was her simpler way of dressing. I guess she is aiming at an American audience that can't look past the flesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely lady, lovely music, but much much better in spanish","review":"Although Shakira's english is perfect, the music loses somethingin english (like watching a foreign-language DVD with a english voice-overs).

However, those two tracks are very different, which means there's hope for Shakira that she may yet have a few surprises in store for fans.

I decided to try Shakira since I had heard two of her songs before and thought they weren't half bad. So, I bought the CD and I have to say that I'm very pleased. It's very energetic which is nice to have once in awhile, she has a very unique voice though I have to agree with the overall statement that it can be somewhat Celene Dion (sp). Overall, I found the entire CD to flow really well, though some of the songs sound very similar but I assume this is to be expected with Pop. The reason I took it down a star in the rating is simply that the some of the songs sound very similar but that really doesn't take much away from the CD. Either way, I would definately recommend this as a first attempt at Pop. It's not completely pop but it has enough of the elements to let you know whether it's your style of music or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is one of the best, but this one could be better...","review":"Let me start by saying Shakira is one of the best artists I've heard...

I love her Spanish albums, but this one is definitely missing the qualities that made me a real fan of her music. Her incredible voice is really restrained on this album (with a couple of exceptions.) Shakira is at her best when her voice is the central focus, not a bunch of overproduced noise. Also, her lyrics are poor at best and made be actually laugh a couple of times. I realize that English is not her native language, but come on - she needs to do a little better. I am not even going to start on the blonde look. Let me just say that I really miss the Shakira from \\"Donde estan los ladrones?\\" I haven't given up on her by any means, but I really hope that her next album sounds a lot more like her previous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"shakira fan","review":"I love Laundry Service.

Therefore, I love \\"Eyes Like Yours\\", because now I can relate to the lyrics and not just love the song because of the beautiful music. I also loved songs like \\"Estoy Aqui\\" on her old album, and many of her songs in English have that same rock feel. My favorite track on the new album is \\"Objection\\".

As a person of Spanish ancestry I can easily understand her Spanish lyrics. Included are the American radio hits, and some more beautiful Spanish ballads. On \\"Eyes like yours\\" Shakira collaborates with Gloria Estefan and creates an upbeat techno type song. There are many Spanish (Spain) influenced songs on this album which creates a wonderful feeling. Shakira writes all of her own songs, and produces them as well. We need more musicians such as herself in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"The service is dreadful","review":"I was trying to think of a redeeming feature for this album. I found three.1. She is the first Colombian I have heard (and the South American rhythms are there for all to hear);2. The single \\"Wherever, Whenever\\" is catchy;3. Lester Mendez is in the production team.However, apart from those lightweight reasons mentioned, there is nothing positive to write about here. Shakira sounds like a very poor Jewel (note the Lester M link with both artists), the songs sound all too alike and her voice is incredibly irritating.By the end - and I did hear it all - I was laughing at how bad the album is. It is, simply, quite dreadful!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"I was expecting something really great and original after hearing the hype about Shakira. She is a middling singer at best and has only one good song on this album. Most of the songs are simple retreads of better music. She should have spent more time in the studio and with a singing coach. But the album has good production values and good studio musicians. Too bad the material is so weak. This album will be forgotten in 5-7 years but \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" will probably be played on the radio for many, many years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"I only liked one song on this cd and that was #3 Whenever, Wherever. A lot of the songs are in Spanish and I didn't like the other songs that she sang in English. Just buy the single for Whenever, Wherever. I found an import at Amazon.com its ASIN is B00005V8Z1 so just copy and paste it on the search box and it'll bring up the single.

I hope I can be as wonderful, moving and soulful and Shakira. And someday I hope I'll be as comfortable with myself as her. This CD has a permanent habitat in my boom box and has changed my life.

The production tried too hard to sound like a lot of the fabricated teen artists of today.

It just sounds bland and could be mixed in with a lot of homogenized pop artists.But this is her first English album. Maybe if the sales are high for this one she'll be able to put in her own signiture for the next one. But when you're on TRL you have to mesh in with that sound some how.

I never took Spanish in high school, but this CD made me want to sign up immediately for classes. I waited anxiously for the release of \`Laundry Service\`, to hear what her amazing voice would sound like. Unfortunately, Shakira's voice is nowhere to be found on her English language debut. The only times you get a real sense of her gifts as a singer are on the four Spanish language tracks (particularly \`Suerte\`, the Spanish version of \`Whenever, Wherever\`). I was especially disappointed with the English \`Ojos Asi\` - the words did not flow as well into the Arabic stanzas. Overall, the production quality is pretty weak. You can barely hear her voice at times over the percussion and bass beats. A real shame. Let's hope any subsequent English releases are better, because Shakira deserves much better than this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"I can barely understand the english???

I can't say that this cd beats her Spanish one because it doesn't but it comes very and I mean VERY close. Shakira is still Shakira but just in English. She even includes 4 Spanish songs in here that are just amazing! From the hit single \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and \\"Suerte\\" to her tango influenced \\"Objection\\" and \\"Te aviso, te anuncio\\" Shakira is super charged to take on the world! \\"The One\\" is a soft and sweet ballad and is sure to become a classic love song while \\"Fool\\" and \\"Poem to a horse\\" are going to show the rock lovers what Shakira is made of! \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\" is a very good dance song and \\"Que me quedas tu\\" slows it down a bit.

This cd is a must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spunky and original...","review":"This CD from Shakira is really great. Most of the songs, with a few exceptions, are catchy, spunky and original. Although her lyrics in English are occasionally a bit awkward (for instance, \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" sounds much better in Spanish) this is understandable given that it is very difficult to translate songs from Spanish to English. But the freshness and originality of most of her lyrics makes up for their awkwardness.Also, the songs are very energetic and catchy. If you are feeling upset, just turn on the first song, \\"Objection\\" - it is guaranteed to cheer you up. Additionally, as shown by \\"Objection,\\" Shakira does an excellent job of combining traditional latin music, like the tango, with modern rock guitar sounds. The result is a unique and original sound! Anyhow, if you don't have this CD, you are truly missing out. Get it soon, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakira rocks!!","review":"I have not been a Shakira fan for very long, but the first time I heard \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" on the car radio I almost drove off the road.

I loved the first single and was eager to buy it-- but then I heard it.In lots of the songs she doesn't seem to show emotion like any other singer would. I'm not critizing her, but I'm not too sure if she exactly understands what she's saying. She sings at the same speed as if the songs were in Spanish which has shorter words and is easy to speak fast and understand. (I've been taking Spanish for 5 years now). What I mean by \\"no emotion\\" is that if you don't know what you're singing it's hard to sing it like you do and not sound [bad].So if you like the sound and don't mind if it's in another language (even though on this album it's hard to tell it's English) get ?Donde Estan Los Londrados?

Great choice to introduce this baby to the ears of english speaking America. \\"Objection(Tango)\\" is my fav song the ablum, the middle rap part is killer-pure genius. \\"Fool\\" is also my personal anthem of the day(so fab). I like her lyrics, they aren't frilly, they mean what they say and say what they mean. \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" was written by the everlasting Gloria Estefan so you know that one is good, and crank up Shakira's lastest single \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" for a hyper latin power rock pop power ballad.

It is life changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great","review":"Shakira's first English-language album was, in my opinion, very good for her fisrt try- especially since she had just learned the language. The songs may be lacking some of the poetry and I don't know, essence (?) that she's so good at, but what can you expect with it being her first time writing in English? I loved almost all the songs on the CD other than \\"The One\\" (which I just couldn't feel the beat or the words)and \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\" (That one went to slow and there wasn't enough singing). The rest were really cool songs, especially \\"Objection (Tango)\\"- that one is my favorite song on the album (of course, the Spanish version is better. The Spanish versions are always better.)

She is not the next Madonna or Britney Spears, she is original. Her Columbian accent is strong but beautiful in most songs, and the rhythm is very moving. Such songs as \\"Te Dejo Madrid,\\" and \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" (which is a remake of 'Ojos Asi' from her last album) makes the CD worth buying as does \\"Whenever Wherever\\" her first english single.

I heard that she writes her songs in a form of a poem and they supposed to have a hidden message, but I feel since english is her second language, she doesn't make so much sense. Her lyrics in english lose whatever meaning they have.

Give her some points for the few rap verses - some originality involved.Take away Shakira's voice, and you have some great beats, good melody and great dancing material.Hopefully, she may get continue with songs like Ojos Asi (English version in this album).

Instead of great rock you can dance to she is doing an Latin inpersontion of Brittney Spears (okay, she pulls it off quite well, but what about us? her fans who hate Brittney and the sex-kitten pop that has saturated the entire music scene and just like rock?) and left the guitars and the gritty lyrics behind.Quite frankly, I was hoping for more songs like \\"Ciega, Sordomuda\\" and \\"Inventible\\", songs of passion and longing, disappointment and rock; songs you can turn all the way up in your car and scream at the top of your lungs! Didn't happen this time, maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed...","review":"I have to be honest, I was a little disappointed with this album. Shakira is just bombshell. I mean, she's so pretty and it's so brave of her to learn English and make an English album and everything. I just don't really like her style of singing. This is just my personal opinion, but the voice-cracking thing she does gets just a tad annoying. However, you know, maybe that's the common style of singing in her country. I definitely respect that. So, would I recommend Laundry Service? No. However, if you have an extensive CD collection and would like to add some exotic flavor, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakira-Laundry Service","review":"I thought it had a great mix of contemporary sounds and spanish love songs.Am still enjoying the tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder she had only sold 63 copies!

NO WONDER SHE FAILED WITH THIS ALBUM. DONT BUY THIS. IT IS NOT WORTH IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Poor Latin Product","review":"Listening to this album will take you to the land of constant repetition, with only 3 minutes per song as a proof of how mainstream can Shakira be only to acomplish the music label and regular fans.Colombia's poorest pseudrock star comes again with a simple cd full of musical inconsistencies such this 13 tracks, most of all in english (9), in a way to overcome her personal style and to explore the american market. Of course she coudn't make neither.Shakira's Laundry Service is completely a Brainwash Service, the entire album is like a child book to learn how to read, with mediocre lyrics only to prove her lack of inspiration. Only the good job of Ted Jensen's Sterling Sound in New York could save, in sound, the bad music."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewww...","review":"Ewww... she has the worst voice ever!I nearly almost hurled after hearing her song \\"whenever, where ever.\\" One day I was in a clothing store and they had \\"whenever, where ever\\" playing in the store, and I immediately rushed out of store because I could not stand Shakira's voice.

Ev'ry song is worth listening to. Underneathe Your Clothes reminds me of a song that Celine Dion would sing, but it is so great song still! This album is a mixup of Spanish and English, wonderful:-) I've heard Underneathe Your Clothes on the Radio and on the Computer and I heard Whenever, Wherever and said to myself I've got to get this album so I did today at the store. As of ALL of these songs are written by Shakira. Except for one is written by Gloria M. Estafon for the English Version!*! Shakira writes very great songs, I am glad she made this album. Cos it ROCKS!*! My favorite songs are Underneathe Your Clothes, Whenever Wherever, and the Spanish version of Whenever Wherever:-) This album ROCKS!*! So please buy this album today, and don't listen to what other people say. K? Bub-bye!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"English Lyrics, Latin Music, Middle Eastern Flavor","review":"One of the things I love about this CD is the mix of influences--Latin pop, US pop (she's listened to Alanis Morrisette a few too many times, but since I like Alanis I'll forgive her) and Arabic traditional and pop music. It's really surprising to me that people don't mention the Middle Eastern influences in \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and \\"Eyes Like Yours.\\" Hearing a beladi rythym played on that odd hollow-sounding South American wind instrument on Whenever, Wherever is odd, but it certainly gets my hips shaking! Lots of fun for belly dancers and anyone who likes good, danceable pop--including my fiance, who is *really* not fond of Arabic pop but can't stop playing Shakira's Latina take on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"-","review":"Though many people say that her voice sounds better in Spanish than English, I think she sounds almost Irish in her song, 'Whenever, Wherever.'

When I first heard \\"Whenever, Wherever\\" I at first did not like it, but after hearing it again it kinda grew on me and I kept singing it. Songs I keep singing I HAVE to buy. I found out more about Shakira. This is her first english album - that alone made me think maybe I should just buy the single because first times usually aren't that good. But I don't think the single was out at the time so I bought the whole album instead. After listening to it, I developed a likeness for \\"Objection (Tango)\\" \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" and \\"Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)\\" (Which I will admit is the most outstanding!) also for the spanish tracks \\"Suerte\\" and \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)\\".

To add insult to injury, they didn't even bother re-setting the typography or images. Tables are disconnected from the text and the graphics are horrible.I had to buy this book for an entrepreneurship class. Do not buy this book as a reference for Finance or Entrepreneurship. It is a bound collection of student papers. The graphics are horrible, usually badly enlarged clip art or newspaper-quality pictures. It is very difficult to find any information in the book (like relevant cases) because there is no index and the table of contents is after 12 pages of advertisment and boasting by the \\"author\\".If your professor requires this book, well, I'm sorry.

Except for maybe the early CGI on the cover, the album hasn't dated in the slightest (the band members even have email addresses - heady stuff for 1993). To listen to, it's similar to the aforementioned 'Polygon Window' - subtle, arty ambientish techno music with meaningless titles and abstract instrumentation. At times it almost seems to veer towards 'world music', although it's hard to see how the skittery beats and unearthly music could be tied down to a single culture. In a way, this album is a landmark, at least five years ahead of its time, and an interesting insight into a music that would inspire a whole generation of Autechre-esque acts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conceivably the best electronic listening album ever release","review":"The Black Dog seems to catch on a variety of feelings, some more powerful than the average Joe could understand.

These radios have the standard, 14 channels, 38 subcodes, but they also have a scrambling option which isn't foolproof, but keeps most people away. This radio has many options, you can turn all the beeps on, (talk confirmation tone, button press beeps) or all of them off or any combination, the lcd display is well lit, despite what is said at Cobra's website from the dirt and road review. The retractable antennea makes this unit extremely portable, when it's down, the radio is little bigger than a pager. All in all, the best radio out there save two or three VERY HIGH PRICED MODELS, (microtalk3, kenwood, cherokee, each at least 100 a peice.) So, go with these radios if you want a compact, clear radio with more than the basic features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Don't order this item expecting it to be as described.

When I finally got around to opening this particular item, I found that what was shipped was a $1.99 CD from Wal-Mart with a UPC-code on a cellophane envelope which covered up what the product actually was.Shame on me for not getting around to opening the package in time to file a complaint and get a refund, but shame on whoever at Amazon pulled off the switch and/or listed it incorrectly.I am a collector of DVD-Audio discs due to a love of everything surround and was very disappointed.

Great new artist who should only get better in the future. The only thing with Tedashii, is that his voice and style are almost exactly like Solo a.k.a. Da Coach from Gospel Gangstaz. I mean if you listen to those two, you would think it's the same person... unreal. Anyways, that would be the only drawback. Everytime Tedashii is rapping, I was almost expecting Chilly Baby from GG's to drop in his line. But comparing him to Solo is a good thing cuz Solo's got some mad skillz! Otherwise a hopeful young prospect. His longevity will be determined by his ability to remain fluid and fresh and not stereotypical. IMHO.

For instance Lecrae, Trip Lee or Flame. \\"Party Music\\" is one of my favorite songs and I listen to it frequently, But this album could have been better.I like when Tedashii raps faster. When it's slow it's not very entertaining but when it's fast it brings out the real rapper within.On the other hand this album has a lot of great messages and has a great beat through most of the songs.This album is really good and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Screen Free Cell","review":"It takes a few minutes to get used to the screen.

However, even as big a Freecell Zombie as I am I think this hand held \\"version\\" is a useless POS. I find it impossible to differentiate the four suits in any useful way. Yeah, you can see them by squinting but, since there's no color involved to distinguish hearts and diamonds from clubs and spades, it's almost impossible to figure out which card should go where. In addition, and, I think, a problem with all these solitare games, is the fact that you cannot see the entire field of cards so you have no idea where the aces are, e.g., without constantly using the \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" buttons.In short, this game is pretty much for those who are desperate to play Freecell in the WORST way, because this is truly the worst way I can imagine. If you are totally jonesing for a hit of Freecell and you're dependant on your desktop, then get yourself a small laptop.

LOTS OF NICKS, SCRATCHES, PINHOLES, AND THE WORST OF ALL IS THEY DON'T SIT FLAT. NOTHING WORSE THAN A ROCKING CHAIR BECAUSE OF UNEVEN LEGS. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS INITIALLY REALLY GREAT OFFERING ME ANOTHER CHAIR. WHEN IT CAME IT WAS THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE IF NOT WORSE. NOW I HAVE 2 CHAIRS THAT ROCK (AT LEAST 3/8-1/2\\" OFF THE FLOOR ON ONE OF THE BACK LEGS). WHEN I TOLD THEM THIS THEY SAID I SHOULD TRY TO MAKE ONE GOOD CHAIR OUT OF THE TWO DEFECTIVE ONES THEY SENT.....END OF STORY. CRAP SHOOT ON GETTING ONE THAT ALL THE PARTS FIT RIGHT.

This book reveals much of his wisdom considering positional play, in a very practical format.

Especially interesting is the chapter written by GM Bareev on what decision making is genuinely like at the top.

It even drowned out competing music coming from groups nearby. Our iPod sat firmly docked into the unit, and I wasn't worried about it getting knocked around in all the chaos. The sound quality was astonishing and the battery lasted the 5 hours we were there, no problem.I can't wait to take this on vacation - it's really light and compact.

After doing considerable research, I came to the Logitech mm50. This is a fantastic piece with great sound quality, portability, features, and equipment. (I had never come across a piece that came with attachments for any kind of iPod!) The only problem with this item is that the remote, while the size of a credit card, has very short distance. Otherwise, I highly reccommend it, as it is the best in its class for price and features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, worth the purchase!","review":"We believe it is a good value and a good buy considering the alternatives.

The clerk really sold it to me, stating that the speakers were superior to the ihome system. I'm very disappointed with the sound quality. I purchased it to listen to my audio books. I often have to raise the volume to the highest level just to hear the audio, but then I get a terrible screeching noise. This noise is not part of the audio. It sounds fine on my headphones or my larger boom box. Also, I cannot play music with the logitech speakers. There is absolutely no bass at all. It just sounds downright horrible. Furthermore, sometimes the stupid device turns on for no reason (once in the middle of the night). And when I charge it, at times, it doesn't take a full charge. This was a total waste of money. I bought it to listen to audio books in the car, so I wouldn't have to use headphones and risk getting pulled over. Well, I'm back to my headphones. I don't know if the ihome is any better, but save your money with this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"My sister-in-law has these speakers and they work great.

The only thing I don't really understand is that sometimes the ipod and speakers come on by themselves when I ordered it off. The unit sounds great, the battery works and charges well and I take this thing with me all the time. It has given me an opportunity to enjoy the music located on my IPOD that is significant that I didn't otherwise have time to listen to. Great purchase and reccomend the product highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ipod Speakers","review":"I bought this for my wife to use with her IPOD. It works fine. The Speakers have plenty of volume and it is a clear sound. The remote isn't all that impressive. It has a max range of about 12 ft. We have to turn the IPOD on by hand and then the remote can be used to skip or play songs and adjust volume. This is a minor annoyance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Speaker System","review":"The system itself is very compact and looks great. It was quite easy to set up-- you simply select the right fitting for your iPod and plug it in.The speakers sound excellent, especially considering the size of the system (and the low price). The included remote is a nice extra, although it can be pretty unresponsive. Overall, I can recommend these speakers, especially at the low price point. I'm not sure I would have been so satisfied had I paid the original price of $149, but at this new low price, you can't really go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of promise, but doesn't deliver much","review":"I was really excited about these speakers, despite the fact that its battery is built in (I always prefer standard batteries to utilize my own rechargeables - what happens when the battery unit in this goes bad?)But once I received it, I immediately was disappointed. There simply isn't enough volume to fill out even a small room. With so little sound, the quality is almost irrelevant and the usefulness goes to nil. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SPEAKERS","review":"These speakers are incredibly amazing. Before this I had the jbl on stage, which were also incredibly good. But I wanted something that I can play without having to plug into a power outlet and would work on rechargable batteries. I didnt want one in which I would have to put in batteries myself(that is a pain) I did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and im glad I purchased these speakers. Most of the reviews about the sound quality is true. The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also, obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer!! Although the bass im getting out of these speakers was unexpected. Without a doubt I would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage, and are truly portable(can be played without a power outlet, I love that feature). The only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight. Its not a big deal for me. The main thing I was looking for was sound quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries die quickly - even after 4 units!!!!","review":"I have purchase this unit 4 times hoping to get one where the rechargeable batteries would last more 30 minutes with my nano. I have sent each one back and got a replacement. Each one did the same thing. The first charge would last for 8 hrs. Then on the next charge, the batteries would last maybe 30 minutes at most. Once again I will send this 4th unit back. I am done playing now with this Logitech product. By the way, I called Logitech's product support line to get help (a non-toll free number) and after listening to their distorted background music for 10 minutes without anyone coming on line to help, I hung up. I high suggest looking at another set of speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect travel speakers for iPod","review":"I bought it for a trip. The sound is very good considering the size. Clear and smooth midrange. Reasonable bass. The tiny remote works very well for me, in fact I found it to be indispensible, as operating my nano with it plugged in is quite awkward. One unexpected nice touch is that it has a passthrough ipod dock connector that let me copy stuff to my ipod while the it's docked. I typically dislike audio DSP stuff as it distorts the sound, but it works well (widen and deepen the sound field without adding too much to the original sound) when it's in front me. One not so nice touch is that while an aux input is available in the back, a cable is not included (so that you can connect it to a laptop immediately.) Come on, Logitech, these are not your low-end speakers, throwing a cable would make it the package close to perfect. And yeah, it would be nice if the travel case can fit the ac/adapter/charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sound quality","review":"I bought the product based on a review, and listening to it briefly in a noisy consumer electronics store. But the sound quality was so poor that I sold it on Ebay. I don't think you can get good sound quality in this price range.The product did not come from Amazon itself; Amazon acted as the liaison. The retailer has a terrible return policy, which is why I sold it on Ebay"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"Great sound, great price and especially portable. I bought this for travelling-in the car, on the boat, on the beach and wasn't expecting the quality/sound of a $400 speaker set. I was pleasantly surprised by the rich sound and unit itself. Would buy it again in a minute based on price and sound. Only issues are battery wears down to fast and remote is hard to use for people with normal sized hands-fingers are too big to press buttons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for what it is","review":"You can buy bigger, cooler-looking, or better-sounding units, but this one works great for me.

I keep it in my kitchen and keep my iPod going all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth buying.","review":"This is a great little system. We've used it many times whilst travelling (with our Nano and Mini). The sound is great, however, the only drawback is that the charge doesn't seem to last as long as they say it does. It's easy enough to charge, and most of the time we have ours plugged in so it's not a huge problem...I guess we haven't really travelled anywhere that doesn't have an electricity supply. Definitely worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech 970173-0403 mm50 Portable Speakers for iPod","review":"so far soooo good. great sound. big sound for such a little system."},{"rating":"1","title":"After few years of using it...its useless.","review":"I've been using it for several years until the rechargeable battery died, so I can't use it anymore without plugging in at the AC socket.

So I vowed that I will never buy another logitech product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically durable, relatively good sound","review":"I've had my Logitech mm50 since 2006 or 2007, they took a European tour with me throughout 2009 and 2010 and the little speakers are still going strong. I'm quite impressed with the longevity and durability. Their sound hasn't seemed to diminish at all! That said, they aren't extremely loud. They're great for adding a boost to your laptop if you want to watch something away from your normal studio monitors. Are they great sounding? No, but they're quite good for their size and certainly for the price!

Now I am stuck with this 100$ worthless piece of metal to carry around and a very bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"To those who have iPod nano 3rd","review":"Please, don't buy this item! It is very glitchy with 3rd nano! I have two nano's: 1st and 3rd. Remote control works perfectly with the first, but completely sucks with the new one. Fast Forward button reacts completely randomly: it either just ignores you, or fast forwards through a song or two, or in less than 30% of cases skips the song as it should.Trying to return the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portable Speakers","review":"Was looking for multi-use speakers, and these are generally excellent. Fine for music, even in the car, even with road noise, although when listening to recorded books using the battery, the volume seems to drop off fairly quickly so road noise becomes more of a problem. I may be expecting them to do more than they were designed for, but I really dislike the FM transmitter route because of (even intermittant) static & the need for station relocation on trips. Around the house, plugged in or using the battery, the speakers are fantastic.The case is a nice feature--would have given it 5 stars too if it had a handle, and space to carry the iPod itself.The remote is also a nice feature, and works well when pointed directly at front of speakers & from distance of less than 20 feet. Would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It died with light use","review":"Sad to say the Logitech 970173-0403 mm50 Portable Speakers for iPod just died out of warranty.

It's less than 1 year old and the battery has not held more than a 40minute charge for the last 6 months. Would have returned it but have been ill.

On the back cover, the book is rated from beginner to advanced. This book is only for a *beginner*. The book totally stops once you are passed the gui config programs.

We only used two of them at a time, making about four batches of smoothies from each blender once a week, and have already gone through all of them in 8 months! The motor kept burning out on us and the BLADES RUST on the bottom. You really have to look at it when you clean them, it rusts on the back side where the two blades connect. I called BackToBasics and I was told it happened because I submerged it in water. Ah, I just cleaned it and let it air dry. And besides, shouldn't something that is supposed to blend drinks while submerged in liquid be rustproof especially with just a few weeks of usage???? This blender is definitely NOT WORTH IT!

Given that the album doesn't get even close to the complex maturity of later albums, there are some quite humerous and even insightful observations within her lyrics here. Her music is unlike anything heard before or since: a sort of cross between modern musical theatrics and traditional folk presented with a late 70s rock vibe. Once being accustomed to the unusual stylings, there are some very catchy and infectuous offerings here.Best Tracks: Moving, Wuthering Heights, The Kick Inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep, beautiful album by a deep, gorgeous woman!","review":"I remember seeing the Kate interview for the first time (on Sat. morning TV - TizWaz I think) after they showed the Wuthering Heights video for the first time. I had never heard or seen anything like it before - quite wonderful. Kate, still a teenager (17/19?) then, was incredibly lithe and attractive somehow managing to combine the seemingly contradictory qualities of sweet innocence and mysterious, sexy warmth. The songs stand the test of time, they are intelligent and original. Kates unique voice adds yet another unique element. Although I like much of Kate's later work, this album is still my favourite. I think it was the first album I ever bought. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"kate bush. the kick inside","review":"I love Kate Bush's music,and bin a fan since the 80,s.

On this album she's the wacky, gorgeous genious chick next door, blowing minds as she bangs out her dreams on the piano and sings like she just doesn't give a damn.Also one the most kick-ass ensembles of supporting studio musicians you will ever hear. Kick-ass in a wonderfully subtle way. We're not talking Motorhead here!An amazing debut for anyone, let alone a nineteen-year-old. I hope that someday soon, she puts out another album like this, with the warm, almost-live sound of her voice and piano.We'll see. In any case we'll always have this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"This album is so good.

Kate Bush shrieks her way into your heart, singing about her period, insest, dead lovers, everything!!! She was 17 when she recorded this album, but it's very adult, feminine and powerful!

This time Robert Kennedy.If you dissect this book and pick out what you can see is actual fact there isn't much to the book. What is left is mob murders, betrayals, corruption and the like. Not much to the book otherwise. Save your money see if you can get a copy from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensationalist Junk","review":"For the Mob historian there's nothing really new here outside of lotsa pure fiction.

Well, this one does not dissappoint either. Sam Giancana was one hell of a Don. This guy was into everything, but his claim to fame was running the Chicago Outfit once it took control of Las Vegas. Al Capone is all you hear when it comes to the Chicago mob, but other than Tony Accardo there were none stronger than Giancana. Just ask JFK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Stanky","review":"This book reads like it was written by 14 year olds stroking their own egos.

Entertaining and informative to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating, but literature?","review":"I'd like to emphasize the large difference in the two parts of this book. The first part is extremely detailed, so detailed that a lot of the conversation must be made up to fit a general recollection of the incidents. The second part is the alleged involvement in the Kennedy murders. Only prior knowledge of these theories gives any credibility to the claim. However Giancana's story fits quite well with Oliver Stones movie. Although the subject and historical aspects are very interesting the literary value is limited.

I'm surprised Chuck didn't claim that the sun revolved around his brother, that would have about as much credibility as most of the other BS in this book. I'm about 2/3 of the way through and I'm only going to finish it because I want to make sure he really dies in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Likely true","review":"Read this book and was not surprised to learn how brutal the mob is.

I work from home a lot and have to dial into conferance calls. Everyone tells me they can't hear me very well at all through the speakerphone. Also, when I pick up the handset and speak into it, people tell me they can't hear me well so I have to put my lips directly on the bottom slits of the handset. This causes the volume in my earpiece to be way too loud so I have to hold it against my lips, but an inch away from my ear. Absurd! I would have returned this phone had I gotten my act together within the 30 day money back window. (Who knows, maybe I got a defected one and I just think they all work like this.)

Be forewarned, though, that the publishers have made an error (which may exiat in the original edition from which this facsimile is taken, I don't know). Page 372 of this edition is numbered in sequence, but is a repeat of an earlier page. Thus, when you are reading of Sir Joseph's adventures in Batavia in November 1770, you are reprised with a page dated May 1770. Infurtiatingly, you then miss the appropriate page and miss, sadly, the death of Tupia.With that caveat, This is an excellent resource, in some ways better than Captain Cook's Journals (though I feel blasphemous in saying that), and as fien a recreational read as you will find in many a year.

Recommended for anyone who enjoys true talent and great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another treat from Ms Reader","review":"Having always been a huge fan of Ms Readers work, this album came as no surprise to me. Whilst there is nothing new on this album, anyone who is familiar with Eddi's songwriting and musical efforts won't be disappointed. A little bit more emotive than the last album, Angels and Electricity, songs like Adam and the Wanting Kind hit home. Eddi's lilting vocals trip lightly, giving us more of what we've come to expect from her, truly insightful heartfelt lyrics. With so many \\"folk / pop\\" performers out there at the moment, it's good to know that there are some artists you can rely on to come up with the goods everytime. An excellent effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddi still rulz!","review":"Yet another great work by Eddi.

This is the follow up album to their self-titled debut, and is a great improvement on it. For starters, \\"Enola Gay\\" was the major hit off the album - reaching top 10 in the UK. The other tracks are obviously less spectacular, with a mix of good tunes and experimental noises, but overall it's a good effort from the band, with a taster of the great things that came from all the albums that followed.If you do not own any OMD music, then perhaps the \\"Best Of\\" compilation is the place to start. If you already own that, then maybe move to \\"The Pacific Age\\" or \\"Crush\\" next, especially if you're a recent OMD fan.

Sometimes when I pick up the handset to make a call, I don't get a dial tone until I click on the cut-off button.It looks nice, but feels cheap. Even for the slight cost, this phone is not worth the money.

Additionally, the caller ID box is too small and angled in the wrong place. You need to mount the phone about 7 feet up in order to see the screen.

The box was crushed and the box they sent it in should have been tossed 5 years ago, then they blame it on UPS saying they caused the damage. I was told to keep the phone so UPS could look at it because they would make a report to them on the damage, when I told them the box it was sent in was worn out they ignored me and said just keep it, well I still have it 4 weeks later...no refund, broken phone, beat up box, shame on you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this phone: best I have ever bought!","review":"When I purchased this I should have bought several.

The whole thing falls apart somewhere past the middle and gradually becomes a boring chore to read. Unfortunately, I am prone to give a writer the benefit of the doubt and hope s/he will pull it out at the end. Not this time. As I closed the book I felt suckered, though with the knowledge that I had suckered myself.

Saknussemm is aiming higher, harder, louder, wider, farther, and deeper all at once. In a dystopic America controlled by the Vitessa Cultporation, an amnesiac named Clearfather wakes up in Central Park with a mysterious phrase carved on his back and apparent mental powers. Is he the key that will end Vitessa's reign on America? Or is he a timebomb that will destroy us all? As Clearfather journeys across middle America in search of his past, it becomes obvious that Saknussemm is questioning and redeeming the power of the individual in a chaotic America increasingly infatuated with groupthink. Think Murakami and Pynchon on juice. Ambition far too rare in today's literary fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the spirit of PK Dick, Burroughs--and Tom Robbins","review":"I was told by friends that I had to read this book.

I think this could develop a real cult following."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious and fresh with an offensively lazy conclusion","review":"I wanted to enjoy this novel as a whole and although I was captivated in the beginning, I was severely disappointed with the last quarter or so. There were some incredibly complex characters along the protagonist's expedition and then the two additional characters that are inserted near the end are never fully developed and failed to elicit any kind of interest. In addition, there were numerous grammatical errors towards the end of the book and I'm not referring to the very distracting \\"drawl\\" of the female character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REMARKABLE WORLD ALL ITS OWN","review":"This is a book I've been hearing about for some time, and I'm so glad I at last got around to reading it. To say it's a major work of speculative fiction doesn't begin to get to what this amazing work achieves. Some of the action / thriller aspects of William Gibson's writing is here--combined with the humor and absurdism of Vonnegut, but the result is something unique and unto itself. I only give this book 4 stars out of 5 because I think it's ambitions are so very high.

I opened the box right away and find the quality of the pads are terrible compare to the old wee-wee pads. The new box indicates 'New & Improved' 'Now Quilted absorbs 10x its weight!'.

These used to be quilted but are now just stuffed unevenly in one big mess of a pocket. I called amazon to return these and they refunded my $$ and told me to just keep them (but they are useless). Here's the problem -- since they are no longer quilted the pee just spreads out and wets the entire pad and all-to-often the floor too (I also get pee on my hands almost every time I go to pick them up).

Each of the stories revolves around the discovery and union of the true mates. The writing is for adults only but not only are the stories romantic and erotic, but they're funny!Enslaved is best read after reading book 1 in the series, The Empress' New Clothes, and book 2, No Mercy, because it all builds up the hero, Kil, the most emotionally tortured of the Trek Mi Q'an heroes. His angst is contrasted with the plucky heroine, Marty, whose feminist views and attempts to \\"subvert the dominant paradigm\\" - the arrogant and too macho men of Trek Mi Q'an - result in a hot and hilarious romance.A great read for a multitude of reasons, but beware, if you read one Jaid Black, you'll want to read them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding me right?","review":"I don't know...it was just a tad unbelievable that a person who was interested in feminist rights and stayed with a warrior tribe of women would lose her complete mind and accept all of the sharing going on at the Conjugial Ceremonies. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enough with the Groovy...","review":"The strong female protaganist is actually a displaced hippy fresh from a 1960's bra burning rally.

If you've read any of the previous books / writers you'll be bored so its best to avoid the purchase.On the other hand if you have never come across any of the above books / authors and have never read any tennis psychology books then it might be of use.

She has not complained about her wrist hurting since she started wearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Self-titled, but still awesome!","review":"This CD, the first of theirs that I bought, is full of ambient, pulsing sounds and more spiritual-type lyrics. There really isn't much this has in common with their original self-titled, but it is definately worth getting. It introduced me to a new kind of music I'd never heard before and which I now like a lot. One cool note: this album was written almost totally on-line; the members never once met in the same room to perform! If you like techno, get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush Ambient-Techno: What an album!","review":"Wow! What can I say? I have owned this album for 3 years and I still listen to it several times a week.A mellow departure from their first album, \\"Unlearn\\" is less dancy and more groovy. Paul Sebastien and Daniel Lenz have described it as less \\"tech\\" and more \\"organic\\". What a perfect description! This album has a flow to it, rolling from mellow ambient grooves (\\"Secret Life\\", \\"Imagine\\", \\"Chromagnum\\") to more pop-techno undertones (\\"Eye of the Mind\\", \\"Ride\\", \\"PGP\\"). And Paul has one of the smoothest voices to grace electronic music. This album relaxes you while it keeps your foot tapping.Lyrically, the guys move on from the rave-tech culture references in their first album to an exploration of cyber-consciousness. Check out their website (www.bitstream.net/psykosonik/) for lyrics.Bottom line: Buy this album! I've loaned it out to numerous friends and I've yet to hear a negative opinion about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEE Single Greatest Electronic Album Ever Recorded!","review":"It really doesn't get any better than \\"Unlearn\\". I got it the day it came out and I still haven't grown tired of it. Easily my favorite CD, I have probably listened to this almost everyday. I have over a 1000 CDs in my collection and still haven't found one to top this album. Everyone needs to own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some really good stuff!","review":"Unlearn is a mixed collection of ambient synth and dark synthpop interwoven throughout the album....definitely hosts some of my favorite songs. You'll get instant gratification from the first six tracks, the rest had to grow on me, and now every track is excellent.It's too bad these guys aren't still together these days...I'm sure if they stuck with it, they would have some really amazing stuff in the synthpop, and perhaps even the ebm realm. I've seen them on different projects, such as Basic Pleasure Model (founder Paul Sebastian) and Hednoize (Daniel Lenz), but haven't really heard much of either project.I highly recommend for any synthpop fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Did This Come From?","review":"A million soundtrack albums with impossibly fast songs. That was my introduction to Psykosonik. One of those bands that are good enough to churn out generic songs with bleeps and sundry other effects but are forgotten at the end of the day. Shopping impulse and who knows what other compulsion made me purchase Unlearn. And I still ask: is this the same band? Instead of force feeding us with crazy beats, they have opted for subtler sonic textures and melodies. First and foremost come the melodies, the beats are left far behind. WHat is left is an album of tremendous, dreamy beauty that I hope is just the beginning in a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"waking dream","review":"this has to be one of my all time favorite albums. the first techno cd i bought was the original psykosonik cd, and that album blew me away. its good to see that artist can change the way they make and produce albums. their first cd was all about industrial, which lead that cd to be the soundtrack to a video game, excaliber 2049, for the snes. then they paved the way onto the mortal combat scene with tracks that sounded just like the industrial from their self-titled album. i bought this album because it was another psykosonik cd, expecting to listen to another great industrial run, but to my suprise, i heard paul sebastian and very very good ambient. it took me awile to get used to their change, but this is an awsome cd. worth buying by a longshot...run, run to a computer or cd store and buy this, you really won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst watch ever!!!","review":"The watch did not work when it arrived.

The soulful single was a minor hit in the UK, and it's a good example of the Crow's early style.All other songs are non-album tracks, making this CD-single even more interesting.A solid acoustic rendition of \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\", is nice to have; but the her version's of Eric Carmen's old hit \\"All By Myself\\" is the scoop among the \\"B-sides\\".Intersting also to hear one of the songs from her early unreleased album, which supposedly should have included the last track \\"Reach Around Jerk\\". This version is, as far as I know, a re-recording that would have fit in nicely on her \\"Tuesday Night Music Club\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventures in a Yorkshire landscape","review":"This album was, I believe, released solely through a small record store in Wakefield I used to frequent in my youth. An album photo was taken in a park near where I lived. One of the real powers for me of Bill Neslon's music is the way he takes the sights and sounds of his (and my) native Wakefield and transfigures them, weaving images with wonderful, hanting sounds. Although not featured on this album my favourite, Adventures In A Yorkshire Landscape is an audio landscape painting of my native county that is so evocative it always -- ALWAYS -- makes my spine tingle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Avoid.

It has just aboutevery quality you could find in a book, sadness, slight romance, excitement, etc. Plus, it is really beleivable, the character's sister adds some more reality into the book. Though, personally, I would have liked to see the mom around for a while and not get killed off in the first half of the first book, that was rather abrubt, I found this book to be most enjoyable, and its sequel, After The Storm, and I plan to read the rest of the series if I possibly can..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rewie of The whole series","review":"Personally, i think and thousands of others would agree that Heartland is on of the most truly fanstastic book seris ever writtin. They contain, adventure,romance,fear, family and achivenments. Each book that has been writtin so far suits any kind of mood or feeling and is writting in a fantastily realistic way.Amy as a charater is strong, happy, beautiful and kind, the best heroin a book could want. By the way, She is SO lucky in The sixths book(you'll have to read it to find out why!)Ty is Soo Perfect!!!. A turly fantastic seris.

I thought the part when her mom dies was the turning point.It was sad. I also liked that Amy was so devoted to her jobs in Heartland. It was neat how she liked it so much to not let them give up Heartland since it is where she grew up.I would recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartland series","review":"I am a veterinarian and mother who is constantly trying to find books of interest for her (now) thirteen-year-old son. Unfortunately, the series was not a winner with him-his tastes run to science fiction-but it was with me as I bought and read the entire set. From a human relations standpoint, Amy's growth and development as a young adult are spot-on, as are her human-horse relationships. Her development as a budding pre-vet student is also accurate as she learns to interpret the many non-verbal cues from her patients in order to come to her diagnoses. This is a wonderful series of books for any young person lucky enough to share special bonds with other non-human beings, horse (or cat) or otherwise. The series is also excellent for any young person experiencing great loss, because it helps teach how move forward in the face of tremendous pain, how to grow and thrive, not merely survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"The book Heartland: Coming Home, is the best book i've ever read before!

Bossy Lou is always around and she wants to go back to New York. Soon the sisters fight because Lou says to close Heartland down but Amy does not want it.

I'll admit it; I read Black Lace novels for the graphic sex; a story line I can get in a Nora Roberts book. This book had potential with the protaganist torn between her staid, vanilla sex fiance and hot, mind-blowing sex with a studly construction worker. But, I didn't expect the 'fade-to-black' sex romps. Boring, boring, boring. It was also hard to tell what was real and what she was making up. All in all a very disappointing read.

Every single guy in the host club is a bishounen. Of course, Hunny(Mitsukuni) reminds you of a happy go lucky kid, kind of like Momiji from Fruits Basket. Ouran High School Host Club isn't shoujo or shounen ai truly, when truly and deeply looked at, but at first glance through the book, it can seem like it at times. Most of it is sales gimmicks, such as Hikaru's telling his brother Kaoru that he will help Kaoru take off the kimono when they get home. People who are really sensitive to this kind of thing will have a harder time digesting this whole concept. If you can get past it though, Ouran is a satisfying, laugh out loud(especially when the Zuka Club comes in in the 3rd volume), manga that will appeal to shoujo fans, and any kind of bishounen fan alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh.","review":"I found this manga very difficult to follow, the story was not as good as I had hoped it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossdressing again?

What the guys did not know, at first, was that she was a she. Now she has to dress up like a boy to help bring in the dough and pay for the damage she has done. So instead of a boy dressed up as a girl, you have a girl dressed up as a guy. While it has been done before I don't think it has been done so well.

It may be electronic music but the sound is anything but mechanical, with its strangely compelling textures and beats. The mood varies from eerie and distant to weirdly inspirational and delicately moving. The track Silverside even has some muted vocal samples, while tracks like Further evoke the pitter-patter of raindrops and other nature sounds. The tempo also varies: Glitch and Piezo have a fast beat, while Nine and Yulquen are slow and soft. The closest I can come to a comparison, would be to Peter Baumann's Trans Harmonic Nights, and then only to a certain extent, as Amber is charmingly diverse. I suppose one could describe this as classical electronic music, and this album certainly is a classic in more than one sense of the term."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top electronic listening music","review":"The Autechre sound reaches it's apex with \\"Amber\\". Hard, ever-developing electro rythms form a solid foundation where frail, beautiful melodies thrive. Clocking in at 74 minutes, the album is not a second to long. Each of the 11 tracks on the album stands out in its own right, although the best track is saved for last; \\"Teartear\\" is a highly emotional finale to an excellent album. 4 years on from it's original release in the autumn of 1994, it still sounds as fresh as if it was put out yesterday (or tomorrow for that matter).

Autechre takes time to reveal each song to you, allowing you to appreciate each and every sound you hear. The rhythms and melodies blend together very nicely. If you'd like to try Autechre out, this is the album I'd recommend first."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I bought this CD and I was not satisfied what so ever.

It taught me the meaning of words that I didn't want to know. Including the F word. It's a terrible thing that happened to this people, but I am sick of being told that all white people are responsible for what some white people did. I was only 2 when this book was published and wasn't even born when the events took place, but I was supposed to read this in college and feel bad for what \\"my\\" people had done to this people.

I wish there would have been a more thorough description of this item. The stem which screws into the sink itself was too wide. I don't recall there being any mention of the diameter of that piece. When I contacted the seller to return the item, I was told of a $5.00 restocking fee. That fee would have been waived had I ordered a replacement, but there was not a proper replacement offered. I kept the strainers. It would have cost more to send it back than what I had originally paid.

The songs are great and Milton's interpretation is wonderful. Milton's voice is one of the best for those that like listening to a good singer. For those that can understand Portuguese, some lirics in this album contain a very good example of poetry. Besides that, some songs represent part of the historical memory that should be kept for the 70's and 80's in Brazil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best YA Book and Best Play I've Read in Years!","review":"I received the book yesterday, read it in 3 hours, and have decided (unexpectedly) to try to have my class perform this as a play.

Everyone else, please, please, please be sure to read this wonderful book. It will change you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seek is Interesting, Unusual, and SO hard to put down!","review":"This book is really cool. It is about a boy who searches for his father.

This book is really good and I'm recommending it to all of my friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not reconmend this book","review":"The title of the book that I am reviewing is Seek by Paul Fleischman. This book is realistic fiction. This book is about this boy who is trying to write an autobiograpghy by remembering what happened in the past. When this boy tries to find his father, he doesn't find him through people but through air waves.I did not care for the book. I got kind of lost with all the characters and how after every sentence it changed form past to present. I think this book would be ok for 8th graders but you have to be focused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversimplified and many of the points are obvious for someone in the business world","review":"I was not impressed by this book. I have come to expect from Nolo legal advice, and in this book I was expecting advice on navigating the intricacies of the tax status of non-profits. This book does not tell you how to file for 501(c)(3) status, for example. It does not tell you how to draft articles of incorporation or bylaws.This book is more aspirational, geared towards someone with minimal business experience who wants to start a non-profit, and who will have to use the services of lawyers and accountants for the nitty gritty details. The discussion on marketing, budgeting, etc is relatively obvious and trivial from the point of view of someone who has already worked in the \\"for profit\\" world for a while.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Information","review":"I found \\"Starting & Building a Nonprofit: A Practical Guide\\" to be well written and organized. Specifics are given as to what \\"Nonprofit\\" really means and the various levels of growth and success. Each chapter deals with an inportant focus that will help the reader build and organize a Nonprofit from square one. There are hints, cautions, and examples in every chapter. There is also a CD with forms and other useful information. The only drawback I saw was the book didn't include specific and detailed guides for completing your paperwork for a Nonprofit Coporation. You are reccommended an additional book with state specific information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of information +++","review":"My disclaimer: I received this book as part of the Amazon Vine Program.I found this book to contain lots of information regarding Non-Profit Organization.The book is dense and it is for the most part very generalbut with lots of details as each state has it owns guidelines.It describes each step to star and run a nonprofit organization.It contains a CD (a Practical Guide) at the end of the book with useful forms.It also has Appendixes with checklists on the different topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the book this one is advertising","review":"Several other reviewers have already posted the truth about this book. It is an advertisement for another book. There are at least six headlines talking about tax-exempt status and none of them tell you anything. I have given it two stars because it does have some limited use as a paperweight. Sorry Nolo this is not a good effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information but lacks some key information","review":"I am usually a fan of Nolo books and this one is no exception. It has a lot of good information on starting up and running a non-profit company. What it lacks, though, is the information one needs to file for and obtain federal 501(c)(3) tax exempt status as a public charity. And, depending on what state you live in, there may be additional requirements for obtaining state tax exempt status as well. Nolo's \\"How To Form A Nonprofit Corporation\\" would be a good companion book to this one if you also need assistance with the incorporation and tax exemption processes."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the Mancuso \\"How To Form A Nonprofit Corporation\\" instead","review":"Very simple, and not very useful. I bought this first, thinking it was the cheaper Nolo Nonprofit book. In the first few chapters there are at least 6 or 7 little comments \\"*NOTE: SEE MANCUSO* for more information\\". So many notices that it reads like an ad for the Mancuso book. On that point, I agree, Mancuso is much more detailed and helpful.The 'forms' provided on the CD rom are only computer versions of the checklists that are printed at the end of each chapter. Total waste of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough guide for the startup non-profit.","review":"Found this manual and companion CD an excellent resource while I am in the process of converting a community organization into a non-profit. Aside from the practical advice of what you need to know, it also provides a warning for mistakes you must avoid.Thoughtful, concise and essential. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and easy to read","review":"This book takes the reader from the first steps of creating a nonprofit to maintaining a successful one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent","review":"I thought this book was extremely violent for young children.

My old Phonemate sounds much better and has a longer range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on MA bell, what happened to Western Electric?","review":"The worst cordless phone I have ever owned. It buzzed. Its sound quality sounded like the PA system on a comercial jet.

A piece of crap I returned it promply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I wanted the \\"all in one\\" phone.

How embarassing!AT&T / Lucent should be embarrased on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone stinks","review":"This phone cannot hold a charge and is constantly cutting off, despite good batteries, etc. The answering machine messages are often completely inaudible and if the caller speaks softly, the machine automatically stops recording mid-message.

The phone itself is too small. 2. If you have it off the charger for more than 10 minutes, it won't make a call out. You have to put it back on the charger. 3.

The phone unit is too small and is not comfortable to hold or to have resting on your shoulder. If you have big ears and hands, this phone will be intolerable.2. On several occasions, I'd dial a number and as soon as the other party picks up my phone would shut off. I shouldn't be having these problems.3. I can't use the phone and answering machine at the same time. Sometimes when I get a message, I like to dial the number as it comes off the machine. At other times it's important for me to share messages with others. This phone does not allow for either use.4. One good feature is that even if your electricity goes out, your messages are saved and can be retrieved later on. During a power failure, however, this phone does not work.Unfortunately, I don't recommend the purchase of this phone.I hope Lucent Tech/ATT product designers read these reviews so that they could come up with better products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems, problems, problems","review":"1. Phone and base ring alternately, which is VERY ANNOYING! I should have returned the phone for this problem alone, but now it's too late2. Can't answer the phone right away: After pressing talk on the phone, you have to wait several seconds before the phone \\"works\\".3. The microphone on the handset no longer works; I just had to return it. This is really annoying because they can't service it locally - you have to mail it in and be without an answering machine for two weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good answering machine but lousy phone","review":"It takes seconds for the phone to turn on, and you can't actually pick up from the base station, without the headset. We're returning the phone, because it's just too annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small...beeps too loud","review":"I had a previous AT&T 900mhz phone, which was world's better....but this one is just too small. The speaker is too small, the unit is too small, and it is difficult to lean the phone against your shoulder while talking. The sound wasn't all that great either....AT&T overall is a good phone company, but this is better for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We have always purchased AT&T phones for their reliability but this phone has been disappointing.You can turn off all of the ringers on the phone, but when someone calls and leaves a message you still hear their voice as they speak to the answering machine. I like to have the phone off when my toddler is napping so it doesn't wake him, but this phone won't allow me to eliminate the sound of a caller's voice (unless I turn the answering machine completely off and don't record incoming calls).I've also found that the sound is very fuzzy with both the reception and answering machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Answer delay maddening","review":"This phone requires that you guess when to say 'hello' after picking up the receiver because of an inexplicable delay circuit. Often the caller hears some fragment of 'hello' if you guess wrong and doesn't know what's going on. You have to reset the clock every time there is a power outage. Outgoing message quality is poor. If you attempt to delete one message of a group sometimes all are erased.

Jeri Taylor is my absolute favorite, and I know her writing style will be missed on the new season of Voyager. I hope she continues to pen the novels, because her stories are magnificent. We are given a clear view of Janeway in this book. The story may make a few leaps, but the path is still direct from child to captain - to television, in fact, because some of the \\"facts\\" in the book have been related on screen. I shall re-read often."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Worthy","review":"Oh my God! I am a faithful Voyager fan and LUV Kathryn Janeway. There is just something about her character that intrigues me. My friend has this book (it's her only Voyager book) and she's been reading it since December. I also own this book, and I can find only one complaint. That Ms. Taylor didn't go into more detail about her life. Oh well. What she did go into was like peeking into a Christmas present before Christmas. You don't know what's in there but whatever it is is sure to be wonderful. This book shows the sides of Janeway that we've already seen in other characters. It shows her as a daughter, sister, lover, captain and student. I admit that I cry easily, so I was an emotional rollocoster with MOSAIC. * there are no Voyager fans where I live so if you're a fan and want someone to talk to please e-mail me!*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it","review":"I really enjoyed the book, I thought a whole book about her background might have been better, but it was well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insight full to Janeway's Life","review":"This book insightfully gave Voyager fans an understanding to how Captain Janeways life inflenced who she is on Voyager. It out lined her life from youth to what drove her into being a command officer. Very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, okay writing","review":"As a huge Voyager fan, I bought this book to help me go through withdrawal when the series ended. I found the story of her life fascinating - I couldn't put it down once I started reading - and even non-Trekkies would find the story a good one. Knowing her background really helps understand the decisions she makes on the show, however from a literary standpoint, some parts are way too predictable (especially Hobbes). My only real complaint is a lot of the transitions from Present to Past, and Past to Present, are really bumpy and left me rolling my eyes. Other than that it's a great read and anyone who loves the character Kathryn Janeway will read it many times over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor brings Janeway to life as only she and Mulgrew can.","review":"I absolutely adored this book! Kathryn Janeway is my over-all favorite Star Trek character, and reading Mosaic was like crawling inside her mind and seeing the universe from her perspective. This book is a magnificent journey that takes the reader through the life of Janeway from early childhood to commanding a starship a lifetime away from home. The story explores Kathryn's strengths and weaknesses, her passions and her fears. Even her first love. It was so wonderfully Janeway that I could hear Kate Mulgrew's voice in my head speaking the lines as I read them. You can't read this book and not love Captain Janeway when you're finished.This novel depicts the warm and wonderful Janeway that we saw when Jeri Talyor wrote for the show in the earlier seasons. (Oh, how I miss her.) Taylor is a magnigicent author, and she proves it yet again with Mosaic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, lots of information, easy to read","review":"Once again, Tanenbaum sets the standard for computer textbooks with Computer Networks.

I can not praise enough for the book, this is truely one of the best book ever written for the subject. Stalling book was also very good. I strongly recommend both for everyone.If you want a more advanced topic, you may look at Daniel Minoli's Delivering Voice over IP and Delivering Voice over Frame Relay and ATM, this is a more advanced and up-to-date, but make sure you have this and Stalling's books as your backup. I am sure you will need them to refresh the basic concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tenenbaum has disappointed","review":"I am a great fan of Tenenbaum. Before this book, I studied three of his other books. The best being \\"Modern Operating Systems\\". But here Tenenbaum has produced a pathetic book. The chapters are not well organized at all. Too much information bunched together. Networking is a lot of mathematical stuff; and this book is theory oriented. The book could be considered okay as a reference book. But to consider this the sole book for networking knowledge is a big mistake. Plus, the book is too expensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most worthless college text i have ever read!","review":"This book is long winded and overly detailed. The text is written with an arrogant tone stating the answer is \\"obviously\\" this or that. The examples are hardly explained and the chapter questions are better answered by OTHER texts that i have on this subject! This text is an excercise in frustration from begginning to end. Do not buy this book. Avoid this book at all costs. $81.00 will buy two or three other books that are FAR better and you will get more use out of them. Trust me. You do not want to torture your brain with the textual vomit contained within the pages of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad print job: eyestrain headache","review":"The print quality is amazingly poor. Looking closely at the characters, there are small divots around the edges where they weren't fully inked. The overall impression is of ragged, weak, and somehow slightly disorienting text. It is an annoying chore to read. (I've seen many copies in many bookstores: they are all the same gray-on-off-white mess.)The content is excellent. It's surprisingly up-to-date for a book published in 1996. The occasional use of calculus is illuminating, though the occasonal code dump is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Networking information right at your fingertips.","review":"In networking you have to understand certain concepts and those concepts are crucial to becoming a valued network technician. I have seen or read many books on networking but until now I hadn't read one so detailed.This book literally takes a chapter for each layer of the OSI model and breaks it down. Starting with the physical layer and then to the Data Link layer which has chapters for the 2 sublayers as well.You'll see where protocols fit into what layer, how security is affected at what layers, where routing algorithms figure out paths and which protocols to use. The author simply amazed me with the amount of information this book covered.The book covered it all including IPv6, Java, ATM, FDDI, Routers, SLIP, HDLC and so much more. This is certainly a great addition to my personal technical library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Networks classic!","review":"Tanenbaum's Computer networks book is \\"The Book\\" the canon of computer networks books so you have to buy this book if you are interested in Networks, this is not a book for beginners so you have to know about some mahtematical knowledge like fourier series and those stuff..."},{"rating":"1","title":"For BSEE grads who knows zero but needs to show off","review":"It's okay to be technical..but it has to be complete too! The book seems unclear on who should be reading it. It mention things like Fourier Series but does not explain it in detail. If you're a business person who deals with networks and just want detailed knowledge this is too much. If you are an advanced engineering student, you really don't need anyone to tell you how to compute the wavelength. If it's meant to be technical...it's not technical enough. But if it's meant to be easy reading...it's too technical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I was made to read this book in Computer networks course. At first it was a difficult read but after a few times I got used to author's style. This book is very detailed on Network and Transport layers specially congestion control. I realize that most networking professionals miss that nitty gritty of the subject as they learn things from very applied side.I highly recommend this book for students and professionals alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too mathematical and theory-oriented","review":"Unlike Tanenbaum's other books (Computer Architecture, and Operating System Design); this book is tough to read (compared to other data comm books) and covers lots of theory.If you are looking to write a thesis, this book might be for you. If you really want to work in the communications field, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for fast reading","review":"This book seems to be fine if you only want to read it as an introduction, and never use the small details there.It has many mistakes in it, and the application layer chapter is outdated and wrong.Try to read any of the chapters anywhere else (like the Kurose & Ross book), and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT SCENICS - POOR VIDEO","review":"The scenes of the Grand Canyon are spectacular and very moving. The music is nice too, if you like that kind of ethereal, av-ant guard type music.The video quality is very poor.

Good to know that the product has no chemical. It has gentle scent that I like. Unfortunately, it's not so comfortable to be used as a hydrating water cause the spray is too strong. It doesn't come out fine and misty which I'd expect and once you spray it, the water trickles down your face.

I did find a couple errors though. In the beginning of the book they said that the anitchrist's name was Charles Grant Morrison and then after the flash back it was changed to Richard Grant Morrison, it really confused me and took away from the enjoyment of the book.And why did he choose Grant Morrison, is he a comic book fan as well?Other then the few spelling errors it was a pretty smashing book, interesting story and I dug his language that he used, yea it was full of \\"f\\" bombs but so is every Quentin Tarantino movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal Portrayal, Gratuitous Writing","review":"Having read the reviews prior to buying this book, I was quite interested in reading this book. Previously, I had read the Left Behind series, and was looking for something with a little more realistic portrayal of what is to come.While I think that this novel accurately portrayed the horrors that are to come, the language and depictions of violence were completely gratuitous. And the book was horribly edited, as there were numerous grammatical errors throughout.I would also recommend Joel C.

Let me save you time and a few bucks, don't get suckered by this charlatan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Behind ripoff - adds profanity - achieves only tedium","review":"Amateurish and filth-ridden story of the last days. Clearly the author is trying to capitalize on the success of the Left Behind series, and indeed he achieves the level of dullness that characterizes the *later* books of that series! Also, the author unleashes a blizzard of profanity (is this the author's idea of realism?) at the innocent, bewildered and bored reader, a blizzard which starts on page 1 and does not let up until the end. Many readers will not stay the course, and indeed there is little reason to do so.I can't comment on the biblical accuracy of this book, but I can comment on the accuracy of these reviews. They are written by the author's buddies! This book is unreadably bad. DO NOT waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troubling, disturbing... really, REALLY not worth your time","review":"There are better attempts out there at portraying the Biblical notion of Armageddon. The writing is flawed, the lurid and wanton sexuality (and really, what we're talking about here is the very disturbing scenes of rape, bestiality, more rape, and still more rape) are highly unnecessary, and the graphic nature of the novel will leave most disturbed.I gave it two stars because there's a wonderfully described scene in which the main character gets the mark of the beast - but the book is not worth it. If you get off on rape, bestiality, and torture, then you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story; Too much foul language","review":"I have to say for starters that his book is a whopping slug to the gut. Realistic as I ever imagined the rapture to be and I say the author hits the mark on situations created within the structure of the story, but the foul language was way overboard. Believe me, I work around some rank individuals with potty mouths to make a sailor squirm but this main character was not believable in the bad language department. Mainly this is for adults only and really should have a hard R rating, but I did like the book and the ending is just jaw dropping. Those who finish this book will most likely be reading Revelations ( if they haven't already) and start looking for the signs of things to come. Chilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre book (at best) with baffling amazon reviews","review":"The plot is mediocre and the prose vulgar. The ending was predictable and a let-down, though I wasn't sure I'd ever get there because of the tiring profanity laced through each paragraph. I'm not a moral high-grounder, a censor of speech, or an objector to profanity - but the author seems to go to great extent to ensure the language is overly crude. The story kept my attention relatively well, and the plot moved on at a decent pace. However, it doesn't merit any of the gleaming reviews I read (which motivated me to buy and read this book). Overall, there's a large variety of books out there far superior to this one. Don't waste your time, money and energy on this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diffirent kind of apocalypse","review":"This is the only apocalyptic novel I've ever read that really looks at the individual instead of at the larger events. Caldwell does, obviously explore what's happening in the ending world, however, he chooses to focus mostly on how that affects one individual man. In doing so, he succeeeds at creating a mutli-demensional character who is riviting. This is a very intimite, personel novel and I found that I just could not put it down. It was excellent and I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, Mr. Caldwell","review":"I began reading this book today, and was really getting into it until I began page 90, where Mr. Caldwell writes \\"For every....Jesus, a Bundy, Reagan, or Pol Pot.\\" I stopped reading right then.To compare Ronald Reagan with one of the bloodiest mass-murderers Asia (or indeed the world for that matter) has ever seen is just plain infantile partisan stupidity. I would expect such drivel from leftist propagandists such as Noam Chomsky (who defended Pol Pot), but I would bet you money, Mr. Caldwell, that most Christians (indeed most Americans) would vigorously disagree with your comparison.Shame on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"funky classic WaxTrax-style industrial at it's best","review":"produced by the folks at Warzone, this album shares its sound and feel with Die Warzau's \\"Engine\\" (an excellent album itself). although this album isn't your typical SMG, it still stands strong as an excellent foray into more experimental and classic industrial styles.

Sounds, at times, like an emo Elvis Costello (especially on \\"Of Course We Will\\"), but with much less wimp nerd whining. Impressive power chords shift effortlessly into melody. There's a wide variety of song types. Even has a romantic ballad (\\"A Million Hearts\\"). I usually skip over the slower ballads, but this one held me due to the heartfelt delivery. The title track is an acoustic quickie that seemed out of place until I got the joke. The rest of the songs all rip, with sharp time jumps, clear guitar chords, and emotional singing. Great party, pogo style music with more inventiveness and experimentation than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"O-Mi-God!!!","review":"all i have to say is WOW! i mean i saw UFB in concert in houston with the impossibles who are GREAT! but when i got home, i popped in the cd that i bought, and it is amazing! they're the greatest band, yet they're so unknown! come on everyone! tell all ur friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good, if you like radio alt. rock like weezer and greenday","review":"but just not that interesting, theres just nothing new here.

The other tracks are just \\"great.\\" UFB combines hard guitar and bass with pounding drums and McShane's smooth pop-like voice. Like I said, I have seen them live a few times and Eric beats the... out of the drums! You can hear it on every track and it's not just your basic dum-dum-tap, I mean he goes off - lots of stop and start too. Nick keeps things moving on bass and I imagine adds most of the humor to the band. Are you ready to rock?

Every time these guys are close, I try my best to see them (even driving over an hour). Their live shows rock, and they are the most personable guys from a band I have ever known.

Of course, a metal to metal connection must be sturdy, right? The release mechanism broke and the tiny ball bearings fell out in five minutes. I fixed it, only to watch five minutes later as the weight of my three keys and one plastic fob break the mechanism. Great idea, if it was reliable. Maybe I bought a defective one, but be careful with the keys you place on these rings because half of them may not be there when you go looking for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I purchased this to use with pepper spray. The pull apart key ring is a safety feature I won't do without. I can easily put it off my key ring if I need to, or to use the pepper spray quickly and noiselessly (without keys jangling).

I bought this one mostly for it's size. I didn't want anything too big. Even with some of the bad reviews, I decided to take a chance. I would only be detaching it four to five days a week, I would make a point of being gentle, and figured with only a small mailbox key it wouldn't see a lot of wear-and-tear. Unfortunately after only two months of use the release mechanism fell apart. One of the ball bearings was dislodged and lost. It instantly became useless to me because it would no longer hold together.It's a good idea, but just not sturdy enough for such use.

This does it's job and seems pretty sturdy.

Once in the open position, the water trickles out at VERY slow rate. To get the water faster you would need to suck on the bottle which looks quite foolish, but is also ineffiecient as there's no vent to release the vacuum you create.

It has the same nice quality as all other Sigg products I used so far. The sport top is much more handy when one wants to take some sips from time to time without the risk of spilling anything.For consumption of larger amounts at a time, the conventional Sigg screwcap may be more convenient, as the sport top does not deliver as much flow. It is a bit more difficult to clean due to the sophisticated mechnism and different parts it requires. I would not not feel comfortable using it for sticky/not well soluble drinks like milk or so as it them would require aggressive cleaning procedures to fulfill my longing for hygiene.In a nutshell, it is a very good (and stylish)water bottle for sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bottles","review":"I got this bottle for my son but it did not come with the sport top it came with a regular screw top and it was not plain aluminum it has the red plus on the front.

I learned a great deal about India's historical and religious cultures and more than I wanted to learn about Afghanistan and Kabul. I can't give it five stars because once you're almost 2/3 through the book goes into such drudge of political detail it almost makes you want to give up on the entire novel. There's a sort of finale 1/2 - 2/3 through, and after that the story becomes arduous to get through with too much detail of the military actions of Britian into Afghanistan.

Her (M.M Kaye)knowledge of the Indian psyche is astounding, I can almost smell & taste the India of the 19th century. My heart ached & I was moved by the intense love between Ash & Anjuli. I felt their moments of joy & despair, Ash's confusion of which society he belonged to & Anjuli's unselfish love. I hope Ms. Kaye would consider writing a sequel (I know, it's asking too much).

It is at once a heart warming and moving tale of love and the struggled to find acceptance in prejudiced world of the 1800s. Interestingly, much of the struggles the main protagonists experience are real feelings that we have all experienced at some point of our lives and can relate to.MM Kaye has done a wonderful job of blending facts and fiction to produce this masterpiece which one could almost believe as a true story! The details have been superbly chosen and balanced with the storytelling, in such a way that the reader doesn't tire of reading the book.On a side note, I found the book to be a little dragging after about 85% as most of it is concerned with describing the 2nd Anglo-Afghan War and secondary characters rather than the main ones.Also, I had downloaded the Kindle version which I noticed has typographical error which were not corrected.Still an awesome read, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best!","review":"I first read Far Pavilions as a teenager and it is still my all time favorite. I remember my sister drove me 40 miles to a book store so I could buy it-in hardback no less. I don't know how many times I have read the saga of Ashton and Anjuli, but each time I find myself carried away and unable to put it down! M.M. Kaye develops characters so completely, and somehow immerses the reader in the story. It's amazing! Other sagas worth reading include the Shadow of the Moon and Trade Winds. For some lighter fare, try her Death in... series.

Of the many texts and books one has available if you've any interest at all in the eastern culture, romance, chivalry, chance and justice - this is for you. While this is my third reading, it is as the first. The clear pictures of the country, the smells of food from the bazzar and the emotions of the characters, all are vividly portrayed for the reader to escape into. I suggest reading the book before seeing the 1984 for tv release movie - DVD is not as good and has been cut in several spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pointers on \\"Automatic\\"","review":"The Pointer Sisters can smoke the stage. \\"Live At the Opera House\\" is a great live album (though it might not appeal to fans of \\"Slowhand\\" and \\"Neutron Dance\\" -- it's the Pointers BEFORE they went disco, when their act was about to be pinched by Bette Midler). This \\"Live\\" album is mainly the Pointers as funk divas, but its mouthwatering track listing is ruined by a pedestrian band, plus arrangements and vocals that are never better than functional, lacking all soul and inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE CAREFUL","review":"I WANTED THIS CONCERT SO BAD AND WHEN I GOT IT, IT WOULD NOT PLAY IN ANY OF MY 3 DVD PLAYERS.

The quality of writing varies greatly. This is a short book that seems to be written to impress the reader with how smart the authors are.

It certainly does offer an alternative view of what happens \\"after death,\\" than we get from mainstream sources.

Unfortunately, this author hasn't read any. Her \\"glimpses\\" of the afterlife don't ring true and her description of Princess Diana's personality is equally off base. I was disappointed because I thought this would be a book I'd love. Instead it just made me cringe.

You can do so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at the life and death of Princess Diana!","review":"I was initially skeptical when I first stumbled upon \\"In Her Own Words\\" recently while researching the topic of reincarnation. However, this book quickly became one of my all time favorites as I listened to the voice of Diana, Princess of Wales, talk about her death and what happened when she crossed over. This book is an absolute must read for those interested in life beyond the physical world that we know so well. Everything Diana said resonated with me and I found myself nodding my head in agreement as she talked about her life review and the levels of heaven. I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Ed Piccolino writes:","review":"Lepsinger & Yukl have written a highly readable book that very effectively integrates the most recent and important research findings about effective leadership practices and competencies. The book provides a very useful, pragmatic framework for executives (and consultants who assess and coach leaders) -- it really offers a roadmap for balancing competing demands and trade-offs that are critical to success, and very effectively makes the point that one needs to consider processes and supporting systems -- in addition to behavioral skills, to ensure success. I especially like the way the authors emphasize what can and can't be learned about leadership, and how they resolve the historical debate about the relative importance of leadership vs. managership -- arguing effectively that \\"leaders need to be good managers, and managers need to be good leaders.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first mystery","review":"This book concentrates on the male detective rather than Lydia Chin.

After the release of the first three Nitro Praise volumes, NP Christmas was released & as it's predecessors, it filled a void that christian music suffered from, renewing the spirit of worship with classic holiday re-done in classic Nitro Praise style. An excellent selection is put together & carefully executed to weave a beautiful sonic portrait of the spirit of Jesus & a new appreciation is born. In \\"Oh Holy Night\\", the emotion rises like a gentle giant, & in \\"Silent Night\\", a cool, R&B tempo sprinkled with the glistening sound of sleigh bells conjures a curious & satisfying nostalgia; as if we were there the day He was born. Either way, you can bop your head, & praise God like you never have before."},{"rating":"2","title":"For My Mother: A keepsake of Thanks & Memories of Growing UP","review":"The books were exactly what I wanted.

That aside it really set the mood for a wonderful journey.The album juggs along like a train, with not a great deal of varience in tempos from track to track, except for the beautiful \\"Tounge\\", with its haunting guitar chords.I'm not a fan of dance music in general, but this goes beyond todays norm. it is deeply set in groove, layers, and atmosphere....I'd even chance saying that Underworld, have been listening to alot of German band , Kraftwerk.Their approach is much like Kraftwerks', layering sound onto sound over a course of time, nothing rushed, finding the best mood, and balance, holding onto it, then slowly letting it go.Highlights, \\"mmmmm Skyscrapper i love you\\"......\\"Dirty Epic\\", and \\"M.E.\\"The is truely a great ride, for any state your in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Underworld release.. just read all the 81 reviews.","review":"82 with mine.But really, if you come this far to amazon.com and are thinking about buying this album..you might as well go ahead and do so. I mean, this album is really well put together. The production levels are very tight. Every single sound seems to go well with each other and as the tracks progress they keep adding more and more sounds. This is probably one of the best dance albums ever put together, IMO it just truly captures what dance music is really all about. You can interpret that in whichever way you want but I have been listening to dance music for a long time and this cd still gets played even up until now 2003. Simply a gem of an album. Dance music never sounded better in 1994 and the best thing is that they do this ALL live...not just pushing buttons. There is guitar rifts, synths, piano, samplers. etc etc.IMHO This is what the future of music would be like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staggering...","review":"I heard \\"Dirty Epic\\" off the TVT Records sampler \\"Afterburn\\", and it literally changed my ENTIRE musical focus from Industrial/Goth to Ambient Electrinica.

There is no way to praise this album too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album deserves eight stars, and YOU KNOW IT!","review":"This has got to be the only album that every person on the planet must own! If you're thinking of buying an album today, GET THIS ONE! I've had it for 4 years, and I still hear something new EVERY time I listen to it! GOD BLESS THE UNDERWORLD! Don't hesitate. JUST BUY IT! I began my Underworld collection with this CD, and it's grown to nearly every release--I might add that this purchase probably won't be the last Underworld album that you buy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unquestionable Genius at Work","review":"This album has a sound and a feel not found anywhere else. Underworld's Dubnobasswithmyheadman shows that they have the ability to create music that can completely captivate and transport the listener. The well-known \\"Cowgirl\\" (form the Hackers soundtrack) is an excellent dance floor beat, while \\"Mmm, Skyscraper I Love You\\" is a long, tripped out, hypnotic journey, and \\"Dirty Epic\\" sounds like it could have been made by Depeche Mode (except, again, a little trancier). This album delivers from start to finish, without the need to skip over any tracks, because they are all amazing. This is, in my opinion, Underworld's best work, although it's hard to compare because all their albums sound so different. A deffinite must-have for anyone who likes electronic music and a good purchase for any music fan in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"underworld, beaucoup fish","review":"I guess that underworld not being a top forty band is a good thing. They have the elements within their music to go that direction but that would spoil it for those eccentric types who can bask in their novelty. The rest of the world will one day look back at groups like Underworld and Orbital and say welcome to the twenty first century music revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brlliant. The best techno of this kind, but...","review":"I feel a little bit uneasy when I hear their weird Japanese voices. Apparently they tried to translate some of the English phrases in there into Japanese. The phrase, 'Can you hold me in your dream?' should not be 'Anata no yume ni watashi wo tamoteru?'. It does not make sense and is grammatically wrong. I would put, 'Anata no yume no naka de watashi wo daitekureru?' For most listners that do not know Japanese, this may not matter at all, but unfortunately I am a native Japanese speaker. Pitty becasue Underworld has created such a cool ambient.I would be happy to do proof-reading for Underworld if they would like to use Japanese words again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory Electronica CD","review":"Underworld's debut, Dubnobasswithmyheadman, was released in 1994. It is still regarded by many people to be one of the best techno/electronica CDs of all time. Although they have had strong follow-ups especially with Second Toughest.., this is their masterpiece. It is a very mellow CD with throbbing beats that sorta reminds me of Leftism although Underworld's flows better than Leftfield's CD. It is really hard to pick a favorite track because they are all amazing. However, track #2, MMM Skyscraper I Love You, is one that rivals Orbital's Halcyon + On + On in its beauty, as it is over 12 minutes of listening joy. If you have never bought this CD, then you need to make your next buy to be this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pefect Match for the Mac Pro","review":"Already formatted to work with Time Machine. Has Firewire 800. Lookes great.

The only thing that was a bummer was that Shaggy redid the Luv Me Luv Me song. Sorry but it doesn't sound half as good. Why did Shaggy replace Janet? Janet is the only one I can picture doing the song. I have never heard of the girl who sings this with him, but she sounds like her voice is cracking. Oh well...everything else is just amazing.

I thought it would be good because I liked the songs \\"It Wasn't Me\\" and \\"Angel\\". This is a really bad album.

You aren't missing anything by not owning this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, Pure genius","review":"This is great for listening to, dancing or both.

Honey let me tell you owning this album doesn't make you cool. It's mindless ska rhythms, and a warbling voice to go with it. None of the songs on here are good. I'd give this a zero, but there's no rating for zero. I heard some of these songs on the radio like \\"It Wasn't Me\\", and \\"Angel\\", and I'm like \\"What's music coming to?\\" From the late 90's up till today music just hasn't been the same. This will definitely in my opinion go down as the worst album of this decade. I know that Shaggy was a Marine, so I just want to say \\"Semper Fi\\", but this album is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slimy","review":"I don't listen. When \\"it\\" (the song? comes over the station or happends to come across the mtv), I turn the station to something else. 2 1/2 of every 5 songs(?) need to be dumped for nothing; just leave a blank space to have some young mind THINK about what could be really out there; buy it you must be crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you could rate it zero stars....","review":"I would have!It amazes me that someone with such little vocal talent and writing skills can be so popular! Every last one of the songs on this album will make you want to stick a pen in your eye. In fact, you'd probably be better off with the pen. I wish I had never received this as a gift, but thank goodness I didn't spend any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial pop nothing else...","review":"First of all, I hate his voice, it's really annoying. I guess Shaggy realized his raspy voice wouldn't work too well either so he called up guest artists on almost every track. Secondly he used too many samples or shall i say covers, \\"Angel\\" was based on \\"Angel of the morning\\" from Nina Simone, and \\"Luv Me, Luv Me\\" was based on Rose Roy's 1977 hit \\"Ooh Boy\\" and \\"Dance and Shout\\" is taken from a well known Jackson's hit. These are just a few example's how to get a cheap hit song, steal some old songs, you make some cheap lyrics and you pretend it's reggae. He happens to be Jamaican but his music is pure commercial pop and that's about it. This is as bad as it gets. please, don't let this guy become even richer and buy his cd's, ignore it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIQUE!","review":"I had my order for Shaggy pre ordered for a couple months. I love his past albums. In each of them i found quite a few favourites that i loved to play LOUD out of my car stereo. But with each of them there was bound to be a few not up to snuff. In HOT SHOT the ones not up to snuff is the MJ remix....i have no idea why the radio stations chose to play it so much when it first came out! Not Fair is DEFINATELY my fave, followed by Angel and Hey Love. It still seems Shaggy is unsure of which form of music he likes. Chica Bonita is unlike anything hes ever done. But then again through expirimentation comes discovery. I sorta want to keep Shaggy's new album a secret...lest it become too well known, and over played. All in all I'm glad Shaggy's back. Keep goin' Shaggy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He Has Talent...","review":"But that isn't enough for me to buy this CD. His songs are horrible! \\"Wasn't Me\\" tells about being naked and having sex. \\"Freaky Girl\\" talks about a girl who can give a player pleasure. \\"Angel\\" is the only good song of his.If I could give it 0 stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaggy rules!!","review":"I've had this album since the day it was released - I am a huge Shaggy fan!! There's just something about that man's voice that makes me melt!! And if anyone gets the chance to see him in concert, you should definitely take the opportunity. I liked Shaggy prior to seeing him in concert, but once I saw him live - and got his autograph - I fell even more in love with him!! He's an awesome entertainer!! And this is an awesome new album - can't wait for future Shaggy releases!! Plus I just barely saw the video for \\"It wasn't Me\\" - he looks so good!! Can't wait to see more videos!!

The messages are pretty good too, as there have been, many tracks released to the radio. It includes Luv Me Luv Me(From the soundtrack of How Stella Got Her Grove Back), Hope(least favorite Shaggy song), Dance And Shout, then It Wasn't Me. Also the new single Angel appeared on this.

When I have gone into the hospital for personal health care, I tell them that Transpore is the only tape I can use and they say that is almost the only tape they use anyway. It allows my skin to breath and it maintains it hold. It is not as hurtful to remove as other tapes... so I am a lifetime Transpore Tape person.

The bite was getting better and then I ran out of paper tape. So I stated using a roll of 3M Transpore tape. After a day or two, I got a huge, horrible skin reaction everywhere (and only) where the tape contacted my skin. Massive irritation and severe sores, which eventually scabbed over and left major scars which are still extremely prominent six months later. It was the worst skin reaction I've ever gotten from contact with anything. Obviously my reaction is rare, but should be mentioned because it did happen and the Transpore tape was the obvious culprit. I got some more paper tape and experienced no further irritation with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tape good deal for the price","review":"Would recommend this deal.

It did not hold up well at all for me. it is NOT waterproof/sweatproof. Tape would come off with couple hours of wear. I did use it to cover a wart remover adhesive on the palm of my hand so perhaps that may be the reason why it did not work out well. I use the johnson and johnson waterproof tape which works great for the fraction of the price. With the johnson and johnson waterproof tape, I would be able to wash my hand all day long and it would stay put. Mind you I would have to clean the tape area with alcohol before placing the tape but I did the same with Transpore tape also but did not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"book ok, binding loose","review":"The book was in good shape and came quickly, but the binding was a little loose.

This book is filled with everyday words that have nothing to do with naming a child. Chimmney and Ajax? Come on! No definitions or pronunciations were given either. Even the \\"From the experts\\" section on the back of the book with comments from Dr. Spock and Dr. Brazelton stunned me. The only things these experts had to say was that they did not have enough time to comment.

If you are looking for something to play in your car while commuting, this is it. The cd promises to teach 50 words and it delivers. Many sentences can be made from these key words to get you around town, order food at a restaraunt, ask for prices and help you find a bus.

If you're like me, & want to read everything Hamsun has written, sure, go for it. Love America bashing? You'll love it.

If you are looking for the best acting or the tightest screenplay this is not for you, it is more like a long sketch.A long sketch but a great sketch. This film is hysterically funny. I rented it from Netflix and decided immediately I'd have to buy it. It's full of surprises. Nothing is sacred. If the acting sucks the comedy is absolutely brilliant.Make sure not to miss the supplements, they were insanely funny as well.I'm glad these guys have the guts to take the big risks, it's the only way to get the big payoff. This movie deserves to go viral like \\"Office Space\\", I see it being funnier with each viewing. A must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed a few times","review":"I'm struggling to find one redeeming quality about this movie...I really am. Sure I chuckled a few times, but in the end I was left scratching my head and asking, \\"Did I really just sit through that?\\" The lead characters Eugene (Zach Cregger) and Tucker (Trevor Moore) were over the top at times and obnoxiously whiney at others. How many times can two guys scream like girls?The only part that was decent was the cameo Hefner gave. As another poster stated he gave a good performance (or just acted as himself) and delivers a simple explanation about how to treat women.I guess with these movies it's hit or miss and this one just missed for me. In the end I decided to give it two stars for the few laughs I did manage to let out and for Hef. Would I watch it again? Never. Am I mad I watched it once?

I am not a transwoman instead born into this life assignment--but it was deeply entertaining and informative all the same. This is a short, sweet, portrait of a woman who is hiding her past identity, but not well enough according to a close friend. Her friend, as friends do, decides to help make sure her trans status is completely undetectable. But the question arises, as her friend removes all that is her from sight: do I want to be this all new person or risk being myself and see? She has a date with a man who doesn't know her status, so they want to ensure his acceptance. This created a funny situation without turning camp, which I appreciated (liking serious subject matter in movies). It turns serious in the right moments without getting heavy. Great film. It will make you want to see more. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I loved this tape as a child, and just purchased it in CD format for my mom who also loves it.

Even when I turned the holder upside down, I had to shake it a few times to get the filter to even start to slide out.Anyway..I am happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What You Get Is Good, But....","review":"This is a very misleading item. First, I received four filters(solid blue, yellow, red and green?) No grey-ish one that softens the edges, which I was hoping for. In the picture you see a little clear circle in the center, but I got solid-color filters. I'm not hugely disappointed because all in all they work and are basically what I wanted but not exactly. Kinda peeved about the grey filter. Also, I'm surprised there aren't more reviews like mine. Maybe it's a fluke?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't come with the holder!?","review":"The filters seem nice enough, if you can find the attachment that you need to purchase (SEPARATELY!) in order to actually use them!Oh well, next time I'll be more careful than to assume that the piece that you NEED will come with the filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect condition and fast shipping","review":"I rec'd the book in perfect condition.

I'm sure I didn't understand all Vollmann wanted me to. The writing style, while difficult, is extraordinary.I do not have the literary background to do justice to any deep analysis, so I'll just give you a reader's appraisal. The closest comparison I can make is to David Foster Wallace's \\"Infinite Jest\\". The method of writing and the characters reminded me of \\"IJ\\" within a very few pages. I feel safe in saying that if you do not care for DFW, you will not care for this book.We are taken on a journey in an unrecognizable USA (and world). There is a bare bones description of what is happening to people and places other than that necessary for us to follow the characters through their travails. The list of characters at the beginning is of benefit so you can remind yourself of who is on what team.To put it in a nutshell - I had fun reading this, which is my goal with any book I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"Great book, much overlooked and underestimated by the reading public.

The other albums are great, but Nitro Praise Live was hard to listen to. There is some guy who is over-powerfully talking/rapping/shouting through almost every song, and at times is off key and out of sync. It literally scalded my ears drums. There are a few songs he is not associated with which are good, but most of the songs are in my opinion ruined by his loud, half-rap babble. In his defense, it was at a concert and I'm sure he was trying to hype up the crowd. I guess being there would be a lot better than listen to in on CD, because you're in the \\"environment\\". I bought this used and only paid $1 for it and still feel ripped-off.

The controls are extremely difficult to use. Amazon was kind enough to replace it but the replacement has all the same problems. Mustek's suggestion to shut off the auto-focus during video recording had no effect. The playback was still noisy with clicks and burps. This piece of junk deserves 0 stars. If you think the zoom feature is continuous you will be disappointed. The zoom function click stops at four zoom levels only which looks ridiculous on playback.

It is my opinion that the current line of tapeless budget camcorders are still a few years away from maturing to usefulness.

If you scrapbook and want a different look for your layouts, this is ok. But this is about all I use it for. The buttons and dials are so small and very easy to hit something else because there so sensative. It says digital zoom is 4X but then its so grainy you cant see well.

I had previously reviewed that these bobby pins were hard to open, which is still kind of true, but once you get the hang of it, its worth it to use these bobby pins over another brand.

I threw the entire box away and spent half the money at the grocery store getting a different set that was better better quality. Don't waste your money on these folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"The bobby pins seem to be very sturdy and the coating should last a long time, unlike my old pins that would flake off and snag my hair.

I have been on a secret mission to find Andy Pratt albums without paying through the snout since I gotRecords Are Like Life. And...........I just found this on wax in a dollar bin--there was gold in there, and now it's mine.This self-titled album is not quite as sophisticated as the aforementioned, which is like listening to a singer-songwriter version of Coltrane's \`Giant Steps, with its winding DNA chords and maze song architecture.This album is a little more streamlined, with structures that don't quite mutate as much or as fast. But this is no James Taylor or Carol King affair, and the playing, singing and writing is top notch, even if some of Pratt's artsy edges are, unfortunately, beveled.Still, this is a great album that is far above most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, wrong description","review":"Beryl Smeeton wrote two extraordinary memoirs of her unusually adventurous life. \\"Winter Shoes in Springtime\\" recounts her journey home from England, alone, in the 1930's, by local transportation, through Persia and Russia, and later through China and SE Asia.Contrary to the Amazon Editorial Review, it does not have anything whatsoever to do with \\"Elizabeth's\\" culinary adventures in British Columbia."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRAIN DEAD","review":"Your brain will work just fine with out this mumbo-jumbo --- don't waste your money ---- buy one of Enya's CD'S instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helpful","review":"I'm not sure if it makes my mind work better, but this kind of \\"white noise\\" music really really really helps me get to sleep, and when I wake up, I feel truly rested and clear-headed."},{"rating":"2","title":"New To Music and Memory Enhancement Phenomena","review":"I bought this CD with Deep Learning by the same author and it has been very beneficial.

The entire CD only goes for 35 odd minutes but the quality of the songs are terrific. This young band that dabbles inbetween emo and alt rock beats shows alot of promise. 'I believe', 'Things You Say' and 'Torn Inside' are utterly beautiful songs that deal with love and relationships. The lyrics are meaningful and the listener will be able to identify with a song or songs from this album release.

Re Jana and her family travel for weeks across the desert to work on the boat in the middle of the desert. Provoost does an excellent job describing the controlled chaos the scene must have been. Noach (Noah) is anguished and struggles with the death of children in the flood. The scenes of the people on the outside struggling and fighting to get in are horrific. While not strictly Scriptural, and there are a couple of elements I was uncomfortable with (Re Jana & Neelata's relationship) ultimately even Re Jana comes to believe in Noach's Unnameable god as a god who will protect her and she can abide in. After reading this book, read Genesis 6-9 and see how the story has been changed from a simple children's Sunday School fable into real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing.

It excelled in only one particular; depicting ugliness in all its sordid detail. The author so grossly distorts virtually every detail of the Noah story from the Biblical narrative that it becomes meaningless, and the author's point a total mystery. Her characters, even her protagonists, are two-dimensional and without appeal, her \\"heroes\\" people who rage against righteousness without displaying any understanding of the concept. Altogether a poorly executed effort, with some disturbing anti-Semitic overtones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time.","review":"A ridiculous story, that falls so far away from the shadow of the ark that I strongly advise you not to even waste your time.

Of course I bought it and just after 3 weeks i've notice i lost inches more than pounds during my first 2 weeks. Which is good because I can fit into a size smaller that what I normally wear and my belly doesn't look as big as it had before. Yea it keeps you going to the washroom, so it would be best not to take it the day your know your going to be out and about if you don't like to use public washrooms. I do give my body a break for like a week but I try not to eat as much during that week off as well.

In fact I may have been a little more constipated than usual (sorry to be so graphic, but hey it's a colon cleanser!) The instructions say some people just have \\"sluggish colons\\" and they need to use the company's Super Cleanse product, but since UC didn't work even slightly, I'm reluctant to try any more of their products. The 2 stars is for the good value price for quantity of pills and the large variety of natural ingredients.

I bought Blood on the Satellite when it came out in 2004, too.I think Plastic Girl is UVR's best album. It's pretty consistent; if you like one song, you'll probably like them all. \\"She's That Kind of Girl,\\" which appears on Superpimp, is my favorite UVR song to date. \\"My Car\\" and \\"Perfect Eternity\\" are other favorites.This album is a must-have for pop-punk fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"if u don't sing in the shower, u will now!","review":"This cd will be one of my favorites for a long time.

It was pretty lame they have even go so far as the threaten to \\"f*ck me up\\". All the while, writing in some crazy ebonics and butchering the spelling at the same time. I seriously think they all might me 12 and live w/ their parents, but I could be wrong.

It is very sad that Mr. Fisher has taken his time and effort to attack not the work of Benny Hinn but the work of the Lord. Just reading Fisher's book makes you grind your teeth. Have you ever had somebody try to pull quotes out of your own words without presenting you with all the information of what exactly you had said. It's like having the media or press around pulling only the words that they like to hear and churning those words around to make them more 'presentable'. However I suggest that you do read this book, it's a good example of how the work of the Lord is still being destroyed today by authors like G.

If you want a book that explains the true ministry of Pastor Benny Hinn I recommend a book called A Servant's Heart: Finding Your Spiritual Father.

BMG Canada is printing and distributing it at a domestic price, as of the N.A. release date of Sept. 24, 2002.Writing this review on the release date -- and after only one listen -- I might be premature. Underworld releases can require several listens to really appreciate them. However, for the time being, there was a track on this album that I found remarkable above the rest:Dinosaur Adventure 3D is a wicked track for its vocal delivery. Karl does a simplified Eastern scaling to his notes and feeds it through a warble effect. It has an earnest mood.Overall, the album has a less upbeat feeling than Beaucoup Fish, but true to Underworld, it still has a lot of character.

It grew on me as I was listening to it for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"top natch underworld release","review":"Just wanted to very quickly add my voice of support for this fine album. Despite the absence of Emerson, Underworld have released a dazzling disc filled with sounds that we've come to know them for: continuous grooves that never seem to get old.

A very satisfying listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure yet","review":"This is just a preliminary review for those of us who went out and bought it on momentum from EverythingEverything and might be dissappointed. Relax, be cool, take this one on its own terms.

The song \\"Born Slippy\\" made for trainspotting in 1996 was exelent and one of the best dance single's of that year, but after that they haven't really been making so much good music i expected. None of the songs on this album is any remarkable. I won't say it's that bad, but they are simply too slow and simular too each other. No hit music, no music to dance to, no music that you can do anyhing else then just relax too. I feel that they don't bring anything new to the genre with this Cd. I will accept this the more i listen to it ofcourse but it's far from what we expect them to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"empty","review":"this is the least creative ever of all underworld releases.they are obviously trying to repeat things which have worked well in the past without any real feeling behind the music.emmerson must have been providing the real depth to this band in the past, it sure isnt there now.ive been a fan for many years and feel it important to say this is heading in a bad direction - an attempt to be catchy and popular, losing what made them so special before.most of it sounds excruciatingly obvious, and so banal i want to cringe.goodbye underworld, i will miss you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"I have the biggest crush on Darren Emerson and as far as I am concerned, he IS UNDERWORLD.

It combined historical fiction with, what I thought would be a compelling mystery. Neither of the these components turned out to be interesting or enlightening in any way. The story started out slowly, and dully, and remained that way through most of the book. I forced myself to finish it, thinking the ending would compensate for its lack of entertaining material in the rest of it. It hardly did. For those of you who are looking for an intriguing novel that will provide new details about ancient Britian, or time travel, I would suggest you find another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Cozy Grows On You","review":"Janis Harrison's first book (1999) \\"Roots of Murder\\" is a typical cozy. Suspects grow like weeds and topics are cast across the pages like so many seeds. That is part of the problem. Though the characters are unique, they rush past you like leaves on a windy day, not always easily identifiable. I spent too much time trying to keep all the characters straight. Once I did have them straight, I thought I knew the murderer just past the midpoint. I was sure of it before the potentially interesting protagonist, Bretta Soloman. She is a recently widowed owner of a florist shop who just lost 100 pounds and can't help branch out into other people's business especially after an Amish friend is murdered. More depth into the copious topics raised and a less hurried pace to character introduction would have helped. For me, it is a three. For lovers of cozies, its real audience, it would harvest four."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud","review":"Another \\"it's all about me\\" mystery detective. Too much about the main character and not enough about the crime in this book. Bretta is snobbish and smug - full of herself throughout the book. Everybody likes her, she's the only one in the book who \\"knows\\" things, the only one people confide in, the only one who can communicate effectively with the Amish, and so on. She constantly takes offense when people notice she's lost weight, but, let's face it - you don't loose 100 pounds overnight and surely some of these people have noticed it by now? I never felt any emotion for the character who gets killed even though he left behind a widow and some children and all the dialogue seems stilted and forced. That's why I gave it a one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak prose, flat characters, comic failure","review":"I selected this book based on the customer reviews. You folks sure let me down this time! Roots of Murder is so bad that I declined to share it with my circle of mystery-reading friends. The prose is flat and simplistic, written at about a 6th grade level. The characters are undeveloped stereotypes, with the possible exception of the protaganist, and she is a pitiful excuse for a detective. I expected to learn something about gardening, flowers, or the Amish, but there's no attempt to educate the reader. The worst thing is that there are some plot elements with the potential for hilarity -- like when the heroine is cold-cocked by a dangling corpse or when she tries to drive with a python slithering around her leg -- but it falls flat. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nevermind the Bad Critiques","review":"Nevermind the bad critiques, folks. Janis Harrison's first Bretta Solomon mystery is a delight, even if you don't like gardening! I, personally, never understood how anyone could enjoy getting one's hands utterly filthy. But JH makes it sound like fun.An Amish man, Isaac Miller is found murdered in his fields of beautiful flowers, these flowers which Miller sold to local florists, including Bretta Solomon. When Isaac's brother Evan asks Bretta to investigate, find out why Isaac was murdered, Bretta is just a bit reluctant at first, but then dives into the investigation, taking you along for the ride.Having read \\"Lilies That Fester\\" first, I'm not exactly reading these in order, but I'm so excited about JH writing more; something in her books, her style of writing maybe, or maybe something in Bretta herself that makes me feel comfortable, like I've known her for a long time.

McDonald spends the first three-quarters of the book writing about himself. There is no kind of evidence of any kind dealing with the JFK assasination. It is difficult to tell if this is a true story or not, some parts began to sound like a cheesy spy movie. It was horribly written, lacked facts or even a description of the assassination, and the interview with the supposed killer was very anticlimatic. McDonald runs around claiming he is searching for the killer. He speaks with his usual contacts and they lead him to this guy called Saul.

The mystery of what happened to her 2 brothers is never answered but it is just one of the many tragedies that this woman overcame in order to create one of England's brilliant dynasties.Amazon.com Gift Cards - In a Gift Box - Free One-Day Shipping"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I saved my money","review":"I have to say my experience with the self-published e-books is poor, and this book reaffirms my impression that there's a reason most of these cheap books are so cheap. The writing in this book is so pedestrian, dialogue so untrue to the era that I am so glad I downloaded a sample. Yes, I did not read the whole book, which is unusual for me but in this case it was so obviously unnecessary. I note the author has already written and released quite a few books in the past 2 years. I'd suggest that she slow down and work on honing her craft. If you want well written books about English queens, try old standard Jean Plaidy, Alison Weir, even, though not my favorite, Philippa Gregory.

Pretentious little piano dingdongs, a capella voices, Bonanza-style rhythms... this album is so funny it's actually painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow....that was...different.","review":"Jonathon Davis cannot song, and singing is kinda required for an uplugged album.

There are some good tracks on this album. The best are Hollow Life, Throw me Away, Love Song and Make me Bad.

This cd combines old school Korn songs and music with their new style of music. It also features Amy Lee of Evanescence helping out lyrically on Freak on a Leash and also The Cure helped out on the song Make me Bad mixed with In Between Days which sounds great. What got me was the cover song Korn did for this cd the song being Creep and not the STP version. They have 4 songs on here from see you on the other side Love Song, Twisted Transistor, Coming Undone, and Throw me Away. But also has the classic Blind, Falling away from me, Freak on a Leash, Got the life and Make me Bad. Total of 11 songs on it and if you enjoy all types of Korn music then pick this cd up and savor both old sound and new sound of Korn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing I've heard in a while...","review":"This cd is horrible. Kudos to the creative aspect, but Davis is NOT A GOOD SINGER by any means. Some vocalists can pull a stunt like this off, but not J.D. He desparately needs his studio recording technology to cover up his incredibly bad vocals. The cover of Creep is such an injustice to Radiohead, Davis just sings it pitchy and shaky like an amateur teen on karaoke night. Sorry, he can't pull off an acoustic set. Invest your money in a good band like Symphony X or Dream Theater!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic funky french house","review":"This double continuous mix CD really is fantastic.

With this new Bolero-ranchero CD, she shows that she still has the emotion and feeling to sing like in tha last decade, when she was the queen, now she is more mature, more atractive as a woman and as an artist. This is the perfect music for her, Todo O Nada is irresistable, the music is wonderful, Chamin Correa did a very good jod, Lucia is singing better than ever, Todo o Nada will be a classic. The songs, todo o nada ( everything or nothing), si ti me dices ven ( if you tell me come with me), siempre estoy pensando en ti ( I'm always thinking about you), ya la pagaras ( you'll pay for it!), amorcito azucarado ( sugarded love) etc... are simply WOW!!!!

The beats are wonderful, and the voices fit perfectly with the undertone of each song. A definite must buy for industrial fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Kickin!","review":"I've been listening to KMFDM for the longest time, and i'm a big fan. I own (or have heard) all of their CDs (up to WWIII) and this is still probably the best. For a crew, it's got all the old favourites, ranging from the Kapt'n (Sascha), En Esch and some wicked guitar by Gunter Schulz., as well as others that we all know, like Chris Shepard, Raymond Watts and others. Favourite tracks include Megalomaniac, Spit Sperm and Anarchy. This is a classic KMFDM typical of their transition from their earlier industrial style-music to their later almost alt. rock style. Of course, they've never really settled in any one genre, but this CD has a nice blend of rock and industrial. Any fans of Pig or Skinny Puppy, this is a must hear. Compelling lyrics, kickin guitar licks and awesome programming are combined to create, in my opinion, KMFDMs finest CD! Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is a fine selection of rock and heavy metal","review":"This cd is a very good example of some of the best rock/heavy metal music that has come out of the 80's. Several songs on their cd, KMFDM are very enjoyable. I believe that they are a talented group. However, they also seem to lack diversity in their music, and most of the songs on this specefic cd are repetetive."},{"rating":"2","title":"My finger won't stop tapping","review":"I love this CD.

It was called \\"Made to Love\\" I really liked it and hoped Amazon had it. They did so I looked for a few more. I bought, \\"Ignition\\". This has been the song of choice for me when working out or just hanging out. I decided to buy one more song \\"Boomin'\\" This was another good song. This is a great album for teens and adults.Great music with a great morale value.I recommend buying these songs or album on Amazon's MP3 downloader service. You get an MP3 file unprotected so you can copy it to any player, including an iPod. However, if you buy it on iTunes, you get a M4P file which can only be played on Apple devices. Amazon is more compatible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Toby Mac has such an upbeat and uplifting sound. This CD follows suit, just in a much bigger way. While most CDs will have 2 or 3 really good songs, this one is packed with them. If you haven't picked up this CD yet, what are you waiting for? It's great for all ages. Teens and even older folks like me (50 something) love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toby Delivers Again","review":"Back with his third solo album, tobyMac doesn't disappoint. He delivers a disc filled with catchy songs, and on this outing he sings more than he rhymes, which is a welcome change of pace because he sings well, and the rap-core style is becoming a bit outdated. The lead-off single, \\"Made to Love\\" features an infectious chorus, as well as live strings and horns that add a cool sound to the mix. Other standouts are \\"I'm For You\\", and \\"Face of the Earth.\\" The track \\"Boomin\\" is exactly that, and \\"Ignition\\" also provides fans with a high octane anthem. Another strong cut is \\"Lose My Soul\\", a prayerful duet with Kirk Franklin that emphasizes focusing on God in the face of the cares of the world. If you've liked Toby's solo stuff in the past, or dc Talk for that matter, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for teens","review":"I bought this for my grandson and he really liked it.

I agree with Mr. Ryan Staples as most of the songs do sound \\"forced and redundant, like he had a deadline.\\" It's not like his old stuff at all and absolutely nothing compared to DC Talk when Toby was at his best. 'Lose My Soul' was pretty good and is worth a listen, but he's changed his style too much for an old Tobymac fan to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This man continues to blow me away with his God centered heart felt inspirational music! I have to say I enjoyed this offering more than his others and I thoughts his others were awesome. He kicks it up a notch from Diverse City with Portable Sounds. I know people want to see DC Talk gete back together, but in my oppinion Toby Mac is doing quite well on his own. Seperatelly the 3 DC Talk guys are spreading the Gospel better than as a group.

This book is not a book for the serious cook/chef. When the recipe for stock includes V-8 juice, one knows the recipes have been completely overhauled for the \\"cooking for dummies\\" dummy. Also, not significant to the quality of the book, the photos, although artistic are not realistic. Never had I ordered a plate a one of Jean-Louis Palladin's restaurants and received such overly manicured food. I believe the photos were designed to appeal to those who appreciate the style of the 1980's.

Why didn't he stay there! French Chefs only can cook with the most expensive ingredience, like caviar, truffle, Goose liver, they even using the best wines to cook. Others drink the wine. And for this they get a star or two. The Recipes in this book are definetely not for the day to day cooking. But for professional chefs who know, how to make the same dish as good, but cook it cheaper"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much! Creativity without thought can upset the stomach.","review":"The cooking techniques were strong, traditionally French. But the food combinations and the photographs were too much for the eye and the palate. Moreover, I doubt very much the presentations and platings in the book represent what the Chef presents in his Napa restaurant. Though the food at the former Jean-Louis' may have been extraordinary, his book is not. I am disappointed that such a great chef was led astray by an over estimated photographer, whos photos take one back to the earily 80's, and aparently a lost literary agent who doesn't know the difference between an apple and an orange. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Theory 101","review":"This book is basically music theory for the beginner, written in a hip and readable fashion.

While my scale did not plummet, as was explained in the book, my clothing started to feel looser and I consistently lost two pounds a week, even when I had \\"cheated\\". I lost 30 lbs. on this program and felt like I was eating all the time. It does really work and I didn't do anything I thought was dangerous or didn't make sense.

Much of it is very repetitive (in a bad way) with not quite enough depth to the sound and a general lessening in creativity than was found on the vastly superior \\"Amber\\" album. I admire Autechre for doing their own thing, but it does seem that their music, while trying to stray further from the mainstream is also straying from the realms of listenability, as evidenced by this year's frankly dire \\"ep7\\". It's different, yes, but is it any good?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the Heap","review":"Just wanted to say, and say it under this CD,that when it comes to vocal-free electronicawith subtle melodies, futuristic percussion andsub-woofer power, AUTECHRE in general---I mean95% of ALL their CDs, are the best I've found, a real Godsendto those searching for creative instrumentals thatchallenge, inspire, and can be trusted to play as \\"background\\" music while you are involved in creative pursuits.I'm not going to list what I feel are the best Autechre CDs; but I am saying: all in all, they are the best, with certain CDs by Amon Tobin coming in a close second.

The sounds are often industrial and rough, but the melodies are contrastingly relaxing, almost like some ambient music from RDJ. The true test of techno for me is whether a song will drag on and be repetetive, or keep me with it till the end. Music like U-ziq and Aphex Twin is so involved and deep that you have to pay attention to it. Autechre manages to make tracks that evolve at just the right pace that even 10 minute songs are listenable. Not even close to EP7 (from the half of it I've heard), but still quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"I imagine anyone who \\"raved\\" about this stopped listening to it soon after (6 months, a year) while those of us who rememeber the release of Eno's On Land Still listen 20+ years later (yeah, I'm pretty old but you'll understand how fleeting enthusiasms can be someday). This will will not stand the test of time. I'm getting rid of it to make space for something interesting. Sure its better than whatever pop music is hot now but not by much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I finally decided to pick up this album because in the underground music scene, Autechre has been consistantly put on pedestals & hailed as inovators and geniuses etc. etc. etc. Now, i know this is older material, and i also know that their newer releases are supposedly much more progressive and groundbreaking, but i've heard from a lot of fans that this CD is among their best work. All that aside, the music sounds to me like a couple of intelligent kids with no musical training or ability (& not much an idea of what they're doing) tinkering with some electronic equipment in their bedroom studio. The musical structres are boring, repetative, annoying, and lack any kind of soul. Is this really music? I would have to rank this among the worst electronic albums i've heard thus far, so if you have bad taste in this genre of music, i'd highly recommend this CD. \\"Garbage\\", the 2nd EP included in this package adequately sums it up for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"IDM/Industrial","review":"If you like industrial music or IDM you'll love this. If you like your techno melodic or with catchy hooks, you probably won't like this. This album is somewhere in the middle between IDM and techno. It has at times the minimalistic and isolationistic approach of Plastikman while at other times it moves you with the haunting unsettling sounds of Skinny Puppy. Compared to other more popular acts in techno this is IDM but compared to other IDM acts like Matmos, or Boards of Canada, I'm not really sure. It's a bit simple in progression in comparison to other IDM acts(like Mouse on Mars) but still complex enough in sound to keep a critic like myself satisfied. This could be a great soundtrack to a movie about someone stranded on the moon looking for a way home. As a Post Rock/Experimental/IDM fan, I now have a party CD without having to resort to my guilty pleasures. An area I needed to fill, seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aural sculpturing","review":"Autechre's Tri Repetae++ is a must have for anyone who's into ambient/techno music. It's solid from beginning to end. There isn't a bad track to be found on the two CDs. Though some tracks stand out more than others (vletrmx21 is probably the one you've heard on some internet radio channels), the whole thing is balanced and original, never boring. Excellent background music when I paint or draw, or just when I'm in a certain mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop, Crackle and Snap form a band","review":"In my opinion Tri Repetae is a defenite turning point in the history of Autechre. This is the place where they really started to develope their distinctive sound of disjointed, heavy, coplex rythms, on top of beautiful melodies. Enter: Autechres \\"dry\\" sound if you will, as opposed to the \\"wet\\" sound on Incunabula and Amber. On Tri Rep they still hadn't let go of the softer elements but the harshness had defenitly taken over. Amazing piece of work really that keeps getting better the more you listen to it. It has so many nooks and crannys that you are always discovering new patterns or new sounds. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave your prejudices at home","review":"If you only like music that you can compare to something else, you won't care for this. If, however, you can put all that aside and listen to a work for its own intrinsic value, there is a good chance you will get a lot out of Tri Repetae. This music requires active listening and a commitment from the listener.I can't imagine why anyone would compare this to Underworld. There is no basis for comparison other than the fact that both use synths and samplers. Autechre's compositions are rhythmically dense, with highly developed counterpoint and harmonic content. The music involves the listener as it develops, adding layers and evolving. Anyone who finds this boring just isn't ready for it yet. Autechre are to Underworld, as Jazz is to Pop.If you're ready to move past the same four-on-the- floor beats and stupid James Brown samples, give Tri Repetea ++ a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful translation of Ramprasad's poems to the Kali.","review":"One of my top 2 or 3 collections of devotional and mystical poetry.

But that is not the fault of the book; it is not intended to teach someone with a grounding in the subject, any more than it is a flaw of an intro Biology textbook that it doesn't teach Organic Chemistry.I have a couple of minor quibbles about this book, but they're really too minor to mention, and are certainly too minor to dock it a star for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book (especially for the price!)","review":"I'm teaching a basic stats class out of this book, and I find it to be pretty bad. I don't mind the fact that the author tried to water some things down. It is an introductory text, after all. I mind that he watered it down too much, however. Some basic key ideas are completely missing (for example, when discussing probability, he skips defining a sample space.) Some of the exercises and examples were also worded fairly poorly. I would also like to see some more computational examples throughout the text.In the end, I suppose the text is serviceable if the instructor is willing to supplement some material.

But when my granddaughter wanted a more expensive model of this toy it was hers. Neither she nor I could throw a pot on the wheel. Children can learn to throw a pot on a profesional potter's wheel. All this toy did was set her up for failure. These toy wheels are a disservice to children and should not be sold by a business of your calibre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't bother...","review":"I am a potter. I find this toy alarming. I tried one at the request of a friend, who was considering it for her child. First off, to successfully work on the potter's wheel, it takes LOTS of practice. It is NOT easy, even if it looks it. The motor on this toy is NOT strong enough, and it is going to be a study in frustration for a child. If you want your child to have the experience of working in clay, sign them up for a local class, or let them do handbuilding.

That is pretty awesome if you ask me.I found Zalman's website very helpful in making sure that this cooler was compatible with my motherboard and in terms of installation.The only negative some people may point to is the overall size. This can only be a negative if because of the size it won't fit in your case or on your motherboard. Therefore you wouldn't be able to use it and that would suck, hence negative.

In the past, Agatha has leeched romantic stimulus and momentum from a revolving cast of male characters who have occupied the neighboring cottage that poor Agatha's estranged husband, James Lacey owns. With Agatha's ill-starred sex life on the back burner, \\"The Perfect Paragon\\" gives us a complete turnover in her detective agency staff in a bid make Agatha still seem interesting.Since they are devoid of any depth of characterization, the narrative also makes few demands on its audience either to think or to feel. The Agatha Raisin series is a harmless way to while away a few hours.As for the surprise ending, I can only think: the more things change, the more they stay the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"More characters, less plot, no interest","review":"Unfortunetly what was once a good series of stories has dipped with the publication of the last two stories - coincidencing with a change of emphasis in the plotline.Out as gone the bitchy amatuer Agatha and the well developed characters to be replaced with an Agatha who now cares about peoples feelings. For regular readers of the books, they will know that Agatha is not one for mellowing.The characters which now surround her are at best poorly developed and are just too good to be true. Any obstacle is now easily overcome, any guess now becomes a fact and with it, the interest has vanished.There is a chance to turn around the padded out plots with book 17 but I doubt we will see it happen.

For one thing, Agatha does not have as much time to feel sorry for herself because she's busy solving cases. We are also treated to some wonderful new characters in this book. Harry is an absolute marvel! Ms. Beaton does such a good job with her characters! In this book Agatha is involved in trying to solve three seemingly unrelated murders, and her and her army of helpers are kept busy trying to keep on top of all three cases.

Not alot, but about 4 or 5. No.2, I think the rappers could have done a little better with rhyming. Their rhymes weren't satisfying. Actually they were like something a rookie could talk about. You know, I'm thinking about going out solo as a rapper-everybody says I can flow and my rhymes are like the best.

Get this or consider yourself out of the loop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzz & What's up with all the 'easing'?","review":"Actually, I rather like Modesitt, despite his peculiarly wooden writing style, but I found this book so dull that I found myself counting the number of times his characters 'eased' into, up to, and around things, rather than paying attention to the plot (which, two months afterward, I have absolutely no recollection of). You may ask, why did I continue reading it, in that case? I ask myself the same thing. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, I guess. But I suppose it's difficult to \\"ease\\" into excitement-mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"L.E. Modesitt has been my favorite author of fantasy novels. I have enjoyed reading the entire Recluce series and the Corean Chronicles, but the Ethos Effect was a major disappointment. The novel projects all the current race, religion, sexuality, and family value conflicts into the far distant future. It is a very gloomy view of the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I spotted this book in the library, saw the cover art, and thought, \\"Oh boy, an action-packed sci-fi novel about spaceships!\\" I had never heard of Modesitt but the quotes on the back cover seemed to lend some credibility to the book.As the chapters went by, I kept trying to convince myself I was engaged in an interesting book, but you know what? It's just plain boring. In a future galaxy of spaceships and planet colonization, the main character seems to spend all his time leisurely strolling around from embassy office to embassy office, mildly contemplating something. Modesitt made a grand effort but the overall effect is soporific and tepid. 500 pages of gentle boredom. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"So THIS is poetry.","review":"As someone who doesn't really like or \\"get\\" poetry in general, I found Leza Lowitz's //Old Ways to Fold/New Paper/// to be a revelation. The poems have a tremendous power that seems to have to do mainly with the poet's voice--there is something about the rhythm of the lines and the honesty of the sentiments that makes it seem as if the words are emerging straight from the unconscious. Pictures are painted in my mind that make me feel as if I'm actually experiencing what the poet describes. I find myself thinking, \\"so THIS is poetry,\\" and taking the time to read other contemporary poets--but without really finding, as yet, anyone else who conveys that quality to me. I will keep trying, however, and hope to see more of Ms. Lowitz's work in the future--she may make a poetry lover out of me yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thing better than listening to Natalie MacMaster...","review":"is being at one of her concerts. MacMaster, who is still well shy of her 30th birthday, is an undeniable master (ok, mistress) of the fiddle. No one puts more of herself into their music, no one can blend what you would think are clashing styles and make them work the way she can. I mean, mixing celtic fiddle and flamenco of all things...but it WORKS and its great! Neither will those who love the traditonal celtic music with which MacMaster made her reputation feel slighted. The beautiful \\"Blue Bonnets Over the Border\\" \\"Flora MacDonald\\" and lively \\"Gramma\\"(plus others)are here for you. If you have never listened to Natalie MacMaster you are cheating yourself of some real pleasure and if you get the chance to actually see her perform some of these tunes live, be sure not to miss it. I just can't figure out how she has escaped wider notice by US audicences....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should have this CD","review":"Natalie MacMaster is a super artist! It is rare that I like every song on a CD, but \\"In My Hands\\" is that rare case.

It's been awhile since I've heard this or actually seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely staggering.","review":"I'm going to do something rare: dedicate this entire review to one song. And that song is Track 8 on this otherwise excellent disc - Stagger. I say otherwise excellent not because Stagger is less incredible than the other songs - quite the opposite. Stagger is perhaps the apex of electronic music thus far. It combines the aesthetics of space/prog rock, the stoned brilliance of guys like Brian Eno, and the ineffable lyrical genius of Karl Hyde. And yet, there's something else there, something that makes it alive; more than anything else on the album, this song pulses with a soul that's absent in most music, modern or otherwise. I could (and did) listen to it for hours on end (at last count, I think I had kept it on repeat for 8 hours). Buy the CD for everything else - keep it for Stagger."},{"rating":"2","title":"underworld : flawless as always","review":"Enough has been written in other reviews that there is no sense in pulling out the details.

It doesn't get better than underworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Toughest in the Infants","review":"Second Toughest in the Infants being Underworld's 4th studio and 1996 release is an album that met with great reviews. Allmusic giving the album 5 out of 5 stars and I agree with this assessment. One single was released of this album and this being \\"pearls girl\\" and the single peaked at #22 in Uk charts. The booklet contains no lyrics, and no photographs. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hear Underworld FLOW in this album ^^","review":"After hearing \\"Juanita/Kiteless\\" on \\"Everything, Everything; LIVE\\", I have always wanted to get this album to hear what the version of the song sounds like. I thought the version of Juanita on this album was a more 'ambient, mystic, and simple' version. The vocals sound a lot more different in it and it's 15 minutes long (wow!). Aside from that, \\"Banstyle/Sappys Curry\\" became my next favorite song for it's pretty melodies in the background mixed in with the drum-beats and well-put together vocals. I think of this one as a clone to Dubnobasswithmyheadman cause they are still keeping it in the same 'style' as they did in Dubnobass...even \\"Pearls Girl\\" I appreciated a lot for being a more 'easier' version from Everything, Everything; LIVE. I've written lots of reviews today and it's tiring me and so this is the best way I'll tell you about \\"Second Toughest in the Infants\\". I hope my review has helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime, electronica genius...","review":"One of the best albums of the nineties. Don't listen to people who tell you that just becuase this music is not song based it is somehow hopelessly ephemeral .These people are idiots. And probably Republicans as well...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title but a few nice bits","review":"The title led me to believe that it would be good for sending 6 year old (enrolled as a senior infant in St. Matthew's primary school in Raheny) to sleep each night. I thought it might help him grow up into somebody assertive and confident but I find really it a bit too noisy. It's all beats and electronic sounds that give me a headache. There's a nice bit I like though at the beginning of one piece called \\"Pearl's Girl\\" but it only lasts a few seconds before some rhythmic thud begins. I don't recommend it for parents like myself. It's not really for your children as the title led me to believe. I think I made a mistake. It must some really alternative music for other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the big deal about these guys?","review":"You want to own something by underworld, get their born slippy single. It has the song itself and many of its remixes. That song is terrific. The same can not be said about this CD. Track 5 is OK but nothing special. Music on this Cd just got on my nerves. Much too often it seemed boring and annoying. Again, some nice moments but I wouldn't recommend it. Some melody would've gone a long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but needs to be REMASTERED!!","review":"An excellent disc, but one that is in dire need of a proper remaster to do it justice. The sound quality on this CD (which has been out for more than 15 years) sounds thin, because the technology was not available at the time to create the full, rich sound that is now standard.If anyone is reading this who knows someone who knows someone who can get someone to get the job done, please, pass this message along: a REMASTERED version of this disc is URGENTLY NEEDED!!! (and while you're at it, the rest of the Underworld catalog too!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite albums for the car.","review":"I picked up 2nd Toughest second hand and almost didn't bother because I wasn't that keen on Beaucoup Fish, man I'm I pleased I got it. The album is beautiful, funky, chilled, everything that you could want. It's got a fantastic sound palette which makes fantastic use of, for example, accoustic guitar. I admit it isn't one that I often put on at home but if I'm driving I'll reach for this almost as often as I do Making Bones by Red Snapper.Basically it's a great album, go and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fav Underworld album","review":"Some people say that dubnobass is the best underworld but I have to disagree, this is my fav. Now, there are some bad (and I mean really bad tracks) like blueski and air towel. But the tracks like jaunita/kiteless/to dream of love, banstyle, and pearl's girl (ahh.... pearl's girl!) are pure genius. It's techno at it's upmost best. Words cannot describe. I would have bought this CD if it cost [a lot more]. It's just crazycrazycrazycrazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reason Journalists Shouldn't Write History","review":"Kaplan tries to sustain his \\"theme\\" of America as the new imperial power with extremely superficial references to Roman history, a subject he obviously does not understand. A whole book based on the typical journalistic technique of taking a single observation and implying that it represents a much greater whole. Some interesting bits, but full of unsubtantiated \\"facts\\" For example, Kaplan accepts taht Yemen is \\"estimated to have\\" 80 million small arms for a country of 20 million (love the use of passive voice.) No human being has any idea how many Yemenis there are, much less how many guns are in the country. Shouldn't Kaplan have simply asked how anyone could possibly know this? Respectful, generally, of the military men he met, but a very thin piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"To all the thin skinned one star woosies","review":"No, the book isn't perfect, nor are Kaplans views on geopolitics and the military. Obviously you morons only like books that espouse your personal viewpoints. I have served in a majority of these places with the Marines, Navy, Army and SF. He relates the stories well; at least they seem not to be self agrandizement or inflated. It seems to me most of the negative comments are comming from the I got an ax to grind liberal left.Actually it is one of the better books on current military ops by a journalist out there. Just take what he says and draw your own conclusions you thin skinned know it all whiners. 'Nough Said. 3 STARS.USMC 85-93USN 02-11"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and a bit sad","review":"Early in the book I stumbled on this sentance: \\"I was starting to love these guys.\\" This sums up the mood of the book, Kaplans simplistic adulation of the Special Forces. As the book grinds on, for it is long, this gets quite boring; much better are Kaplan's descriptions of the situation in Columbia, Mongolia, Yemen and the Phillipines. Kaplan's Balkan Ghosts was a real five star book, here he gets himself enmeshed in very strange ideologies - sometimes even bordering on facism. I also think that in many ways his analysis is wrong, in many instances the beaurocratic/humanitarian methods of the EU seem to work as well. I suppose a man like Kaplan who believes that the world is headed for total chaos wouldn't subscribe to that.So, in many ways a silly book - I have the impression of a bookish type wanting to be one with a bunch of macho, budweiser drinking soldier types."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Excellent","review":"Great read and a good job on Mr. Kaplan's part. Reading this book increased my respect for the brave american troops deployed world wide. Loved it and it is a recommended read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and thought provoking, as always.","review":"Another great read by Kaplan. The detail and gritty, grass-roots feel of the tactical viewpoints he uses as a lens provides the reader with the opportunity to agree or disagree with some of Kaplan's larger, strategic conclusions. He's got such a knack with military and \\"travel\\" writing that readers finish with a true feel for at least a portion of the ground truth. And its this tactical context, acquired through some pretty amazing hardship and risk-taking, as well as years of dedicated relationship building with the military in general, that makes Kaplan's voice unique and priceless as part of America's aggregate coverage of the dirty, pointy end of our foreign policy.You may not always agree with him, and he may not always prove himself to be correct, but Kaplan is always worth reading and keeping on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are missing the point","review":"If you read this book as \\"why we are in Iraq\\", then you are missing the point. Kaplan does a good job of describing today's VOLUNTEERS, as compared to Hollywood's version of Vietnam draftees we've seen portrayed in film, fiction, and prose. He is not trying to defend today's administration -- in fact many of the policies and projects he describes go as far back as Kennedy. He puts a face on the men (mostly) who make up today's armed forces, and he disappoints those who think they are all troglodyte, parole-jumpers looking for a better life.I really like the book, despite its similarity to a Theroux travelogue, because he is giving a voice to people who are \\"better seen than heard\\" in our culture. There will never be enough stories of generals who don't get it, but to hear real men tell real stories about what it's like to be on the edge of the empire is worth the price of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, insightful, and an eye opener. A book for everyone.","review":"This book is a narration of a journey in the real world, not an op-ed piece or a military history/war story. The title is misleading giving the current politics in this country, liberals will think its a Slam-America piece and will be drawn towards it while conservatives will shy away for the same reasons. It's really a great read for both parties. I don't agree with all of the author's conclusions, but can understand were he comes from. His talent lies in his ability to compare different third world countries(from years of experience),different character types, and different though patterns like academia vs. real-world(military). Four stars instead of five because i think the books location-by-chapter set up would make it hard to connect the dots for some."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique embedded journalist with great insights","review":"As an outsider to the military I found this book very interesting. The \\"tribe\\" within the various SF & Marine teams and platoons as well as the culture found therein was somewhat of the surprise. It was immensely believeable and rang true for the most part throughout.The unique problems and challenges found in each locale along with the history and evolution of each area made the unconventional approach seem obvious.The military reality post WW2 of massive firepower also makes sense and the transition to modern day realities for such a huge structure is slow and cumbersome. I was left with respect for the people who made this their life's work and hope for the future. The sociology contained in Kaplan's views also seem astute. He is certainly not your usual journalist, which he readily admits and I thank him for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for....","review":"I should've known that $19.99 was too little to pay for a leather planner. While the leather cover itself is nice enough, you should know that the inside is basically an inexpensive, plastic planner with cheap metal rings and pages that are not extremely functional. Every time you open up the planner, the plastic insert inside slides and moves. I'm sending it back (unfortunately with a $5 restocking fee)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an OK planner","review":"I like the planner for it's brown color and it smells like real leather. But when I opened it, the inside looks as though the planner was used by others. It has scratches and it looks like the planner was washed. I guess for $19.99 it's an ok planner.

Fearing not however because in sex ed I had seen a Trojan stretch over someone's arm with no problem, so surely this one could tolerate such stresses I thought to myself. Intercourse was good, but guess what? I must congratulate kimono for one thing; they have presented me with my very first ever broken condom experience.

If my memory is correct, it ran for 4 straight weeks. It was a great family show and the \\"Keane Brothers\\" really showed their talent. Tom Keane was excellent on piano and vocals and his younger brother John Keane was also excellent on drums and also vocals. The one song that really sticks in my mind is \\"I Wanna Get Back On The Floor And Boogie\\". The song is full of energy and has a great beat, not to mention the lyrics. The two brothers together have a dynamic vocal range.....not to mention perfect harmonanies. Since I have purchased this CD, I have listened to it numerous times. It reminds me of my teenage years when music was fun and innocent.

The fifth book will detail the events of Belinda & Judge Childs' affair, the birth of Hallie, Oliva's committing of her sister, the scandal of Hallie & Kenneth, and the eventual flee of Hallie & Chester. Do not fret, the rest of the story will be told. I only have one disappointment - what becomes of Melody? She is a great character & her story is never really completed.

And sometimes the drummer hits the snare and you just know what you are viewing isn\`t what you are listening.Total Scam.Worst dvd i own"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not representative of Dishwalla quality","review":"I read the comments about the editing before I bought but it still didn't prepare me for how BAD the editing on it was.

Yes Colombine was bad, but the music didn't cause it. I really love this album. Their mixture of metal, techno, and industrial really just is absolutely incredable. This is their best album so far (just barely beating Nihil). \\"Son of a Gun\\" is a standout track (though it was the song that the contraversy was surrounding). It is by far the best song on the album. It blended some really hard driving metal riffs and some great techno beats. Some other great tacks are \\"Blame\\", \\"Dogma\\", and \\"Praise\\". All in all one of the best industrial albums ever released (up there with Rammstein-Sehnsucht and Ministry-Greatest Fits). Buy it, you will not be disapointed...-MC"},{"rating":"2","title":"review update","review":"After realizing how crappy most other music is I decided to update my previous rating of Xtort. I was too hard on Xtort, mostly because KMFDM has such high standards, thus I needed to look at it objectively, rather than comparing it just to their other albums. That said, I really like it, but they've done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"1996 Album of the year!","review":"Like a gimicky psychological examination Xtort is one of the things that I would blurt out in assocition with 1996. Its appeal isnt confined to one year mind you. I'm listining to it right now. Craze being the only raised eyebrow. I hate songs with that kind of beat and others similar to it. Other than that Xtort scores big with singalongs like Son of a Gun and Power, and lyric readers like Rules and Dogma. Groovier than Nihil and more solid than Kmfdm/ST and Adios, Xtort delivers a punch that only 96 can bring. The only other problems I could possibly have with this album is that its too short and more videos should have been made for it. I saw one on USA up all Night of all places."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of KMFDM's best","review":"Everyone says this album is \\"radio-friendly\\", which personally I dont think is a bad thing. I am a big fan of KMFDM and I say this is their 2nd best album, only next to their self-titled album. My personal favorites on this album are Power, Son of a Gun, and Craze. After reading others' comments, the general idea I got was that Dogma is the best song on this album. Personally this is my least favorite KMFDM \\"song\\" (if you want to call it that) out of any album. Except for Dogma, every song on this album is superb. I would recommend buying their self title first, and then this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"It looks like MGA is running out of ideas because these dolls are a rip of their original series.

Even if I was on a deserted island and this product was the only one available to accompany be that a fish freshly caught, a salad made of the abundant vegetation this island would offer, a loaf of bread that unexpectedly drifted towards the shore in a waterproof container, Miracle Whip is a resounding NO.

The visuals of DA:DotS were barely tolerable (oddly, I thought it looked better with lots of action and worse when it was still frames). I stopped watching after about a half-hour because the voice acting and the writing were so bad I couldn't see myself making it through another hour. The voice actors lacked the level of quality I've come to expect from shows like Legend of Korra or Young Justice. The writing/pacing was awful, the pauses between lines of poorly written dialog drove me crazy.I'm so glad I didn't pay hardly anything for this. Luckily, I have family who are into anime (and Dragon Age), so they may appreciate this more."},{"rating":"1","title":"So terrible I couldn't finish","review":"I truly don't understand the possitive reviews.

Awful.","review":"I saw this movie at a pre-release showing at C2E2 this last year, and I have to say, this was some of the worst voice acting I've ever heard. I wanted to walk out, but the room was too crowded and my friend wanted to stay and watch the end. The entire movie's plot was totally predictable, as I was practically reciting it to said friend a half hour before the event would happen in the movie. I believe her when she says Dragon Age games are great, but I don't know if I'd want to play them if they are anything like this movie. Even all the DA fans in the room were wincing at every awkward, failed joke and lame plot twist. Plus, it didn't help that the movie's visual quality looked as if it was slapped together in the early 2000's. Trust me, don't see this movie. It's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back. You could spend it doing something better. Like actually playing a Dragon Age game."},{"rating":"1","title":"An offering with worse imersion than Dragon Age 2","review":"If you thought that your decisions made little difference in Dragon Age 2 and it couldn't get worse, you were under estimating EA's ability to marginalize the player.

If you thought the Dante's Inferno anime was as bad as it could get, think again. Why do publishers insist on trying to milk the success of the Animatrix?

But then, I wasn't expecting the very best.What this movie did offer was the following:- Lots of action- An okay storyline- Good voice acting- And a few amusing scenesI expected mindless action with amusement here and there and to be honest, it delivered and I was very entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely feels like a Dragon Age story.","review":"Having played both Dragon Age 1 and 2, I really enjoyed this movie. The anime truly is an adaptation of the video game. The story and events portrayed in this movie were so accurate to the Dragon Age world. The animation is beautiful in blu ray and the voice actors are great. You'll probably notice too when you watch this anime, but many unoriginal and cliche moments happen. Even so atleast they did it perfectly. No parts felt like they were overplayed.Now even if you never played Dragon Age, its still a fun movie to watch.

One such description takes up approximately 12 minutes of tape time.Based on the tape, I certainly would not buy the hardcover version; but would consider a paperback version just to see if there is any similarity between the tape and the book. However, I feel some cognitive dissonance as I think Mr. Steinberg was well aware of the difference between the two media AND somewhat mis-represented the tape - which is not part of an ethics based business (especially since he hardly needs the money from the book or tape sales)."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read to develop synergy based on worth","review":"Valuable lessons for people lacking mentoring to interact effectively with partners, colleagues, customers, and other significant people in ones endeavor.

I had this book 7 years, then it was kidnapped from an apartment I moved out of along with my othercookbooks(Ok, I left them by accident, went back for my precious book next day and gone, thanks housekeeper..enjoy!)I might of cried. This is my favorite cookbook I bought at B&Nobles; in 2001. I baked mostly the breads and cakes. If you love to cook and follow directions well, your recipe will turn out very good (just like the picture)well, at least mine did:). The recipesare challenging but very rewarding. Baking from scratch is becoming a lost art..I intend on keeping the big spoon stirring, past it on to my daughter..No Boxes here.The breads are easy and fun to make, you'll be mad for buying a bread machine. I'm excited that I found my book at last, can't wait to get it in my hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I seriously doubt that anybody tested these recipes before they wrote this book. A couple of the recipes I really love, but some I have tried repeatedly and they never turn out. Don't bother with any of the bread recipes and most of the cake recipes. Very disappointed. I threw it away and then dug it back out for the couple of recipes I do like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs some adjustment","review":"Not everything I make from this book comes out like I'd expect. For example, the Na'an comes out like pita and a cookie bar recipe needs more topping. I take notes here and there in the margins but, at its core, a useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable recipes","review":"The photos in this book are so seductive that I keep on trying new recipes from it even though they never turn out right. I am not a novice baker, yet I could not produce anything acceptable using this book. The ingredients quantities are often incorrect; the instructions are neither detailed nor precise enough. Some of the recipes call for very delicate and advanced techniques, but in this book they are simplified or ignored completely so it is impossible to achieve success.I do not recommend this book, even though it might be very hard to resist the tempting photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untested recipes","review":"Untested recipes- in one even quantities suggested for making pastry were incorrect!. Makes me reluctant to try any more- feels like the seductive photos are a big con!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show for preschool-aged kids","review":"This show is excellent! The only reason I didn't give it full stars is that it is the same show that is on Netflix instant stream. I thought it was a different batch of Mysteries due to a different cover than the one on Netflix but it has a different order of the shows. I wish they would've kept making the show instead of stopping with the two seasons. My son loves it so much and has really gained some great vocabulary words and looks at things differently due to this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but inaccurate","review":"This book has some nice descriptions of the area and gives you a starting point. But it is full of internal contradictions (e.g., 2 day trip in the description but 4 day trip in the summary) and outright errors (e.g., the phone number for White Squall is wrong throughout the book) and the information is getting outdated faster than you would think (e.g., the fellow who welcomed kayakers to tea out on the Mink Islands has moved and some marinas have new names and phone numbers). The black and white photos are disapointing, being colour originals not well reproduced in grey scale. At best, this book is less useful than talking to a local resident or outfitter. More up-to-date (and verified) information can be found on the Internet. If you know nothing about the area, this book will give you a sense of what to expect and ideas on where to go. Just double-check any facts before you go. -- They're writing another guide? Here's hoping they get a better editor this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must have\\" if you want to paddle Georgian Bay","review":"If you want to paddle in Georgian Bay, then this book is a good investment.

He also includes trip lengths, camp sites, fees, access points, and possible extension routes. This book is sure to enhance your Georgian Bay experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome writing","review":"One of my friends suggested I read this book. I am not one to enjoy romance because most of the romance novels out there are disgusting and trashy...but I told her I would give it a try. I was surprised and very impressed by Francine's writing, the book had romance, suspense, love, all of that and NONE of it was degrading or nasty to read. I love this book!! It tells the story of Hosea and Gomer from the Bible. The story is set in the midwest in a gold mining town. I got so frustrated with Angel, she was so stubborn. By reading the book I saw the kind of love God has for me. It is overwhelming!! I have anther of her books, Unshaken which tells the story of Ruth. I can't wait to read it!! God bless you all!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've ever read!","review":"Redeeming Love inspires me to attempt to love my husband as Michael Hosea loved Sarah. A beautiful example of what God intended for the love between a husband and wife to be. This story is thought provoking, inspiring and kept me wanting to read on for hours. Rarely have a read a book and gone looking for another by the same author. I'm almost to the end of my second Francine Rivers novel and will by buying another before leaving this web site. I just can't seem to put the book down. Amazon has beat the lowest prices I've seen by almost 25%. I paid $7.00 more for one of Ms. River's books than Amazon's pricing. This is my first trip to Amazon.com and I'll be back regularly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love","review":"The book is probably my favorite of all time. It is heart-wrenching, and there are times I didn't think I could get through it. But I pushed through an dam SOO glad I did. WOW this is an amazing writer and has created characters and a story line that I will never, EVER forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about Redemption....","review":"I have NEVER read a romance novel until I read this, and I was hesitant about reading this book. A friend gave me a copy for Christmas last year, and it sat on my shelf for almost a year until I decided I should probably give it a try since so many people raved about it. I typically read non-fiction books about biblical topics or about our Christian forefathers, and never was interested in reading anything having to do with romance or fiction. But it was a great read, and I read it in 3 days...which I never do with any book. It was easy to read and had a great message of redemption throughout it's core. She's a great author and now I'm starting the Scarlet Thread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good update on Gomer of Hosea","review":"Very easy read. Captured the tragedy, sinfulness, and need of a broken and abused woman. Helped frame my understanding of the biblical Gomer and Hosea better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Christian Fiction","review":"I am tired of reading reviews complaining about about the negative stuff in this book. That is how the world is. That is how child prostitution is. I commend Francine Rivers for writing a Christian book that isn't full of happiness and fluff. News Flash: The world isn't happiness and rainbows, no matter how much other Christian authors seem to think so! Angel is a refreshingly strong female after so many wimpy and winy girls you read about in other Christian books. Rivers is one of the only Christian authors I read anymore. Her novels are realistic. They don't hid things because they're \\"offensive.\\" Child prostitution is a sad and horrible thing. Everyone should read about it. Gaining knowledge of these issues is the least we can do for those women and girls actually going through them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I just read this book for the first time and I must say, if you haven't read it, READ IT! It is a powerful, powerful book. Not just an interesting story or an entertaining read, but a book woven with truth that spoke to me on a deep level. It's hard to explain, but what is in that book resonates deep within you. Read it, and read the WHOLE thing. It really blessed me and refreshed my spirit. Reading it, I was sucked into the story, then shaken to my core by it's message, them uplifted to glorious heights of joy by the truth woven into the story. This is undoubtedly one of the most meaningful and eye opening books I've ever read. Francine Rivers has a gift. A gift for weaving God and His truth into story in such a powerful way that it leaves you feeling breathless in wonder and delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Compelling Story! Couldn't put down!!","review":"I got this book on the recomendation of a few friends. I was really drawn into the story from the first pages. I couldn't put it down. Then I had to go to my bible and read Hosea, I'd never paid too much attention to that book of the bible! Wow! Thanks Francine for another awesome book with the message of Redeeming Love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally gripping","review":"I first read this a couple years ago, and am now listening to the audiobook (it's all I can do sometimes to not let my jaw drop at some parts when listening to it on my commute). This book has grabbed my emotions. I found myself getting mad at Paul for judging Angel, and amazed at Michael's patience. Most of all, I ache for Angel (Sarah) and the things done to her both in her childhood and adulthood. I believe God led me to this book again, because Angel's resistance to Michael Hosea's love reminds me of my resistance to God's love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put it Down, A Must Read","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and having never read a Francine Rivers novel I didn't know what to expect. I absolutely could not put it down and have gone on to read most of her other books. It is a great love story about forgiveness, faith, and a love that endures. It also reminds us to listen to that inner voice that guides us. I would rank this book right up their with one of my other favorites, The Notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read and message.","review":"Many surprises in this book. It was a very enjoyable read and good message! You will not be disappointed in this one. I wish all of our daughters would read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This was a \\"can't put down read\\" from beginning to end. Francine had me captivated in each chapter to see how events would pan out.The characters thoughts and reactions were genuine and something everyone can relate to. The story is a wonderful parallel of a marriage between man & wife compared with the wonderful, faithful, unconditional, sacrificial love of Christ (the bridegroom) for His Church, His people and those He calls upon, (the bride).Francine Rivers was successful in reminding/showing me how awesome God's love really is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It is a strong book I don't think many people can read it. There is so much suffering but I have to say it was the first book i read from River\`s and I love the way she writes so much emotions. Her books are very emotional and strong but above all very real and honest. River\`s writes with so much honesty in this book of how much we fail as individuals and only God\`s love and grace can really save us no other person can love you more or show you more mercy than God and his love.P.S. Her books are not preachy! at least not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!!!","review":"This book was like food to my soul. Several feelings or thoughts the main character have, many women can relate to.

It is one of her older books and reminded me how much I loved her stories and her heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative","review":"This is an imaginative and peculiar story. For the most part it was interesting and did not drag. Angel, as one who was afraid to love, spoke to me, as one who is all too often afraid to trust God."},{"rating":"2","title":"honest on my life, this is THE best book","review":"Seriously. I had never read one Francine Rivers book in my life before Redeeming Love. I had never even heard of the author! Now, I am here, on Amazon, searching for and buying up every single Francine Rivers book I can lay my hands on. Redeeming Love was simply incredible. I started it Saturday morning, finished it Saturday night. In the course of one week, following that Saturday, I have completely finished her Mark of the Lion trilogy, and now am more convinced of her extreme talent for literature. I HIGHLY recommmend this book. It makes you feel every emotion to your very core. Humor, Sorrow, Pain, Sympathy, and Sheer Joy just flow from the words on the page! Just Wow. I mean, WOW. :) Two words: \\"buy it\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love","review":"This book was the best book I've read since the Bible. I couldn't put it down.

Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read!","review":"Redeeming Love, by Francine Rivers, is absolutely the best Christian fiction book I've ever read. I could not put it down. I would recommend it as a gift for anyone who enjoys reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. It was rough sometimes but so is life. I would get mad at Michael for taking her back over and over again. until I put myself in that position and thought about how often God forgives me and takes me back over and over again. I got mad at Angel for leaving him and kept thinking why are you leaving someone who loves you so unconditionally, until I thought about myself and how many times I have gone off and done what I want to do. This book just made me think about my life and my relationship with God. It was truly life changing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Writing","review":"Such a beautifully written book. This was my second time to read it. It's been a couple of years. The things that happen to all of us in life can and will shape the way we view ourselves and the world around us. This book takes us through the journey of the pains and horrors of a young girls life and though the things that happened to her were not of her choice, she is given the choice by God to stop allowing the damage to hurt her forever.God reaches out to pull her out of the muck and mire, but is she willing to reach out and take His hand. So many of us blame God and wonder why did He allow this. This girl has many barriersbuilt for protection, will she begin trusting what God says about her. This story takes you through that process of the mind and the strongholds she must fight against in order to bring about a different life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely exquisite","review":"Has to be one of my all time favorite books. Moving, inspiring, Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Read","review":"Normally, I am not a fan of fictionalized Bible stories. By and large I have found that although they are based on great truths and principles, to me they just don't seem very realistic. I've never identified with the characters or hurt for them. THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT. Your heart will beat faster. You will want to cry for these people. You will be overjoyed to see them discover and re-discover God's amazing, redeming grace. The editorial reviews do not do this book justice. This is one of those books that, when you finish the last chapter, you want to open it up and start all over again. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Amazing Amazing","review":"Redeeming Love is by far the best book I have ever read. I couldn't put it down from the moment I started reading.

I would totally recomend this book to everyone who would take the time to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read on unconditional love and grace!","review":"Francine Rivers is my favorite author by far and she outdoes herself in this touching novel of grace, unconditional love and marriage! I read it in one sitting (all night) and have recommended it to all of my friends, especially the married ones. I simply loved this book and will forever be changed by what I learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"can you say unequally yoked?","review":"Why would God choose a prostitute to be the wife of one of His own? Isn't Rivers writing about the same God that tells us not to be unequally yoked. I have loved her other writings but found this to be a disturbing book. There are other ways to get this same message across. I wish I hadn't polluted my mind with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redeeming Love","review":"How many times can you say the same thing!

However, once I started I couldn't put it down and read it in 3 days. I read it everywhere, every chance I got. I even read it while waiting in the drive-thru.I can't even explain how amazing it is. Michael's unconditional love for Sarah and his faith in God assured me that the right man is out there I just need to pray and I will surely find him. I loved the bible references and how although it was a romance novel, it also showed the love of God.I believe that everyone woman, no matter where they are in their lives and where they are in their relationship with the Lord should read this book. Its an incredible book that you will never put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly best book I\\"ve read","review":"I just finished this book last week. I think the only thing I don't like about this book was the way it ended. It had a happy ending and all but this book was so good that I believe the author could have gotten a few more novels out of what happens the rest of Angels life. This is a book with Christian values and I was very skeptical when I got this book as a gift from my sister. I like romance books but not the raunchy kind and my sister kept pestering me so I finally read it and couldn't put it down--quite literally. It's a romance book in a way b/c the main character finds the best romances you can have, with your spouse and with God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love","review":"Redeeming LoveRedeeming Love is one of the best novels I have ever read! A little painful in the beginning but then I could hardly put it down. It is a beautiful story of the enduring power of God's Love.

The wording is simple and beautiful and transcends the reader through Angel and Michael's lives. It's a book about tolerance and forgiveness and the grace of God.I recommend this book to everyone, not just Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best way to see God's redeeming love","review":"This book was so incredible. It showed God's unfailing and merciful love through fictional characters. You won't regret reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love","review":"I have never, ever read a romantic novel in my over four decades on this earth. I have never been a fan of Christian fiction. But boy, did this book prove me wrong. I first found it at the library, and picked it up because a friend (half my age) had recommended it, so I read it out of curiousity. I fell so in love with this story, that I ran straight to Amazon to purchase my own copy, and also one for a friend. That's how well written this story is. It started out interestingly enough, got better as it went on, and then I couldn't put it down. By the end of the book, I was weeping, and that is a brand new experience for me. I have never cried from reading a book. This is one I intend to read over and over again, and never lose my personal copy. I'm not as big a fan of Ms. Rivers' other books, but this one sure takes the cake. I couldn't recommend this book any higher. It is my most favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I bought this book for my wife. She wanted it to take on an upcoming cruise. Well the book will not make it on the cruise. She says she can't put it down. She is not much for reading other than what applies to her job or Bible study. This book has definitely changed her reading habits. She said she thoroughly enjoys reading the book and hopes to read more by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"Friends highly recommended that I read this book. I never realized what a difference in taste we have in literature. This story reminds me of those romance novels that have the beautiful women and handsome men on the cover. The story was repetitive. Ms Rivers used more detail describing her characters' looks than developing them into real people. The storekeeper and the restaurant owner were more interesting than anybody else was. But at least she kept it clean. She told us what was going on without lurid detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story!","review":"I loved this story so much. I was hooked immediately. This is my first book by this author and I found it absolutely delightful. I only wish the author would have elaborated about their intimacy rather than skipping over it and allowing the reader to use their imagination. Other than that it was fantastic whether you're a Christian or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite novelist","review":"What a story of unconditional love and sacrifice.

The book of Hosea expresses this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an AWESOME book!!!","review":"This was the first book that I read of Francine Rivers. Oh my...what a book. Since I was only vaguely familiar with the story line... it was such a love story. Michael loved God with all his heart and soul. He depended on him completely. The way God guided Michael to Angel...the way he kept guiding him to her over and over again. Angel running off and coming back again. Michael forgave her over and over again. I loved the way God spoke out in this book. I felt sometimes he was talking to me too. This was such an uplifting story. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!! I hated that it ever had to end!","review":"This is the first book I've read by Francine Rivers, and I have to say I've already ordered more of her books.

Anybody who doubts that really needs to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartwarming and refreshing","review":"A friend asked me to read this book. I am so glad that she introduced me to this book and author. It was one of the best books I have read. It was an easy read and a refreshing love story. True love story paralled to a biblical story.

Tifani had raved about it so much and assured me that I would love it, but after about a year, I let my mom read it kind of as a guinea pig. ( We tend to love the same books ) Well, this is not normally her kind of book but she told me it was one of the most fantastic memorable books that she has ever read, so of course I read it.

However, after reading it and letting it sink in it impacted me in ways I couldn't imagine. If you're looking for an incredible story of what God's love would look like in real life- this is it. If you want a story of what men of God can really become- this is it. It's a classic story of change that would never happen without God. The story will turn your stomach in knots with the lead characters selfish actions, while constantly reminding you why she is who she is. God is the answer of course, but he doesn't slap her with a Bible or whisper in the wind- He's alive in this book in ways I've never read. His works and His will are done and things HAPPEN. Powerful. Wonderful story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I loved this book. It was absolutely beautifully written and discussed issues that do not normally occur in \\"Christian\\" books.

After the sale something urged me to see if the book had sold. I redeemed the book from the box of unwanted books and decided to take it home and read it. I couldnt put it down. I gave up trying not to cry as I realized how many other Gods I had been putting in front of Jesus Christ. I see Gomer and Hosea in a totally different light. I no longer question why God can take someone so unclean and make them whiter than snow. I will pass this book on. I believe God speaks to us just like the book says.

I was overwhelmed by God's unconditional love!","review":"The author has such a compelling way of drawing her readers into the setting. She makes you feel the joy and the pain of the characters.

God Bless you, Francine Rivers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A life touching story....","review":"I love this book. I believe this book to be Mrs. Rivers best peice.

I received this book from a cousin of mine who said I had to read it, I wasn't expecting much and sort of thought it might be boring. The eloquence of her writing captivating me to the point where I did not want to stop reading, I even had a frustrated husband telling me to stop reading, come to bed. This book has reinstated my relationship with the Lord and I am so thankful. I look forward to reading more of Francine's novels. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love","review":"I am like others, this book needs to have a rating of 10 stars instead of just a measly 5. I have read this book 6 times.It is so worn. I've loaned it out several more times.I make sure they return it.My husband bought me a new one and I loaned it out and never saw it again. I still have my old one but I'm afraid to open it that I might tear it, so I am buying a new one again,because I want to read it again. Yes, the one person was appalled at how blunt it was for a \\"christain\\" book, but sometimes even we Christians need bluntness to awaken our own shame and backslidings that God ALWAYS forgives us for.I also agree that it needs to be required reading for high schoolers.They watch enough \\"R\\" rated shows on TV that this would be something to show them Gods true love and forgiveness and that the many trials that teenagers are going through that He is there for them no matter what.I could go on and on about this book, but you need to read it for yourself and FEEL His love for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Francine, I'm disappointed!","review":"I have read Francine River's Mark of the Lion series and it was life changing,(I highly recommend it!) so when a couple of friends suggested 'Redeeming Love', I said, \\"Oh yeah!\\"I admit it started out interesting but when it got to the part where the \\"hero\\" found her, it just went on and on,with the teasing of will she or won't she give in to her hero. Also, will her hero win her? It was boring and it did not capture my interest. I found myself skipping pages to get to the good part but it never came. I can't believe that my review is so different than the others and I would really be embarrassed if I ever met Francine Rivers in person, because I know she's a real Christian! I love you Francine! I just don't like this book! I also read another book about 10 years ago and loved, loved it, and I will continue to check out other books she has written because I believe in her writing! Like I said, Mark of the Lion!!! You must read that!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance Novel","review":"I am so sorry I bought this book. I am 80% through it and I can't believe Angel is leaving Michael once again. I want to smack her. To me this is just a romance novel missing the detailed sexual descriptions. Blah Blah they love each other but she fights it; it's the same old love story. Any reference to God and Christian love - I'm not buying it like a real story of God and Christian love; unfortunately, that's why I bought it. For a real story like that read \\"Rising from the Ashes\\" of the Rwandan Genocide by Immaculee Ilibagiza - something I recently read; now that book blew me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redeeming Love","review":"Our church book club selected this book based on the reviews from Amazon. This is the first time I have felt let down by Amazon. The way our book club works, we give a book a rating on a scale of 1-10 before we discuss the book. The book received mostly a 3 with one member refusing to finish the book.This is basically an OK romance novel. It became quite preachy and predictable-except the end which was over the top. Would not recommend it anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"I read The Last Sin Eater several years ago and was delighted to find that there was another book by Francine Rivers.One thing I do not like in novels is the constant repeating of what has gone on before in the story. While I do understand that the author was trying to show what Angel's mindset was like, I found the repetition tedious.Actually, if I had understood it was a romance novel I probably would not have bought it.What did I do with this book once I was finished reading it? Threw it in the trash. My pastor's wife thought thatHavah: The Story of Eve/A Novelwas too graphic. She would not like this novel at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christian Harlequin Romance","review":"Book was in great condition, probably because nobody read it. I got it for a book club and was not at all impressed. The story could have been told in half as many pages, the characters were unbelievable. Would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and repetitive","review":"This author was recommended to me by my hair stylist, but I can't imagine why. I found the book to be boring, immature, and repetitive. Although it started out with an interesting premise, it soon just kept repeating the same theme over and over. I had to force myself to finish it, especially when the author decided to add Biblical teachings and it went from bad to worse. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Woth the Time or Cost","review":"Altho I am a devout Christian, the frequent indications that God had 'spoken' to the main characters is repetitive and annoying; the advancement of the romance between the sub-characters was SO disjointed in the literary sense and so unrealistic and out of touch with Christian mores dominent in this story, that it appears as a 'rushed filler ending' by the author. This novel was waaaaay too long and preachy.I would not read another novel by Francine Rivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had some issues with this one....","review":"I could not wait to read this book since it had so many rave reviews. I usually don't read reviews in detail until after I read the book because I hate spoilers. I mainly look at the titles of the reviews and the average rating to help me decide if it is a book that I will deem worthy of my time. That said I have to say I was disappointed. I just found so many events disturbing, and most of all extremely unromantic! While reading this book, I kept hoping that Micheal would end up with Mirium! I get that everyone deserves love and forgiveness, but Sarah needed more. Sleeping with your father??? EWW...WTH is wrong with you? How is that revenge?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This was the first book I had read by Francine Rivers, and it was awesome. At first I was slightly hesitant about reading it (I had recently read a book by a new author and it had greatly disappointed me). But I'm so glad I did. Francine Rivers has a great way of writing books. What a special talent. At first I thought it was sad that Angel kept leaving Michael, but by the time I finished reading it I was quite satisfied. I was talking about it for days afterwards. I must've told my mom about hundreds of times abou how great a book it was (I think I gave her a serious headache). I love laughing and crying with the characters in the book I'm reading. Redeeming Love had all of that and so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love","review":"One of the best books Francine Rivers has written. What faith in the life of Michael Hosea.

Redeeming Love was one of the most incredible books I have ever read. It allowed me to see reason where I thought there was none. It helped me see how the Lord can work in such wonderful ways even if at the time you don't understand why. I was able to read this book at the perfect time in my life. Maybe it will be the same for you.

No on to love her or care for her in a non-sexual way. I spent several evenings crying tears of pain for little Angel and finally tears of joy for Sarah. It was a rarity to read a book that the entire theme of the book was about Lord Jesus and his desire to save each and everyone of us if we would take the time to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FANTASTIC BOOK!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book & HIGHLY recommended it to all!!!

Wow! I was very wrong, I didn't want to put the book down, and at the same time I didn't want it to end. This book is about Michael and Angel. Angel, by the age of eighteen, has lived a horrible life, her only reason to live was to be free. Michael, on the other heand, is a strong and handsome man that lives by the word of God.The book takes you to a span of four years,but so many things happen that your feelings change with the turning of every page.This book is also good to read and discuss in a group. As I read, my feelings for my husband were rekindled,and was happy just to be next to him. I highly recommend this book, Read it and be prepared to weep, repent and rejoice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by a friend","review":"This book was recommended by a friend. She said it was the best book she had ever read. I thought it was good, too, maybe not the BEST book I ever read, but certainly enjoyable. The dialogue was great and it really was much more than just your average Christian romance novel. Certainly written for the adult crowd, perhaps a bit racy for teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love: A Novel by Francine Rivers","review":"Great story... it kept me interested right to the end and wanting more.

Little did I know that I would be reading about the sweetest romance of all.It is a great story, and I suggest both men and women read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite book","review":"This is truly the best book I have ever read. I must admit I was skeptical, as I am not a very religious person so to speak, but this is truly the most beautifully written love story I have ever read. Not only a love story, but a story of redemption and trust, it is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"I was encouraged by numberous friends (and a few strangers) to read this book.

Its absolutely the best book I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most meaningful Christian fiction I've ever read","review":"A friend gave me this book to read and I was reluctant because of the cover, since I don't read romance novels and thought this must be one. It turned out to be the most meaningful book I've read in a while. I got lost in the book, falling in love with one main character and relating to and hurting for the other. I learned through this book of my own negative attitude toward men and relationships, and my need for a softened and more vulnerable heart. My heart, like that of Angel in the book, has been hardened by past and present pain. Michael Hosea, a man of God, was able to be faithful and love her unconditionally. The book is based on the book of Hosea which makes it even more powerful and believable. It's a must!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!","review":"To give you an idea of how this book affected me, I have been an Amazon user for years and this is the first review I have ever left.I actually bought this book somewhere else and only bought by it accident. I was really after another book that had no Christian leanings. I found this book by accident and hoped I would have a good weekend read. I started at about 9 or 10 pm Friday night and didn't stop until 5:30 am Saturday morning. After reading this I read some in my Bible to cofirm some of what the book talked about and I cried for I think a good hour or so after I read the book.This book shows a beautiful example of God's love for us.This is suprisingly the best book I read have on accident in my life. I have never read anyting by this author, but I will definately check out her other work.Note: The NIV refernces are ok, but to get the beauty of the verses quoted check out the KJV of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers","review":"I read this book to my sister-in-law while she was recovering from surgury.

It definitely made me think about my relationship with God. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian adult romance","review":"This is a Christian romance with lots of preaching and teaching of God and his love. This is also a very tough book with lots of emotion and hard subjects. These books are for adults with adult situations but are kept clean, like a pg13 level. I liked Angel she was a good character. The way they came to be married was a little far fetched and there was a little more drama then was necessary. But overall I liked it and it was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!","review":"This book really surprised me. This book is fantastic on every level. It is so good that I don't think I can list why without writing a book of my own.I will tell you this. I expected a light, fluffy romance novel. Maybe even a little corny. I only read it because I thought it might be mildly entertaining and my daughter was reading it.I couldn't have been more wrong on all counts. This book far exceeded all of my expectations. This book is deep, well written, has an incredible theme, does not hide the realities of human nature or underestimate human potential for both good and evil.BTW, my daughter (mid-teens) loved it too. But, I would not recommend this book for pre-teens, or even emotionally immature teens. This book deals with some very harsh topics...something else I didn't expect.I hope they make a movie some day. So, I can tell everyone the book was better. :-)Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!","review":"If 10 stars were possible, this one would get them all.

This is an unequivocal MUST-READ for everyone! Don't miss it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly!","review":"After reading all the reviews, I just had to get this book. After all, everyone just has the most glowing things to say about it. I am agog. This is just a terrible book. The characters aren't interesting and there is nothing challenging about it. Obviously, I am just not getting why everyone loves this book so much, but the writing is average, the characters forgettable and completely boring. I simply do not understand why this book had garnered so much praise! Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I will not read any more novels by this author","review":"This was definitely not what I was expecting.

Had I read the reviews I would never have bought it. Then I would have known that it was all about religious do goodies. I really hate mixing religion with romance. Instead I could have read about the good Samaritan had I wanted to. Typical American releious crap. Now I know better. So never again a book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Extremely boring book. And pathetic too. There are no surprises in this book. Just after reading 10 pages you know how it will end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"The most powerful novel I have ever read, and I've read many! This book took me through the most incredible journey, emotional AND spiritual, and reminded me of just how precious each of us are in God's sight! The characters are utterly real and the story is a beautiful testimony of how God's grace, forgiveness, and strength can work miracles in our lives and the lives of those around us if only we believe! This is the love story that all of us dream of coming true. Michael Hosea is an uncommon man of integrity, strength, humility, honor and commitment that every woman, even those with a dark history, deserves as a husband! I highly recommend this book for Christians and non-Christians alike, as it puts the Gospel of Christ in a real-life setting that everyone can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"This book touched my heart in a way no other has. It is an emotional ride that ends in happy tears. I would highly recommend this book, to believers and non-believers alike.

Michael Hosea is a man after every woman's heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love Book Review","review":"This was the BEST book I have ever read, and so I've heard from other friends. Francine Rivers has such a unique way of putting together Biblical truths with real life kind of stories, including tragedy, death, love, encouragement, spiritual battles and joy, along with constantly wanting to know what will happen next. She is an award winning author in my opinion and herbook(s)have changed my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"This book has been my favorie of all the books I've read, it was very hard to put down, when I was reading and someone wanted me to do something, I would get annoyed.Everyone reader in my house has enjoyed this book, I finally picked it up and started on it.

I have never had a book effect me the way that this one did. I was sitting beside my husband in the bed when I finished it and I was crying so that I almost couldn't get it together.(I am fairly easy to cry ) I also have just finished it for the second time and it was just as good this time too. I have now read just about all of Francine Rivers books and they are all good but this one is the best by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This is such an amazing story about God, the Father's love for us.

It was recommended by several coworkers and so I read it and loved it. Gave it as a gift to family at Christmas and they loved it too. I typically don't venture from Nicholas Sparks but this book was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless/Timely picture of God's love","review":"'Redeeming Love' is both timeless and timely. I found myself nodding (affirmatively) as redemption becomes a reality for 'Angel'. Francine Rivers portrays so intimately God's personal, diffinitive, non-religious love for us in Michael, Miriam and eventually in Paul. As the wife of an author (and preliminary editor)I understand the skill of writing. After reading only two books written by Francine I can tell I will be devoted to reading all others written by her. I particularly love the message thatGod is committed to meeting us all in our own places of need. There are many insinuations that the 'religious habits' of our various cultures are weak at best.....that we need to hear thepertinent, 'individual' voice of God in our lives in order for Him to guide us moment by moment and step by step. .....A thoroughly thought provocative read and challenge. Thank you.Pearl Toews email: pctoews@mb.sympatico.ca"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting For The Sequel","review":"Redeeming Love is set in the California Gold Rush era of the late 1840's and early 1850's. This is a historical romance novel with a religious theme. This book will be entertaining, informative, thought provoking and uplifting for a Christian reader. A non Christian reader will have to settle for three out of four.Although the story line is entirely predictable, author Francine Rivers tells it so well that the reader is drawn into the tale and can hardly wait for the inevitable to happen. The subject matter is PG-13, thus not appropriate for all readers.I hope a sequel is written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read Redeeming Love","review":"If you have not read this book, please do so as soon as possible.

So Redeeming Love should be a great pick for her as a Christian novel. I just love Francine Rivers books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love story disguised with redemption","review":"This was nothing more than a poor rendition of a love story that focuses on sex but has God speaking to the main characters. Can you imagine Hosea as super man? This is so formulaic that it was difficult to read; you knew early on the outcome. No surprises; everyone lives happily ever after. Psychologically, there are some flaws in this but she did get it right on some level and that is \\"Angel\\" needed to be set free. I only read it because of a friend who wanted us to read it for book club, but all of us are laughing and worrying how to tell her how bad it was. Please, there is better literature out there that has God interspersed in it. If you want redemption, then read the Christian Bible and you will understand how to be redeemed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture of Redemption","review":"As with many titles I have read by Francine Rivers, I could not put this down! She gives a great picture of redemption and love. It is such a picture of Christ's love for us. This book is not for the light hearted though as Angel struggles with her past of human trafficking and prostitution. If you like this book, I suggest Kimberly Rae's series Stolen (Stolen Woman, Stolen Child and Stolen Future)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put this book down!","review":"I must say first off I'm not a reader at all! To be honest, I've never sat down to just read a book for pleasure. I was drawn to this book so I bought it. I bought it and downloaded it to my touchpad. I thought, well I will just read a few chapters before bed. Well that didn't happen as I planned! I literally could not stop reading it. I stopped for few hours of sleep but that was it! I read the book straight through! What an inspirational story! I truly feel God had his hand on me the whole time I was reading. It has forever changed me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I absolutely love this book and thing that both man and women should read it, it really touched my heart and I found my self completely indulged in it, it was recommend by a good friend and I recommend it to everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing evidence of God's amazing love","review":"The book was a definate \\"hard to put down\\" story of God's amazing love and how it can and should be manifested in our own lives.

I picked this book up at my local library weeks ago read the first few pages and then took it back without finishing it. I then went back to the library and picked it up again my bookmark was still on the page I stopped at. And this time I must say I couldnt put it down it is truly a wonderful book. There is child prostitution in it and through out the book, but it is written with so much taste I honestly finished it in like 2 days time. Do read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful! I couldn't put it down!","review":"Angel is a young women who has hasn't felt loved or wanted since her mother died when Angel was eight. After years of prostitution, she has given up on life and when Micheal Hosea shows up asking her to marry him, she thinks he's lost his mind. Eventually, there comes a point at which she has no choice but to accept his offer, but a lifetime of insecurity does not disappear with a wedding ring.Angel runs back to the life she knows but Michael faithfully comes for her. However, she runs again, believing that she can never be what a man like Michael needs in a wife. Until she opens herself to God's love and forgiveness, she thinks she'll never be good enough for a decent, loving man like Michael.This is a beautiful story of faith and unconditional love. I love all the little things Michael says and does to show her she is loved and worthy.I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Redeeming Love","review":"At first, I thought Redeeming Love was going to be hokey, but it ministered to my spirit and turned out to be a gripping read! I haven't found a Christian fiction author whose works I've enjoyed in quite a while. This book now tops my list of favorite books. It is a novel based on the relationship between Hosea and Gomor, but is set in the early to mid 1800s. The story drips with the love of God. This book catapulted me in a positive direction. It completely changed my understanding of love in my own marriage and gave me a new perspective on God's love for me. I cried and cried while reading this book.

There are some \\"period\\" phrasing errors but they never once take away from this moving adaptation of the story of Hosea. I've found a new respect for my marriage and for the ideal of and need for forgiveness. Fairytale or not this story I've lived and now I can believe. It's not a \\"preachy\\" story--it is an awakening for redemption, salvation , and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers","review":"I heard this book was good so I pick it up at a christian book store. Now, I'm not an advit reader even on a good day, but When I began to read this story I couldn't put it down.It touched places in my heart that I had forgotton or had been tucked away in hidden places.It brought out cutain truths about what was in my own heart that I couldn't deny any longer, about me, about relationships in my own life.Thank You, Francine Rivers, for allowing the Lord to write this book threw you.I guess we all want a Michael Hosea as husbands in our real realtionships and sometimes as wifes we act like Angel.I found myself never wanting the story to end but I guess with Jesus, it never does, it goes on for enternity.Thank You So Much for this Book..it Truley gave me Hope Again!!!I would recommend this novel to anyone who like to go on a journey of the heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating","review":"Wow, I am blown away by the almost 800 reviews, with only a tiny fraction of them one-star reviews. I gave this book to my mother-in-law before reading it, based solely on the positive reviews. She read the entire book, but mentioned it was shockingly tragic and disturbing in ways. I began reading it myself and was embarrassed that I gave it to her. Some of the images the book draws about prostitution, young girls, etc are truly upsetting. The writing style is almost unbearable and repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. I don't agree at all with the author's idea of God and how He \\"talks\\" to Michael. And Michael blindly listens in spite of all reason. It's simply infuriating. Angel is just dumb, dumb, dumb. I am almost finished with the book and can't wait to be done with it so I can finally move on to a better book. Awful fiction, I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This is what was called a \\"pot boiler\\" in earlier years. I don't understand how or why a Christian publisher agreed to publish this book. This is pure and unadulterated porn. I see nothing redeeming about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A degredation to women","review":"If you are up for a book where God instructs a man to \\"save\\" a woman from a life of prostitution look no further. How is she saved? Going to college? Counseling with a spiritual leader? Helping other women get out of the profession? She is saved by forcefully taken into marriage and THEN forced to live/work on a farm 30 miles from the nearest town. When she escapes as she DOESN'T WANT THIS LIFE the husband continually brings her back to the farm (as God has instructed him to.) I was nearly sick reading the images of a child being forced into repeated rape at 8 years old. And then subsequent images of more rape, beatings, prostitution ... all through the perspective of one-dimensional characters (who the author doesn't let you forget are gorgeous, mind you.) Believing this hogwash is Christian or romance is sick. I finally had to STOP torturing myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crosses the Line","review":"This book came across to me as a Christian's excuse to read smut. One could write a similar story full of sexual details about David and Bathsheba, but I don't think it would honor God. I realize the author was trying to portray the theme of amazing forgiveness, but it got lost for me somewhere in all the sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much redeeming about this book","review":"This book was pure drudgery to read. The characters were one dimensional and the plot was so obvious it stung me between the eyes. (Michael HOSEA is the main character in a retelling of the story of Hosea? Come on! Is that the best you can do? ). This is just one example of the lack of creativity and originality of this book. Awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This book is wonderful. It was very encouraging and uplifting. I loved how it paralleled the Bible so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"I own this book and have read it many, many times!! It is most definitely my favorite book. Once you start reading it, it's very hard to stop. It's such a good story alone, but with it being paralelled to God's love for us - it makes it that much better. I definitely recommend reading this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Hosea","review":"This story is supposed to be based on the biblical book of Hosea but I found the author strayed a long way from it. First, there was no use of little girls in the biblical story at all and I found no need for that subject in a Christian book. I just found it a very strange, frustrating and disturbing book to follow. Slow and wordy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful message","review":"This book was recommended to me by my 20 yr. old daughter. I pick it up and couldn't put it down. What a riveting story line. Upon finishing the bk I went to God's Word and read the story of Hosea with a new set of eyes. Its a powerful message of long-suffering, patience and true love. I was so impressed with the quality of the message I bought, A Voice in the Wind, another powerful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little- too heavy on religion.","review":"A friend who is a born again Christian, recommended this book highly. It is a fine book however, although i am a Christian, attend church weekly, it was slightly \\"over the top for me\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have picked up in a long time!!!!","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down. I read it within three days. It is a powerful story told by a magnificent story teller. While the story line was taken from the book of Hosea, you don't think of that while you are reading. Rather you are captured and engrossed by the characters and story. Francine Rivers does such a complete and excellent job of developing the characters . . . there is a suspense and mystique created, and while you may not be able to relate to a prostitute or a man who is dedicated to one, you find yourself relating to the characters completely!! What a story!! If you havent' read it, pick it up, but be sure you don't have anything else to do for a while, it's hard to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST Read!!","review":"Everyone I know that has read this has recommended it to someone else to read.

I also enjoyed ordering from Amazon.com, and having it shipped right to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another romance novel","review":"I bought this hoping to find a powerful story of Christian love and was pretty disappointed. It was just like any romance novel, sprinkling the \\"voice of God\\" around everywhere to justify their actions. Unbiblical and self-indulgent. Slightly better written than Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I am astounded at the numerous 5-star reviews for this book! It's downright cheesy, and reads like an 8th-grade creative writing project. I can't even finish it. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does she..Does she not..Does she...Does she not...repeat","review":"This book has some good points and it does really have some insightful wisdom, but I guess to me it seemed like you were at a stand still for the good majority of the book with some small up's and downs that just let you feeling like you were back at the beginning again. I actually found myself irritated at times during this book which I've never really experienced reading a book before. Last words: it's long, it's repetitive and well...I hope you like it better than I did..truly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I had hoped or was told...","review":"A bunch of my friends (all females) were raving about this book, telling me I needed to read it. When I looked at the cover, I (being a guy) asked, \\"are you sure a guy would enjoy this?\\" They all assured me a guy would. Well, I finished chapter 1 last night and I can tell you I won't be reading the rest of the book. I would've stopped after page 10 of the prologue except that I wanted to give the book a chance, and I trusted my friends. No offense, but it's definitely a book written for women, and it has a commercial fiction feel to it that I honestly can't stand. I know the story is beautiful, but you can read that story - the inspired one - in the Bible for free, and it will probably be more powerful. To each his (or her) own, but I honestly just can't stand this genre, and anyone who tends to gravitate towards the classics would probably be bothered by the cliches and stock characters in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Read","review":"I highly recommend reading \\"Redeeming Love\\". It is a beautiful, compelling Christian love story- without simple answers. However, it may be too sexually suggestive for teenagers and men that struggle with being tempted by sexual accounts. The novel does not shy away from the gritty side of prostitution, or the delight of sexual experiences in marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate Love","review":"This was only the second book by Francine that I've read and I must say, it's one of the best books I have ever read in my life! God spoke to my heart all through the book and made me realize how passionate His love is for His bride! I could not put this book down. For two days my nose was in this book every chance I got. I could SO identify with Sarah/Angel!!! I could understand why she felt the way she did about herself. Oh, to find a man like Michael in real life! The closest one I know personally is Jesus! Wonderful, WONDERFUL book!!! Now I must get busy reading her other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reedeming Love","review":"This book is amazing!

Secret: it is not a romance novel! Read it. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My New All Time Favorite!","review":"This book really impacted me and spoke to me about God's love for me. The theme of God continually taking you back and loving you even when you think you've done things that are unforgiveable, it brings amazing joy. I love how the author took the book of hosea from the bible and really made it real for me. This book was a definite page turner, i couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A picture of how God makes beauty from ashes","review":"Loved this book.

Buy it today.~~~Excellent readying material.!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncle!","review":"This is a very slim book - however, it could not keep my interest long enough to finish it. Reading this novella requires real dedication, because it has no chapters and no breaks.Planet 8 is besieged by drastic climate change, and the inhabitants change their entire society on the advice of Canopus, another, more advanced race. The buildup was incredibly slow, and I frequently found my eyes sliding off the page. I finally gave up when I found myself grinding my teeth at the thought of picking up the book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best relaxation, massage, meditation music i have foun","review":"I travel a lot on business and this cd is always in the cd case in my briefcase when i hit the road. Music from Big Sur literally kept me sane during a 13 hour plus flight from kennedy airport in nyc to taipei in taiwan. I highly recommend this music for anyone who wants to totally relax into a mind state that is peaceful but not boring, alert but relaxed, or if you want to feel your mind expanding into infinite space.

Price was ok but shipped to the front door who can complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unbelievable Trash","review":"With the main actress appearing like she's reading her lines the story of Horsey is poorly written, poorly directed, and has no believable emotion from any actor. Primarily about an artist who turns her back on her best friends to be with a junkie who is addicted to heroin. If you are interested in this type of movie recommend \\"Better Than Chocolate\\" as this is a real bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVI Freezes at random, no fix as of 2006/03/09","review":"I like this tv, but the DVI feed video freezes at random for a random amount of time.

I use it mainly to watch DVDs and DirecTV, I have recently purchased a Samsung Upconverter DVD and since my LCD is the new model it comes with a HDMI input, it is Amazing the Quality and clarity. The DVI freeze up could be true but as far as I'm concern the new models don't come with a DVI input you'll have to buy a HDMI to DVI cable and you can use this as a Monitor for your CPU.This LCD comes with technology that no other brands like Sony, Sharp and Samsung don't have.You have no idea how usefull the Swivel option is until you have itJust Buy it is Great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH. MY. GOD.","review":"Wow. Where do I even begin? The state of confusion is so intense, it is hypnotizing. From the moment they begin the movie, till the very end, you constantly ask yourself, \\"what the..?\\", or \\"what is going ON?!!\\" This movie is unforgettable. It's so different and so unusual and eccentric, you cannot take your eyes off of it. The main reason I sat through everything was in hopes that the movie will explain itself, or suddenly break back to reality and say, \\"ok, that was silly. now let's come to our homeland of the real world.\\" But no, and that is probably the best thing about this film. I was never so glad I sat through that much confusion in my life.

I would encourage anyone who may own the rights to produce this movie in DVD format."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Buy Only One Book about Julian","review":"This is the most athoritative modern biography of the nephew of Constantine the Great who was rased a Christian and turned to pagan beliefs in adulthood. Julian tried to revitalize paganism by giving what was a multitude of cults a organization that could compete with the Christian church. He ultimately failed, but the story of Julian's rise to power and the struggle that became his life's work is told here with a refreshing economy. This volume is the most complete biography of the Emperor without being the largest. This is the book you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to Pagan Intolerance","review":"I dove into this book after recently \\"discovering\\" the last pagan Roman Emperor, Julian the Apostate. I was pleasantly surprised to find an objective appraisal of an unpopular puritannical reactionary. I expected to read a romantic account of a leader who represented a dying religion. This book was an uncompromising account of the unrealistic ambitions of a man who was out of step with his times and the religious realities of his age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting biography of a controversial Roman emperor","review":"The fourth-century Roman Emperor Julian attempted the impossible: to stop the Christianization of the Roman Empire put into motion by Constantine the Great. Branded \\"the Apostate\\" by later critics, Julian reigned only about two years, dying in battle against the Persians. This is a balanced, accessible biography that captures the intensity of Julian's Hellenistic Paganism--an intensity that frequently bordered on fanaticism. Bowersock is careful not to romanticize Julian and notes that when he died, practically everyone in Rome breathed a sigh of relief. This is an interesting, well written work that should interest students of ancient history as well as those who enjoy reading about the history of early Christianity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey and pitiful plot disguised by lyrical descriptions","review":"Love it or hate it...I guess. What was the point to this story? Three women in varying states of coherent thought hold a priest hostage, abuse him and then when, convieniently, one of the women happens to be able to solve the issue at hand, they let him go? The plot was lame and obvious, the use of myth and story interesting at first and then it got really old, the mixing of pagan and religious story quite compelling but then rather overdone. I've never seen anything masquerade as a literary gem the way this seems to be. Send this book off to a remote island, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating.","review":"A poor excuse for literature with strong elements of Catholic-bashing, animism and witchcraft. Over 300 rambling pages of dementia and pathological squalor, both attributed to \\"faith\\". The main characters, three rotting nuns and a treacherous priest, are total degenerates. Excluding the sheep illustrated on its dust jacket, this book has no redeeming features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full bodied - subtle aroma","review":"Lucid prose, wonderfully rich characters and a readible story-line. Lots of smells are evoked. However, the book is best read in one sitting or over the fewest possible to maintain the mood (and interest).

Liked least: the periodic ramblings on weaving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Badly written, poor camera work, poorly staged, terrible dialog, lousy plot.

She's beautiful and a joy to watch from beginning to end. However the quality of the film is horrible, sometimes the lighting is too bright and sometimes too dark. If that's not bad enough, the sound quality makes it almost impossible to hear the dialoque; I had to watch it a few times to piece together the shaky story, which takes me to my next point, the plot. The plot was weak, but possibly could have been saved if they had a better screenplay.This film was disappointing for me, although it was great seeing the lovley Lola Falana in her prime, and of course Mean Joe Green!!!

In terms of pure appeal and versitility it is unrivalled in my opinion. Whether you want some smooth background beats for when you have guests for dinner, or to create the mood for that fine young thang you managed to get back to the crib, or even blazing up a blunt with your boys, it's all to be had on this record.

I try to sing along even though it sounds rediculous.When I have any songs from this album playing at my house, people generally inquire about it. It is so far outside the realm of what most people normally hear, I think it is a shock to their system.I have witnessed this album appeal to people with a wide variety of musical tastes.

The very nature of this album's title, a hangover from the 1950s field recording era, indicates both the scope and the drawbacks of this disc. It is a sweeping overview of Indian classical and folkloric styles, and as such it is alternately delightful and disappointing. Gathered by French ethnomusicologist Alain Danielou, these well-produced recordings capture many vibrant performances in a variety of styles. Yet as any fan of Indian music will tell you, two-to-three minutes is simply not enough time for most songs to properly develop, and while these are excellent examples of the music, they are not complete performances. But seen as a guide post to steer you into deeper exploration of Indian music, this is a very, very nice record.

Hank screams, talks, hollers, and mumbles, but he sure doesn't sing a note throughout the entire show, and he is horribly out of tune for the duration.The covers are all of a piece - atrocious rewrites that serve to prop up Hank's massive ego, and his frequent references to his truly talented father.The only saving grace is that I heard this fiasco before I ever plopped down any hard-earned pay at an actual show."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A SET OF CLUBS!","review":"Don't believe the title of 3-PW.

The distance from the base is lousy, it's hard to tell whether you have messages until you get right up to it (very dim display), and the handset audio is lousy.

(Maybe you have to be old enough to remember pre-TouchTone...) I never had any trouble with this phone at all, having had to replace a much older cordless phone that picked up too much outside noise. The sound was great, the batteries were plenty long-lived for home (and SOHO) use, and there was never any bleed-over when both lines were in use. And the complaints I've seen -- the beeping when you push the buttons, etc -- strike me as very trivial. Unfortunatly, my phone was recently fried by a nearby lightning strike, as were my modem and network card, and now I'm acquiring a DSL line, so I'm cutting back to a single phone line. I will probably replace my poor, dead phone with VTECH's model 2461 -- but if I still needed two lines, I would defintely replace it with another model 2960!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"When I first got this phone a year ago, I noticed a loud buzzing in the handset (like a chainsaw), unless you hold your finger on the charging contacts while talking, or if you use an add-on headset. This phone also laacks dual keypads, meaning you have to dial from the handset first, then turn on the base speakerphone later. I found this to be very inconvenient. Using a headset (not included) makes this a little less troublesome. The \\"backup battery\\" I installed in the base (an extra from VTech) doesn't retain the basic functions during a power outage (loses time anyways.) The second battery does allow you to make and answer calls when the power is out, though. Now, a year later, the phone cuts out occasionally, keeping you from hearing your party on the line, and has even disconnected about half a dozen calls now. I will NEVER buy a VTech cordless product again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"problem solved","review":"from time to time while talking on the phone I would pull the entire unit off the counter much to my husband's displeasure.

This book has the best dialogue between characters. They all have a different wit, which gives the book its rythym. The Jessie character is the Hollywood she-beast of them all and she and Ethan go at hammer and tongs at every turn. You can feel the tension that drives them and nothing is out of bounds so you will be shocked by their antics. But there are great loving moments throughout the book and the love/hate aspect of their relationship is fully realized. In a way it is even passed on into the next generation with a younger female replacement for her, so Ethan can be kept in a perpetual state of agitation throughout the book. Making him so low key compared to the high flying females, gives every outrageous event greater depth. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bed-time story that never gets old.","review":"This is probably the funnest book I've ever read in my life.

It blazes less than before, but is incredibly heartfelt and very powerful. So the rest of the collection goes; Night Ride is pretty calm but seems more logical and essentially \\"Sibelian\\" than most other performances. The sound is both clear and full. Rather than sounding efficiently generic, the LSO produces crystalline textures and broadly powerful climaxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recording","review":"This disc features an eclectic group of works: on one hand, three well-known, instantly likeable compositions which serve as a nice introduction to the music of Jean Sibelius (Karelia suite, Finlandia, Valse triste); on the other, three elaborate and multi-layered pieces that, although not too hard to appreciate at first, reveal most of their secrets after several listens (Oceanides, Tapiola, Nightride and Sunrise). Davis obtains beautiful sonic textures from the LSO: this is one of those discs that beg to be listened to with headphones. The recording ends with the musical adventure that is Nightride and Sunrise - a piece which, even if you've listened to it many times, remains unpredictable. From the first minute to the last, this is an excellent disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Davis is disappointing","review":"Up until now I've always liked Colin Davis' work, notably on Berlioz, but he misses the boat entirely here. My goal in buying the record was to get a collection including the Karelia Suite with the Intermezzo, as well as Finlandia, the Nightride and other smaller Sibelius works in one recording. I based the choice on the Amazon 30-second soundbite. Unfortunately it's after the first 30 seconds of the Intermezzo that the conductor's chosen tempo becomes clear.It should sound like a high spirited procession, some what joyous and uplifting. Instead we hear something akin to a bunch of poor souls trudging through heavy snow - dreary at the minimum.Unfortunately that's the pace for the entire CD. I checked out a video of Sir Colin conducting the final section of Sibelius' 2nd. Same impression. I don't think he quite \\"gets\\" Sibelius. I just can't recommend this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karelia -- where's the snap?","review":"I just bought the old Davis/BSO Sibelius symphonies, based on reputation. I should have listened to them first. The performances feel lifeless, and I feel the same way about his Karelia on this recording. Do yourself a favor -- get Sir Charles MacKerras' recording of the 2nd Symphony + Karelia + Finlandia, and listen just to the Intermezzo from Karelia and compare it to this, and you will understand what I am talking about. And if you want to compare Davis to someone who takes the Intermezzo at something like his tempo, try the old Barbirolli recording with the Halle Orchestra. Even though Barbirolli is little, if any, faster, there's life in his music-making that is totally absent in Davis' version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off very well but the end quite ruined it","review":"Movie started off as a very good movie but the end was quite ridiculous.

We thought we would give it a shot since it was expensive; however, we were still unhappy with it. We couldn't easily tell how much water we had added and if the coffee pot was not 100% in the correct position, it clogged the filter and ended up getting coffee and coffee grinds everywhere.

It replaced my old Braun Flavor Select, which I LOVED (I'd give it a 10 out of 10). However the Braun was 9 years old and Braun no longer makes the Flavor Select and I didn't like their replacement. My biggest criteria was to find a 12 cup maker and Cuisinart had one. I like the style of this coffee maker. The only downside (and it's slight) is there is a very small area where the water can be poured into the maker. Although I'm getting better it seems like I can rarely fill the water area without spilling some water down the outside or into the basket area. Not a huge drawback but worth mentioning. Overall I'd give the Cuisinart an 7.5 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly love","review":"What a beautiful coffee maker. Our friends had one when we went to visit and I liked the way the pot poured. I also loved the coffee! So I ordered one the minute we got home.

It did not last even 8 months. I turned it on, and nothing happened. There is no troubleshooting section on the manual. The only thing it says is that if you press the self-clean button by accident the machine will not work. However, in my case I have disconnected and tried resetting it, but it still does not start the brewing process. The only recourse is to return it to the manufacturer with a $10 plus the additional charge of shipping to them. I think, I'll try another manufacturer, but since all of them are made in China, I think I'll get a real cheap one so I won't feel so cheated when it breaks down after less than a year.I should have paid closer attention to the more than 200 1-star reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...stopped working in less than a year","review":"I bought this coffee maker less than a year ago. It makes great coffee...until the unit stops working entirely. Yesterday it worked fine. This morning the lights come on, but it won't brew. I've read dozens of reviews online saying exactly the same thing...one day it works, the next day it doesn't. I've also read consumer complaints about this unit overheating, smoking, and having electrical shorts that could be a fire hazard. I thought by paying a bit more for a coffee maker, it wouldn't have to be replaced within a year like the cheaper ones we've had in the past. Very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee maker","review":"I have had the coffee brewer for approximately 2.5 months and I must say that overall I am very pleased. It is very user friendly, easy to maintain and appealing to the eye. However, when brewing smaller batches of coffee, the temperature of the coffee is a bit cooler then had hoped for. According to the manual, the 1-4 cup setting is supposed to provide 'double' heating of the water, but as stated, does not leave the coffee as piping hot as desired. To overcome this small hardship, I brew my coffee about 20-30 minutes before I leave the house in the morning so that coffee sits on the hot plate for a bit. Lastly, when filling the reservoir with water always use the carafe, as the measurement latter within the machine is hard to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cousinart DCC-1200 - poor durability","review":"Two year old unit started with quirky premature shutting off.

We made repeated tries....nothing. Trying to find a positive in this lousy experience, our investment of $80 has amortized out to a cost of $.36 a day.

I figured that this Cuisinart should do the trick, but now I wish I hadn't donated my old Mr. Coffee to Goodwill! Even using my favorite strong German coffee, the Cuisinart can't make as good a cup.

When I investigated, I found the coffee in the carafe boiling and smoke pouring from the unit. I unplugged it and removed the carafe. Dark smoke continued to stream from the machine for another thirty seconds or so, filling the house with it's acrid odor.I shudder to think what might have happened if I had not been home at the time. It seems to me that the electrical parts used in the construction of this coffee maker must not have been designed to safe enough tolerances and the quality control in the factory is insufficient.I would not risk buying another cuisinart coffee maker.

The other important difference is that Cuisinart either limits the cost of shipping the unit to them to $10 or declares it free. For us the latter is what would apply as this is for California residents.Why do I care? Because the experience with Kalorik has tought us the value of this warranty. After 3 1/2 months of use the Kalorik's heating element gave up. No more brewing, no more heat. We were required to ship (and pay for shipment of) the old unit back - ensuring no damage to the product - to receive a new unit.Do yourself a favor, buy this coffee maker and get all the benefits of a filter, a programmable coffeemaker, extra hot coffee and all the other nice features on top of an excellent warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"Yesterday my DCC-1200 overheated.

We returned it for a new one, same model and this one lasted 10 months and did the same thing. The lady that helped me with my original return said she had the exact same problem with her Cuisinart and has had a lot of returns with this one. It must be a problem with this model because I read other reviews by people who had the same problem--turns on, but won't brew. I would never recommend it and wouldn't even consider buying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great until not at all....","review":"Just reached our year anniversary with this product and as of this morning it no longer works.

Then it crapped out just like less expensive coffee makers I've tried. And the coffee wasn't any better than less expensive models. It simply does not brew at the proper temperature or within an acceptable amount of time to produce good coffee. No amount of attention to coffee bean or water quality can make up for that. A slightly more expensive Bunn replaced it. I'll never go back.

When I brewed my first pot in the new coffee maker I thought my husband had switched coffee grounds on me. Nope, same coffee, but now instead of tasting like stale Starbucks it actually tasted like Tulleys. The caraffe is easy to clean, although the lid is a bit of a pain because it doesn't flip up it comes off and not as easily as I'd like. I read the directions once to program the thing and I haven't had to look at them again. So far, no overflows, the auto has worked, and no grounds in the pot! I'm just hoping it lasts. :) Oh, the only other thing is if you buy your coffee ground they may be too fine and pass through the gold filter, so I use paper filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm coffee","review":"Everything worked ok except the coffee was warm and temperature control for the heater plate seem not to vary much.

I have previously owned a similar model of this appliance before, and with the new design and features thought it would be a good addition. The only drawback that I am not happy with is the adjustable burner feature designed to keep the coffee carafe hotter after brewing; I really do not notice any difference in temperature after brewing. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product, and was surprised to see that it came with a gold filter basket included. I would not reccomend subscribing to the automatic filter replacement program through Cuisanart, though. They send replacements way too often than you will need to use the filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffeemaker","review":"This coffeemaker was for my wife who had a Mr. Coffee that would not make hot coffee.

I returned the unit to Costco, and stood behind another customer who had returned three of the units and finally purchased a Krups stainless steel model that I did also, and have had no problems. If you search the internet, you will see that there are many of this for sale as \\"factory reconditioned.\\" I think they have a problem with this unit, and cannot recommend this to anyone.

We were shocked this morning (4/5/2011) when the entire bottom plate started melting and smoking. Evidently the bottom heater plate shorted out. We have proper care of this unit, cleaning it with a damp cloth and never allowing the carafe to spill onto the plate. We do not use the automatic brew function. This occurred about an hour after manually brewing coffee, and I am very glad that we were home to unplug the unit when we noticed the burning plastic smell.

I'm sure it was a fluke that it died in 9 months, however, a company that charges you to replace a defective item isn't a company I wish to deal with.

I am one of the last people to complain about an item but stay away from this coffee maker! How it got sooo many good reviews is way beyond me.

I was so wrong. When reading the directions, it did say that if your grind is too fine that basket overflow MAY occur. Since I usually do a medium grind on beans, I thought it would be fine. NOT! I end up have to clean the biggest messes. Now my grinder is set on the largest grind to try & resolve the problem. Don't even think about using Melita's fine grind. It will over flow on a regular grind from a can! You're safest only making 6 cups of coffee at a time in the 12 cup carafe. That way when the filter becomes clogged with grinds you don't get crunchy coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I bought this coffee maker about a yr ago and it makes great coffee but it caught on fire this morning!

DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEEPOT!!!! Throw it out. I am going to call the company, but others with complaints were told there were no recalls and would send a new unit.

It actually worked very well....while it still worked. As with most of the one-star reviews on here, mine also failed. One day the brew light just would not go on, and it never brewed again after that. Now, I do not have enough space in my house to store all of the packaging from every small appliance I ever buy so I could not return it to Lowe's. My other option would be to send it back to the factory....however, I have done that before with Cuisinart, and of course it takes a few weeks to get a replacement. How am I supposed to go without a coffee maker in the meantime? But coffee at a local shop every day? That would add up quickly.

However, I am not incorrect in assuming that a coffeemaker should last for more than three years. Mine did not. I have no idea why it stopped working or what caused it to stop working, only that it is now a brick. A brick that teases me with the fact that there is currently no coffee available in the morning.

It was not the problem however. We clean the maker as well as use bottled water for coffee. Also, the feature in which the maker indicates that cleaning is needed never did operate from the beginning. For such a large brand, I am disappointed.

The last 6 months we have struggled to keep it on! It shuts itself off mid brew cycle several times and again when it's done. Today we pressed the switch 8 different times before finally saying we've had enough. When we did searches it seems to be a reoccurring problem with this machine for some people.

I should have been more concerned; what Cuisinart has done to keep the price low is to cheat on quality.

We figured that was an exception, got another one that worked normally for a year, then broke down just like the first one. In addition the machine doesn't hold enough coffee grounds to make a large pot of strong coffee, and a normal load of grounds tends to jam the holes in the bottom of the lid.

Easy on line purchase...no hitches. You can stop all your researching...buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"woke-up to an EMPTY pot . . .","review":"it just QUIT, just like that!!

You can pour a cup of coffee and ther is dripping from the pot. That what we really like about this coffeemaker, plus you can control how hot you want your coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased!","review":"I love my new coffeemaker..I've only experienced one problem and it was my fault---I was in a hurry and didn't place the pot in the coffemaker correctly,it backed up in the filter and coffee spilled everywhere! That is the only !problem I've had, just pay attention and put the pot in correctly---it is a beautiful coffee maker. I would buy this coffeemaker again--it is very attractive and fits on the counter nicely, (small kitchen)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase, a fire hazard.","review":"This is our third one of these, and we have only been in our house for 3 years. My wife called me this morning to tell me that there was smoke coming out of the coffee maker, and then it died. The first one we bought at costco, the second was from amazon, and the third was from Kohl's so it isn't store related. A coffee maker should last more than a year, and certainly shouldn't start on fire. I won't purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice coffee maker","review":"I received this coffee maker about 2 and 1/2 years ago as a wedding present and it's still working well today. I agree with other reviewers that the height is a little bothersome as I do end up pulling it out from underneath my cabinets to fill it every morning, but I really don't even think about it anymore -- not a big deal. I haven't used all of the functions, but I like the 1-4 cup extra hot setting since I'm usually only making coffee for myself. Mostly just wanted to chime in since it seems some other people were having problems with defective machines. Mine gets daily use and still works just as well as the day I got it. Also still think it looks nice on the counter :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me back my Cuisinart!!","review":"I had a Cuisinart for years and loved it. In August it stopped working which really disappointed me so I bought a different brand. Within a month I ordered another cuisinart because I was so dissatified with the other coffee maker I bought. I am most happy with my new Cuisinart as I knew I would be!! It is easy to use. The coffee is hot and stays hot, I love the adjustable temp feature. Plus, it is a very nice looking coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 14 months","review":"I loved the coffee maker until it completely failed to operate after only 14 months. Prior to that, it made excellent coffee. I cleaned it regularly when the self clean light came on and never had a bad cup of coffee with it. From other reviews that say the same thing, I will avoid buying this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best coffee make I ever owned","review":"I purchase unit the day it hit the shelf, five years ago. I paid 150 for it. My friends and family thought I was crazy until the taste the coffee. The maker filters the water with a replaceable charcoal cartage system, combine this with gold coffee filter created a great cup of coffee. This a great coffeemaker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Danger","review":"Coffee maker worked for a little more than two (2) years when it suddenly and unexpectedly started burning up. A pungent electrical burning smell continued to come from the unit even after it was unplugged from the electric outlet. The Consumer Product Safety Commission should issue a warning to consumers about the potential for a fire to occur even when the unit is being used correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical design","review":"It is too big and clumsy and very difficult to fill as well as difficult to read, both on the canister and the unit. My coffee maker is white. However, it does make good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"two died in two years","review":"We've been through two of these in two years. The first one had a bad switch which couldn't be repaired - which was out of warranty by the time it broke. The second one just died this morning. It started smoking in the back where the cord goes in. It smelled really bad and I think it would have caught fire if we didn't notice. This was also out of warranty when it broke. So I'm out two expensive coffee makers, and will definitely turn to another brand when I buy a new one tonight. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Carafe Design","review":"Regarding the Cuisinart DCC 1200 -- Well, I am sorely disappointed in this product. I could not even get the lid off the glass carafe. Terrible design. Two stingy little molded-in plastic tabs about depth of toothpicks where one is supposed to use their fingernails to pry the lid loose. Not made in the United States. I did not even try to make coffee in it, because I refuse to be subjected to tearing my fingers up trying to lift the lid. Bad, bad, design. Somebody fell down on the job. I am hoping they will take it back, refund my purchase price and postage. If they do, I will post a positive on their customer service, but at this piont, I am one unhappy customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Maker burned up!","review":"I owned this unit for about ten months. It made good tasting coffee. However recently after making a pot of coffee I heard loud popping noises and smoke was coming from underneath the warmer. I could smell an odor of burning electronics. I quickly unplugged the unit and placed it outside where it continued to smoke for a few more minutes.After calling Cuisinart they said there were no recalls or reported problems. I would stop using this unit. Another reviewer said, (Don't look back. Buy it!, October 26, 2011) well if you have this coffee maker I sure would look back and not stop. You may find smoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 18 months","review":"This is an update of my previous review which was very positive. The machine worked well for 18 months, although it was always a hassle to see the time clearly and program the timer. Yesterday I made a pot of coffee and although it brewed the coffee, smoke was coming from the bottom of the machine along with that burning smell we all know so well and indeed the unit had died. I let it cool off and tried to use it again but nothing happened. I tossed it in the trash and frankly will try another brand this time. We've all had Mr. Coffee and Black and Deckers that seem to last forever so I think it is inexcusable for an expensive upscale unit like this to fail after less than 2 years. And it's not like it was overused or abused in any way. I'm the only one using it, typically one pot per day, and it has had new filters and cleaned according to instructions on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Hot","review":"We've had problems trying to find a good coffee pot. This one works well. Keeps the coffee hot. Has the program features we need. We do still wish they would bring back the thermal pots with the glass lining like a regular thermos bottle had. The metal ones do not keep coffee hot. this pot will do until or if ever that happens. It works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Coffee maker","review":"We have had to return ours to Costco because one of the nipples/ hinges for the lid broke. As soon as the new ones come in we are getting another one. It makes good coffee, doesn't leak, alarm is noticeable but not annoying.I have to say that it would be better if some things like the nipple/ hinges were made of metal or somethig more durable/ flexible, but thats what the warranty is for. It is a bit tall so it is a tight fit or no fit at all for some counters, and a bit awkward to remove the filter and fill with water. My only complaint is that it should come with a gold plated filter and not some paper samples, and it does drip water condensation when lifting the lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Design But Needs Work","review":"The coffee maker looks nice and incorporates some good features, but has two drawbacks, in my opinion. First, since the opening for the water reservoir is right behind the top of the filter basket you need to be careful not to let the water splash into the coffee filter.Second, the machine is aluminum on the outside with a black plastic liner, and there is no water level indicator on the outside. You are supposed to lean over the machine (hard to do if it is under a cabinet) and look down at the water reservoir and gauge the water level against a grey plastic graduated stick against the black plastic sides. I realize you could just measure the water you pour in to begin with, but that is an extra step if, like me, you use a water filter such as Pur or Brita.In summary, it's a nice machine, but the water reservoir should be separated from the coffee filter, and there should be an external water level indicator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't a $150 coffee maker last more than 4 years?","review":"We received this coffee maker as a wedding present nearly 4 years ago. I registered for it because I thought it looked spiffy. Mistake. After about a year of daily use (just ONCE daily, mind you), the mechanism that delivers water to the grounds started to clog, this even with repeated cleaning. Every few pots or so, we would start the coffee maker and get nothing at all. We would also often get overflowing coffee rather than being able to get a cup mid-brew as advertised. We kept living this way for a while, but now it has stopped altogether. I'm online today looking for a better coffee maker since we are now reduced to boiling water in the kettle and pouring it through the coffee grounds in the coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted two years","review":"My coffee maker has been acting rather strange lately, I keep setting it on auto, only to wake up and find it doing a self clean. Not my error either, this has been going on for a week. I am about to chuck it in the bin as I am a coffee freak and hate waking up to crappy coffee which has been going through the self clean cycle for I don't know how long.

I have had the grinds overflow the basket a few times when making four cups of coffee. The machine seems very sensitive to positioning of the pot. My wife put the pot in a little off center and that was the first time it happened. I don't think the coffee saver push button depresses unless everything lines up just right. We use the pot to measure the water, as the marks inside the machine are a pain to use. I like the beep that tells when the pot is done brewing and the fact that you can set a timer to turn off the warming feature after a while, so you don't have to worry you are burning the house down because you think you might have left the pot on while you went to work. It makes good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in under 24 hrs","review":"We purchased this coffee maker and received it promptly. After brewing the initial hot water to clean the machine, we made one pot of coffee in this unit. It tasted fine -- nothing spectacular here. We unplugged the unit to move it to its permanent home on the counter and when attempting to make coffee the next morning we were surprised to find that the unit wouldn't turn on. We tried everything would could think of, but it was as if the machine had completely died after brewing twice. The clock wouldn't even come on. It was then that I actually noticed all the negative feedback this unit has received. We returned it and are now trying to pick out a non-Cuisinart brand of coffee maker to buy. Pretty disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the water????","review":"Why in the world would Cuisinart design and/or sell a coffee maker whose water indicator is INSIDE the pot, with no external display of same?? One pours water into a dark cavity in the rear of the pot, then stands on tip-toe to peer down into this deep, dark hole. There is a white gauge on the side of the cavity that is supposed to let you see how much water you have put in. The time it takes to deal with this configuration is absurd! This coffee maker has lots of great features, but how it handles your water and the amount you use is not only ridiculous, but unnecessary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, quality design","review":"After reading the reviews by other posters, I decided to buy this model. I don't regret it. It does not drip or burn the coffee. The first day in use at the office, almost everyone complimented the machine. Yes, the condensation does drip when the top lid is opened, but for the only flaw, I think it is tolerable. Very easy to use and clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good experience","review":"Completely stopped working after a little more than a year - heating element went kaput.

Okay that didn't work so I called back again and was told by a much nicer gentleman that they will ship new unit but will cost me 10.00 plus I also have to pay to ship my old back. I am doing this because it is cheaper than buying a new maker but this will definitely be my last Cuisinart!

Cuisinart replaced it under warranty and the replacement unit just stopped working after a year or so. I called Cuisinart and they said that the warranty does not restart from the replacement date, so they will not replace the second faulty unit. Does that make sense? I have replaced the Cuisinart with a Mr Coffee unit, $23 at Tartget. It looks great, makes perfect coffee and I bet that it will last for the next ten years.

Yesterday it made coffee automatically, but failed to keep it hot and this morning it is totally dead. The light is on, but it does nothing.

The internal design is extremely poor. The opening to the water reservoir is very narrow, making it hard to fill without spilling. There is no water-level gauge, so you have to measure the water beforehand in the carafe -- which wouldn't be so bad if the reservoir wasn't so spill-prone.Worst of all, the coffee quality is not good. We tried adjusting upward the amount of ground coffee three times and still couldn't match the quality of product coming from our 11-year-old Krups (the equivalent model for which sells today for about $...). The water flows too quickly through the filter, making for a weak brew.Don't believe the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good coffee, but LEAKS when filling","review":"We have owned this for over a year.

Bought this coffee maker because of its standing on the consumer search website. It does make good coffee but to have died in less than 3 years is not very impressive. Not worth shipping to be fixed at a cost of at least $20. Will put that money toward buying a different and cheaper brand. Why spend between $80 and $120 on something that doesn't last? They sure don't make'em like they used to.(Update) Cuisinart sent us a replacement model and that model died in less than a year. Cuisinart does not make these coffeemakers to last. My advice would be to stay away from this model and Cuisinart in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffeemaker!","review":"We have had one of these for the past several years and have been very, very happy with it.

And it's one of the few nice looking mid size coffee pots available (for what I consider a decent price) that doesn't look and feel cheap. I only have two very minor complaints. My first issue is the same one I have with all Coffee-mate coffee pots...those darn cone filters. What is wrong with the much cheaper standard round coffee filters, do they get a kick back from Malita? The second thing is the clock...it's not back-lit, which makes it hard to read in low light. Both are very minor issues (I know the cone filters is a pet peeve of mine that will not be an issue for most) that detract only slightly from an excellent coffee maker. I would recommend it to anyone who asked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart DCC-1200","review":"This is a great coffee maker, I have been using it for about 2 months and I really like the 1-4 cup mode.

We have always kept our coffee maker against the wall below the kitchen cabinets. This configuration DOES NOT WORK for this tall machine. In order to make coffee, you must slide it out from under the cabinets to give enough room to swing the top open. In order to slide it out you must UNPLUG the extremely short power cord. It does make coffee but isn't worth the hassle when there are so many better designed products on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously flawed product","review":"I agree with Joan and others that this product is seriously flawed. Initially, it makes great coffee, although the unit is a bit too tall, and because of the placement of the tank and small opening, it is very east to spill water when filling the tank. I could live with these design flaws. The real problem is that after a few months, the unit stops working, as many others have reported. Instead of hot water flowing from the water reservoir to the showerhead, the water all boils off. Only condensed water from the cover makes it into the filter basket. I get maybe one cup of awful coffee. The \\"self clean\\" light comes on, but the cleaning lasts one time at most. I have used the self-clean function repeatedly, to no avail. Stay away from this coffee maker. I am back to using an old Braun coffee maker, which unfortunately Black & Decker, which owns Braun, no longer makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Bought this coffeemaker to replace one just like it.

But after a few months, it goes from hot to warm and you have to put your cup in the microwave to get it as hot as it was. But my major gripe is its lifespan... I've owned two of these in the last four years, with each lasting two years. Well I wasn't about to buy a third, so I went digging in the basement for my old Corning Ware perculator. To my pleasant surprise, it's still working after 42 years as opposed to this 2 year Cuisinart. By the way, the good old fashioned perked coffee has a rich scrumptious flavor that I don't think a coffee maker can match."},{"rating":"1","title":"no power","review":"This product worked fine for @ 2 years but one morning it just wouldn't turn on. I called Cuisinart because there was supposed to be a 3 year warranty but according to them my model had been produced prior to the three years so I'm out of luck. I know its been three years because we got it as a wedding gift and we haven't reached our 3rd anniversary yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful coffee maker and great coffee!","review":"This coffee maker is great and makes super coffee. I had a Braun before this and it was just so so. I got the Cuisinart burr coffee bean grinder also (they sit next to each other on my counter-top). I couldn't be happier. It took about a week of experimenting to nail down the proper grind and amount of water, but once that was accomplished the coffee is as good or better than any coffee shop out there. I use the gold filter that came with the maker. By the way, this unit is very pleasing to the eye - we also have a brushed stainless steel refrigerator so it matches very well. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 'mayfly' of coffee makers","review":"Lovely in a quirky kind of way, but very short lived.I didn't have one of these, I had 3-- I'm that much of a sucker for the vaguely retro, vaguely diner styling: it was perfect for my kitchen.The best lasted about 8 months, the other 2 less than that.2 simply stopped working, the other developed a leak.Replaced it with a Bunn, which has been flawless for over 4 years-- and it's almost as nice to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there a \\"perfect\\" auto-drip coffeemaker????","review":"This coffee maker brews a hot cup of coffee. The decanter does not drip, a good thing. The coffee appears a bit murky, the goldtone filter allows fine coffee to pass through. Getting the water into the unit can be a bit tricky. The coffee maker must be pulled out from under the cabinet for the filling process. The opening to the compartment into which water must be poured is quite small. As for programing the auto-on feature, keep the manual handy the first few times. Be sure the decanter is properly seated on the hot plate. There will be hot coffee all over the counter if the decanter is just a slight bit up on the edge of the hotplate.All in all the coffee tastes good and is hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"this brew is fantastic","review":"my last one lasted 11 years.

Very frustrating, I would not buy this brand again! I don't reccomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete failure in less than 16 months","review":"How long should a coffee maker last? In my opinion, at least 4-5 years. I purchased a Cuisinart DCC-1200 in Nov. 2010 and it completely failed after less than 16 months of regular, daily use. Therefore, I cannot recommend the DCC-1200. However, after calling Cuisinart customer service, they have agreed to replace it for free. I hope the new one lasts longer than the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Coffee Maker","review":"This is my second Cuisinart...first one lasted 5 years....this one less than 18 months.

Made nasty noises ...gurgling...then no beep to say coffee was done, after brewing it's final pot yesterday -- guess it was the death rattle. It's toast and I won't be buying another.Don't buy it. Don't brew in it. Horrible machine. Would have given it zero stars but Amazon doesn't offer the option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed product, don't waste your money!","review":"This coffee maker looks great, very attractive but poorly designed. Our first cups of coffee were so weak I looked at the design of the water spout, and discovered that there were 6 or 8 small holes in a very small circle that dripped water only on the middle of the coffee grounds. Most of the grounds stayed dry, resulting in very weak coffee. Next, the carafe lid opens backwards! You heard that right, backwards! Then, I discovered water leaking from somewhere under the product. Also, don't expect to be able to see the reservior water level from outside, you must lift the lid for this simple task! Don't waste your money on \\"good looks\\" as that is all this product has going for it! I returned it and bought a Black and Decker for 1/2 the price which is well designed and works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST COFFEE MAKER YET","review":"I've tried all the major brands of coffee makers and, believe me, this one is the best. It is the easiest to program, first of all. Once you set the clock, which is easy also, it's set. Once you set the time you want it to start your coffee in the morning, it's set. If you should wake one morning before the start time, just turn the nob to \\"brew\\" and push the toggle switch so the light goes on, and you are good to go! Then turn the nob back to program for the next morning. You do not have to \\"re-program\\"!! Also, it turns off automatically after a couple of hours. That's a good safety feature!I chose the \\"black\\", rather than the \\"stainless steel\\". I feel it is more attractive and it doesn't show fingerprints! Another good feature is that the top of the carafe fits on tightly, so it doesn't flop open, when pouring the water in the coffee reservoir or just when pouring your coffee. It brews good coffee, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' it!","review":"This coffee maker is all that we expected and more! It makes a mean cup of coffee, is easy to use and looks great too!

So far I haven't been able to make a strong enough cup of coffee. We grind our own coffee and that may be the problem. When the coffee is ground too fine, it's bitter. Too coarse, too weak.I plan to buy a new grinder that has grinding grades, hoping that will help.The coffeemaker is nice looking and will hold up because of the stainless steel outside. Also the automatic timer works fine. ...I must admit, I was hoping for a perfect cup of coffee and have so far been very disappointed. Good luck to all those who purchase this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool design. Cold coffee.","review":"Fantastic design. Great looks.

Because it was under a year old, Cuisinart did send us a new one (at my own shipping expense). We've had the new one for under 2 years, and now the on/off toggle switch doesn't work.Despite the French name, this made-in-China coffee maker is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't trust the warranty!","review":"We do drink a lot of coffee, so we bought this machine about 1 1/2 years ago. It worked for about a year other than the carafe leaking and the top not closing all the way, it did make good coffee. It finally quit working and we hadn't saved any of the information, so we just bit the bullett and bought another \\"new\\" model. Again it worked well for about 6 months. Suddenly it completely stopped working. Called Cuisinart and asked about the warranty (we saved all the info this time) and first they made us jump thru all kinds of hoops resetting, cleaning, doing all kinds of stuff to the unit. When none of it worked, they told us we would have to give them our credit card # and we would be responsible for shipping the unit to them and thay would charge is us for the shipping back to us, and this would probably take a month or so. We told them what to do with their coffee maker and went and got a better machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke","review":"Have had this coffee maker for over a year and really liked it.

It makes great coffee, but mine spontaneously burt into flames this morning. I have had it only a few months. After looking this model up on the Consumer Reports website, I found that this is apparently a very, very common problem. Large numbers of people have reported the exact same scenario-they hear a cracking sound and smell smoke coming from the kitchen, investigate, and find smoke and flames pouring from around the hotplate and the coffee in the carafe boiling. Cuisinart replaces the coffeemaker, and the replacement also catches fire. It is not only this model, but the whole DCC line of coffeemakers that does this. It is obviously a defective line of products, and needs to be recalled and/or discontinued. If we had not been nearby, it would likely have burned our house down. I am writing this review solely to hopefully save someone from a house fire caused by this product.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee pot caught on fire","review":"We had this coffee pot for 8 months and one Sunday morning the warmer caught on fire.

At least the warranty was'nt written in small Chinese print at the bottom of the page,buy it,i think it's a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a champ","review":"Our old coffee pot pooped out, but we were kind of glad because we didn't like it very much anyway. We were willing to pay a bit more for one with useful features and I think the Cuisinart DCC-1200 fits the bill without blowing the budget. We love the quality of coffee it makes in a short period of time, the flavor is superb. It looks sharp, fits nicely on the counter and blends well with our stainless appliances. One of the handiest features is the indicator light that tells when it's time to decalcify. If water quality is important, this coffee maker has replacable filter cartriges. It is easy to use, easy to program and easy to clean. The one quirky thing about it is that the lid on the carafe isn't hinged and is awkward to remove, but it's such a small thing...we would purchase this as a gift for someone in spite of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific coffeemaker","review":"Purchased this to replace more expensive coffeemaker and have been delighted from day 1. It has compact footprint on the counter, clean design. The coffee brews quickly and is much hotter than previous coffeemaker. I'd recommend this machine and consider its price a bargain for a product I use daily. The programmable auto-off is helpful feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fan of Chrome","review":"This is the second version we have had of this coffee maker. I really like the features of this unit and the way it makes coffee. They have improved the pour spout...it use to drip onto the counter as you were pouring and a slight change in the angle of the glass spigot on the pot has made a great improvement. I mixed up a bunch of words to describe the pour mechanism so I hope you get the meaning.However...my first unit was had a stainless steel finish on the sides and the new one has changed to chrome. The chrome shows a lot of fingerprints and is somewhat harder to clean. Liked the stainless version much better, but that doesn't seem to be available anymore. Also, if the filter drys out when you refill the water in the reservoir, the filter insert piece floats up and keeps the lid from closing. No big deal, just have to push it back down and close the lid.All in all a very good coffee maker. It was my first choice when the old one went bad after many years of good service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Lover Likes it","review":"I really enjoy this coffee maker. Only two things that I would change but I can live with.Number 1: The opening where you pour the water in the maker is a little small. I would have made the opening larger.Number 2: The maker is a little tall and I cannot open the cabinet door above where the coffee maker is setting on counter. But this is good also, because then the maker will not be pushed under the above cabinets and turned on allowing the steam to damage the above cabinet.I like the timer feature. I like the beep sounding when coffee brewing is complete. I really like the auto shut off. I do think the water filter improves the coffee flavor. I purchased this coffee maker to replace a kitchen aid coffee maker that was old and just quit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"We have used Cuisinart coffee makers for several years with good results. After reading the very positive review of the DCC-1200BW in AARP Magazine, we decided to give it a try.

It WAS great. Now, my wonderful coffee maker stops brewing mid cycle, at many random moments. Oh, it also turns itself off, and my coffee gets cold. The automatic stop on the coffee that used to work when I went to get some coffee from the still brewing pot does not work anymore. It's sad. I am an avid coffee drinker, and I use this pot everyday. I was it's biggest fan, had one of the first reviews on how great it was. It was all great in the beginning. Now, things have gone downhill, and I have to buy a new coffee pot after just a few years. I will probably not spend this much money on a coffee pot with such a sad decline. I am disappointed.Hey, they are sending me a new one! only 10 dollars. apparently there is a 3 year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking after 1 year of use","review":"This one leaks when it brews.

I have two complaints about this coffee pot: 1)it leaks all over the counter and 2) it doesn't make 12 cups of coffee at the strength I prefer because if I load enough coffee into basket to get the taste we like, it backs up into the water reserve.I will give it one star because I do like the taste of the coffee I get using the maximum amount of coffee with eight cups of water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker","review":"Makes a good pot of coffee but I sure wish the clock would light up.

I have some trouble getting the lid to fit back on. Would prefer a hinged lid. The little sensor button in the bottom of the warming plate makes it hard to set the pot in straight. Overall it is a good solid unit with a stylish look and takes up less counter space the many of the others I looked at. Makes a very good cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control problems","review":"We had one of these for about a year and a half. Then it went bad. It would not stay on. At times, it would turn off every few seconds after the switch was pushed to \\"on.\\" It did make decent coffee so we decided to get another. We have had it for about 2 weeks, but it only worked correctly the first 3-4 times we used it. Then it started making terrible gurggling noises for about 10 minutes near the end of every brew cycle. Now, the self-clean light comes on every few times it is used, indicating it is full of calcium deposits. However, we have very soft water, and the previous unit never required cleaning because of deposits. Meanwhile, we put up with the gurgling so we can have our morning coffee. Other than that, the coffee tastes fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two years and out","review":"We've had our Cuisinart DCC 1200BCH for a couple years. I never thought it brewed the coffee hot enough, but neither did our last one. I figured all coffemaker manufacturers must do this to avoid lawsuits, and simply resorted to microwaving my cup if I wanted it hot. Woke up this morning to find that nothing happened when I flipped the on switch. Not worth the $10 Cuisinart wants to send it in for warranty repair. Chalk up another lesson to cheaply made, unserviceable off shore junk. Will spend the morning looking for a stovetop percolator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the coffee pot hate the carafe","review":"I've owned Bunn coffee makers for over 20 years. I like them and the three minute coffee they produced. I felt I was ready for change, and I like my new Cuisinart coffee maker. I can live with the 12-15 minutes it takes to create a new pot of coffee. 20 plus years, I never broke a Bunn carafe. Now, 2 1/2 months after buying my new coffee maker, I'm buying a new carafe. I couldn't tell you how it cracked, but it's cracked and costs a little less than 1/3 the price of the entire coffee pot. It's very thin glass, and I'm at a loss. One more carafe and I'm back to a Bunn boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The coffee maker that died...","review":"After 8 months, this piece of junk just died.

Easy to Use. No spills.","review":"I've had this coffee maker for a couple weeks and am happy with it.PROS:* No spills. I have no problem filling the tank or pouring coffee. You have to be able to flip the lid all the way up and lean in close to the machine. The target for filling the tank is small.* No burns. The steam when pouring the coffee isn't directed toward the handle, as it was on a prior (horrible) coffee maker.* Very nice looking machine. The chrome shows finger prints, so the stainless may have been a better choice.* The pause-and-pour feature works without drips.* Easy to use.CONS:* No see through indicator showing the volume of water in the tank. You either have to measure in the carafe or look down into the tank for fill-markings. I knew this buying the coffee marker, but it's more of an annoyance than I expected.* No brew-strength settings.* The clock is small and hard-to-read except with good lighting (or younger eyes?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffeemaker, but filling the water is like target practice!","review":"This is a great machine -- great brewing, temperature, etc -- and it's one of Consumer Reports' top-rated coffee machines. I didn't realize that it came with a free permanent filter, so that's a bonus too. The only negative feedback I can give on the machine is the difficulty of filling the machine with water. I bought this for my elderly father, and he uses a funnel to ensure that there's not a lot of spillage. The carafe's spout is pretty precise and doesn't spill, it's just that you need to aim the water into an opening that's not that much bigger than a 50cent piece.... If it's early in the morning, forget about it!I was trying to see whether this model has a stainless thermal carafe, but I don't think so. I left an inquiry with Cuisinart's customer service, but two weeks later and still no replies."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Months - defective","review":"This is a beautiful coffee maker and when first used, loved it. Now, three months in, it is defective even after a couple of cleanings (not brewing properly - incomplete cycles). Could be clogged? The grounds do stick to the top lid and when not very carefully wiped off will fall into the water basin. It does come with a 3 year warranty for \\"household only\\" use only (as specified with customer service). Customer service is a bit of hassle, they will tell you it is defective due to the calcium buildup and will want to know specifically how you interpret their cleaning instructions written in the their manual and what your water source is. They are not too helpful with you in getting these serviced/returned. This coffee maker is not worth the hassle. There are other brands that are more reliable and cost less. Don't waste your time and money with this one.On a positive note, the coffee pot is better than most at pouring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes great coffee","review":"Very pleased. A bit tall and difficult to pour water into the reserve tank. Also, the lid to the coffee pot isn't hinged. It snaps on and off and is hard for my 82 year old mother to get off to empty old coffee and put fresh water into. However, it can be done without removing the lid, just takes a bit more time and coordination to fill with fresh water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately the greatness is short-lived","review":"We've had one of these for just over two years. We loved it, unfortunately two years seems to be the limit of its life. The switch has gone out on ours and it no longer turns on reliably, and turns itself off at random intervals. We are going to have to replace it.We have complained to Cuisinart and gotten no response of any kind.Just an FYI that the machine is not going to last all that long. If you are okay with getting a new one every couple of years, then this one is great.

Water would leak out at the seam between the top plastic and the glass. So when I pour water into the coffee maker, it dribbles all over the counter top. Also, unlike Mr. Coffee type machines, there isn't a huge dumping area to put water in, it is a fairly tight area to pour the water into. So I have to put a small dish rag under the carafe as I fill w/ water. I've been living w/ this pain for over a year now, and a replacement maker is $25. Would not recommend you buys this coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward to fill & remove grounds","review":"Don't buy this coffeemaker if you have a cabinet above the location where you put the coffeemaker. It is too tall to remove the grounds basket,or for that matter fill both coffee & water. You have to pull the appliance out of it's location to do both operations. Doesn't sound like much, but after awhile it gets to be a pain.

Have tried everything Cuisinart recommends: Different filters, different grind of coffee, different carafe placement, charcoal filter in, charcoal filter out, etc. No luck so far---never had this problem with my old one (exact same model). Otherwise love the coffeemaker, but am about to give up and just return it for another brand.

I wasn't looking to spend any money on a coffee maker right now so I pulled one of my spares out of the attic. After going through the two that were up there, I quickly remembered why they were in the attic. I have to put a lot of coffee grounds in them to get a strong enough cup of coffee. Not true with the Cuisinart. It makes a perfect cup every time with a normal amount of grounds. The coffee is made in a reasonable amount of time and the temperature is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many nice features","review":"Unit brews a stronger, more flavorful cup of coffee than my previous Cuisinart maker, with all other ingredients equal. The auto-off, temperature setting, and small batch features are particularly helpful.

It is probably the most popular model since it seems everyone has one. The reason I hate it is because you cannot adjust the brew strength and it brewed our coffee extremely weak. We had to change from a medium roast to a dark roast just to get any coffee flavor. It was ridiculous. Buy the Mr. Coffee LMX27 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker instead. Not only is it much cheaper but it is less bulky, you can adjust the brew strength, and it is less expensive.

Who tells time by their coffee maker anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning-this is plastic, not metal","review":"We ordered this as a replacement for a beloved 10 year old version of the same coffee maker, which finally died. As we unpacked it, we were disappointed to find that the \\"brushed metal\\" exterior was actually silver colored plastic (except for the back which is black plastic). Looks cheap even from a distance. This seems to be the same model as the stainless steel version. Went to Macy's which had a stainless steel one on display, but the plastic versions were inside all the boxes there too. Makes me suspect that this was a recent price cutting switch to this model which isn't yet reflected in the descriptions.
