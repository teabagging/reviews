Although the description and picture CLEARLY state this is a Blu-ray disc you are ordering, I recieved a STANDARD DVD (definitely NOT what I ordered). I'm not sure if the company doesn't understand that the two are not the same, or if the workers in charge of packaging do not, but this kind of mistake is certainly a glaring one. I will be getting a refund through Amazon. This is either a communication mix up within the company, or deceptive advertising (if someone thinks that no one is going to notice the difference between a Blu Ray and DVD - that's insane - esp. since you can get a standard DVD of the same movie for HALF the price)!

Probably want to check all the excercise that in your routine and insure that they don't have any sort of padding on the grip.Also, it is difficult to set minute adjustments on the hook's height in your hand.

He presents information from personal interviews with many of the prominent people in the field, and includes both sides of the controversies. Later in the book he shares his own personal experience with neurofeedback which he felt necessary in order to report on the subject. Information is recent since the copyright date is 2000.

I can truly say that I am far less inclined to undergo EEG Neurobiofeedback after reading this book than I was walking in with no prior knowledge of the therapy.I can't speak to Robbins' coverage of the history of the field.

The book was given to me by an avid techo-thriller reader who said he didn't want it back and I could do what I wanted with it. I read about 20 awful pages and sent it on to a Naval aviator friend, a retired Rear Admiral and F-14 pilot, himself an excellent writer of books on naval aviation, who experienced the same cog-diss.

OK, OK, in the techno-thriller genre we don't expect literary masterpieces, but Robinson's writing is so bad as to be laughable. The plot actually gets *bogged down* through the middle third of the book -- a capital crime in the genre. The characterisations are ridiculously sketchy and/or cliched, even for a technothriller.

The culprit behind the sinking of the carrier is discovered only about a third of the way through the book, with the only question being what country is backing him. Who cares? Hell, I'm writing this review only a week after reading it, and I can't remember who was backing him. This book was that dull.

The US military officers are strong and exciting characters. The author has made good use of excellent military advice, particularly about the ways of the British Navy. There's a low-level background of preaching about keeping a strong military. Some parts of the story do strain credibility. For example, principal characters move in international venues, easily using English everywhere. But this is a minor objection, easily suspended. The book is a great technical thriller, with lots of mysteries and surprises.

Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazing book","review":"This truly is an amazing book. It is very rare to read a book where ALL the characters are completely empty stereotypes, the plot gets gradually less and less interesting and all that is left is semi-fascist propaganda. How reassuring to read about all these \\"great men\\" out there, ready to kill some \\"towelheads\\" for us! And in the most efficient manner of course.

The author drags out conversations and rehashes information several times. For over half of the book the reader knows the plainly obvious, which is not that bad, but some of the conclusions drawn and actions taken by the Americans are just downright outrageous. You don't get a sense that he is writing from two different perspectives. The action really never picks up, and the ending is not climactic at all. Downright disappointing. If you have read or even like Tom Clancy, don't bother with this book. In fact, don't bother at all, whoever you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"HE GETS THE EQUIPMENT RIGHT BUT NOT THE PEOPLE","review":"This book reads like some Aryan vision for a racially pure fighting force.

I was assured that this would be a fast-paced thriller in the mold of Clancy. This book plodded along with all the speed and grace of a drunken elephant. The characters were completely unbelievable and after reading a third of the book I could no longer take the lack of any character development and minimal plot development. Saying that the book contained characters is a stretch; they were caricatures, like something out of a Republican's wet dream.

The design of the backing to the disk for this actually does what they say.The table is very heavy and when locked down stays there. I built my own custom sliding sled with different angles for different segments and the sander repeats very well. I've removed the table, put on new pads, then reinstalled the table using the stop with no problems having to fiddle with realignment.The other handy feature is that you can sand right up to the middle of the disk, again unlike the Grizzly.Two of my woodturning buddies have also bought this after seeing mine in action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I have had mine for less than two years and used it for making pens.

The movie plot is as ridiculous as all the 'Emmanuelle' series (except for the 1st), but the scenary is beautiful. The camera caught not only the beauty of it's star, but as well as it's locations.

It is definetly one of the best \\"latenight\\" shows on Max or any network for that matter. It might not feature the best sex scenes out there, but it is very entertaining. It's very campy (how could it not be considering the concept) and it is hard to watch Emmanuelle in Space without laughing often (listen closely for the computer, its especially amusing). There is a certain level where something is so corny, tacky and awful that it actually becomes quite entertaining to watch. Such is the case with this film. Krista Allen is hot, as are the rest of the ladies, so there is enough titilation, so to speak, to fortify this campy comedy. If you don't buy this, at least keep an eye open for it on Cinemax.

This person starts with a prejudice against the artist, might have listened to the music and then took the opportunity to rip away. He rips her voice, rhythm, melodies, then starts in on the songs on this CD. Apparently she couldn't help but be inferior though since she's not \\"native American\\", that is \\"black or of Latino or Hispanic origin\\". We all have varying opinions, but if a person had already heard the artist's past work and thought she was so limited and inept, why would they write a review about her newer material?

Yattering play an extremely enjoyable combo of death metal and grind. The vocals are awesome (although almost indescifrable) and the druming is excellent. What sets them appart from other bands, is their unconventional sung structures and the excellent riffs (catchy, technical, and BRUTAL). The lyrics are interesting (a little demented...)

Mishra's attempt to fuse classical, eastern, and new age styles leaves the effort somewhat directionless and not a strong example of either genre.

From the lucid \\"My Meditation\\" and the danceable \\"Allegro\\" to the hauntingly beautiful \\"For Julia,\\" Mishra never fails to capture the listener with multiple layers of feeling and emotions.

The same recipe on the Food Network site, which also features Cora, calls for 2 cups of flour--a bit different!

However, a lot of the poetry is hardlylegible (Blake's handwritten print style is hard for me). If you can read it,fine. It's also all in an appendix in modern typeface, but for some reason theychose a 6-point read-it-with-a-magnifying-glass font.

These guys have a different sound, it's like a heavy pop but by heavy I mean not at all pop. 'Still Frame' is really cool, the chorus pumps you up. It'll probably be the second single. 'When All Is Said and Done', 'Made of Glass', and 'Hollowman' are all stand-out tracks as well.

I like to call it corporate rock, because that's basically what it is. If you want REAL metal, stick to the proven leaders such as Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, Death, Sepultura, Malevolent Creation, Suffocation, Obituary, Exodus, Slayer, Kreator, Brujeria, Pantera, Superjoint Ritual, Cryptopsy, Megadeth, Metallica, Carcass, Machine Head, and newer heavier bands such as Chimaira, Shadows Fall, Mastodon, Arch Enemy, Killswitch Engage, Hatebreed, The Haunted, and God Forbid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trapped (oh I mean Trapt) in one hit wonderland","review":"Was \\"Headstrong\\" supposed to be a pump up song directed toward young suburban tonedeaf males? Was there ever a time before a football game or a fight that you were involved in where you had to listen to this song in order to get yourself revved up? If that's true, I'm sure you must have gotten your a$$ whooped. This song has as much pump up value as the sound of my grandma trying to fart through a vase. I bet you in 2 or 3 years you'll be looking back and laughing at yourself in pity for listening to this noise comparable to the melodic value of \\"the Chicken Dance.\\" Do do do do do do do *clap*clap*clap*clap* In the meantime, keep letting your team down for losing games as well as continuing to be the kid who everybody beats on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy Annoying Nu-Metal For Posers","review":"I seriously don't understand why anyone would like this band. With all the great music out there today, it's surprising that a teenie-bopper nu-metal song like \\"Headstrong\\" which has some of the dumbest lyrics ever written, could do so well. When I hear that song on the radio I actually get irritated from the singer's whiny voice and horrible amateurish jock teen-angst lyrics. The sad fact is that there are people out there that are so lazy that they let corporate music stations like MTV and popular radio stations (also very corporate) tell them what good music is. Well they pay for it by embarrassing themselves by listening to audio garbage like Trapt. At least I'll know I'll be listening to something a thousand times better.Trapt = Crapt"},{"rating":"1","title":"How does crap like this get made?","review":"This cd is so bad I do not even know where to begin.

Besides the fact that this Band comes from the Town that I live in, Los Gatos CA, I love this group because of the diversity that you will here while listening to this CD. Every song has its own distinctive sound to it. You can get a Hardcore rock sound out of \\"Headstrong\\" or a soft-acoustic sound out of \\"Stories.\\" I absolutely love this cd and it is the only CD I listen to at Home, or in my car.

It's just another radio friendly Matchbox 20 wannabe....I just don't understand how bands of this nature are smiled upon and bands with talent are, well frowned upon.."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMFG so talented!","review":"Please. Uncompromising? These guys just took it up the ass from the industry. Rather than writing music they just played Linkin Park and Evanescence on loop and copied what they heard.I'll admit, radio-core bands (Slipknot, Staind, Evanescence, Korn, etc.) usually have a bit of originality to them, tied in with whatever will get them played. Trapt has none of that. The vocals are unoriginal. The lyrics are vague and bereft of any sort of meaning. The guitarist just plays powerchords. The bass and drums aren't even trying.In conclusion, Trapt is one of the worst bands to show their face in the rock world since Limp Bizkit and 'Headstrong' was so bad it's the reason I stopped listening to the radio altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and go buy a Tool CD","review":"TRAPT, STAIND, LINKIN Park, KORN, Limp BIZKIT....any band name that is blatantly misspelled so as to sound COOL and/or creative automatically suck. (Led Zeppelin is exempted from this for obvious reasons). Perhaps the band, or more likely the record company realized the aggregate intelligence of pop music fans is comparable to a brain damaged hippopotomus, so they named the band, and wrote the music accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another modern day wanna be metal band","review":"The first time I heard \\"Headstrong\\" on the radio, I'll admit I was a bit intrigued, but when I heard the rest of their self titled major label debut, I quickly came to my senses. Just like labelmates Linkin Park, along with countless other rap-rock and post grunge sensitive rock bands, Trapt has little or no emotion in their music, and are just here to sell records and t-shirts and nothing else. The bass work is commendable, but along with the repetitive downtuned guitars and inconsistent drumming (plus the vocalist's almost unbearable whine that would make even Billy Corgan wince) make this another disc best used as a drink coaster. Skip this and stick to your \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad For The First CD","review":"I first Heard 'Headstrong' on my hometown rock station before the album came out. The first thought that went through my head was \\"Oh s***, another one hit wonder.\\" There have been so many come-and-go bands recently that I paid Trapt little attention. Then I heard the second single titled 'Still Frame' and it got to me. I decided that I still didn't want to own the CD, but I would give it a shot. I borrowed from a friend of mine and listened to it while reading the lyrics off the internet (I only borrowed the disc). I was amazed at how the lyrics and guitar riffs flowed and moved with the beat. What impressed me more was that you could actually hear what the bass player was playing!!! That's almost unheard of anymore. I think that, while they are only OK, this band deserves at least a four star rating because few bands are that good at the release of their Freshman Album. I think they are gonna go places and hope to hear the new CD soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"this band is horribly unoriginal","review":"i decided to try listening to this album to see if it was any better than it's horrific first single. i notice that sometimes happens.not in this case. this entire album belongs on pop radio. not to say that only bad music is on pop radio (most of it's bad, though), but this is typical, run of the mill nu-metal that is WAY too over produced and way too...boring. you've heard this before elsewhere, and done better. and oh my god, lyrical content. the lyrics are your typical \\"i have all this pain inside\\" (i don't know if he actually says that) type lyrics that you'd expect from this type of band.final verdict: stay away from this, and buy something a little different. take one of the past reviewers advice and buy some radiohead or tool. shoot, korn is more original than this. don't buy this. please."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the biggest disappointments I have ever heard...","review":"This album, quite frankly, disgusted me. I had heard the two singles, Headstrong and Still Frame, on the radio, and I found them quite promising. So I bought the CD. The edgy, angst vibe that I heard from those two songs instantly disappeared, and was replaced by mindless crooning and rather poor guitar. None of the songs could measure up to Still Frame. NONE. O sure, there were a couple of decent songs (Made of Glass, Hollowman) but other than that...just steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two of the worst songs ever:","review":"\\"Headstrong\\" and \\"Still Frame\\" are two of the most poppy, radio ready, formulaic, and predictable songs I've ever heard in my whole life.

I hate the fact that major record labels don't care about good quality music, they just can create a band, write their music, and shove it down the naive listeners throat until they go out and buy it, yuck. I think the main thing about this band that annoys me was the fact that this guy I hated at work (total metro sexual lame-o) thought this band was gods given gift to sound. Needless to say we ended up fighting (he said the Misfits and Black Flag sucked, I was really just looking for an excuse to pick a fight) and I sent him home crying in his lame honda civic hatchback. Needless to say we all laughed and had some cold beers after that affair. Anyways, if you're a brainless mainstream listner that buys a cd for one song than forgets about it after a month, this cd is all yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesy (mmmmm... cheese)","review":"You'd better have some crackers handy if you buy this album, because all your gonna' get is a whole lotta' cheese! No ones gonna' know who these guys are in five years. Sadly this is just another wannabe new age rock band. If your into the \\"new-age\\" rock stuff, I reccomend somthing like Disturbed or maybe KoRn. These guys just got their fame from that lousy \\"Headstrong\\" song (which I shamefully used to like). This band is just going to be another dusty record on the shelf. I reccomed \\"The Sickness\\" album by Disturbed, not this crappy excuse for a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"They aren't as bad as I thought they were......","review":"I'm being pretty nice giving this cd 4 stars. If I could give it 3.5 stars I probably would. Anyway enough with the rating lets move on to the cd. The production is pretty good (better than most new bands). The songs are well written and the track listing is very good. Although sometimes I have to skip the first song. They are your average alternative rock group. If 3 Doors Down or Puddle of Mudd doesn't ring a bell than this band may seem totally new to you. Stand out songs include \\"Made of Glass\\", \\"These \\"Walls\\" \\"Still Frame\\" \\"Echo\\" and \\"The Game\\". My personal favorite on this album is \\"Stories\\". (...)This cd took some time to grow on me (...). It's almost been a year since it came out and its doing pretty well, so either ask for it for christmas or just buy the (...) cd already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your share of TRAPT","review":"This album is perfect for releasing any strong emotions you may have bottled up inside. Chris Brown, the lead singer, has a very expressive voice where the listener can just relate to anything he sings. I LOVE all the songs, but my personal favorite is 'Stories'. It seems very personal. Buy this record now and see what you think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"'Each to his own' i guess, but I just don't see how someone can give this cd 5 stars. There is nothing remotely spectacular about this album. Okay, although overplayed Headstrong was a pretty good song, and Still Frame was alright too. that is the only reason I give this 2 stars. The music is solid, but where is that something extra, and the lyrics sound like they come straight from the book 'Nu-metal lyrics for dummies'(not a real book you guys, although it could be.) Anyways, I bought this cd to finally finish my Columbia House 'contract'. I guess I don't know what the biggest mistake of my life is then? is it this cd, or giving in to the 10 cd's for 1 cent each and 4 more at regular club prices through the next 2 years(plus shipping and handling)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!! This is awesome!!","review":"I recently heard about this band on a T.V. commercial which had a brief sample of \\"Headstrong\\", the first single on their album. I really liked it and listened to the whole song on their website. I then bought it and wow! This CD kicks ...! But \\"Headstrong\\" isn't the only good song!! \\"Made of Glass\\" is sweet, along with \\"Echo\\" and others!

Headstrong is real catchy and has a good heavy beat to it. This is what you will buy the cd for. However, the rest of the cd leaves you with more of a 3 Doors Down kind of vibe. Which is not a bad thing.If you've never heard rock beyond MTV's TRL, then go ahead and knock yourself out to a cd that sounds pretty much like everything else.If you'd actually like to lisen to a rock band that will blow you away, pick up a cd by Thursday, .hopesfall., or Taking Back Sunday.I don't want to make this sound like I'm bashing Trapt, because they actually are worth listening to.

With some bands you can say \\"oh they sound like this band or this band\\" but with trapt u cannot do that cause they have such a unique style. There fusion of hard rock and acoustic music with greatly written songs makes a cd you can listen to over and over again. Each song adds something to the cd in its own way.

They sound like every other modern rock band that has came out in the past few years. The diversity on the album comes off as a calculated attempt to aquire fanbases in disparate markets rather then an honest attempt at depth. The lyrics are cliched and the arrangements are boring and repetive. Like many debuts from bands signed to major labels without an indie track record they lack heart.

There are absolutely ZERO redeming qualities on this CD. They are as stalemate as Smile Empty Soul, Three Days Grace, and Static-X. Their lyrics are all cliche (\\"Please help me, cause I'm breaking down\\"....wow...no radio rock band has ever used the work 'break'; that must make Trapt just the coolest ever!!!

I have read your review and you run your mouth you sick freak. Im the type of person that does'nt stick to a particular genre. My motto is 'A good song is a good song.' If it's a good song it should'nt matter what genre it is. Trapt produces some good songs such as Headstrong,Echo and when all is said and done. But don't count Maynard's Dicks words out, like most bands there is room for improvement. To their credit but it was their first album. People say they are'nt real metal. Listen to SLipnot,Korn or Lil Nino.(which i have) I like tracks from all of those bands as well. But trapt plays to their own style. I don't think their trying to be heavier so why are you comparing them.

My favorites are \\"Hollowman\\", \\"The Game\\", \\"When All is Said and Done\\", \\"Enigma\\", \\"Stories\\" and \\"New Beginning.\\" After this album, Trapt sort of went on a bike trip down a rocky hill.

I don't think anyone could honestly say that clown scene didn't scare the heebie-jeebies out of them!Poltergeist was unique in that it contained a certain sci-fi element inside its main plot of restless ghosts haunting an innocent family's home.

The cast also does a great job in this film espically CRAIG T NELSON and HEATHER O'ROURKE and so does JOBETH WILLAMS.

The picture and audio quality on the disc however is AMAZING, vastly superior to the original disc. I have done extensive comparisons and the first thing I checked was the neighborhood title sequence, which was riddled with dirt on the original DVD. Not so on this new disc! They are lovely and clean. The same goes for the edge enhancement and grain, which plagued the original disc.

If chairs start moving by themselves across a room surely anyone would rush out and try and get professional help. At times I thought this could be a Disney production for kiddies.

They said that they removed the graves and stuff but all they did is move the head stones. This is why the Poltergeist is bothering the family.

My review this time is purely for the new DVD reissue which is one of the biggest disappointments I've come across. Let's start with this \\"25th Anniversary.\\" The only mention of the anniversary is a haphazardly placed sticker on the outer sleeve. The fact that it was just slapped onto the box gives the buyer an idea of how much thought went into this new DVD.Then there are the extras. A documentary about true-life hauntings. Okay, that's not bad. But wait - where's the original trailer for the film that was on the earlier DVD? It's been removed. Did the trailer get sucked into Carol Anne's closet and is being held captive by the Beast? What purpose did removing the trailer serve?This is a pointless release. My advice is to hang onto the earlier release which is anamorphic AND has the trailer and skip this one; there will be another, hopefully better, release someday. Warner Brothers should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific and Chilling Ghost Story","review":"A classic horror show about things that go bump in the night, Poltergeist promises to scare you: and it does! When Poltergeist first begins, it seems as though it will just be another spooky movie. However, once the first half concludes, the movie shows you one scare after another. The swimming pool scene may make you jump out of your skin! (Literally!) Craig T. Nelson is just fine as the concerned father and JoBeth Williams is stunning as the intrigued mother. However, it is Zelda Rubenstein who steals the show as the zany medium. As an added plus, the phenomenal music sets the perfect mood for the film and the movie ends leaving you feeling very unsettled, just as a good horror movie should. So if you are looking for a well-written, stylish ghost story, Poltergeist is just that. But there is plenty of gore, too. Rent it tonight and enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is one of the best OZ books out of them all.....","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book I couldn't put it down.

It may justly claim to be one of the best structured of the Oz books, but the combination of characters and locations simply did not do much to capture my imagination back then. I liked Trot and Cap'n Bill, but I did not really like them as much as some of the other possible main characters.As an adult I found that I admired the book much more-- even if the Scarecrow does not appear until much later, it is always good to see Button Bright back. The plot is also well-developed and Trot shows a side of her nature that fades later in the series when Baum sets her next to Dorothy and Ozma.In short, a worthy entry into the Oz canon, if not a natural favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made, do not buy","review":"I bought these pillowcases to coordinate with the Bamboo Shoots Duvet Cover.

A replacement mug was sent but it became evident almost immediately that the ceramic mug gets very hot too and does not retain the heat well.

My only complaint about this mug is that it came with some imperfections in the glaze on the inside, so I don't know if I'm really getting it clean. The shape is a bit hard to clean, anyway.

Not that all good authors can't stumble occasionally. A Walk Through the Fire was tepid and just plain boring most of the time. It didn't really even seem that Sharon was the same character we've been following for so long. The demands of turning out a top notch mystery year in year out must surely take a toll on any author.

However, as they reveal what happened, they also find out that someone among them is behind all of it. Intriguing? Mildly. Overdone? Probably. The main reason to see this movie is for Jeff Speakman. Jeff Speakman is a Kenpo Karate expert, who has sadly done many bad films in his career. However, if you like to see martial arts action, you may like to see this movie. Toward the end, Jeff gets a fight scene in which he gets to crazy against his opponenet. I think Jeff has some of the fastest hands in the martial arts movie world.

The remote is perfect for a single person to rotate the beam to where they want. Just be aware that this unit does not constantly spin like some do. You rotate it once so the unit will \\"find\\" level and from there, you rotate the dot until it appears on the spot you desire. The line projection feature (a mirror that bounces the beam into a series of dots) is a little inaccurate so I never use it. It works excellent and is very accurate.

End of the World (sic; the actual original title is The Good Life) benefits from the superior engineering provided by Dave Hassinger.

Also, the background instruments are rendered in a clear and undistorted manner. 4 starsNice Girls Don't Stay for Breakfast on the other hand is sabotaged by some of the worst recording Julie suffered through (courtesy of Sidore and Britz??). Her voice is boxy and plagued with constant sibilant distortion. The reverb is also poorly integrated with her voice although this album is not unique for that unfortunately.

Though Dr. Ingram plugs North American Herb & Spice Company, I didn't find that bothersome, as he's just giving you true and factual information of where you can get some of these products (even if he's involved with the company).

The movie is dramatic, cliche, and poorly done, but because of that it's funny. True Son falls in love with a blonde servant.

His readjustment is difficult, despite the love interest he has in the character portrayed by Carol Linley. The plot is a bit formulaic, but if you like the look and feel of the 1950s Disney films, (and I do) you will enjoy this film. Seeing Fess Parker and James MacArthur perform is always a pleasure.

One thing that i disliked was the fact that True Son's white brother wasn't in the movie, instead he was replaced by the servant girl. I didn't enjoy the elements of the movie because it wasn't like the novel. There were many things that were different. One big difference is that Gordie (True Son's white brother) wasn't in the movie. Another big difference is that there was no name for the servant girl in the novel and that she wasn't really paid attention to in the novel.

If you love the novel then avoid this movie. If you're trying to cheat on an English exam by watching this movie instead of reading the book then you will fail your test.If you have not read the book or are ambivilent towards it then you just may enjoy this movie as a mild piece of Disney escapism similar to \\"Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier\\" or \\"The Parent Trap.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The light in the forest!!","review":"I do not like the movie.

Barry Farm must choose berries at their peak of ripeness because the berries are rich in pure strawberry flavor with a perfect consistency.

Only one negative thing I can say, and that is that my clip comes apart if I wear it on my hip and try to jog. Somehow the screw that holds it in place becomes loose with normal use.

Nevertheless, she is a gem, soulfully bombarding her listener with a concordance of musical honesty. Her voice is airy in its delivery, she literally breathes into every song. Talent such as hers makes me upset that artists such as Britney Spears can be idolized, yet REAL voice talent such as Ms. Larrieux's can be ignored. This is one of the best albums of 2004.

Anyway I got this couldn't wait to hear what this beautiful young lady had in store and I was blown away of how crappy this was.This CD has 1 good song and it's that one single that overplayed on the urban stations. I expected more of a Minnie Ripperton vibe but what you get is some wierd African style beats sound as if made by a computer and some Eryka Badu weird lyrics and a rip off Chaka Khan impersonation but if you like Eryka Badu at her weird moments or maybe some would say at her \\"deep\\" moments then this you will enjoy.

There are truly no 'filler' songs to be found on \\"Bravebird\\" which is rare these days, so I won't pick any favorite tracks, everything here works to brilliant effect.

All of those songs beat any song on this album. The only good ones are the first two, \\"For Real\\" and the title track. After that, the album falls flat with generic production and faltering, sometimes oversung, vocals from Amel.I hear that this is her last album and it shows because it seems like she worked on this album while looking at the front door.

The video is run at high ISO and is full of noise.

To correct myself a little, most health advice, programs, books and supplements usually offer pretty good advice these days.You know:1. Don't alcohol2. Don't abuse drugs3. Don't smoke (cigaretts and the like)4. Eat move live fresh fruits and vegetables.5. Eat less process foods and meats.Now all of this is good advice, although there is a right way and wrong way to do anything. I saw an excellent book with a good 8 step plan.

I liked the film, but it will depress you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful touching movie","review":"The Deep End Of The Ocean was a very touching movie. The acting in the film was great. The movie was like 2 movies in one. The first half was dealing with a family who had just lost their son. Nobody knows what has happened to him. Then the next half of the movie was when the family moves into a new house a couple of states away and their long lost son comes knocking at their door asking them if they want their lawn mowed. That is how they become a family again. But then they start to realize that the boy is not happy with this \\"new\\" family. So they give him back. Then at the end he goes with the origanal family again. Very good movie. Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Willaims gave outstanding performances. Jonathan Jackson was also a very big part of this movie. He also did very well. This was a good movie and you should buy it. It will inspire you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT ABOUT THE MUSIC?","review":"I saw this movie about 3 times and each time I found things that I missed in previous viewings. I have also read the other reviews of this movie and surfed the websites for this movie, but no one mentioned the beautiful piece of music at the end of the movie as the credits were displayed. What was that piece and who composed it? Music has an important part to play in any movie and the music for this movie has been thus far ignored by everyone connected with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie but sometimes depressing!","review":"I saw this movie on HBO one time and I liked it. But this movie seems more like a made TV movie to me. The 3-year-old boy disappears and returns 9 years later who lives only 2 blocks away from his mom's house. Now does that sound like a mystery or what? Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is great and the rest of the cast are okay.

She seems guilty about losing sight of him momentarily and for letting him get lost. Her guilt overtakes everything, and she is not a very devoted mother to her other two children. You can see that they are suffering from her neglect and total self-absorption. I felt that the movie was supposed to have been very compelling on an emotional, almost primal, level, but it was not compelling at all. I imagine that the book did a better job of conveying the terror of losing your child and realizing that your child may be gone forever. The people in the film all seemed to be too obsessed with themselves. Naturally this kind of tragedy will cause introspection and times of real doubt and soul searching, but I did not get the sense that the people here had any level of depth or sincerity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is much better..............","review":"Pfeiffer plays a mother who is devastated when her son goes AWOL in a crowd. Nine years later he returns - but is he her real son?

I live near the area and was also looking for some current supernatural fiction with a romantic bent. Steamy sex scenes are not what I look for, nor does Ms Briggs burden her stories with these crutches.In her Raven series she shows the same great talent as a writer and uses the more usual \\"serfs and kings\\" historical setting. Her style translates well and the world she creates is very interesting. Character developement makes it to about level 8 out of 10, the plot is standard good vs evil.If you liked her other books and enjoy fantasy settings I would definitely recommend this duology."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak sequel - plot, characters second to ideas","review":"this was a very weak sequel to the excellent Raven's Shadow. the plot plods. the characters aren't as fun - they are always worrying about each other like an overprotective family. the worst is that the whole second half of the book is heavy on explantions on the 'history' of why this world has Shadowed in it - not interesting, not well thought out, and all teh action stops dead over and over. a real disappointment from an author that can do better.also, 30 pages are missing in the middle of the book, with chapter fifteen repeating instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading.","review":"The book is good reading, well written and flows well.

If you take the Raven Dualogly for what it is, a very good Fantasy series, you will enjoy the series quite a bit. I wouldn't pick this book up without having read the first book..you could.. but why would you want to be left out of the depth of the story.The series is not groundbreaking, the magic system does get a little incosistant at times, and the ending could be paced a little longer. But with that being said, it is really a great tale and well worth the buy. I walk away from every one of Patricia's novels satisfied and laughing to myself about ever listening to critics who whine that the story is not totally new. Come on.. its fantasy.. lighten up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Female Protagonist","review":"I thought this was complex for a sci fi/fantasy book. I liked that, mostly. I don't know whether to give it a 3 or a 4.Strong female protagonists are always attractive to me. Seraph's husband is a strong character, too. I like the way the family works as a team with each using her or her special talent.This is great for a wizard/mage/gifted fantasy. At the moment, however, I'm more interested in urban fantasy, which has usually more to do with current and more familiar settings and culture. I know. \\"Vampires, and Werewolves, and Fairies. Oh my!\\" Look down on me if you must. Patricia Briggs also does a great series with Mercy Thompson, walker. What a talented author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first book","review":"The first book; 'Raven's Shadow' is better. After reading the first, the second is repeatative. In the first book, I was carried away by the idea of of a group of magicians hated by the populice. Also the hero Tier is a magician who does not realize what he is. We only realize that he is a magician as the story unfolds. In the second, we already know he is a magician, we already know that Tier loves his wife et.cetra et.cetra. There is some new stuff of course. We learn the story of the 'stalker', we learn more about 'Isolder the silent'. However there is not enough character development. In the end the 'stalker' is just the \`stalker' and 'Isolder the silent' is just a woman who didn't speak much. I was hoping for more. I give this book 4 stars since it is an exellent read.

Ms. Curington is an accomplished storyteller, grabbing your attention from the first page and never letting go.The main characters are well drawn and fully developed with perhaps the most fleshed out being the Zi, J'Qhir - the Commander. Never has \\"I will build a lair for us\\" sounded so romantic!And speaking of romance, from the \\"ss\\" in its title to the signature s-speak of J'Qhir, this book sizzles! The sexual tension between the alien male J'Qhir and the human female Leith is all the more intriguing for their differences. Here Ms. Curington charts an original course in exploring their love. They truly discover one another and in so doing, define themselves.I would highly recommend this book to anyone whether they are fans of science fiction or, like me, just enjoy a good old-fashioned love story - with a new twist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"I just finished this book this morning.

This is one of those books I read more than once. First of all I love this genre (alien ,who is not human looking meets human woman and has attraction immediately on both sides.)Just love it. Lanette Curington does it so well too. I do wish she'd do it again. I'd love to read a sequel to this book. I keep hunting Amazons profile page of L.C. to see if she has written anything else like this, to no avail. This story was so touching that I even cried at a couple parts.

It is the only interpretation (Muslims do not accept that the Qur'an can be translated) that tries to keep the poetic, grand, glittering, rhythmical and rhetorical flavor of the Qur'an, but the text is not terribly accessible and there are no footnotes to explain anything.If you want to just get a flavor for what the Qur'an reads like, this is good, and the preface is enlightening. ...For sheer poetry, Arberry's text gets five stars, but I gave it four because of the total lack of explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"the classic Qur'an and the best in English","review":"I own many versions of the Quran and I can safely say that A. J. Arberry's translation is the most poetic Quran in English. Arberry is full of passion for the non-Arabic speaker and his 'interpretation' is a plea for the truth of Islam. As well as being beautiful in English, the feel of Arberry's Koran is impressive too. To use one example, the penguin is printed on grey paper with a small print, the text feels squashed inside a heavy book. The penguin feels like a cold textbook, rather than the fingerprints of God. Most books these days have this cheap flavour to them. Arberry's is printed on luxurious yellow paper to make the pages warm and the word of God in a beautiful font; also, Arberry's Koran Interpreted is now considered and old translation, it is very affordable. This book is an absolute gem and a bargain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like the Title Says","review":"This is not an interpretation of the Koran.

Arberry's has great command of the English language but unfortunately he comes short in his knowledge of the Arabic language and Islam. This makes his translation a beautiful read, but extremely inaccurate and even plainly wrong in crucial parts. For a much better translation I would recommended Muhammad Asad or Nooruddin.

The liner notes are better than adequate, and there are photos of Numan at different stages of his career... he's a real chameleon as far as his 'look' goes. Saw him in concert many years ago. Front row. Unforgettable! Didn't have too much to say between songs, but what an elaborate stage presentation! There are a generous 18 songs here from what I guess you could call his peak period, and there is not one I don't like. Nor do I feel like there are any glaring omissions.

Absolutely no plot,I gave this movie 1 star. it takes alot more than guts to make a good horror movie.

Try and write another good one like The Shining or Pet Cemetary."},{"rating":"1","title":"MANGLED SCRIPT = MANGLED MOVIE","review":"THE MANGLER originated in Stephen King's fun short story collection, NIGHT SHIFT. It was brief and to the point. In trying to expand its merits to the screen, director Tobe Hooper finds himself with a mangled script that gets so incoherent, it becomes annoying. Ted Levine is mysteriously miscast in the leading role, and his performance is wooden and uninspired. Even the formidable Robert Englund seems to be playing another Freddy Kreuger. The inclusion of the belladonna is confusing, and the ending where fingers start being lopped off comes out of nowhere.Not one of the best King adaptations to hit the screen, but it IS far better than its ridiculous sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down.","review":"When I first saw the peview to The Mangler I am sure that I asking myself why this flim was not more popular. Being it was a Hooper/Englund/King combo I had high expectation for is one.But all this movie turned out to be was a forgetable and weird story of a machine that is eating the factory workers who are working for an old, rich, crazy, guy played by Englund, who owns and love the machine very much even though it is possessed by the devil. The machine also very much injoys 16 year old virgans on their brithdays.The movie gose from good and scary to lame over and over agian in a trend almost. The Mangler also has one of the cheesest screenplays i have ever heard. I will give this movie some props for the great and sinster acting by Robort Englund, and Ted levine."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes Dreamcatcher look like a masterpiece","review":"The Mangler is by the worst horror movie next to Dreamcatcher,Cabin Fever,House of the Dead, Halloween 3,and Ax Em. Stephen King's short story is expanded to feature length with Tobe Hooper directing. The main plot is a woman is mangled in a laundry steam-roller and then it takes a cop to figure out why the steam-roller is killing the people. The cast is good with Robert Englund as the crazy owner of the laundrymat and Ted Levine(who played the villian Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs)as the cop but the movie is confusing and then turns ludricrous in the middle half. The only good part is when the man is ripped apart in half by the steam-roller's claw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, LAMEgler is more like it","review":"This picture is most boring for a long time. It contain three robots, two of which are evil. One is our loveable friend, though whose heart contain much love but dead birds as well. This robot is corrupted by a jerk police officer who calls him son of bicth. Then he kicks off. His head and demon spirits release to a factory which becomes posessed. The back of the movie I beleive says that the movie contain cameo by actor who plays chewbacca in star trek. It didn't to my knowledge. I might be a mistake. Factory possesed by loveable robot's spirits, turns into monster, kills freddy cougar who plays a robot in the film, and chases cop and lady who I have never seen before into sewer. It then leaves them alone and they go\\"oh well\\", even though monster is still living the movie ends. This doesn't contain very spooky themes - don't watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"The headline on the case looks like a sure fire winner: Tobe Hooper directing! Englund staring! Based on a Stephen King book! Well this movie just plain sucked. I remember reading the short story of the Mangler and thinking it was some of King's worst writing. Then I remember I have a weakness for really bad horror movies, so I picked this baby up. Aside from a few cool scenes of gore, this movie just drags on and on. Englund's acting is really not up to par on film; He seems wooden and not into the role. Also, films based on King novels are never that good, ive recently discovered. Read a book instead of watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha! Ha! Ha!","review":"OK, I fell for it too. A movie based on a good Stephen King short story (from his \\"Night Shift\\" collection), directed by horror meister Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Poltergeist, Salem's Lot), starring Robert \\"Freddie Krueger\\" Englund and Ted \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Levine! How could it possibly stink?? Well, it's another case of a short-short story being bloated out to fill movie time. The Mangler itself is pretty scary in the book. On film, it's just one more mechanical monster on the loose. Hooper probably did the best he could with the awful material. Englund and Levine just sort of sleepwalk through the mess.

Tobe Hooper (\\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\") is the director, and it's lead star is none other than horror legend Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger). However, \\"The Mangler\\" just doesn't deliever. It looks like the budget wasn't much and to be perfectly honest, King's story isn't much, Hooper's direction is uninspired, but Englund has fun with his role as a bitter old man with polo."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mangler","review":"I couldnt help but be impressed when I read the all star cast involved in this movie. Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) as director, a Stephen King (The Shining) adaptation, and good 'ol freddy krueger (Robert Englund) as one of the main characters.With these three involved I couldnt help but pick it up and give it a viewing, and get a little excited about watching it.Unfortunately, like a lot of King movies, it falls quite short of being anything special, in fact the end result is rather mediocre considering the players involved.Tobe Hoopers creeping claustrophobia is felt throughout the movie,but wasnt enough to keep the movies head above water.The acting performances were pretty ordinary, but thats almost the norm with horror movies.Of course, Im not going to recommend you buy it, but if you are a fan of Hooper or King, or even England, watch it for there sakes, but dont say I didnt warn you.For you Hooper fans out there, (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"The mangler is a great movie,a short story by steven king.

Those are Robert Englund's twisted performance, and the gore. Everything else about this horror film, from the script to the direction to most of the acting is pretty bad. I don't know how someone goes from directing decent to great movies like Poltergeist, The Funhouse, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to directing crap like this, but Tobe Hooper did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not entirely awful","review":"Since apparently only lunatics are writing reviews of this DVD (not you Johhnykay), I thought I'd better chime in to offer a reasonable voice.First thing: Stephen King has no approval regarding movies like this. He sold off the rights long, long ago, and thus cannot control when and if they get made, much less the quality of the movies.Second thing: this is not a good movie. Don't make the mistake of thinking that it is. The plot is ludicrous -- it sort of works on the page, but filmed, it is just silly. That said, the movie is not entirely worthless. Robert Englund is fun to watch as the factory owner, and there are a few decent sequences. Mainly, though, I'd say the best reason to watch is for Ted Levine, in a rare starring role as the policeman trying to sort this mess out.Just don't think this is any sort of undiscovered masterpiece; it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO! Robert...How could you do this to me?","review":"This movie was one of the worst I've seen in this genre. Being a Stephen King and Robert Englund fan, I was not only disgusted but shocked when I rushed to pick up this video 4 years ago. I watched Nightmare on Elm Street for the first time at 4 years old, and it was love at first sight. I've been a blood and guts fan ever since. Robert Englund's acting was a superb additive to King's story. The plot and story line matches the original novel, which is rare with horror movies. However, it just was NOT scary.

I see other women carrying their small dogs around the store and I think HA! Not too fun to shop with a dog in your hands, is it? Sure, I get a lot of people looking at me with this big pup in a stroller. Though most of them stop me so they can talk to my dog since he's so cute.

I found myself laughing at Demille's humor at the very beginning of the book. The book is easily readable even with the military terminology. The book is a little slow in the beginning but as I said the author keeps you page turning with his humor and wit. But keep on reading because the ending is unbelivable and shocking. The book is far better than the movie and has much more description. I have recommended this book to family members already. The book is filled with suspense, humor, sadness and horror. I'm ready to read more of Nelson Demille's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is the first Demille book I have ever read, and it is because I heard that it would be made into a movie starring John Travolta (I'm a BIG fan), but I wasn't disappointed at all!

Why an author would choose to focus much of his story on deviant sexual practices is beyond me. Is it supposed to titillate me? It's disgusting. The who-done-it aspect of the story is somewhat interesting, but when the murderer was revealed, I had a hard time remembering who this character was. In an audiobook you can't flip back a few pages to make sure you remember who this and that character is and I'm afraid I had to listen again to the first side of the tape to understand better what had happened.

It is a convincing story with sharp and sometimes comic dialogue. The dialogue itself is well composed and convincingly sounds like different people talking, and not the work of the same author.

I am running out of DeMille books to read and am hoping that he will be writing another new novel soon. I need to get my DeMille fix.

There was no reason to care for any of the characters; they were poorly-drawn, and undifferentiated. Every time I read 'and so on,' I knew the author had run out of the words of his craft and had resorted to yet another meaningless gesture to the reader's already much-put-upon imagination and effort to make the reading experience into something more than dull.Don't waste your money.

I wasn't sure what to expect but discovered a cleverly written, well plotted story of the search for the killer of a General's daughter. And I was as involved as the investigators in trying to find the truth and discount the lies.The characterizations were brilliant, mostly through the dialog between Paul Brenner (sleuth extraordinaire) and Cynthia Sunhill (sleuthess extraordinaire)! Their own love-hate relationship kept alive many of the flatter parts of the story. The suspense was built by there being a deadline on the investigation, and I admit that I hadn't puzzled out the culprit until it was exposed in the story.Nothing too cerebral, but a good book for easy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"DeMille has a way of weaving a story that leaves the reader in a state of suspense from chapter one.

There's the trademark stuff by DeMille; the sexual angle and the brainy detective work. It does seem to lack the enterprise of The Gold Coast or Plum Island.Still, it reads well and does present the darker side of humanity in a reasonable manner.For DeMille fans, it gets 3 stars; for others not familiar with his work, 2 stars - start on The Gold Coast or Plum Island first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, Funny, Intriguing.....Disappointing?.","review":"I just finished reading the Novel but i had done a sacred mistake.

I, too, would like to know who had her ring and what the deal was with the bayonet.

If these instances were removed from the book, it would be very slim indeed.It made it very boring and hard to read.I wouldn't suggest this book for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst waste of time","review":"Intrigued by the description on the back of this book, I waded through all the 'intrigue' and 'scandal' thinking there'd be a worthy moral of the story.

Is there anything wrong with his being a proud American? Why shouldn't he embrace that part of himself? As he said himself, it is Americans who buy his tickets and watch his program and 90% of them happen to be white. George Lopez is obviously very proud of his accomplishments, his Mexican heritage and his American citizenship that was his birthright.

I think there was a big progression between Loud and Dirty to Survival of the Sickest to The Dead Moon Calling. The Loud and Dirty CD was raw and not as good. Survival or the Sickest was a better CD with better songs and the Dead Moon Calling is down right excellent. Survival of the Sickest does have some awesome songs though. It's down right psycho! It's full of Slap Bass and Screaming Vocals. If you are starting out with Mad Sin buy Dead Moon Calling. If you already own that CD but this one! It's a little less than that one but it still sounds good! Their older CDs are good too but I wouldn't start off with them.

Boy do I regret that. I am a fan of psychobilly, and this is far from it. It sounds like a horrible, poppy mix of Sum 41, AFI, hard rock and some kind of drunk pirate. It has its moments, but I would stay away from this one unless you are a real fan. I did get \\"God Save The Sin\\", which is an impressive release from these guys. I would reccommend that one instead, especially if you're an actual psycho fan. I guess if you are a fan of more mainstream music this could be for you.

It has a very powerful and smooth-running motor. The fit-and-finish of the tool is the best that I have seen for any drill--period. The ergonomics (balance, grip, ease of operation, etc.) are superb. Drilling/driving at low speed takes a little practice, but is quite manageable. However, the drill really shines in high-speed drilling applications, such as pocket-hole joinery. The Porter-Cable 2611 is a rock-solid, high-performance drill. The only serious competition is the Milwaukee model that is in the same class."},{"rating":"1","title":"fail","review":"I got this product a few weeks ago and thought it was really good, it was a good length for me [I am 5'4] but it would be good for someone taller also.

Propped-up as great exploitation in the product details, I purchased it almost immediately (at least I got it from a secondary seller and didn\`t pay Amazon pricing, thankfully). Unfortunately, the 3 films come from a wretched source, all the colors bleed and/or are washed out, creating an almost hot orange haze throughout, the films are edited/hacked to pieces, and all are poorly, annoyingly dubbed, resulting in an abyssmal viewing experience, even w/ the fast-forward button engaged. \`Felt like I was the one imprisoned ... look elsewhere for your WIP kicks, you won\`t find them here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible video quality","review":"This is not worth purchasing.

But a pristine print of any of these movies defeats the purpose. Anyway, I am sure the original prints are long lost and forgotten. These movies are down and dirty and that's part of the fun. We are conditioned by big budget commercial entertainment to reject anything that doesn't quite fit that norm. That incompatibility with the sleek and shiny norm is precisely why I enjoy these movies.All three films deliver the lurid thrills fans of the women in prison genre come to expect. They were shot on the fly and, yes, the transfers are crummy. But if you're looking for some surprising examples of the genre that are a bit off the beaten path, you'll get a kick out of these. You can find poetry in the strangest places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Box Cover deceiving","review":"Like most or all movies of this genre, the exotic box covers pulls in suckers/viewers to the movie. Viewer is disappointed after watchign the movie, looking for exotic, big-busted babes in prison, doing catfights, shower gropes, etc. The good parts are few and far between. I prefer the old Pam Grier WIP (Women in Prison) movies. More skin, more violent women action scenes thjan in this mild, lame triple-feature. Watch on FAST FORWARD, stop movie to watch the few scenes worth watching when yuo find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this show?","review":"This show is terrible now and it used to be a favorite. Seasons 1-3 were a wild ride and I thought season 4 had some problems but overall it was a great change of pace. I was excited to see how S5 would unravel the mess from the S4 ending. Well I just finished watching and it looks like the writers ran out of ideas. The plot is contrived and many of the jokes felt forced and unfunny. Worst of all the characters are all despicable now with the exception of Nancy's eldest son. The writers quit trying to write thoughtful scripts and started relying on shock value. This is evidenced by the inclusion of a disturbing and gratuitous rape scene. A scene that two of the show's writers and Kevin Nealon joke about during one of the episode commentaries. I'm not sure why I'm even giving this thing 2 stars but it does have that trainwreck quality to it. You just can't quite quit but you know you should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series slides further; don't waste your time","review":"This show is at best a pale imitation of what it was in its first three seasons. I guess I want to see how Nancy Botwin's tale ends, but I would have been so much more satisfied if this show had wrapped up after a two or three-year run. Season 5 still has some funny moments, mostly propelled by the dry, wry Mexicans Nancy is forced to deal with, but the initial charm of the show is well and truly lost. Maybe Weeds is a little bit like what I'm told using drugs is like: it's very easy to get hooked, but after years of use you're embarrassed and ashamed and wished you were clean.The old devices are wearing thin: Silas does something stupid, Shane broods, Nancy sleeps with somebody to get everyone out of a jam.

I returned the first set because the episodes on disk two were completely unwatchable. If the disk would load at all, it would only play the first half of the first episode, then it would freeze. It would load the first episode, and sometimes you could fast forward through this episode to get to subsequent episodes, but it would play about 5 seconds of them (blurred and skipping) before it froze and stopped. I tried playing this disk on 3 different DVD players, and all were varying shades of intolerable. So, I returned the disks, got a replacement and it was the same, the second disk was useless. Both sets were new, never opened. There are only 3 disks, so one third of them are worthless straight out of the package. Returned for refund.

I found the stories unpleasant, some characters despicable, and felt all the regular cast became obnoxious and unlikeable - especially Nancy. After \\"being in love\\" with Mary Louise for a few years I felt totally the opposite. There was no way she should have even been nominated for an Emmy, let alone win it. And she had the nerveto ask on Twitter, \\"Who Thought I Should Have Won the Emmy Last Night?\\" I bought two copies of the first four seasons. This is the first season that I will not even buy one. It's unfortunate that Jenji and the writers had to ruin a Great Show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the show can't wait for more!","review":"Looking forward to seeing Nancy spin out of this one.

Right from the begginning, you feel like you know who the characters are, and you can't help but care about how everything turns out for them. O'Donnel's character grew up without a role-model and Pacino's needed to know he could still be one.

It makes you laugh, makes you cry, and it makes you want to stand up and cheer. Al Pacino plays one of his best roles ever in playing the Colonel.

If you liked Dead Poets Society or Finding Forrester you will love this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to watch.","review":"Mr. Pacino, who has not been a favorite actor of mine, gives a powerful and compelling display of his acting abilities as a blind, embittered, retired army officer bent on destroying himself.

Frank Slade ranks with Michael Corleone and Tony Montana as Pacino's most memorable (fictional) screen characters (Frank Serpico is in a class all it's own). This is also an enduring story of friendship: The bonding between Pacino and Chris O'Donnel's Charlie Sims is heart warming, but never sappy. Bo Goldman again proves to be a genius with the pen. Great, great work.

Al Pacino delivers one of the greatest on screen performances ever (and he's delivered a few others too) as a blind Colonel whose desires for life send him and Chris O'Donnell to New York for a weekend full of laughs, tears, tragedy, and triumph.

This movie, however, knocks my socks off! Yes it's cliche to mention by now, but the tango scene has got to be one of the BEST dance scenes ever filmed. Lovely...absolutely lovely. Oh to be young, willowy, smartly dressed and able to tango with an elegant man like Mr Pacino! And then to watch Charlie stand up to the old boy's club with the stirring defence of Lt Col Slade...LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd buy the movie for the disciplanary hearing speech alone!","review":"Different movie...quite an unexpected, albeit analogous role for Pacino. He's a master, no doubt, but what brought me to tears wasn't the 'near death scene' at his suicide attempt, but his stirring speech before the disciplinary committee. THIS type of speeches make history! All the other stuff may or may not happen--the facts would vary, of course, but the strength of the movie are the underlying principles that make life worth living. Not being melodramatic, just a tad bit jealous that a person put them into words so well, and that another person internalized them so masterfully as to make them sound...infallible...despite, or against all else.GREAT show. Not the action flicks I'm used to, but nonetheless satisfying on a deeper philosophical level. A definite recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Words! Hoo-Hah","review":"Al Pacino may have deserved his award earlier but this is a beautiful moving performance as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade. He touches all the funny parts right and truly deserved this for his bravura performance. He was a laugh riot as the Colonel because of his hoo-hah phrase. But most importantly Chris O'Donnell should have won for his performance as Charlie Simms.

The Magnolias were one of the best bands in the Twin Cities for many years, but always lived in the shadow of their more famous brethren; Husker Du, the Replacements. and Soul Asylum. They share of bit of the same musical template as the 'Mats and Soul Asylum; a buzz of guitars laid over a pop-rock bedrock, but with a punkier, fiestier attitude. A bit more like Green Day in that sense, and less of Westerberg's lyrical genius. But still ... the Magnolias went at their music full throttle and always played with flair and passion. No ballads or filler here, just very good songs. This album is an excellent representation of what the Magnolias were all about.

This is a big budget movie. The costumes and sets for Victorian England as well as the scenery are outstanding. It was filmed beautifully, rivaling The Black Stallion for the most beautiful equine photography in a movie,ever. The story is actually much more true to the book the The Black Stallion is too.If you have read and loved the book, you won't be disapointed in this movie.

This film version brings the lesson along with its gorgeous color and lively music. One of the great voice performances ever captured is given by Alan Cumming as the voice of the horse. It's the strongest performance in the film, as well as the longest. Bean fans will be disappointed by only two early scenes.

Allough Beauty narrates through the movie, the other horses don't talk, some people don't like this, but the movie is about beauty and it would become to confusing if they all talked. Some small characters have been left out but I doubt you will notice this. Some scenes have also been left out but this does not make any differences to the movie.

He used to have the print center make course guides, but now (for the first year book) he has put the book online at http://polish.slavic.pitt.edu/. It's always his most up-to-date version. Also, instead of doing the drills at the end of the chapter on paper, he has a free computer program called Lektorek. It tells you when you are wrong so that you don't learn something incorrectly. It's sort of buggy sometimes, but for the most part it's much easier to learn Polish with this program. Another advantage to the online version of the book is that you can click on the drills that you'll have to do in the Lektorek, and it will pronounce it for you. The conversations border on the surreal, but all in all, I did learn a lot from the Lektorek and online pronounciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"This book is outdated and it uses an old style of language teaching.

Billy Bob Thornton plays an amazing role as the unmotivated brother of Bill Paxon. The chain of events in this movie really prove that money makes people do strange things. I loved this movie so much that I read the book afterward (first time I've done that). This is a must purchase for DVD collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I'm very satisfied with the prduct that I got from you.

The plot has been seen a thousand times before but the atmosphere and tension were pitched just right. A little more originality next time please but top marks for popcorn value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird....","review":"If I had not read the book before, maybe I would have liked this movie more than I did. After all, Paxton and Thorton give above average performances here.But what amazed most was the fact that Scott Smith himself adapted his original book to the screen. So, one could supose that the necessary amount of changes would be minimal and restrict.No. Smith himself changed a LOT of his book. Believe me, Hank Mitchell is a lot less bad than he is in the book.But maybe, when translating it to screen, Scott Smith realized that his acclaimed book had some unecessary excesses of violence, like, for instance, a horrible chapter in a small store, when Hank kills an old woman...All in all, it's a good movie for those who had not read the book. Also, it proved that Sam Raimi is definitely a great director beyond the horror movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"A Simple Plan is a movie about characters getting into bad situations and going to extreme measures to hide their guilt. It is suspenseful and entertaining. The plot involves this: 3 friends(two of them brothers) hunting in the woods find a plane full with money. A LOT OF MONEY. They decide to keep it. One thing leads to another, and they end up commiting horrible crimes and going to further lengths to hide their guilt. The 3 friends start to go against each other and threaten each other. 1 crime leads to another, and at the end there's a climax in the woods that will be with you for the next 3 days. This is a definite must see if your looking for a thriller. The acting is excellent, especially by Billy Bob Thorton and Bill Paxton. The dialogue is perfect. You will be blindsided by the things they are driven to commit all because of the money. After all, it was just a simple plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dunno...","review":"I suppose the biggest problem is that, while it's evidently supposed to be a neat little morality play about how greed corrupts and whatnot, it never really humanized the characters before daemonizing them. There are numerous problems of believability beyond that, but it doesn't really matter--the film just lays it on too thick to really get anywhere. Yeah, Thornton is quite good (surely the author was influenced by Of Mice and Men), but all in all it's just sorta goofy. Ah well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre!","review":"This was such a bizarre movie! however, it was very entertaining.

A simple plan you might think but of course it's not and things start to go wrong...First off, let me tell you that if you want to see a cheerful uplifting movie that will send you off into the night with your faith in the morality and humanity of mankind restored, this aint it!! Stop reading now and go watch something uplifting and sentimental like the fantastic Field Of Dreams or any of Frank Capra's movies. Sam Raimi's movie is dark. Did I say dark? I'm sorry I meant very DARK. Bleak even. It's kind of like It's a Wonderful Life but in reverse. However if you like dark movies and love Billy Bob Thornton, you'll love this. If you don't, then don't watch this movie, spend your hard earned cash on something else. This is a great movie, with great performances from all concerned, it just wont be for everyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"And a Simple Movie","review":"Both my husband and I fell asleep before the movie was over.

I don't in my reviews because it's fun to be surprised! Billy Bob Thorton and Bill Paxton are mismatched brothers who discover a huge load of money and the events that follow the discovery are hysterical to watch - in a demented sort of way!The acting, directing, and writing are fabulous! The missteps that surround the brothers and a friend as they handle the discovery will leave you laughing and crying all at the same time --- you'll be crying because you are laughing too hard and laughing because you know you should be crying instead!See it...enjoy it...and remember if you ever find any money - don't tell ANYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real nailbiter","review":"This is one of those domino movies, where one small action sets in a motion a long tumbling of dominoes, with one thing leading to another and, finally, to an inevitable disaster as the developments play out. There's a certain Fargo-esque quality, given the snowy Minnesota setting. Billy Bob Thornton gives the most memorable performance as the slightly dumb drunk brother of the college educated feed store clerk, with the third plotter bringing up the rear. At its heart is a question of how far people will go for a large sum of money. As usual, here and in countless other movies with the same theme, the answer is way farther than they should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I feel I must agree with Greg B. To say a movie wasn't good because it wasn't the same as the book it was based upon is ridiculous, for film must follow different conventions than the written word. HOWEVER, that maxim is true only most of the time. Sometimes, what was left out of a film in the transfer from book to screen would have made a better cinematic impression . Such is the case with \\"A Simple Plan\\". Scott Smith more than likely felt compelled to water down his novel to fit Hollywood's narrow views of what makes a successful movie. He probably felt he had managed to still retain the spirit and impact of the book. Sorry,Scott, but I disagree. It was bungled badly, and what could have been a truly chilling morality tale ended up a by the numbers actiion thriller, with a thin moral fabric tacked on as an afterthought. Fair at best, only because a fine cast of actors save what should have rated zero stars. A dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work","review":"product did not work, Kept on putting it in several times and kept on getting incorrect disc.

Desperate to keep the money, they concoct a simple plan.But they soon discover that even the simplest of plans can go awry. While the brothers are attempting to replace some of the evidently initially stolen cash at the suggestion of Hank's wife Sarah (Fonda), an elderly neighbour almost uncovers their secret. This inadvertent act ignites a tragic sequence of events in which the three men play a game of cat and mouse with each other and with the law. Eventually, and inevitably, each man falls victim to his own greed.This film is a highly entertaining thriller, a roller coaster ride of twists and turns, and a vivid portrait of avarice and the callousness and banality that accompany it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water generated Electricity","review":"Lots of information with no pictures to help understand what was bein said.

The title created an expectation of many useful strategies to \\"outsell, outmotivate & outnegotiate\\" my competitors. What I found was a mix of common sense ideas, semi-interesting anecdotes, cute stories, along with some good useful advice. With a 48 minute runtime, there's no need for fluff and filler. I expected a barrage of valuable ideas that I could apply in my own business.One of Harvey's ideas is to never be boring or predictable. Ironically, many (all?) of the examples he recites on the DVD were taken from his previous writings. If the DVD material is recycled from his books, then it should have been titled \\"The Best of Harvey MacKay\\".In fairness, this is the first Harvey MacKay product that I did not like.

Deb's musical passion shines through in songs like More, Mary, and Pick-Axe Love Song, while the whole album lets you know that there is a fierce intellect at work behind what you're hearing. There is a heavy Joni Mitchell influence at work here, but Deb is always herself, throwing in the odd scat riff in her acoustic jazz-folk.

I'm not denying there are a few good songs on it, and DJ Tatana does know how to DJ, but his CD lacks one thing-creativity. Nothing is apparent to me that made this unique than an DJ mix that you can download free (and legally) online.I do enjoy listening to Eye of the Tiger and Man in the Moon, those I believe are good examples of trance, though still not the best I've heard. I do not recommend this CD to anyone-even though it says those who enjoy \\"stadium trance\\" (which 'eye of the tiger' I believe is a good definition of) will love this CD. Maybe I have the wrong defintion before I bought this, but this is not a type of trance I like anymore.I recommend you check out www.di.fm for some great electronic music (and if you go to www.di.fm/edmguide you will find excellent defintions of all genres with sound samples.

Though there are a FEW great tracks on here you'll find yourself playing those and only those songs, ultimately playing them out sooner than you had hoped. Volume 2 is the same way, maybe even worse.

Though it definitely is trance - and so is the music on the other discs titled This Is Trance - this isn't particular representative of the style. This particular disc, released by the Universal-distributed Water Music, does hold a slight edge over most of the other This Is Trance comps, if only because the contributors are more likely to be recognized. DJ Tatana runs through a set of 17 tracks, including ATB's \\"In Love With the DJ,\\" Timo Maas' \\"Old School Vibes,\\" Sarah McLachlan's \\"I Love You [BT Mix],\\" and Conjure One's \\"Sleep [Ian Van Dahl Mix]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved the cuisine on a recent visit to Santa Fe.

If these women had actually taken the effort to break out of such a constructing mold, they would likely not have had to worry about their sexual desires tanking as a result of cutting off their life force.If you've done any work with your own sexuality or work with Earth-based spirituality this book will likely be much to simple and boring for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is so Black and White","review":"Let's see, I'm not a maiden, never was a mom, but at 42 I'm a crone?

The sound on my end is the worst of ANY phone I have ever used. The people on the other end hear me fine but for me at this end (with one base station and 2 additional satellite units upstairs) it is an unclear, static-filled, painful experience that is NOT improved by increasing the volume or hitting the Booster feature. This is the first phone I've had at the new highest frequency (900 MHz or 3 GHz or whatever) so maybe it is that. The base unit is no better than the handsets and the handsets are no better if you are close to the base unit. I'm seriously thinking of going back to my old phones but the LCD's don't work anymore so you can't make use of the Caller ID features!

A couple years ago when it was happening frequently I disconnected all the batteries, cancelled the frequency assignments and reprogrammed, after which they've been working reasonably fine. Sound quality on each line is good, providing there's no inteference with the other line. They've been dropped frequently and have survived. Last complaint/comment is that all the older phones ring tone has seriously dropped in volume. New phones are fine. Seems to be a common flaw.

Being a guitar player myself I really appreciate his expertise. If you like later Robin Trower then you must have this album. It's different than Bridge of Sighs. Hanna and Ballerina are haunting tunes that stick in your head . An excellant CD to listen to while driving, or anytime. I highly recommend Twice Removed From Yesterday to any Robin Trower fans.

I recognize quite a few of the songs, including the FM \\"hits\\" \\"Day of The Eagle\\" and \\"Bridge of Sighs\\". This is 2 albums on one CD, the second, \\"Bridge of Sighs\\", is even better than the first, which is very good. As noted by another reviewer, the sound is a bit \\"flat\\" on the first album, bit it's fine on the second. Not bad, though, especially for 30 year old recordings.

It's hard not to feel sorry for Kidman and Cruise for being forced to do and say such utterly stupid things, but I'm sure they were well compensated though they both looked fairly stricken too.In a nutshell: just as the happily-ever-after ending is almost clinched after a predictably suspenseful conflict/challenge situation, Tom Cruise has a near-death experience but is brought back by...Nicole Kidman's True Love and Heartbreak! Ron Howard as demonstrated in his other films is a fine director, with enough of a brain and good taste so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and blame this outrageously nauseating ending on some Hollywood producer(s) and their focus group of 13 year old halfwits and emotionally deprived housewives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I gave it one star because the submission required something. I've always been a huge fan of of Ron Howard's, until watching (as much as I was able) this. Aside from the worn-out theme and predictable acting, the fight scenes made me sick. Unfortunately, this is what the general public seem to enjoy, and Howard has sunk to the same level as every other director who feels necessary to include footage of someone getting their face bashed bloody to get a paying audience. At least Howard didn't go overboard with the make-up and fake blood (the real thing was far worse). If this is truly a part of history and the way people behaved back then, I am ashamed of being Irish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!","review":"This movie is terrible. The plot is horribly contrived and makes absolutely no sense, the acting and fake Irish accents are horrible, and there is no onscreen chemistry between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Considering that they were married at the time, it really lends credance to the rumors circulating back then that their whole marriage was just a PR ploy.The only way to watch this long movie is with the subtitles on and your DVD player on 8x fast forward. Good for speed reading practice.And the only reason that I wrote this very short review was that I felt duped by all these five star reviews for this movie. There just aren't enough one star reviews on this movie to do it justice.I can only guess that many of these other five star reviews were entered by Tom Cruise's infamous PR machine.

Nicole Kidman on the other hand always does a great job but, like her ex-husband, doesn't always have the best taste in screenplays.Far and Away is, in my opinion, Tom and Nicole at their best.

As a romance, Tom and Nicole's characters actually hate each other a good part of the time, but they endure these hardships until they have a strong bond between them. Both strive to fulfill their dreams, taking us on a tour of old America as they go. We see some important US history laced within the story. Their journey is met with several heartfelt blows, but they keep picking up the pieces and going forward. The movie culminates with a little known event in US history, the Oklahoma land rush.

It's a somewhat interesting (although exaggerated and over-simplified) look at the American immigrant experience and a man's (or, in Nicole Kidman's case, a woman's) yearning for land to call one's own.The scenery is beautiful, there are one or two very funny scenes, and the acting is not too bad.The budding romance between the characters played by Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman is well done.

Amazingly the hard rocker who'd become a pop crooner now sounded as fresh and original as the new bands that were just beginning to break.There are three standout tracks on this album. Clones was a minor hit. If you ever heard it, you probably wouldn't know it was Alice at all. It is slyly funny and great for dancing the robot. Pain was a track from the film Roadie and features Alice's patented dark humor and a nice steady beat. Aspirin damage is a quirky little classic. Most (or all) of the songs on this album are intended to be funny-- and they are-- wickedly so.The old album still rocks today. It was a nice departure for Alice. Should fit right in at any 80s dance party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flush Da Fashun","review":"Yeah, yeah, we all know this isn't one of Alice's finer efforts. I mean, you'd never even guess it was Alice unless you're familiar with his voice(and that is sometimes tricky on this one). This is the first of what I call his \\"weird\\" trilogy( cruddy name, I know). The beginning of the decade made him want to reinvent himself, and he started it with the new waveish, slightly punkish album. He continued to expand on the punkish sound through the next two albums. But whether you view it as a guilty pleasure, rubbish or genius, there are some fantastic songs on this album. \\"Pain\\" I think is one of the best songs he's done lyrically. Basically, this one is for the completists(kinda like Yes' Tormato), because those who want to get into Alice Cooper aren't going to rush for this one first. If you become a hardcore fan, you'll eventually get around to this and either love it to death(haha) or have it sit there in your collection making it look larger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with early Alice","review":"You have to give Alice Cooper credit. They managed to evolve with the times nabbing critical acclaim in the 70's(with \\"Love It To Death\\" thru \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\") and their commercial success in the 90's. Oh, but there was the dreadful 80's!! On \\"Flush the Fashion\\" , Alice Cooper seemed like there were lost in time somewhere with no direction to turn. \\"Aspirin Damage\\", \\"Nuclear Infected\\"(the list goes on...) don't even make decent album filler. On this album, Alice Cooper are just uninspired. They should have taken the 80's off. \\"Talk Talk\\", \\"Clones(we're all)\\" and \\"Pain\\" are quite good though. But sadly, 3 out of 10 good tracks don't add up to a good album. Do yourself a favor and avoid Alice in the 80's. Embrace the Alice of the 70's.

It has some decent guitar work on it, but it generally just all sounds the same. Nothing at all like his earlier (perfect) works. If you like this era of Alice Cooper, I would suggest getting Hey Stoopid instead. It is much more true to his classic style, and a much better record, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good, really...","review":"I have every Alice Cooper album - many on both CD and vinyl. I'm a fan of almost all of his music, both by himself and with the original AC Band. Also, I absolutely LOVE the three albums that followed this (Special Forces, Dada, and Zipper Catches Skin). \\"Flush The Fashion\\" is a dud, though, in my opinion. I have tried and tried and tried for years to get into it, and as my tastes in music have evolved and expanded, I still haven't been able to find FTF to be a good listen. While many reviewers give credit for crossing from hard rock to New Wave, to my ears, it just didn't work here. \\"Clones\\" and \\"Pain\\" are indeed gems, and I listen to them often. But I consider this to be an album strictly for completists - those two tracks could be downloaded, or are available on \\"The Life & Crimes of Alice Cooper\\" box set. Do yourself a favor and skip this one unless you absolutely feel the need to have it. Sorry, Alice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise! Surprise!","review":"I have avoided Alice's \\"Flush the Fashion\\" for years due to negative reviews. Anyway, I picked it up on a whim with a few other of the more obscure Cooper albums. Ok, ok...this is a REALLY rockin' album, and I was totally surprised. It was produced by Roy Thomas Baker (The Cars) so it has a little of that vibe/sound, but it's undeniable Alice. I wish I had got this sooner. The way each track effortlessly segues into the next is great and the song Clones (We're All) is one of Cooper's best. There is plenty of humour throughout these tight punchy numbers. For example, check out the tunes, Aspirin Damage, Model Citizen and Grim Facts. Check it out you may be surprised, like I was..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough, biassed and both scientifically and sexually naive","review":"James Jones's biography of Alfred c Kinsey is a valuable antidote to the hagiographies and demonologies published so far. Jones presents the nastier sides of his subject's personality and exposes his strategically concealed sexual practices. However, Jones presents Kinsey as a pervert and charlatan, failing to understand the moral and scientific rationales for Kinsey's approach to sex research and thus totally misrepresents both the man and his achievement. Jones's last-page sop to Kinsey's greatness seems to be a cowardly after-thought to a bilious, splenetic and angry book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean Book","review":"Jones certainly did his homework, but the work comes across as mean, even vindictive. He shows Kinsey is the harshest light and he comes across as excessively judgmental. A more recent book, Sex - the Measure of All Things by Jonathan Gathorne Hardy is a kindler and more balanced look at Kinsey and his work. I recommend starting with that. Kinsey was a great pioneer -- not perfect -- but a true giant in opening up to the doors to our sexuality. The Christian right has spent the last thirty years trying to discredit Kinsey's work and take us back to the 19th Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, Terrible Book","review":"\\"Awkward\\" and \\"provincial\\" wrote the NY Times reviewer, and I can't disagree. To get an idea of the biographer's perspective on Kinsey, consider that he refers to an interest in S/M as \\"peculiar,\\" and closes by predicting that had the atheistic Kinsey lived to see the age of AIDS, he would have seen AIDS as the work of a \\"wrathful God.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This is crap","review":"This book is based on a little research and a large amount of opinion (too much).

All I kept seeing were several words repeated. I thought this book would give an insight to the Yakuza world and how it functions,etc. Like the foundations. This is nothing but a simple, lame recap of a guy who went through some semi-yakuza and other dealings. Some of the details, for like 150 pages are his high-school/university demonstrations. I mean, how boring is this!. The title is about his involvement in the underworld, yet half the book is merely about demonstrations, JCP, etc etc. If you want a fun read- read Confessions of a yakuza- that is excellently written, and the story will keep you entertained. I could not pick up Toppamono after the 150th page. It was just too boring, I felt like skipping pages. What a waste of a buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becomes very dull quite quickly","review":"The book starts off well with detailed insight on the author's upbringing in a small town yakuza family, but becomes very boring after the first third of the book. Unless you have a huge interest in the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) circa 1970 and student uprisings, you'll want to skip large sections of the book.To be honest I stopped reading half way in, I simply lost interest. If you're looking for yakuza-style memoirs, read 'Confessions Of A Yakuza'. Toppamono deviates too far from the gangster world that I was looking forward exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Review","review":"This is one of my all time favourite songs, which I had only owned on vinyl format until recently.

This is a much better product than the traditional sphygmomanometers because there isn't a whole lot of tubing with this cuff. In the traditional cuffs, there is a lot of peripheral noise with tube rubbing especially when you are in a moving vehicle trying to treat a patient. This is even excellent for an office setting. Rubber tubing will have wear over time.

I've read a lot of her books but Honest Illusons struck me as the most beautifully touching one of all. It is an experience to grow up with the hero and the heroine, to live their lives with them, to cry when they're down and cheer when there's a happy ending. All this can be found in Honest Illusions, and much much more. The magic in the book is more than the tricks and illusions that Luke, Roxy and Max display, it's also the magic of life and living ... masterfully constructed to give every reader his or her heart's dreams. If you only read one romance-thriller-mystery in your life, this is it"},{"rating":"2","title":"You wont be disappointed!","review":"I have read nearly every book Nora Roberts has written, and this tops my list of favorites.

The over-produced sameness and glossy slickness of the stuff they did for Son Seals' studio albums is in direct contradiction to the rawness of his basic style. This album, however, shows it the way it should be...warts and all.Son's guitar playing and singing are direct and powerfull (ie: raw and aggressive). This album shows him doing what he did best: kicking out hard, ripping bar blues. The song \\"Funky Bitch\\" is worth the price of the album on its own. His other live album \\"Spontaneous Combustion\\" is great too, but \\"Live and Burning\\" kicks its butt, steals its wallet, and dumps it in the alley.If you like a lot of slick, Hollywood horn arrangements and syrupy production look elsewhere, but if you want to hear what it sounds like listening to a killing machine tear the house apart....

This NEVER happened when I could readily find L'Oreal Mattique retail. I am very disappointed. I'll try one of the other bottles to see if the same problem exists there. I find myself not using it. I wasted my money. Before it had been discontinued, it had been my very favorite makeup--non-oily, beautiful shade (Pale), and it was the one my dermatologist recommended.

But I heard this album while shopping in a record store and had to have it. In it you can hear the seeds of Doo-Wop, just exploding with verve and energy and virtuoso acapella performances. Try a couple of the sample tracks Amazon has furnished and see if you agree. Unfortunately, some of the liveliest and varied tracks; Live So God Can Use You, and I'll Fly Away aren't available for sampling, but I strongly reccomend you at least spend a few minutes trying the available samples and seeing if you don't think they have potential.

I was hoping there would be recipes using leftovers or precooked meat and there are none. I have \\"Pilsbury's Creative Cooking In Minutes\\" and Betty Crocker's Family Dinners In a Hurry\\" from around the 70's which have more appealing recipes, which I have tried and have liked. One sample recipe in this cookbook is for Chili Mac Casserole which uses one can of chili and cooked macaroni combined and baked in the oven for 20 minutes. Now, I like easy, but this goes way overboard. Most of the recipes are like this. There were only a handful of recipes I would actually make, and they were mostly chicken recipes.

It has a very funny story line with excellent makeup and special effects. Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep and Bruce Willis are excellent in their roles.

The special effects won an Oscar, and even though you don't hear much about it, the performances are very good.Especially notable are Meryl Streep and Bruce Willis, both playing strongly against type. (Although Streep played a role not too different in \\"She-Devil.\\") Willis is riotous (and hardly recognizable) as Ernest Menville, washed-up, drunken funeral-home cosmetologist. And Streep gave an unforgettable performance as faded star Medeline Ashton, an acid send-up of ego-driven celebrities with al sorts of great lines.Early morning, as Ernest walks past her bedroom door Madeline: (Sticking her head out) ROSE!

Strange plot but well executed.I don't think the majority of people will find this a funny film. Some scenes, which in my opinion are hilarious, are crude. For example when Goldie Hawn gets shot in the stomach with a shotgun, and starts walking around with a tremendous hole in her. Or when Streep falls down a large victorian-style staircase, you can hear and see bones breaking, and when she stands up all her limbs are pointing all over the place. Well, crude or funny, or both.

I think he was miscast.Going back to the special effects, they were good & do well in standing up to the test of time.No good extras on this, just standard cast information.

Justification is the issue upon which the church stands or falls. Luther's exegesis is second to none."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Cast","review":"Cast's 1st effot, \\"All Change\\" has a number of singles on it, including \\"Alright\\" which was a radio darling, and even got play in the United States, which says something. Mother Nature Calls, though not offering a charting single, is a great listen, and a necessary purchase if you like britpop or rock/pop. The reviewer who related this album to Oasis' \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" is right on track. Great mix of ringing electric guitars and smooth acoustic melodies.Note: Lead singer is John Power, not Tom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, emotional, sensational","review":"Gary Oldman is at his best.

This movie is one of my all time favorite movies. It's definitely my favorite Gary Oldman movie. I have seen this movie several times and never tire of it. Awesome story. One of the greatest artist of our generation playing the greatest composer that ever lived! The writing, the acting, direction, costumes, and, of course, the music. What amazes me about Gary Oldman is that he is not a big man but he always seems larger than life on the screen. He amazes me. The only actor right now that is doing that is Tom Hardy. I highly recommend this movie. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and great performances","review":"In this fictional reconstruction of Beethoven's life, we will learn of the drama of misunderstanding his beloved (who is it?), caused by an abusive youth which impaired his communication skills with words. How Beethoven struggled with his gift as a music composer, while losing his hearring and showing the shallow admiration at his death of a man which was hard to live with.The performances of two Dutch actors Jeroen Krabbe and Johanna ter Steege is sublime, next to Gary Oldman and Isabella Rossellini.A thrilling love story with a surprise ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie is amazzzinnnnggg","review":"Gary Oldman is absolutely transformed in this film.

Can be seen again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Opportunity","review":"Sophomoric and totally non-historic. This is an almost OK movie about one of the greatest men who ever lived. Beethoven's life is too important to let this movie rest as his biography on film. Nobody who knows anything about Beethoven the man or about Beethovens music could like this movie. The three women in question weren't even contenders, especially his sister-in-law Johanna, who he despised. Beethoven is written as a freakish eccentric. Gary Oldman's performance is superficial and cartoonish. The sets are nice, the costumes are nice, the music is nice, but so what? You get that in any period film. The greatest composer of all time deserves a great movie honoring his life. Oh please God, give us a second chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible film--buy the soundtrack instead","review":"I don't really care how accurate it is biographically; I wanted to be entertained with a good story. This isn't it. It wanders all over the place. The premise is ripped off from Citizen Kane (detectivey-person must talk to surviving loved ones to find out a Big Secret about the Big Man), and it takes forever, goes off down a million side roads that are never resolved or resolved with a big thud. This Beethoven isn't a likable guy--unlike the film character of Amadeus, who was a spoiled brat but still kind of fun and sympathetic, Beethoven is a self-centered, sadistic monster, plain and simple. A single redeeming quality in him--or anyone--would have carried this film a long way. The Ode to Joy at the end is very well done, and the only reason I bumped this film up to 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not entertaining","review":"First let me say that i am a composer and die hard musician. i just watched this movie to learn what i could about this supposed genius, and i could barely keep from turning it off, actually, i did turn it off. quite unattractive really. turns out Beethoven was an insane jerk and his lifestlye was not intersting to me at all. he may have been a great musician, but that is not really the focus of this movie. in fact, there is no focus in this movie, except that he was a jerk.If you want to watch a great movie about a great man, I suggest the \\"The Endurance\\". Enrest Shackleton will make you want to punch people like this Beethoven character. It will blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not believe this movie.","review":"This movie is totally garbage. Not one thing in this movie is historically correct. This does not come close to the other composer movie \\"Amadeus\\" which depicts Mozarts life. Do not come out of watching it thinking you learned something of Beethoven, except how his music sounds. It is obvious that the writers didn't consult any of the numerous historians that focus on Beethoven alone. As a music major, I am completely disgusted with this film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Immortal Beloved","review":"One of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I found it insulting to Beethoven. But far worse than that was the premise of the movie - that Beethoven's sister-in-law (Johanna) was Beethoven's 'Immortal Beloved'. This is the most absurd suggestion I have ever read. Beethoven HATED her! It is beyond me how the directors of the movie could come up with such an absurd premise. Quite apart from these facts, Johanna simply does not coincide with the facts of the case, as revealed in Beethoven's letter to his immortal beloved."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Beethoven....","review":"Beethoven is one of my favorite composers. I took an extensive Music Course dedicated to this fantastic composer. As much as I like Gary Oldman's acting, I could barely watch this film. This is not his life, this woman was not his love, this is NOT Beethoven. Watch Amadeus if you want to see a great film about a great composer. Another reviewer wrote that Beethoven deserves the same treatment as Mozart got in Amadeus. He absolutely does. He was a tremendous man, complex and misunderstood, but beloved by the ALL of Europe by the time of his death. His memory still awaits a film dedicated to his real life and tumultuous, brilliant, disturbed life.Better spend your time watching something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Dementia","review":"The only TRUTH to be be discovered by this movie is that Hollywood and History is an OXYMORON! It would have been more interesting without the inserted fantasies. Beethoven could be a violent character. I hate to think what he would have done to the producer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"While watching this, I couldn't help feeling that the director was TRYING to make a masterpiece, rather than actually produce one. The acting is good, but not extraordinary. As far as the actual shots and music editing, I felt as though I was watching a made-for-TV movie. Many times throughout the movie, Beethoven's glorious music was just playing in the background, with no connection to the story. Absolutely poor music editing! Come on now, Beethoven deserves nothing less than brilliance..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener into a life of a truely legendary musician.","review":"I never expected to ever take an interest into the world of classical music. Seeing this video suddenly turned on a whole new light to this man and his music. Amadeaus did not even come close to the feeling and emotion this film portrays. I have now found myself suddenly listening to this masterful musician with a whole new understanding and appreciation. The movie truely touched my heart..I would highly recommend it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrant Trash","review":"Beethoven deserves better. Anybody who knows Beethoven knows that none of the women under consideration for the title were even major love interests of Beethoven in real life (with the possible exception of the Isabella Rosselini character). The true Immortal Beloved is not even mentioned in the movie. How about a serious movie about the life of Beethoven, with a score that does him justice. The music could have been done so much better. Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhhhhh!","review":"This is what I was screaming during the movie. It was so annoying! You had to sit there forever watching things that are pointless to you until the end of the movie. You spend at least two hours doing nothing but staring at it blank faced. What for? Simply to find who Beethoven was writing love letters to! Even if you like classical music, don't watch this. I like it, and still I hated it. If you don't mind watching long, pointless movies, watch this. I think whoever said watching Amedeus is better, she or he is right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling rendition of Beethoven&#65533;s mystery inamorata","review":"Ludwig van Beethoven's mystery lover is speculatively revealed in this masterpiece.

I was pleasantly surprised at how extremely good the hi-def picture looks and the music is amazing in surround sound. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery solved?","review":"This intriguing film presents one possible answer to the question which has occupied many minds for a long time. It is a beautifully crafted film with Beethoven's music as a supporting player. Beethoven's struggle with his deafness and other maladies, with his nephew and his sometimes uncontrolled anger help demonstrate his humanity in contrast to his sublime musical gift, the power and depth of which have not diminished over time. He was a mortal man, but perhaps more. Scholars may have other answers about the identity of his immortal beloved, but his intense longing inspired his creative powers which lifted him into a realm occupied by very few. Those who made this film have created a beautiful document about one of world culture's greatest figures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary Oldman can't carry this mediocre bio flick","review":"Gary Oldman is a fine actor who has portrayed Lee Harvey Oswald, Sid Vicious, Joe Orton, Count Dracula, and here, he impersonates Beethoven. That's what's known as \\"range.\\" But this picture demonstrates why, despite his gifts, he isn't a big star - he just doesn't have that indefinable screen presence that enables even inferior actors to carry a movie. Here he doesn't do much but scowl, rant, and behave like a \\"genius.\\" It's always hard to play a great man convincingly, and it doesn't help that the real Ludwig van was a deeply unpleasant shnorrer unlikely to win the viewer's sympathy. Do yourself a favor and fast forward the video 1 hour 13 minutes to watch the great Barry Humphries as Metternich. It's the best 45 seconds of the film, and I suspect Humphries, a modern dandy, accepted the role because it gave him an excuse to wear a splendid frilly cravat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music and story line","review":"For those who enjoy a good suspense movie, with WONDERFUL music, this is one you want to purchase. My wife, who falls asleep at the mention of \\"movie,\\" not only stayed awake, but enjoyed the movie enough to watch it three times!! She also purchased this for our library. OK, this is the best rating of all -- NO Z's. And no, we aren't sleepless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In general a disappointment","review":"I had heard good things about Immortal Beloved, but in general was disapopinted. I had expected something on the level of the superb Amadeus, in terms of direction, cinematography, acting, and musical score. I found the story hard to believe and wasn't really engaged in discovering the mystery of who Immortal Beloved was until the last 30 minutes of the film. I was also disappointed in the music- basically you only get to hear Moonlight and Pathetique sontas (over and over and over again) and part of Beethoven's 9th symphony. My suggestion: see Amadeus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"This movie has achieved the daunting task of being good enough for its music. I don't collect many movies because, even if I enjoyed them, I don't want to sit through them again after I know the endings. This is an exception. The acting and filmography are so great (not to mention the music) that I enjoy watching it over and over, even though I know the surprise ending. So well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Scenes in All of Film","review":"Despite whatever anyone says about the rest of the movie, the almost-final scene featuring the \\"Ode to Joy\\" is the best expression of the transcendent passion of creativity ever produced on film. The video is worth buying for that scene alone. Gary Oldman is great, the story is fascinating -- although no one actually believes it to be historical, it's still a fascinating account of the personality of a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie!","review":"This movie is simply one of the best ever, and it escapes my mind as to how it didn't do well at the box office, let alone not winning Best Picture!

Beethoven was perhaps one of the most interesting people who ever lived and deserves (at least) the treatment that Mozart received in \\"Amadeus.\\" The angle used in \\"Immortal Beloved\\" was so weak, it doesn't even come close to depicting the Maestro as he deserves. His story doesn't even need an angle. Just a straight-forward bio would have served his memory better; he was tempestous, egotistical, deaf and brilliant! This film is a dog. Please, someone, make a good movie about this great genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling historical innacuracy","review":"One would expect a movie about a famous composer to be true to history. Suggesting that the Immortal Beloved was Beethoven's sister-in-law is sheer nonsense. If there was anyone Beethoven loathed, that was his sister-in-law! He considered her unfit as a mother, due to her past crimes involving theft and false testimony, among others. After his brother died, Beethoven did the utmost to get custody of his nephew .

I see I've put 3 stars for durability by mistake & it won't let me edit. We haven't bothered to try to use it except for a couple of minutes on opening so I can't speak to durability but I don't expect much from the cheap flimsy feel of it! The sound effect is just a very weak buzz, we both said \\"that was it??\\" It's not even nice to use as a pen. It may end up on eBay but the buyer would probably want his money back!

He's thrilled with it. It's been a few days and he's still \\"sonic-ing\\" everything around the house... A grown man. ANYWAY, it is definitely a plastic toy, but there is something cool about having something that works and sounds like David Tenant's sonic screwdriver. I can see how if a person is too rough with it, it might break. My husband has a bit of an issue getting the pen cap off without the whole nib (that what he calls it - see the black dohicky on the end of the screwdriver. The non-sonic end) coming out. The pen comes with a regular pen nib and an ultraviolet nib. I didn't buy it for him to write with and he doesn't seem to care much about that function. It came with 3 batteries, and that's good because as much as he uses it, he's going to wear the batteries out before I can hide it to get some peace. I've been sonic-ed a few too many times.

When you extend the screwdriver the cap on the back often falls off and the whole thing feels a bit like it might fall apart. This feels like a $5 toy to me, it was definitely not worth over $30.

Laser light doesn't work as a pointer, just illuminates the blue end cap and that is dim. The sonic sound is just a beep each time you push the button. After three weeks the push button has failed. You must wiggle it side to side to make it work. Batteries were checked and found to be fully charged at 1.5 vdc each. I've had christmas cards that sing louder. As a show piece that sits on the shelf... it doesn't measure up either. The plastic case has stamped impressions that would need to be (painted) detailed to allow it to be properly displayed. The secret writing ink did work and the blue light did allow the ink to be visible. A fun fact for the kids, but that didn't last long.

I was so thrilled to be able to order him his own Sonic Screwdriver and he was absolutely tickled when he received it.So, for a kid who loves WHO, the toy is great. I only noticed one sound, not two, but it was authentic and not loud enough to be annoying to parents. Also, mine didn't have the \\"Psychic Paper\\" pad for some reason. Still, the UV ink nib worked well, which was a big plus to my son. It seems sturdy enough, save for the pen tips, which I suspect won't stay on for long.

Alas, the piece of plastic wore out faster on the newer one than it had on the older one (I mostly used them in the unextended position, and I always raise and lower them with the bump on the side, as the instructions state).Overall, I love the Sonic.

As it is, its only contributions are from the design standpoint, such as not breaking the model of the web, and not making the navigation so contrast-y as to visually distract from the content.

The author presents concepts for implementing usable web design through a book that seems to ignor hundreds of years of proven usability principles for the printed word. Interesting design, or even attractive design, is not always usable design.The book looks like an undergraduate graphic design project - and not a successful one at that. While the author may have many good things to say, communication of those points gets lost in the design. His credibility for what he has to say also gets lost, because of the way he presents his information. I purchased this book for about $6 (used), that's a fair price for an example of what not to do.

Times have drastically since this films release. It is far less unusual today to see a stay-at-home father than it was in the 1980s. While many maybe out of touch with some of the macho ideals of the day, Keaton and Garr do a wonderful job at making much of this film suitable for any era. Keaton (Batman, Johnny Dangerously, etc.,) and Garr (Young Frankenstein, Tootsie, etc.,) are the typical middle-class, American couple with three small children living the dream. But when Daddy loses his job Mommy decides to go back to work and leave Daddy with the babies. Kudos to Terri Garr's character who is a totally confident, trusting but not stupid modern woman.

Michael Keaton was just entering the thick of his early comedic career here, and plays the lead with enthusiasm despite an exceptionally thin script. Through physical humor and an overdose of energy he's able to wring as much life as possible from several one-note scenes, but can't completely revive such a narrow concept. John Hughes gets the writing credit, but this effort is missing both the sharp wit of National Lampoon's Vacation and the warm, beating heart of his brat pack classics.

When I tried using it for that, it just kind of choked, while free ffmpegx worked fine converting the film on my same computer. So, like I said, sometimes it helps, other times not. But if you use iMovie on the powerbook, then yes this little baby will do wonders for you. But I highly recommend ffmpegx as well, it's a joy and free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elgato Turbo.264 & YouTube - NOT!","review":"I just received this from Amazon just because I read that it makes encoding video for YouTube easy. That it does, but if you are concerned about quality, do not get this device. The quality is terrible and there are no settings to change. I also have VisualHub and did some research and found recommended settings and encoded the same video with VisualHub and it's 100 times better. A little slower yes. Takes a little more thought, yes.

I tried a few times after that, with different sources (all unencrypted DVD's, still getting the same result).Technical Support at Elgato was not much help as they told me it probably had to do with a bug in the firmware. They sent me a link to a new beta firmware update, but it was the same result.I am very disappointed in this.

This is just a fun, fast, exciting picture, with a terrific perfor- mance by Bridget Fonda and an even better script than the original.Also, the use of Nina Simone's music puts this picture miles ahead of the first one--it makes the music an equivalent of Fonda's soul--the suffering and passion we hear in Nina Simone's music is what's going on in Bridget Fonda's heart.

If you've seen the original and then viewed this version, \\"Point of No Return\\" becomes an appalling experience that highlights the very worst creativity-by-committee aspects of Hollywood.Buy the original \\"La Femme Nikita\\", deal with the subtitles, and whatever you do, stay away from the dreary and over-dramatized TV series of the same name. \\"La Femme Nikita\\" is excellent, even if you don't like French movies (and to be honest the dubbed version on the most recent editions of that DVD is reasonably watchable), you'll like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood directors treating its audience with contempt","review":"Having watched this film and its original French counterpart, <Nikita la Femme>, I have come to the conclusion that the directors of this (...) treated its audience with contempt.

Even worse, it attempts to transpose the French context - the inimitable style and elegance, the fear of a powerful state, etc. - into an American one and it just fails pathetically. Fonda isn't bad, but the original actress was far better, as was the Victor (the \\"cleaner\\") in Jean Reno.Take Femme Nikita over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare to the original","review":"If you're thinking of seeing this movie, bag it and watch La Femme Nikita instead. Nikita is a smart, sexy movie that doesn't degenerate into a plain vanilla action film, as does Point of No Return. The \\"dumbing down\\" of the original film for an American audience is insulting.In addition, the acting in the original is far superior to that in PoNR. Bridget Fonda isn't believable as a tough street girl, and while I enjoy watching Gabriel Byrne in most films, his portrayal of Bob pales in comparison to Tcheky Karyo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste your time with a lousy remake?","review":"I went to see this movie without realizing it was a remake of Nikita.

With the exception of a few 'twists', this is a shot for shot rip off of Nikita, which is about a million times better in just about every way. I found myself literally closing my eyes in parts cos I just couldn't bear to see these actors make fools aout of themselves. If Luc Besson was dead, he'd surely be rolling in his grave. And LB, however much they paid you: it weren't worth it.And whose idea was it to have a nerdy harvey Kietel playing Victor the cleaner? Trying to capture the wooden efficiency of his vastly superior predecessor, jean Reno, kietel fails miserably & just ends up looking wooden.

Director John Badham manages to keep the action tense and suspenseful, but the writers expect a lot from viewers. How can one truly identify and/or empathize with Fonda's character? She's really a cold-blooded killer, with little grace or worth. Even after her Pygmalion like transformation, she is still the same ruthless woman, only we are now supposed to sympathize with her and wish her well? This reviewer can't do that. Gabriel Byrne struggles gamely with his likewise unlikeable character; Dermot Mulroney only manages to look goofy in his puppydog idolization of Fonda; and poor Anne Bancroft tries to be the cold, but caring, mentor. It's to Fonda's credit that she manages to at least get us in her corner, guiltily or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Femme Nikita for Dummies","review":"This movie was made for people who are too lazy to read subtititles.

Sure, Bridget Fonda might be cuter than Anne Parillaud, but that's the only plus I can think of. All of the subtlety is gone, some things don't make sense (why did they go for the drugstore ?) and lots of technical details are messed up (the revolver that was replaced by a semi-automatic). Harvey Keitel as unscrupulous hitman doesn't come close to the unnervingly scary performance of Jean 'Victor' Reno. And it might be my imagination, but the movie seems to have lost a lot in pace.As a movie by itself, it isn't bad. Mind you, it isn't good either. It's OK to play it with a pizza, or to have it playing in the background while you're reading e-mail. Boef bourgignon it isn't, but it's passable if you're only looking for chewing gum.Unless you are allergic to French or subtitles, I really suggest that you spend your money on Nikita by Luc Besson.

Do yourself a favor, get the original. Part of what made the original so great was Nikita's transformation from a dirty druggie, to a sexy yet vunerable spy/agent. Bridget Fonda is soo unbelievable in this role it's appalling. 1) There is something about her personality and character that you really can't believe that she has suffered a day in her life. So she is no good as a drug addict 2) While I can see that people might find Fonda pretty, she lacks the hard core sexiness and strength that's needed to portray a secret agent. So she fails on both counts. The whole movie was so plain vanilla, it was sad. It's like expecting to go to a five star restaurant and get a five star dessert..and instead, you get the diet sponge cake that tastes like cardboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst remake i've ever seen","review":"Think of everything that was good about 'La Femme Nikita', remove them all and replace them with every poor Hollywood action cliche in the book.

However, 'Speaker for the Dead' is truly a worthy succesor to 'Ender's Game'. If you liked 'Ender's Game', you'll almost certainly like 'Speaker for the Dead'.'Speaker for the Dead' lacks the emotional connection that one has when reading 'Ender's Game'. But the words on the pages are well written and the story is very interesting. Card is truly a master of science-fiction, and the 'Ender's Game' saga is undoubtebly one of the best series' ever written, and rivals such great works as 'Dune'.If you like science-fiction, read 'Ender's Game' and then read 'Speaker for the Dead'. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing after reading Ender's Game","review":"If like me you really enjoyed Ender's game beware: this book is quite different. I did not enjoy reading it, the attitude of the characters is infuriating and the author makes it seems as if the whole human race is made of idiots, except of course for Ender. A couple of intriguing concepts are introduced, but overall I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"After reading Ender's Game, I was sure that the sequel could not live up to the standard that it set. However, Speaker for the Dead is every bit as good as Ender's Game, if a completely different story.Card does a great job of creating an entirely new species and describing its behavior and customs as well as defining an interesting human culture on the outpost world of Lusitania. The interaction between these two is fascinating and an interesting contrast with the story of first contact with an alien species told in Ender's Game.I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Great Audio Experience!","review":"I listen to audio books everyday while I drive to and from work. Some readers are better than others but the \\"team reading\\" done on Speaker for the Dead is phenomenal. This book is a complex and entirely engrossing story of Ender Wiggins (and the sequel to Ender's Game). Ender is not longer a boy, but a man who has travelled from world to world in search of a place to settle and allow the rebirth of the \\"buggers\\". He ends up on a strange plant inhabited by the only other alien species known - the piggies.This book is layer upon layer of social impacts based on culture, religion, family, love, science... very deep in places, very imaginative in its sci-fi appeal. An excellent reading/listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sequel is Ender's Game","review":"Speaker for the Dead, as well as every sequel to Ender's Game, is not worth reading. There is very little of the interesting, strange thought process that made Ender's Game excellent, and there is none of the military strategy. If you liked the military strategy, you won't find it in any of Orson Scott Card's sequels. You might as well just read a non-fiction book, such as Victory and Deceit, by Dunnigan and Nofi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it","review":"Too much religion and preaching in this book. hoping to read something in the lines of Ender's game.

The lead character Ender was a child general who lead an intersteller army in the distruction of another species which he didn't know because he believed he was just doing battle simulations at the training academy. Afterward he calls himself the speaker for the dead - the dead being that lost species. When a new intelligent species, the \\"piggies\\" are discovered he finds the opportunity to redeem his past. The books moves along alittle slow at times, action wise(Ender's Game the prequil is more fast paced an action packed), but this book is deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelluctual, but just as good as the original.","review":"This book really makes me want Card to write The Hive Queen, The Life of Human, and The Hegemon. It would make the book much better, even though it already is an amazing book. That's the only bad part about it. It's not long enough. If it was 10,000 pages it would be to short.

It's truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Sequel That Did Ender Justice","review":"When I had first finished reading the masterpiece that was Ender's Game, I was kind of horrified to learn there was a sequel. What could follow this? I thought. I did not read Speaker for several years, but I finally caved and read it. If you think that Game was amazing you have to read this. Card captured Ender again, and did it with the beauty and realism that I love about his work. Card, as always, draws on the emotions of the characters so deftly you could swear they were real. Read it, and let Ender touch you again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For your own humanity","review":"I expect good science fiction novels to offer complex worlds, unusual characters, and fascinating moral dilemmas. For me, not only did the book fulfill the above criteria, but it also changed my own ethical stances on a number of issues--and it was a painful change. The characters (alien and human) face the classic problems of cross-cultural interaction and misunderstanding. In this book you will find compassion blended with selfishness, humility juxtaposed with moral righteousness, instincitve horror transformed into sympathetic understanding. Ender Wiggin, the genius strategist/xenocide/diplomat, comes to this realistic mess of a situation and demonstrates the wisdom of a man who has made the deepest mistakes and participated in the most horrible of crimes. I loved Ender's Game and thought it was brilliant. But the Speaker for the Dead is not simply brilliant and engrossing, it is an argument for the deep, extraglobal consequences of failing to be honest with oneself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"This book really didn't do it for me. I know it has won tons of awards, and I know most reviewers seem to cherish it, but that was not my experience. Ender's Game was a coming of age space opera with a conscience. Card balanced all of the elements to create a masterpiece. I am not sure what this book is. Apparently, Ender has become Doctor Phil and inserted himself into a Latin American soap opera (yes I know they were Portugese). There were certainly some interesting episodes in the book, but overall I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but there's just ONE thing.","review":"I hate it when authors \\"discover\\" a new religion or culture or something and practicly BASE the ENTIRE book on that.

Orson Card does a great job of pivoting from one story to the next that I was unable to put down Speaker for the Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want a Similarity to Ender's Game? Thought-Provoking","review":"The Ender Series is entirely about humanity, and what happens in the face of fear. While Ender's Game touched on the mindset of alien creatures, and focused mostly on human beings, Speaker for the Dead digs deep into both. Ender is much older in the story, and has a very different standing with society. His siblings play an interesting part that is also very different from Ender's Game. The thing that will stick with you about any Ender story though isn't the action or the strange aliens: its the reality of human behavior, and the incredible \\"what if\\"s presented throughout each story. I haven't yet read Children of the Mind, but Ender's Game through Xenocide are all fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same quality as Ender's Game","review":"Just like the Ender's Game - one of the best Sci-Fi books ever. Just google it and you'll see how the series is rated around Sci-Fi top lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Continuation","review":"This book was a good continuation in the life of Ender after the Formic wars. It takes him out of the \\"Battle School\\" and moves him to place where you understand his underlying character better. Would recommend this to anyone who has read \\"Ender's Way\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing novel","review":"I loved this book. It is better than Ender's Game in my opinion. Ender's Game was awesome, but this novel is more mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker for the Dead","review":"Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card is a sequel to the book, Ender's Game. In Speaker for the Dead, a new alien race is discovered on a small colony on the planet Lusitania. But after the new species make vicious attacks on the colonists, the entire galaxy is thrown into turmoil.What I liked about this book was how the author described his characters. They were well written and had very distinguishing traits. The characters were also dynamic in that they changed very much in the story. I also liked the author's word"},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving exploration of truth and conformity","review":"After reading Ender's Game, I was intrigued enough to get the sequel. This book displays a more mature author's voice, and is not just a story of first contact. It explores the secrets we all keep and the devastating impact of the lies we tell in our families and social groups. When Ender starts speaking the truth about what is going on under the surface, he opens up a lot of pain for the families in the story, but also allows healing. And the book clearly and compellingly evokes the pain and cost to the truth-teller in doing so. I felt enormous empathy for all the characters, and the book caused me to examine where I am not telling the truth in my own life and in my own family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It wasn't as good as Ender's Game, but the story was still a very good read. I love to get to see character development like this. Seeing Ender speak for the dead was actually a really amazing read.

I am glad Ender finally found peace. But who will speak for him when it's his time? Now that will be an interesting time. And of course time will tell or should I say... Speak"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Sci-fi!","review":"Liked it even better than Ender's Game this 2nd time through. I won't even try to go into the plot since it's very complicated. My family listened to this one on a long road trip and we were all captivated and couldn't wait to get back into the car to finish our story. Ender is still in this book, but it is set 3000 years in the future. Everyone he knows, except his sister Valentine, is dead. Those two have been traveling through space for almost 25 years (he doesn't age as centuries pass). Anyway, he goes to a new world to Speak for the dead, and we meet a new species--the Piggies--that humans are trying to understand. This story had great morals hidden within the plot, and deep questions that keep you wondering long after the book is through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"Fast read but a great book. It is for a \\"teen\\" audience but I am in my 30's and liked the fictional fantasy storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great epic and story telling","review":"The tale of Ender's Game is sequeled greatly by this book Speaker of the Dead. I like the outside character development of Pipo, Libo, and Novinha where Card uses them well to tie Ender into his whole role in being speaker for the dead. There are times of lag but the over all it pushes through pretty well. I love the series of Ender Wiggins and speaker of the dead is one of Card's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel to Ender's game","review":"A great sequel. It is not as good as Ender's game, but then again what is? Unlike Ender's Game, this book centered around a large group of characters. Some parts may be a little hard to follow,but most parts are easy to understand. A must read for sci-fi fans. Read Ender's Game first, although it is not absolutely neccesary. I hope you enjoy the book as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Better Than Game","review":"Seeing as I loved Ender's Game, I bought Speaker for the Dead its sequel. Let's just say I was confused to high heavens in the first few chapters. First off, all these new characters came and I must have reread chapters one and two about five times before moving onward. Another thing was the major changes between this book and Ender's Game.However I took my time and reread each chapter and finally got a firm grip on the story and continued reading. I found the beginning somewhat boring but in the middle and end were great. I found once Ender got to Lusitania the story picked up greatly. Good read and I recommend it, four starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fantasy","review":"Totally engrossing. Hard to keep track of the names and relationships (even with the genealogy presented in the front). Nonetheless, the reader quickly jumps into the world of the \\"piggies\\" and finds that extraterrestrials are not like humans. Should we fear them or nurture them? Kill them or help them? Not at all clear, based on early draconian events.The concept that a eulogy should tell the truth about a person's life is intriguing. However, you can just imagine many people for whom it would not work at all. The Speaker would be torn to shreds by the in-laws. At any rate, a good read and a very helpful companion (sequel) to \\"Ender's Game.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Ender's Game","review":"Although Speaker for the Dead is a decent story overall and does have some great sci-fi elements, like relativistic space travel, I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as Ender's Game. I thought of it like Return of the Jedi if the rebels spent the whole movie pondering the social behavior of the ewoks.Of course we're not talking about Star Wars or movies here. Speaker for the Dead was just a peculiar departure from Ender's Game, which is one of the best novels I've ever read. I almost felt like Card decided he didn't really feel like writing another sci-fi novel, so he went with a biologist drama instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really lame.","review":"This story was most definately well written... But if you really enjoyed Ender's Game, you're far better off reading the \\"Ender's Shadow\\" spinoffs. Those were *awesome*. This book was enough to turn me off from all of the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Ender's Game","review":"Ender's Game is one of my favorite books, but Orson S. Card totally missed the target when he wrote this book and went way off course. Instead of trying to continue with the Characters, Orson tried to write and invent a new science and new vocabular. Interesting work, but where are the characters from Ender's Game!! Don't waste you time, just re-read Ender's Game again and let the story end there!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metaphysical Tract - Not Science Fiction","review":"This was quite a let down from Ender's Game.It is much more of a discourse on the author's bizarre metaphysical views than anything else. Xenocide (the sequel to this) is even worse in that regard.If you enjoyed Ender's Game, don't let this or the other sequels detract from that experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ender's Game flew by...SFTD just plods...","review":"\\"Speaker For The Dead\\" suffers from the same sophomore-outing problems M. Night Shyamalan's \\"Unbreakable\\" movie did--too much exposition of not enough plot. Whereas \\"Unbreakable\\" would have made a great 30-minute Twilight Zone episode, stretching it to fill an hour and a half was a bad idea. Same with SFTD. The big mystery isn't all that mysterious, and there aren't that many possible resolutions, yet it drags on for hundreds of pages longer than it should have.If you want more of the Ender Saga, skip the SFTD/Xenocide/Children of the Mind branch for now, and go with the much more Ender's-Game-like \\"Shadow\\" branch. THEN come back and pick up the other, and you'll be more satisfied with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ BEFORE BUYING","review":"I started this book with high hopes of it being equal or better than Enders Game...boy was I mistaken. I started the book and at first i just gave it some time to see if it would get any better...NOPE. This book has little to no action and Ender doesnt even come in until like 75 pages in. Do not buy this book. I advise you to just stop at Enders Game if you dont want disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tree People","review":"Ender saves the universe yet again.

This book was a major disappointment. The plot never seemed to get off the ground and I just couldn't get into the characters. This is a relatively flat story and nothing to get excited about. I will not be reading anything further in the Ender saga. There is too much good reading out there to spend any more time on this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This book is truly wonderful.

I barely finish this marathon of tedium"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wincing in pain","review":"If you can wade through all of the painfully cheesy heartstring pulling and redundancy/bad writing then you'll find a couple really cool ideas, the coolest of which is Jane, a sentient computer program which teams up to help Ender tackle his problems. The overall plot of the story adds to the scope of Card's universe, however I found myself literally wincing in pain throughout the book, eventually just skimming the last 100 pages just to find out the plot resolution so that I could put the book back on the shelf where it belongs. All said, you'd do better to get the Cliffs notes rather than damage your opinion of Ender/Card."},{"rating":"2","title":"moved to tears","review":"a very different book, a very different cast, a very different Ender. where Ender's Game may have strained you emotionally, Speaker will leave you wounded. a powerful, compelling, masterfully-written follow-up on Ender's life. some complain about too many characters, but they're each very powerfully portrayed and feel like real people. and the story itself is music more massive and imaginative that its prequel.i do however have one suggestion: read the 'introduction' _after_ you finish the book.buy it and you'll be glad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good followup to Ender's Game","review":"Although this book was not as good as Ender's Game, it is still a great read. For a long while I could not put this book down because of the suspense and mystery. The book starts out with the planet Lusitania, a colonist planet settled Portegeuse Catholics, where the only other intelligent race, the Pequininos or piggies for short, live. At first the piggies are regarded as an animal and not a real race. The people study them and are fascinated with their culture. But they cannot ask the piggies a direct question. Meanwhile Ender lives on the ice planet known as Trondheim.

You can't even put it in with Ender's Game because you can probably get away with reading either book as seperate stories. That's the brilliance of these two books: Just as in real life a man's lifestory cannot be told in one volume. He changes in the interveining years. I loved the theme and premise for this book so much that I ran right out and read Xenocide and Children of the mind. I regretted that decision. Both were long, boring and intolerable. By the end of Children I cared little except having time to read another more worthwhile book.Even though Speaker for the Dead continues I would recomend you stop with that one and read Orson Scott Card's other works instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best.","review":"Very different from its predecessor, this novel has very little warfare or space action. However, it is just as absorbing and suspenseful and probably the better of the two. A story about redemption, forgiveness and the power of love, this was a moving and well-written novel. This (with Ender's Game right behind) is one of the best sci-fi books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sci-fi book","review":"My favorite sci-fi book, make sure you read Ender's Game before you read this one. The third book is good, the forth one is not so good.This book is by far the best book I have ever read when it comes to this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing, but still great.","review":"After reading 3 novels in the Ender Saga, I jumped onto this one. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed in it. The storyline is pretty weak, the beginning is boring, and it just isn't as riveting and compelling as the other novels.But this is of course in comparison to other novels in teh Ender Saga. When comparing to other unrelated Science Fiction novels, it shines. Card just has that great talent of writing.Don't be intimidated by my review to purchase this book. I really did enjoy it, it was a great read, just not as great as perhaps Ender's Shadow or Shadow of the Hegemon. If you read Ender's Game and absolutely loved it, I recommend getting those two books before getting this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card does it again","review":"In this sequel to \\"Ender's Game,\\" Card does what few thought possible. He has made a sequel that rivals even the original in splendor. After reading \\"Ender's Game,\\" I decided that no book could even hold a candle to the obvious genius of it. It is in this book that I am proved wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good writing helps this story","review":"I'll admit that I preferred the story line of the first book compared with this one. \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" seemed to take on a few \\"Fantasy\\" qualities that weren't present in \\"Ender's Game\\". I still found the book entertaining, and this is mostly due to how Card tells a story. He has kept the story entertaining enough that I very much look forward to the remaining books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storytelling at its finest","review":"Card's characters are perfectly distinctive. You'll swear you could pick them out in a crowd. He blends them all together with such a feel for their personalities that you can't help but believe they're real. Hard science fiction is not his strongest suit, but he tells stories like nobody's business! I'd love to see him team up with a more hard-core SF writer in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card is a great story teller!!!!!","review":"Card's ability to show us who his characters are in a few pages of text is astonishing. We intimately know his principles as soon as they are introduced so we care about what happens to them. I personally wished many times while reading this book that there was such a person as the speaker for the dead. Someone who would tell the truth no matter how it hurt in order to create greater understanding. However, in Card's world Ender knows that his speaches will heal and they do, in the real world the reaction to the truth would be unknown and most likely would have hurt those who hide what needs to be hidden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens!","review":"ENDER'S GAME was gripping and it recaptured the feelings of childhood for me. But SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD was disappointing: the plot is slow, the characters are boring, the premise is unbelievable, and the philosophy is pretentious.The most exciting moment in this book occurs when a small child urinates on the protagonist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"Ender's Game was a much better novel in my opinion. Speaker For The Dead reminded me much of a drunk man trying to walk a straight line stumbling ever so often and taking breaks to explain why. I found myself glancing over entire sections of a few chapters simply because they lended no contribution to the storyline or were repeated for an empty dramatic effect. All in all, it was a rather plain and boring novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!!!!","review":"Ender's Game is me and my best freinds favorite book ever. This book, however, was unbearably atrocious. There were maybe three sentences with the faintest hint of some remote, indirect quality. The only thing good about this book is that without it, the best book ever would not exist in the form of a novel/Novella, simply a series of stories in Analog SF magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, terrible Portuguese !","review":"Although the central idea of the book is quite nice, Mr. Card puts a lot of effort on making their characters speak a foreign language - Portuguese - on a most annoying, careless and absurd way. Not being in any way important to the story, the frequent Portuguese phrases, full of spelling errors and lack of sense, are at most a poor attempt from a non-Portuguese speaker to show off to his classmates. It is a nice book ruined by the lack of editing that a junior high student in Brazil could do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God!!! Not Another Horrible Scan Version!!","review":"I had recently complained to Amazon that Ender's Game had been scanned and then poorly edited prior to releasing it here for sale. Now I get into Speaker for the Dead, and if anything, this copy is even worse than the first book. I am finding that the same issues that plagued the first book are there, and now letters are even missing from words. The last few chapters really show where the publisher just gave up even trying to find anything...not that they seem to have caught the issues with words containing \\"ru\\" in them.I am getting to think that some of these digital presses are just sending straight OCR copies over to Amazon as quick as they get a file completed.Amazon...get some quality control going before you allow a book to be put up for sale!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LISTEN TO ME GOOD-AGAIN!","review":"A DAMN GOOD CONTINUE FOR ENDR!!!!AGAIN, O.S.CARD MAKE ME IN LOVE WITH THE FIGURES IN THIS BOOK-AND NOW ENDR IS MY TRUE AND ONLY GOD.HOW CAN I PLAY THE MOVIE???????????IM 14 AND I'M GETTING THIS BOOK BETTER THEN EVERYONE ALSE!!!!I SAW IN THIS SITE THAT U R LOOKING FOR A BILION KIDS FOR THE MOVIE.

It lacks the humor found in parts of Ender's Game and the tension. The only common element is Ender, who seems to have grown older, more serious, and more depressed. I actually went back and re-read Ender's Game. Could this be the same author? Unfortunately yes. The style is so similiar it has to be written by the same person. But, when Mr. Card wrote this one, he seems to have forgetten the human element, the compasion, the soul, of the first book.

This book has affected me more deeply than anything I have ever read. It is deep enough to almost seem like philisophical literature, but it is not for people who get bored easily, because it is long and has virtually no action. For fans of Enders Game, my favorite ever, this will have to be a definite read and all the other books in the series. Also, if you ever wondered how a new species would evolve, this book is for you.

Instead we have a different culture, different characters, religion has been injected and of all things Portugese slang. Then to top that mess off, we have words that apparently Card has made up and require an online search to gather the meaning of.

So much time spent on this alien race, trying to figure out their mating habits, then some stuff about some portugese catholics and how their religious beliefs are very much against the idea of a Speaker for the Dead....which by the way was a fact that was repeated MANY times... On top of the absolutely boring as hell plot, at no point did I find a reason to care much for the any of the characters involved.I'm continuing on and reading more of the Ender series, since 3 out of 4 that I've read were 4 & 5 star books.

The aliens are really no more alien than some of the nativetribes of Oceania where to the Europeans when they first came intocontact. The idea of the speaker is somewhat interesting, but thestory of first (and second) contact is overall a bit unsatisfying.

I liked the Orson Card I read in 'Ender' but if his writing style is more like what I read in 'Speaker' I'll just stay away from the rest of his books. I hoped against hope that 'Xenocide' would redeemwhat I felt, but sorry to say, it didn't. Now IF you like these books, I am truly happy for you, however they just didn't do it for me (I don't know why, but I was just bored with them). I have high hopes for 'Ender's Shadow' but after 'Speaker' & 'Xenocide' I'll await for the paperback before I buy it. Again my apologies to fans of these books. I'm not a bad guy, I just didn't enjoy the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor to the Ender franchise","review":"Another great concept, well executed by this master of scifi. I suppose it could be read as a stand-alone, but knowledge of the events that took place in the seminal \\"Ender's Game\\" will greatly enhance one's appreciation of all the layers of meaning in this novel. The character Ender is once again the protagonist, and he definitely brings with him all the baggage he accumulated in his previous role(s). It is hard to write a review of this book without giving too much away, since it is written as a mystery and the reader only finds things out as Ender manages to find them out. The twists and turns of the plot kept me guessing and the characters kept me reading. A worthy successor to the Ender franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy continuation of Ender's story","review":"This book was a great continuation of the story of Ender. What was even more surprising was that it was a completely different type of story. One that also uses the characters to give us both sides of an ethical coin that Card flips back and forth with precision. I can see why this book was as critically successful as \\"Ender's Game\\", since he didn't do anything like a traditional sequel. I suppose that's what is so remarkable about it. The only drawback I can see is that he begins the book with a bunch of notes on pronounciation, which nearly caused me to put the story down. Just ignore them (unless your a linguist) and get to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"edgar cayce on healing foods for the body, mind,and spirit","review":"I found this book very inlightning it has improved my system over 50%, it is accurate and safe with all the information it gives the reader, I would recommend it to any one who is serious about healing their body, mind and spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"great healing book","review":"This book is awesome.

This book suggests that you should \\"be mindful more not of the body for the body's sake, but of the body that the temple of the living God may be the better channel for manifesting the spritual truths.\\" Many foods are mentioned regarding their inclusion or exclusion in your diet, but you're expected to take it all on faith since the book does not reference any studies, scientific or otherwise. The book also recommends to avoid microwave ovens for cooking but mentions no reason! Conventional ovens are OK. It also suggests you never eat raw apples. Basically, it's a bunch of advice on how to eat and live without any scientific backing.

It is odd that a book you read in your early teens haunts you into your young adulthood. After thinking about my initial reaction to the gore and unnecessary violence I guess I would sum this book with the fact that characters are incredibly well fleshed out.

Here's the bad: Is not fully automatic but still fires fast manually (there is an automatic version made). Sometimes the pin on the side slides forward & you have to pull it back to fire again, runs out of juice once tank is 80% empty. Not sure if this is normal.

Unfortunately they fell just a little bit short. There is room for ten additional quarters, but twelve spaces were actually needed (two each for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands).The item title says the folder can now hold quarters from the territories.

The book in itself is sturdy but the slots to insert the coins is rather flimsy and you can see the imprint pushing through the cover when the book is closed.

Horses, girlfriends. He plays a Presidential candidate in this one. Although I can't say his performance has changed through the years; it was his over acting that makes this so entertaining. The ending where he battles the Jeff Speakman \\"good guy\\" character makes this worth it. Seeing Shatner jump out of a helicopter was like somthing out of his Captain Kirk era.

Fortunately, he hires a martial arts expert, former Navy SEAL, and survivor from the explosion of the planet Krypton, whose wife used to drive in demolition derbies, as an aide. When the FBI gets the aide to check on some incriminating info on his boss, he is caught, and the militias make the mistake of going after Superman and his family. The movie goes downhill from there, ending in the hero committing first degree murder. The other members of the conspiracy survive, but apparently are too intimidated by this man to take further action. The bad guy's influence in the Justice Department and the federal judiciary is similarly intimidated. The ghost of Ed Wood may have been involved, but is not mentioned in the credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great story... but who's?","review":"Such a socially important event treated so opportunistically by the author. Full of hearsay and unsupported speculation. But then when there are no witnesses you can claim just about anything. And Wansell does.When I read sentences like, \\"....and they may have....\\" or \\"...then it is likely that he....\\" I suspect that it could be just a bit of imagination. And that is exactly what this garbage is.West committed suicide (??) before giving evidence in a court of law. Everything that he said before his death is questioned along with the evidence of his wife. And somehow Wansell is privy to all the facts.No doubt he will make a fortune with this rubbish.

The preamble is enough to break your heart in witnessing the niave approach of the people of a small Italian town to the coming of WWII and its massive evil.

Having a nice fire going while reading a book, relaxing with a loved one, taking a nap on a rainy day, or any other time you want to hear the crackles and pops of a fire.

The fires all felt as though they were sped up, and instead of being able to luxuriate in the slow soothing flames and sounds of a fire, I felt hurried /rushed...as though each version had to complete and burn fully within the 1/2 hour. I couldn't find such a product...ie: the 4 hour fire that burns down to coals in real time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast.....","review":"I do not know why no one has mentions that the fires are burning at a faster than normal rate - I did not find it at all relaxing, and am very disappointed in the DVD.

Any one else experience this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it! Must have HD TV to view","review":"When I recieved this CD I tried to play it in two TVs that were not HD and it didn't play at all. You must have an HD TV for it to play. There are 9 fires to choose from and 3 we really loved. They do all burn down like a regular fire at the end. I would have preferred that they stay burning full force the whole time. It was very realistic and my guests said they \\"felt\\" warm just being near it.

I am happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy effects ruin everything","review":"Instead of showing a video of a fireplace, the \\"director\\" of this video added every cheap effect in microsoft movie-maker to his video. So you get about 2 minutes of fireplace video and the rest of the video is a distorted, spinning, bouncing, mess of horrible transitions and blurry powerpoint-like effects. There is also background music for the videos instead of the ambient sound of a fire like the title implies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to HD video","review":"This says \\"Shot in HD\\" as if it was actually HD, its not. Its just \\"Shot in\\". Which means the video on the disc is of dissapointing quality if you own an HD capable TV. Not only that but the fireplace scene selection is bad, and there aren't enough long-play scenes to make this disk worthwhile IMO. I could do without things like a campfire scene, and an ugly candle scene. Its not a big deal to buy a candle and light it so I'm not sure what the benefit of seeing a candle on a TV for ten minutes is...Its a decent product, but, it could be better.

This album is a very good rendition of how the Manics view themselves and the world around them. The songs are all very well written. They are just as politically aspiring as some of their previous tracks, and James' guitar can still make the ears stand still with great melodies and solid riffs. The Manics are a matured band and this album shows that they have come a long way since their prime back in the nineties. Maybe it is not as good as some other Manics albums, but if you're a fan, or even a newbie this is a very solid collection of quite enjoyable tracks.Key Tracks: Let Robeson Sing, Baby Elian, Why So Sad, Freedom of Speech Won't Feed My Children"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manics still have it","review":"After a couple of milder albums, the Manic Street Preachers are back at it and better than ever. Though they will never again recapture the strange, pre-Richey-Edwards-disappearace glory of The Holy Bible, with tracks like Intravenous Agnostic and My Guernica, who wants them to? This album won't break into mainstream American radio--it has too much soul, integrity and politial contrversy to appeal to the common music fan. By their own admission, the Manics won't last much longer--and with Know Your Enemy, it's clear how much we will lose when they go."},{"rating":"1","title":"a ripoff","review":"This item appears to have been produced on a home PC.

The album opens up with an infusion of \\"not of this world\\" sounds...and an infectious groove...but don't be fooled. Unfortunately for the listener...as the singer chimes in...\\"the Music\\" becomes as annoying and agonizing as listening to your grandma belch and wease during an 18-hour car ride to Florida. Rolling Stones (for whatever reason) praised this album...apparently their reviewer also enjoys long drives to FL to drop off Granny.As the album continues...the vocal stylings started to remind me of the glory days of the mid-80's...and bands like Slaughter and the Bulletboys. Next the listener experiences a sense of deja-vu when you start to realize that each drum track sounds exactly the same. This similarity turns to boredom. Trust me...wait until you see this sucker in a cut-out bin at a local used record store...that's where mine is headed. The Music should take their own advice...and take the long road...and walk it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great band","review":"A really great band with great music.

Harvey can basically reach frequencies only women can, and that's a compliment..The members of this band are actually pretty young, the average being 18 or 19 years old. their debut CD is solid, it has its own unique sound, it's unlike anything ive ever heard.This cd lacks some maturity with some mild inconsistencies though.The dance (#1), Take The Long Road And Walk It (#2), The Truth Is No Words (#4), Getaway (#8) and Too High (10) are AWESOME songs, the other songs are somehow weaker but still listenable.This is a very solid debut, and is sure worth picking up.

This band is a combination of all great things rock n' roll has had to offer over the past 30 years. Sort of an update on classic rock with a fair amount of 80's alternative and modern electronics thrown in to the stew. People have compared their sound to alot of different bands and you do hear elements and traces of everything from Zeppelin to the Stone Roses to what Kula Shaker should have sounded like. A truly majestic sound which hopefully will go noticed and help nudge rock and roll back into a creative and exciting genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"This album is not as great as the other reviewers have made it out to be.

You should watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's the schiznit!","review":"Very, very funny movie. Contrary to what has been written, you dont need to be stoned to watch it - just dont take it seriously.Basic plot is four guys get stoned and Kenny has to go get food. On the way out of the grocery store he sees a horse and feeds it all his food. The horse turns out to be a diabetic police horse. The food he feeds him kills the horse and Kenny (mr nice guy) goes to jail for killing a cop!!! The three other guys have to raise money to get him out of jail and ending up dealing weed to get him out. how original is that?!!the cameos are brilliant in this. Look out for (normally straight-edge) Bob Sagat off Full House playing a coke-addict at a Drug-rehab meeting. His line is classic and understandably he didnt want to be noted in the credits for his appearance. GOLD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...peanut butter , man...","review":"wow, funny as hell, but make sure you interact with the movie, and watch it with some buddies.. have lots of water, munchies,soda and the number to the pizza place.

The movie creates a mood of already feeling high with the help of a wierd plot, funny actors, and obsessive drug use. This movie can relate to the pot-smoking audience who have or will have the same feelings and charateristics of the characters in the movie. I, for one, can relate towards the humorious situations taking place in this movie.

When I watched it, I couldn't believe all the stupidty it produced. In every movie, I can find good for almost every scene, a way of understanding it and realizing what the director was trying to show his audience, but in this film, it was difficult to do that. I was very displeased in this, for it not only wasted my time, it made me think twice about renting another movie like this again. I would recommend American pie if your looking for a comedy. But for a film that does nothing but show drug usage, and shows no point in doing so, I'd recommend a more worth your while film, like Traffic or Scarface (Al Pacino)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Half-Baked but funny anyway","review":"This movie is, as movies go, terrible - I'll prepare you for that straight up. However, it'll crack you up every ten seconds, and that's just about guaranteed, as long as you watch it with the same attitude you need to sit through movies like Baseketball and Dogma - don't get all hung up on the immorality of drug use, sexual issues, deplorable language, etc. If you're easily offended by such topics (or these topics made light of, I should say), then you probably should not see this. If you think you can get over those hang-ups for an hour and a half, it's good for a laugh if not much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you so much!","review":"This movie was not only funny, but I got it as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.

It wants you to enjoy your high, while not going over bourd with higher drugs. It plays as a comedy to try to get people to laugh,and accept that marijuana is a commonly used item in America's droor today. It does make a good point as to some people shouldn't smoke weed! If you pay close attention, and watch it for what is secretly writen, then you will know how to properly use marijuana, and laugh. More than anything, enjoy yourselves, and don't take this movie too literally. You can't really get bonded out of jail for 10 percent of one million dollars, and everything will be ok. That's just to get out before a trial, then you will be sentenced after the trial, and there's no buying your way out of that. So don't feed the horse is what I am trying to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better stoner comedys.","review":"Half-baked always seemed to me to be a movie about weed, by people who know nothing about weed. I know it is a movie and it is fictional but hallucinating that you are flying from smoking marijuana, expecially from swaggy government weed is so far from reality it is not even funny. I hate it when movies and TV shows depict the effects of marijuana as if it is a PCP trip or something. It is just a pet peeve of mine because it sets the law reform movement way back because idiots who believe what they see on TV, think marijuana makes people see elves and unicorns.I have to admit the films does have some clever stoner puns and is very quoteable, \\"wesley pipes\\", \\"billy bong thorton\\" and Bob Saget's cameo line. Yet it does not make up for the rest of the movie being so cartoonishly fake. That is just my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I paid for this DVD almost 25bucks and I could not watch it on my DVD or my PS3!!!!! I got hustle!!

Dave Chapelle is halarious. I highly recommend this \\"fully baked\\" DVD to all comedy fans, not just stoners! The new edition features deleted scenes and an alternate ending.

How could you miss with a list of added features such as..Five Minutes with the \\"The Guy on the Couch\\"Different Types of SmokersGranny's Guide to Bakin'Well they missed big time. The guy on the couch.. some imitation rolling around for five minutes with a pillow covering his face as he rolled of the couch. Lame! Types of smokers.. animated and not even amusing. Granny's baking someone throwing a bunch of things in a pot like a cooking show. The whole thing was poorly produced. The only additional footage was things that they edited out of the film. ie originally they had Kenny calling Thurgood to do the whole scene in the movie where they visited him and tell him how they are going to get him out.This is a pitiful attempt to turn a buck off of Half Baked's fan base.

I am wondering why amazon.com is selling this copy of the movie while Amazon.de is selling a pristine Blu-Ray copy of the movie in English (or in German with English subtitles) which plays on American Blu-Ray players.

Every day.I kinda forgot where the book was going.The fact that this book has attracted only three reviews so far may be an indication of how many readers actually finished it.Good reviews from the trade notwithstanding, no matter how well-designed a car is, if it doesn't go anywhere it's just a big paperweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hammer Forever","review":"This collection is a must for any fan of classic horror films.

The Curse of Frankenstein 10/10: My favorite one in the whole series. It started the Frankestein series and was Hammer's first film2. Dracula has Risen from the Grave 7/10: Not one of the best Dracula films in the Hammer series, but not the worst3. Frankenstein Must be Destroyed 6/10: The plot in this movie is very thin and is kind of boring.4. Horror of Dracula 8/10: Very good film based on Bram Stoker's classic novel.5. The Mummy 8/10: I actually like this version of \\"The Mummy\\" better than the original black and white classic.6. Taste the Blood of Dracula 10/10: Probably my favorite Dracula movie in the series.

All Mega Man games have infinite continues except for the very first one, the Legends series, and the GBA titles. And it was always possible to destroy most bosses with your default weapon, it was just tougher that way (and it's still like that). I also have yet to determine how X5, which came out right between X4 and X6, qualifies as \\"a long-overdue return\\" to anything other than the frustrating level design that plagued some early Mega Man games.

This recharger does not work with the pink Leapster( or any of the smaller versions). I purchased this for my daughter's birthday to go with the pink Leapster I purchased. It was linked on the Pink Leapster page to add this recharger to the order. I did and when I got it, I found that it isn't compatible.

It didn't take long to install.. a couple minutes at the most. And yes, I used the silver backplate instead of the original one. At first it worked fine, but then I began noticing that whenever me or my son would put it on the charging dock, the light would go off after a few seconds. To keep the light on, we have to keep jiggling the leapster around which is really annoying. Because of this problem, my son rarely plays with it anymore and I can't blame him.. Who wants to deal with a toy that lasts a few minutes before dying because it can't charge properly? The company really has to fix this problem because it's really dicouraging to buy a recharging system that doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE","review":"Unless you own stock in energizer you MUST buy this accessory.

It would seem very unlikely that these \\"professinals\\" would be so easily taken.All of the characters are acted well. I've never had much use for the Baldwin brothers, but Daniel does a good job here. The biggest kudos have to go to James Woods who as always gives a performance that is so believeable that you can't think of the role with any other actor.John Carpenter's Vampires is a gritty no nonsense movie that is worth your money and a great variation to a genre that could use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"I usually like John Carpenter movies, but give me a break. The hunters were nothing more than a bunch of mysogonistic morons. Why drag vampires into the sunlight when you could just burn them out? Why are our heroes tying the chick to the bed naked? Carpenter tries so hard to make James Woods look cool it's almost funny ... but not quite.The one saving grace of this movie was the bad guy. But I would have been much happier if he had won."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Horrible!","review":"I just have to say that this movie was one of the worst I have seen in a long time. Admittedly, the trailer made it look good, especially the scenes with the head vampire. But five minutes into the film itself I had a feeling it was going to be bad, and I wasn't wrong. Like someone else wrote in their review, the characters are foul-mouthed and mean-spirited. And I don't think I have seen a more misogynistic movie in years. Poor Sheryl Lee. I, too, was confused over the neccessity for the \\"Let's tie her to the bed naked\\" scene. But my boyfriend said, \\"Guys like that stuff\\". Whatever. Overall between the mistreatment of women and priests, I found the film very offensive. The soundtrack sounded like a \\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\" rip-off. Thank goodnes it was \\"dollar day\\" at the video store."},{"rating":"2","title":"This flick is a kick!","review":"I have been a fan of vampire films since childhood; in fact, I even made a few on 8mm with friends--- using ketchup as blood--- the whole nine yards. That's why this film can't really be taken seriously as \\"a vampire film,\\" but CAN be taken seriously as a vampire film \\"take-off.\\" It was just hysterical. So many \\"in\\" jokes and references and hommages to previous vampire film endeavors. Sure there's plenty of gore but, yet, even THIS is in sync with what Carpenter, I think, is trying to say. I didn't expect much; afterall, the critics bit into this film, if you'll pardon the pun, with a vengeance. Well, frankly, I think critics suck. (Another pun?) VAMPIRES has everything..... but it simply must be viewed with fondness, humor and a willing (very) suspension of disbelief. James Woods is wonderful--- the film would be worth watching just for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Horror Film","review":"It was a great film.

Plus it's a great movie too."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much plot, so little movie","review":"The premise of this movie is predictable for anyone who ever saw the original Dracula; however, John Carpenter must have been too heavily medicated to develop it beyond a camp and often vulgar attempt at teen romp by old (age wise) actors. Had the cast from Scream or even Dawson's Creek been used it could have possibly turned into something more than just watchable. This is good celluloid fodder for matinee or the \\"budget\\" movie crowd - but eat first don't spend the extra money on movie food. Probably its best asset will be that it will be the only new movie not rented at the video store on the weekend so you won't have to go home empty handed. It is the perfect nap movie. Catch the beginning, catch the \\"zzzzzzzzz's\\", and catch the credits - an afternoon well spent on a bad-weather day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of this movie!","review":"I usually love John Carpenter's work but I hated this movie. Vampires have only been around four hundred years? And why are they living in crack houses in the desert?This is one of those films that I feel is a part of the contemporary polarization. Vampires are either romantic teenagers or nearly mindless killing machines. It's one extreme or the other. No one remembers balance anymore. I miss characters like Dracula who could be charming and occasionally sympathetic but still able to be predatory and vicious. Now that is an interesting vampire. I miss vampires like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like The Book...","review":"This movie is nothing like the book... Its effects are okay but seriously lacking.

We all came out pretty disappointed with this one. nothing new, the vampires in the desert was already done and over done by the dusk till dawn series. It tries to be somewhat serious, but isn't. It's not cheesy enough to entertain either. You'll see very uninteresting vampires, and very unimpressive vampire hunters. This movie did inspire a sequel, Los Muertos, starring Jon Bon Jovi as a the vampire hunter. That movie was so awful it didn't even make it into theatres and Jon bon jovi is wishing to erase it from memory. That's Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you watching","review":"First saw a piece of this movie when I was at a friend's, never was able to finish it until I got it off of Amazon.com.First, the effects are great, at least for its time period. Blood, gore, toplessness. . . yes, it's all there. However, in a movie with vampires, the plot is pretty predicatable. Big hero chases master vampire, friend becomes enemy, hero wins.The reason it gets four stars, however, is because of its effects, the actors, the script, (Yes, the script was probably one of the better parts to the movie.), and its unique display of exactly how the vampire came to be.Over all, it's a decent movie. Worth watching once or twice, but in the long run, not worth owning for $15 or more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie ever made","review":"Any film with the remotest pretention of success should at least attempt to allow the viewer to begin to suspend disbelief.

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The dialog was terrible the action sequences were very confusing. It was nonsense action that I would expect from a 5 year old who is playing with their GI Joe dolls. Who ever wrote the dialog for this script should have a stake through his eyes, and be forced to hear the screams of dispair of those who had to sit through this movie! Mind you going into this movie I wasn't expecting a 4 star performance, but I didn't think it would be this bad. If you want fun mindless brain candy check out BLADE. It is much more entertaining.

It was by John Steakley. If you like vampire literature, GET IT! The movie? It was bad. And what's such a shame is that, had they stuck with the book, James Woods would have been perfect. There's one or two moments, and for that, I give it a star, where he very briefly shines through with the original intent.

Starts like any other film. Abandeon-looking house. Vampires inside. Shooting spree. Drag them outside and burn them. Gregory Sierra (Barney Miller tv series) plays a priest who offers a blessing before the hunt and after they burn the vampires. They think all the vampires in New Mexico are accounted for except for the Master (Thomas Ian Griffith). The Master finds them, kills everyone except for James Woods, Daniel Baldwin and a freshly-bitten Sheryl Lee who are now on the run. Maximillian Schell plays a Cardinal.

Don't even bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires Lacks All Bite, Rated B for Beyond Bad!","review":"I know why Daniel Baldwin did this film - he couldn't get any other work - but James Woods must have been hard-up for money or just plain bored to even consider this film, and I am not sure what Carpenter's excuse was, but this is one pile-of-garbage movie. Our protagonist isn't remotely likable and gratuitously refers to women as \\"whores\\" as well as being physically abusive to them - yes ladies and gentlemen, this is our hero. Not even some decent actors in the cast could save this movie. Leaves you rolling your eyes at el cheapo special effects and stupid dialogue. Made me laugh for the wrong reasons and root for the vampires to kill off the \\"hero\\" to put me out of my misery.

And those lines were just 3 words long. If yo uthink im lyeing find out for yourself. The action is kind of boreing.

It is horror with vampires, but it is more of the vampire hunter-type like Blade. Blade is the best of those movies. I don't like some of the special effects as much as in Blade, but it does have some pretty awesome scenes. Valek, the master vampire, is a very cool vampire. In the scene where he attacks James Wood's rag-tag band of vampire hunters he shows himself to be a very powerful monster. He cuts a guy in half using his hand like a sword, and easily kills the whole team of hunters except for two of them. He then pursues a truck down the road on foot at nearly 100 mph and leaps fifty feet into the bed. He is more of the old-style vampire, unlike Frost in Blade, who is a newer, hipper vampire. If you like vampires or just good action movies, you should see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A horror classic","review":"Definitely in my top 10 horror movies of all time.This movie is far from perfect, as a matter fact in order to enjoy this movie you will need to ignore several holes in the story.The grail being protected by defenseless, harmless monks being one of them.The story drags a little towards the end but overall, great movie. As opposed to MOST vampire movies, there is nothing romantic or poetic about these monsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, Sharp Fangs, Sharper Stakes","review":"A fun, if unsophisticated movie. Loosely based on the book Vampire$, which is a very good read. Tells the story of professional vampire hunters. Violent, bloody, and dark.

Oh, I wish I didn't have to, but they're burnt into my brain.You have scenes of vampires being dragged out by a truck wench. That in itself is reminiscent of the scenes of dino-hunting in The Lost World.But it gets worse. Vampiric oral acts. Daniel Baldwin burning himself in the case of any injury. The worst soundtrack I've ever heard in a non-porn film. Woods beating up a priest. A final scene with Woods(as Jack Crow--an obvious Christ-figure) mounted on a cross in which Baldwin has his throat ripped out and there's a sharpshooting priest and... Oh, dear Lord, no...If you are a member of a non-war generation, watch this with some friends.

I wish I turned it offhalf way through because I couldn't stand to watch any more, but I'm just too thrifty. I paid for it and damnit I watched it, painfully. The characters in this film are all mean, brutal, foul people. James Wood's character tortures a mild mannered priest for information, and he's supposed to be the hero! His idiot sidekick (a Baldwin brother) beats up a hooker, treats her like total crap through the whole movie, THEN says he's in love with her and they head for Mexico. The coolest person in the movie was the vampire! I hated all the characters and I wish the vapmires had killed them all.

Like so many book adaptations, They took the title, the main charactors, the basic story \\"hook\\" and threw away the rest (99% of the original story). Trust me, Don't waste your money by even renting this movie with a bunch of friends. It's not even worth 50 cents. READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite bomb. Only James Woods is worthy of praise.","review":"An utter disappointment. A bomb. There's no other way to describe John Carpenter's Vampires. Carpenter isn't one of my favorite directors but I've before Vampires, I've seen five of his films and I enjoyed three of them. Halloween was a creepy slasher flick that took more scares from implicit violence, The Thing was a creative special effects sci-fi thriller, They Live was a paranoid action thriller, and Big Trouble in Little China was a hilarious action-comedy.Watching Vampires, I was hoping for the scares of Halloween, the edge of your seat suspense from The Thing, and the action of Big Trouble in Little China. Instead, Vampires exceeded in explicit violence and gore, had little action and the suspense was nonexistent. The only thing noteworthy of this film is James Woods, who delivers an over-the-top performance as vampire slayer Jack Crow."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE CARPENTER, HATE THIS MOVIE","review":"VAMPIRES is one of the worst films of the year. See the DVD ONLY if you are a Carpenter fan so you can listen to the director's commentary, but other than that stay far, far away. James Woods and Daniel Baldwin are awful. Waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks!","review":"I really enjoy James Woods and his expected intensity on film. However, this movie was very disappointing after an excellent beginning. There was no horror only mildly entertaining stunts and no real suspense. What suspense there was was wasted by the good guys all to easily defeating the bad guys. I feel Carpenter could have done so much better with the actors. The movie just didn't jell for me. Suspense was built up only to take the easy way out. Both myself and my 2 teenager sons felt we were watching a MST3K movie but (unfortunately) without Joel & the Bots. Oh, by the way, Catholics should beware to be viciously portrayed both by a traitorous Cardinal (bad) and a gunslinging, vicious Priest (good). This mess could have been so much better. I think Carpenter has lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disapointment","review":"I have enjoyed many of Mr.Carpenters movies and I think he use to be one of the greatest directors. ButI have lost hope in him. This is the last John Carpenter movie I will ever see. I was hoping he would redeem himself after \\"Escape from L.A.\\" but I guess not. Vampires was pure crap. I think I could have written a better script to this garbage. As for Mr. Carpenter, I think its time for him to stop making movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"The story was a string of cliches. The characters dull and cardboard flat.

Don't add insult to injury by wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"way below par for talent involved. little redeeming value","review":"Went to see, looking forward to decent work by Carpenter and Woods. Sadly disappointed by lack of decent story and gratuitous violence. Not even scary. Grossly overpriced at this discount price. Save your $."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of Carpenters career?","review":"If this simply atrocious film doesn't mean the end of Carpenter's days as a director, then Hollywood is in worse shape than I thought. As much as I hope that Carpenter can score with a comeback film that manages to capture the cinematic magic that made some of his earlier films so compelling, I have to say that he's running out of time. Not only is \\"Vampires\\" a perfect blend of shoddy editing, muddled sound mixing, amateur acting, and awful camera work--the story itself is a mish-mash of every vampire film in the past ten or so years. Everything from the brilliant \\"Near Dark\\" to the vapid \\"Lost Boys\\" to the stupifyingly bad \\"From Dusk Till Dawn.\\" For God's sake, don't waste your money on this junk. Check out \\"Near Dark\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen","review":"I loved vampire movies before I came across this one. I liked John Carpenter's movies and J. Woods as an actor but... I would rate \\"Vampires\\" as a B movie for the luck of C. Bad acting, no story ... For a great Vampire movie look into \\"Interview With the Vampire\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite simply awful","review":"I was completely surprised by how awful Vampires was. It's aJohn Carpenter film, a man who knows how to direct action sequencesand scary jump-in-your seat shocks. It's unfortunate that Vampires was a complete bust, an extremely unscary movie that never hits on the right note on whether it wants to be funny or scary. The result is that it's never either one for a moment. Only thing worth noting about this film is James Woods fun performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This movie isn't worth your time. It's cheesy, simplistic, and boring. The acting is horrendous...even James Woods! I'm not even sure that a \\"big name\\" actor could have saved this script.The \\"heroes\\" are all insipid and repuslive, and the plot is about as predictable and mindless as they come. The villian acts like some 1920s Dracula wannabe. I expected much more from John Carpenter and crew and was sadly disappointed.Worst line: \\"A master vampire, able to walk in the sunlight, unstoppable. Unless we stop him.\\"Almost everything about this movie was unsatisfying and lame. The grammar school plot gets overshadowed by a plethora of violence, profanity, and bad acting.Avoid this movie if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fullscreen? Seriously?","review":"It blows my mind that that you can't get a widescreen version of this film that also has the commentary by diector John Carpenter. JS is well known for his widescreen compositions and his informative and entertaining DVD commentaries. BUT in order to get both you'd have to run the featureless Superbit dvd in your player while simultaneously playing the sound from the \\"standard\\" dvd on another TV. Absolutely astonishing that in the past 14 years there has been no upgrade to this work by a major genre filmmaker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw it once, Haven't watched it since.","review":"I saw this movie in the theater, and thought it was great, but when I bought it on DVD, I just could not bear watching it again.If yo uhaven't seen this movie, rent it, or better yet borrow it, but don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although this film is not his best work, it was decent.","review":"It was nice to see James Woods working in a John Carpenter film. I was a little disappointed with the story line, but the effects really kicked ass. Sheryl Lee was under-used in this film, she is a great actress that could have been a wonderful asset to the story, instead, she was wasted in a goofy role. Hell, she could have been one of the hunters rather than a mere victim. Oh, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TOTALLY FAB MOVIE","review":"James Woods is always watchable and he is just perfect as Jack Crow. There is good support from Baldwin and Lee but it's a pitty that Griffith didn't have much dialogue. If he did his character would have been scarier. But with that one minor fault aside. This movie rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Carpenter strikes again!","review":"This film was the best vampire movie I ever saw in my whole life.I hate the scene at that party when the priest gets killed in front of your eyes.The master vampire makes Dracula look [bad].This movie really scared me.That Hooker girl,dame she is hot but I better not tell you she becomes UNDEAD!Jack(James Woods)who is the leader of a club who kills vampires.I am telling you once you have seen JOHN CARPENTER's VAMPIRES you'll never forget it.Even if you are undead.It is just a movie right?Ages 13 and up can see this do to violence and bloody battles,language,adult content,and nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not deep, but fast moving and fun","review":"This is a very enjoyable movie with one of the better horror/action movie intros I've seen. The movie keeps up a tense and very violent pace throughout and while you're never pondering any deeper issues through this movie it's a good bet this flick is at least keeping you on your toes. The ending was set up to be pretty good but I couldn't help but feel a little cheated by how easily the Vampire Lord was disposed of, especially after his rather gross introduction at the beginning of the film. It may not be for everyone but it's at least worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daywalkers are 'Vampires'","review":"James Woods gives the best performance of his career in this John Carpenter classic. Jack Crow is a vampire slayer and he works for the church. His crew uses spears, guns, and a truck to pull vampires out into the sunlight. How genius. But wait, there's an ultimate vampire named Valek who is seeking the black cross to keep him an immortal. He should know that he's not a genius, so he'll never be immortal... There are many decapitations and a man is actually split in half by Valek's hand, medusa ugly! Woods is very funny when he curses at a fake priest and Baldwin is hilarious when he curses at random people, especially when he steals a guy's car. Friendship values are important in this movie and Crow spits on a guy for betraying him. Yes. This is a good John Carpenter movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I paid retail to see it in theaters!!!","review":"Where to start, where to start... Bad writing and even worse acting.

My advice...wait till you can see it for free!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is OK but...........","review":"I think blade was a whole lot better.If you gave Wesley Snipes those guns in vampie.....dang!!! Jack Crow and blade would make an awesome team!!!!!!!!The vampires in vampires looked a whole lot more you know mean!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why me...? Why did this have to happen...?!","review":"I've heard some people say this movie either ruled or sucked. While it had some really cool parts, I think the only thing this vampire movie lacked was that they killed off the vampires way too fast. We didn't get a long fighting scene much like From Dusk Till Dawn. Hence, this movie pretty much sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for Valek","review":"I must admit that I was captivated by Valek, and his quest to find the Berziers Cross. The idea of a vampire surviving in the daylight wasn't bad either.However, I found the acting and the plot to be mediocre. Lets give some credit to the vampires, especially to Valek : Jack could have never survived their first encounter. How is it that he is not only able to survive, but also able to defeat the vampires? It seems to be a weak plot: 2 slayers and a priest, able to destroy vampires of such strenght. Can someone explain to me, why it took the vampires so long to get into safety? Why would Valek take refugge in a place where he would be easily killed?As for our hero Jack, I must admit I was digusted by his character and his story, from begining to end. I also never understood, why Katrina laid naked in bed, or why she was punched and pushed around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie","review":"Had this in VHS for a long time and have slowly been replacing all of those with DVDs.

I will be ordering again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there were a lower rating, I'd give it.","review":"One of the (unintentionally) worst movies I've ever seen. The absence of plot, poor acting, bad directing, bad dialogue, bad EVERYTHING make this one unbearable. Sure, the movie gave me nightmares, but not ones of vampires and ghouls, no, rather ones in which I was to blame for this crapfest, sinking deep into a spiral of depression and turning to alcoholism...I can only Imagine what John Carpenter must feel like after every keeps telling him how this movie sucked.You want vampires?Watch From Dusk 'til dawn (1&3....2 wasnt very good.), Shadow of the Vampire, Bram Stokers Dracula, Blade..... but by all means, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My God this movie blew","review":"I don't give out one star reviews lightly but this one merited it. The heroes of the film were completely unlikable as spent most of their time beating up a half conscious girl and freaking out at each other for no reason. This could have been saved if the actual vampires had been decent. They weren't. They were almost as easy to kill as the Dusk Till Dawn crew and had no personality whatsoever. If the director was going to go for the completely brutal and animalistic tyoe for them this would have worked but it was sort of an uncomfortable medium throughout. The head vampire was especially lackluster."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a movie that has no plot.","review":"I viewed this movie and felt that it was a waste of time and film. There was no plot to the movie. I am a fan of the vampire genre and I found this movie to be nothing but trash. The whole movie was about stakes and blood. There was nothing to the movie to keep the viewer interested. This movie is a lot like the movie \\"From Dusk 'Til Dawn\\". If you enjoyed that movie then you will enjoy this one. If you did not enjoy that movie then you will definitly not like this one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampire Bites the Dust","review":"This wasn't as bad as expected in the begining and I gave it a chance but somewhere around half way, the film becomes another routine teen action flick with nothing to say. Woods isnt awful as the aging vampire hunter who cuts the fingers of priests to extract information but the vampire is so lame that we don't even think its frightening anymore. Most of the vampires look like rejects from a 1980's gothic bar and they are about as scary as a dead mosquito. The early 80's vampire flicks (Fright Night, Vamp, Dracula) are much better and I'd recommend seeing those instead of this waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it was possible....","review":"I would give this movie -100 stars.I can't believe that people have given this movie such a high rating. This is possibly the worst movie ever made in the whole history of man. James Wood as a leather clad gun toting vampire hunter is laughable at best. Daniel Baldwin needs to lose some weight. And the vampires seriously need a bath. Blaaaaah! That's all I can say...and that I seriously wanted to slice my wrists when I watched it on its opening day, Halloween 2000 (I believe). Oh god, why did I watch the whole thing? I guess I like punishment, I guess. Don't watch unless you want every intellectual thought ripped out of your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money . . .","review":"This movie is an extremely disappointing effort by Carpenter. Acting is bad, script is bad, plot is bad, music score written by Carpenter is bad. Could not watch to the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Blows","review":"This movie is one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen. It's horrible and worse than cheesy. It's another film that portrays the evil vampire and the master that needs to be killed because he's so old and powerful that blah blah freakin blah. The way they drag the vampires out into the sun and how they burst into flames is really dumb with horrible effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!!!!","review":"IF YOU LIKE VAMPIRE MOVIES, THIS IS FOR YOU.

NOT TOO SCARY, BUT JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WANT TO KEEP STAKES AROUND....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, my poor eyes!","review":"This was by far the worst Vampire move ever made. I am surprised that John Carpenter would be so broke as to put his name within 1000 miles of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak story and annoying characters","review":"I was hoping for a lot more. James Wood was so unlikable that I was rooting for the vampires. Wesley Snipes presented a much more balanced hard-ass character in Blade. If Woods and Baldwin's characters weren't such jerks to everyone, I'd characterize their treatment of Sheryl Lee as misogyny; instead I'll just call it offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dull.","review":"Director John Carpenter's career is virtually over by now. I don't care what Ghosts of Mars is like because I won't be watching it. After directing such fine horror films as The Thing and In the Mouth of Madness, he's gone way downhill with Vampires, a horror flick that is always dull and boring, without a single scare. Other than a fun performance from James Woods, everything about this movie is hackneyed and unoriginal. The movie takes such a routine approach that everything feels derivative."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"I was quite eager to see this movie when it came out. I read the book it was supposed to be based on before I went to see the movie and was sorely disappointed to find that the two had nothing to do with one another except for 2 characters' names and one scene (though vastly different in book and movie) takes place at the same location. Even if I hadn't read the book, I would still be disappointed in the movie. It had a couple of cute lines, but the soundtrack was monotonous and unimaginative, the plot was dry, and there were unresolved loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ranks Among the Worst","review":"I simply cannot believe this many people can possibly like this movie. I rented the DVD the other night, and simply could not believe how terrible this movie was. Granted, my hopes were not high, but the quality of this movie was just minimal.Not only does John Carpenter fail to provide any real suspense, the entire screenplay is completely formulaic. The acting, including the performance by James Woods, is simply horrid. By the end I was _hoping_ James Woods would die, not rooting for him, and his character is the protagonist.I do not give a 1-star rating for no reason, this movie is simply trash. There are many action films and many horror films that do this much better that you can spend your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME","review":"John Carpenter hasn't made a worthwhile film since ... ummm ... since the Stones put out a decent album ... Alot of amazon readers probably weren't even born the last time JC put out something good, and this is no exception ... A complete and total failure, and James Woods is so mis-cast it's not even funny ... Ah, serves him right, I never liked him anyway ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE WE HAVE SEEN IN A LOT OF YEARS","review":"I love horror movies and although John Carpenter is not one of my favorite directors there are some films of him that I like. And I can't understand how the director that made \\"The Thing\\" or \\"Halloween\\" has been able to do this ghastly movie. A lot of violence, gore and in bad taste. Awful interpretation. Bad dialogues. Dreadful aesthetics. Very poorly executed storyline. Not credible story (The vampires kicks and punches their victims, where are the superhuman powers of these creatures!?, and the only one of them that possesses superhuman strength has to travel by train to go to different places!?... incredible!!). In short: A horror movie that instead of to frighten, surprises for its bad quality. It is absurd, lame, boring and soporific... horrible.

The silver work is good, heavy enough to wear often. The clasp is really nice and has a safety catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"The most frustating thing about Helio Delmiro is the fact that, for some reason, he hasn't cut that many records by himself.

You can almost taste the beer and feel the amps scream! Eddy was one of the best guitar players around, hands down and this is full testament to his power.

The SJ20 has a much improved screen (even for poorly sighted individuals like myself)over the palm III. What a relief. Thanks Sony. Also the memory stick was a big plus. I have several sony products that utilize this technology. I have found it to be an effortless method for transfering data. I also like the size of the Clie. It is a little thicker than I had hoped but you can't have everything. I gave it 4 stars because I have never seen a 5 star product of any kind. But this is a fantastic PDA.

I agree that this book has its roots in truth, but I think that a more evenly assessed account could certainly have been written.I didn't like the attitude of the author. She seems to think that black women were the only ones who suffered. What about black males? Or white women? Or Native Americans? Just because I didn't see them in the first chapter doesn't mean they aren't discussed at all, but it didn't set the right tone for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read for acedemic as well as personal growth.","review":"If you are interested in an indepth analysis of the history of many of our current social movements this is the book for you. Angela Davis is brillient to be sure, but this book portrays her intelligence in understanding (and ability to convey) the conplex issues America must disern concerning gender, class and race. She also is able to articulate beautifully how these three issues intertwine. The book is worth the read for personal as well as acedemic growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"snatching the cover off...","review":"This book had the most incredible and insightful research. The detailed information on the plight of the enslaved woman was amazing. Another favorite chapter of mine was, Racism, Birth Control, and Reproductive Rights. The previously mentioned chapter sheds light on widespread practice of surgical sterilization. Ms. Davis especially makes a point of how this practice was forced upon the poor. It was also refreshing to read about women who were influential in the Communist and Worker's Rights movements. There was also eye-opening accounts of how racism was rampant in the suffrage movement. This book was straightforward nothing but the facts. I would have liked Ms. Davis to convey more of her thoughts and feelings. You can gather her perspective to a degree but you do not close the book feeling like any certain view was being forced upon you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I've read half of the book, and find Sister Davis enlightening!

It misses some key scenes including the important scene in the snow and also the Settermbrini & Naphta's discussions, both key to plot of the novel. These scenes were shown in the 2 disk 3 part earlier film version. Also, Joachim seems to randomly die at the start of disk 2 for no reason. And the casting of Clavdia is questionable, as she does not appear to the gorgeous siren she's depicted as in the novel or in the earlier 3 part film version.

I was in my first couple of years of college at the time. As many of you can relate, I had lots of fun in school (especially after classes)and didn't watch much TV. For whatever reason I was at home when the first installment aired and I was hooked. Being in college, I wasn't too much of a history buff and knew little about the Holocaust. I would come home early from parties just to get to see the next installment. Since that time I have always wanted to see the documentary again and now can say I have bought it and will watch it (this time with my wife) soon.I had the opportunity to visit Munich some time back and didn't miss the chance to visit Dachau.

Eschewing archival footage from the '30s and '40s, Lanzmann presents the slaughter of European Jewry through the testimony of the survivors ... surviving inmates, surviving guards ... even surviving neighbors of Auschwitz, who claim to have been unsure just WHAT was going on. For me, the most affecting interview is that with the Jewish Auschwitz barber who tells of how, in a period of 10 minutes, he silently shaved the heads of his wife, best friend and best friend's wife just prior to them being gassed ... none saying a word, so the barber can survive and offer his testimony.

Dodgy puppets, contemptable know-all kids, a cliched cavewoman and people in unconvincing costumes all battle to make this series one to forget. It was all obviously no more than a cash-in on the then soon-to-be-released Jurassic Park anyway. These two episodes, as if anyone gives a pedipalp, include a volcano, the green(!) larva of which is stopped by magic, and a rather pathetic 'knight', who looks about twelve and quite obviously isn't a real knight.

These people are real, their problems are believable, and almost from the first page you feel as if you have lived in their wonderful ruin of a house in the olive orchard in southern France. I hope Drinkwater is considering a sequel so we find out how her stepdaughters grew up, how the dogs did, and whether they have restored the house yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical Tribute to Life in Cannes","review":"The Olive Farm is a well-executed memoir in the fashion of Under the Tuscan Sun and A Year in Provence. In it, actress Carol Drinkwater and her fiance, Michel, a film producer, impetuously purchase a rundown olive farm in the south of France and begin the process of restoring it to comfort and fecundity.This memoir will not disappoint-- Carol and her fiance face the difficulties of limited finances, needed repairs well in excess of initial estimates, and frustrations with the local workforce. All of these, of course, are transcended by the satisfactions of nursing the olive trees into production and the triumphs of beginning to restore the farmhouse to its previous grandeur.This ground has been trodden before, but Carol Drinkwater tells her tale engagingly, drawing likable portraits of her family, friends and neighbors in Cannes. Sit back, relax and enjoy the journey to Drinkwater's Cannes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Blend Of Romance And Reality","review":"I loved this account by Carol Drinkwater of the challenges she faced and the rewards she reaped as she and her fiance Michel brought a broken down olive farm back to life.

With this book, I think Ms. Drinkwater has me convinced that an olive farm would be the place to be.The book does drag on in some parts a little bit but I love reading memoirs of people who have been able to do what they wanted to do with their life so that kept me going. It's most definitely inspirational. Drinkwater paints a gorgeous picture of easy (and sometimes not so easy) living in gorgeous Southern France. This is really a vacation in a book.

It's definitely a one handed clasp, but I've had it open several times just from having my purse strap press against it or touching it by accident. I've learned to work around it though and do not feel that it enough of a downside to make be not love this bra.Overall comfort and support is superior and no seam show through clothes!

So, with anticipation I purchased it, and I was totally let down by it. But, if you don't have the full moon compilacion of subspecies and the other story where (Duff, produced and co wrote) its a fair triology to watch.

That's what made her remake of the Isley Brother's classic At Your Best (You Are Love) so beautiful. She didn't need any belts, runs, or whistles. Just a silky soul delivery that was as close to angelic as one can get. The Gangsta Child Remix was released as the video and radio version. There's a bit more music added to the mix that expands on the late night sensuality of the original. The repeated chants of \\"let me know\\" during the chorus are infectious. I'd steer clear of the Stepper's Ball Remix though. R. Kelly gets a few verses in and ruins the mood with his creepy \\"stay awhile, child\\" lines. Who can forget his shortlived illegal marriage to Aaliyah? How I wish I could.

What's unusual about the Resdients is that they are unusual, NOT ugly. Their tunes are simple, accessible, and often quite beautiful. They are just oddly arranged.This album, believe it or not, is their LEAST accessible. They have made a collage of tiny shreds of many 60's pop songs, interspersed some vague Hitler references, and a hell of a lot of just plain noise. The result is angry, violent, unpleasant.

By that i mean it will effect the way you listen the 'golden oldies' that seem to cheer up your day (but ultimately leave you feeling unsatisfied). The Residents present a combination of 60's 'pop songs' that have been bent out of proportion, and probably more than they deserve. They turn the cheese dial to max and spew forth an album of distorted vocal styles and schitzophrenic mellodies, despite the lyrics and arrangements being seemingly the same. They attempt to show people that if you take away the 'cutesy-poo' voices, and the clear, boppy sounds of the music, it's left with nothing. The Residents attack music that has no heart, and no purpose, and do a damn fine job at it. I think this album would have made quite a few musicians think twice about their work, and hopefully it made them give it more soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chronicle of The Early Residents Sound","review":"I will spend no time discussing why you shouldn't be offended by the title or the images. I will spend no time talking about the concept of the recording. I will say that serious Residents fans should have this recording. The reason is that all of the early, hard to find, and largely undocumented sounds of the Residents are captured here in one form or another. This CD does not contain any of the music from early unreleased tapes such as \\"Baby Sex\\" (you need to get your hands on the long out of print UWEB titles or \\"History Mystery\\" from \\"Our Tired, Our Poor, Our Huddled Masses\\" for that). But the sounds on 3rd R&R are the gelling of the \\"Kamakazi Lady / Eloise / Sandman\\" style. The closest readily available Residents work to the early unreleased material."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Bloody Twisted","review":"In a perverse way, this is genius. Take 60s pop, mangle it and string it together in the most atonal manner and this is what you get. One one level, it's absolute dreck of the most unlistenable sort. On another level, it's a crafty inversion of the happy-go-lucky sounds of a bygone era. Somehow, despite the warbled and grizzled vocals, the vacous production and the frustrating repetition, there's a humourous spark that drives the entire album. I mean, for crying out loud, look at the titles on these uber-long tracks.In the end, you do have to concede to the fact that the album itself is a great work of disjointed pastiche. A tad challenging, yes, but it's got a wealth of laughs that totally make it worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School -- Good School","review":"I wasn't sure what I was purchasing... it is rather short for the money...

The product was used but in great condition and at a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak effort","review":"Can this be the same author who wrote the wonderful \\"Range of Motion\\" and \\"The Pull of the Moon\\"? The characters in \\"Say When\\" are not well developed, especially the husband (WHY did he want Ellen back anyway?), and it had a typical \\"Hollywood happy ending\\" -- although none of the couple's problems seemed to be resolved. The parts of the storyline involving the daughter just seemed like filler; the reader gets no real sense of how Zoe is actually coping. Elizabeth Berg used to be a wonderful author, but this book is more like a sappy Harlequin romance than a moving novel that makes you feel truly caught up in the characters' lives -- if you want to read THAT kind of book, try \\"Range of Motion\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disapointing Berg novel...","review":"I was so looking forward to this book, and was surprised at how short it was. It was a new twist for this author to have the main character or voice of the book be male, and it just didn't work for me at all. The ending was sappy, the kid was a brat, and I skimmed the last few pages to find out what did happen. If you are looking for a good book about relationships, try her book \\"Open House\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK; if you liked Open House you won't like this","review":"...but if you didn't (and I,as stated before in these pages, an avowed member of the Elizabeth Berg Fan Club, thought that Open House was the weakest of all her novels), then you'll find some pretty authentic Berg here. It's a small story, in that respect not unlike Never Change, but quite lovely, with some rather unique, quirky touches.I will admit that setting it in my general neighborhood endeared it to me even more, but there is universality to the story that should strike a deep chord in anyone who has ever been in a committed relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO EMPHATIC!!","review":"Elizabeth Berg's new novel \\"Say When\\" is a huge disappointment. Unless they are awarding prized for having the most ITALICS in current fiction; there are ITALICS on EVERY SINGLE page. Too TOO many ITALICIZED words! It's like having a TEN year old read it to you! I think she was TRYING to paint and ARNEST picture of a TROUBLED marriage from the viewpoint of the MAN for a change. But it just doesn't WORK."},{"rating":"2","title":"reread","review":"Say When is about Griffin and Ellen who hit a rough patch in their marriage. Ellen has an affair and wants a divorce. It really brought back memories of my parents divorce but the ending is way different. I can identify with how Ellen is feeling in her marriage. A very Good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Missed Completely","review":"This story idea has the potential for a really good novel, but I thought this missed by a mile (good cliche.) The character of the husband in particular seemed rather simple minded, although the wife certainly wasn't too bright either. I just didn't see how either could be taken seriously, the way they were presented. What was the point in making the husband a part-time Santa Claus? I did not find either of them particularly sympathetic or believable because, I think, the writing was at a level as if Berg were writing a story for children instead of adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Author, not quite my favorite book","review":"Elizabeth Berg is in the top three of my favorite authors-- I have purchased and kept every book she has written, and eagerly await every new one. She is an excellent writer, particularly about the complexities of human emotions and thought process. She really understands the way people think, and behave.I listened to the audiobook of this publication before owning the \\"hand held\\", and it kept my interest well. It really does seem to \\"get into the head\\" of men, and my husband confirmed this for me. He read the \\"hand held\\" book and quite enjoyed it. It isn't my favorite Berg book (something like saying something may not be my FAVORITE Godiva chocolate-- but they are all exquisite!) but it is certainly worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My First and Last Elizabeth Berg Novel - Read Why","review":"This novel confused me. (I would give it 1-1/2 stars if possible.) The subject matter is decidedly adult (divorce affairs, near affairs), but the writing seems more appropriate for someone in the age range of maybe an 11 to 14 year old girl. In fact, I even looked it up to see if I accidentally selected a book meant for young readers. Both the husband and the wife are so incredibly childish acting, the story seemed infantile and unrealistic. All the scenes with the husband playing a shopping mall Santa were unnecessary and, frankly, rather stupid. I love quirky characters, but these characters were just kind of foolish. The only person halfway plausible and interesting was the young daughter. After this taste of Berg's writing, I will not sample another."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was... okay.","review":"This is my first Elizabeth Berg novel, and I have to say that though it had some interesting quirks, I didn't find it moving at all. The husband is erratic and spiteful and the wife is selfish and emotionally immature. Humor could very easily be derived from these personality flaws, but the narration style is so flat and removed that I didn't chuckle much. The daughter is a nicely drawn character, as are the restaurant owner and the waitress, but when the main characters are as unconvincing as these, I don't get drawn in. It's not a bad book, but it isn't a good book, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic all the way through","review":"I am firmly with the one star raters on this one. Unmoving characters and no apparent story line. I read (actually listen) to books for entertainment as I spend a lot of time commuting to work in the car. Elizabeth Berg has done much better in my opinion. I will not give up on her books but I wish I had passed on this one. I kept waiting for something to happen. It was mercifully short and David Colacci delivered a great job of reading the audio book so I did make it to the end. Let's hope for better efforts in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long, meandering journey to nowhere","review":"When couples separate, there is a reason. And one would think that a spouse, left suddenly when his wife announces she has a lover, would use this occasion to learn something about himself, about the wife, about their relationship. Yet in this book, Say When, it doesn't seem as if the husand, Griffin, ever learns. When his wife announces she is having an affair and wants out of the marriage, he is stunned, though the clues have been in the air for some time. Rather than trying to address what went wrong with their marriage, all Griffin can seem to do is alternately get angry then beg her to come back.Ultimately I didn't feel any of the characters changed in this story. Personally, I found the ending unsatisfying, and I saw it coming from a mile away. Griffin seemed smug to the end, never admitting his culpability in the marriage's undoing. In general, not a very satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"~ Say When ~ ( When )","review":"I kept seeing this at the book store and every time I had it in my hands, but for some reason I would put it back, I saw this at the library and decided to read it and I am glad that I did. Reading what Ellen was feeling I could feel the emotions she was going through Elizabeth Breg did her homework, I am sure that there are women out there who have felt the way Ellen did. Then there are men out there who felt the same way as Griffin did, I could not help but feel bad for Griffin he loved Ellen so much that he would do anything for her even take her back if that's what she wanted. This is the second book by this author that I have read and I was not disappointed.Hapy Reading Lisa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Elizabeth Berg really write this?","review":"I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Berg's books and eagerly awaited the arrival of this one. What a disappointment! I found it so bad - and so unlike anything else she has written - that I was seriously questioning whether she HAD actually written it! To me, it seemed like the work of an entirely different author. It didn't hold my attention (I gave up halfway through) and the writing style seemed weak and contrived, when compared to something as assured and polished as 'Open House'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A man...written like a woman?","review":"In some ways I suppose this was a fine book, but I had trouble with the voice from the beginning. I just had a hard time believing that narrator's voice was male. Meaning -- it felt like a woman trying to write a man. Since I happen to be female, I surely don't understand how/why men think, but to me, Griffin's thought processes and memories seemed very womanlike. In addition, the ending was predictable and kind of cheesy.I've always thought that Berg is at her best while writing from the POV of a 12 or 13 year old girl. That's just my opinion, of course, but for some reason I think she tells a more powerful story when she uses that voice, instead of the quiet domestic dramas she creates when writing an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF TIME !!","review":"WHAT A BORING , NOTHING OF A BOOK..

I purchased a medium and it fit very loosely. The straps constantly slip and loosen up. I ended up making a small stitch near the clasp so it would not slide and loosen the straps. This really does not function as a harness to control your dog while walking -it is more for just looks. The material is soft to the touch. My recommendation is to get one size smaller than what you would usually order if you decide to purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke's on me","review":"I put an entire package of the powder in my girlfriends hot chocolate while we were on the way to her family's reunion. Nothing happened whatsoever. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fun Flick","review":"I like movies that are fun especially the ones that are based on great literature. Cruel Intentions is based on a classic story reset in modern times- but still manages to play like a period piece, which is what I loved the most about it. I loved the posh settings, the over-dressed characters and the overall look of this movie. Even the story interpretaion is more accurate (except for the ending) than I had first expected. My only complaint is that with the exception of Witherspoon and Blair, the acting is a bit strained. I am a fan of Phillipe, I liked him in 54 and Homegrown, but in this one, it seems he was a bit unprepared to play such a deep character. And I can't buy SMG as Kathryn, she's too goody-goody looking. Other than that, this is a must see, if anything, just for the great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive! Feels like Gossip Girl the Movie.","review":"I didn't expect much from this film. I just picked it out of curiosity, and to my surprise, I enjoyed this movie. It was better than I thought. I felt watching a movie version of Gossip Girl. I am always fascinated by high society, and with all that power, how it can affect one's life.The movie does have subtle message, but for me, it was jut about learning the art of seduction. :)Pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frivolous reinterpretation of Les Liaisons Dangereuse, done very well.","review":"For a movie on a really tight budget, using (at the time) B list talent, this one's done well. Les Liaisons Dangereuse is the precursor text, and updating it to late 20th century Manhattan does not damage the story at all -- the societies (pre-Revolutionary France and modern urban-extravagant culture) are eerily similar.The production values are high, the talent is well cast and works well within their roles, and the script is pretty solid. For a teen targeted puff piece of film, this one turned out to attract the attention of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruel Intentions :)","review":"This is probably the best movie I have ever seen in my life. I highly reccomend it. Ryan Philapee plays a stepbrother Sabastion who makes a bet with Katherin (Sarah Michelle Gellar) Joshua Jackson is probably the best actor in this movie playing a gay freind. If you like sex, cruelty, and a good plot. This is the movie for you. I watch it every day, i own it on dvd. Dont get it on video get it on DVD because it has lots and lots of bonus material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel Liaison","review":"This movie is modernized, teenage-ized, Americanized version of the great movie, \\"Dangerous Liaison\\", only with lesser actors and actresses. It was funny that Phillippe sometimes immitates Malchovich's speaking. Overall, the quality of this movie really can't match that of Dangerous Liaison. For the people who haven't seen DL, this movie could be still enjoyable (thus 2 stars). For the people who already watched DL, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel Intentions","review":"A horrible movie, with bad acting (let me say that i despise Sarah Michelle Whats-it) but a heart-felt ending. Definitely not worth paying 8.00 or 3.75 for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for all ages","review":"I think many people would write this off as another teen flick in the midst of lots of mediocre ones. But Cruel Intentions is so wonderful; it is sexy, romantic, smart, and sassy. It may not be realistic, but it is a masterful teenaged interpretation of Les Liasons Dangereux. This movie really touched me, and I think it was well done and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip masterpiece","review":"I am absolutely in love with this movie. Usually I am very critical of teen movies but this one has a mesmerising quality that goes beyond pretty faces and fad clothing. It took me a while to understand why and now, after watching it for a third time I think I know what it is. Granted the director, actors and set stylists did a great job in creating a film of delightfully surprising substance but it is the combination of intelligence, wit and perfect comic timing that makes the age old marriage between lust and betrayal stand head and shoulders above similarly themed films. Dangerous Liaisons is a beautiful retelling of the original novel but Cruel Intentions is the most entertaining adaptation and unsurpassably chic in its inventiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that cruel of an intention","review":"Many people concider cruel intentions to be this big trouble making hit. Unfortunatley,the only trouble i see is when i watch it at home. My mother screams at me to turn it off. I found cruel intentions to be a pretty good film, even though the title should be changed a bit. Ryan Phillipe's character was a little bit shy of cruel, dishonerable yes, but not cruel. The film needed to cool it on the whole lesbian, homosexual vibe. Too many times did we see this happen in this film. In my opinion, cruel intentions had great actors, a nice plot and a firm grasp on teenagers in society, but the movie could have been a little bit cleaner so it wouldnt corrupt the minds of little children who are flipping through channels on a sunday night."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute WORST movie ever!","review":"How in the world anyone could like this movie at all is beyond belief! I love dramas and I was soooo disappointed in this \\"thing\\" that I could hardly stand it. It was almost laughable. It looked like a bunch of kids trying to pull of adult parts. This movie is nothing more than an attempt to profit off young fans of these young stars. I am not that \\"old\\"...in my early thirties, and I found nothing entertaining about this movie. It was almost a comedy to see them try to act like adults in adult situations and try to make us think it is \\"serious\\" stuff. This movie, with it's lame plot and unnatural characters would have hardly went over with older actors playing these roles... much less with these actors... this was one big joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rate it Zero Stars if they let me","review":"Pure unadulterated garbage.

From a fairly objective point of view this movie blows goats, pardon my french. Card board characters, possibly decent plot met with horrible acting and writing execution, etc etc etc. To be fair, not all the acting is terrible and I imagine much of Roger Kumble's direction and editing did its fair share to smash perfomances to the hollow, bratty, unimaginitive level that there at. That all said, I still love Reese Witherspoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This movie has it all. It does not play just one sex because both sexes continue to upstage the other. From the very beginning it is hard to tell who is the puppet and who is themaster. I highly recommend this movie. One of the a few good movies made this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"No. This movie is not sexy, not cool and definitely a [piece of poo]. \\"Cruel Intentions\\" tries everything but misses the bull's eye. Ryan Phillippe doing his best Justin Timberlake, makes a bet with his stepsister (Sarah Michelle Gellar) that he will win over the virgin of the country (Reese Witherspoon). Gellar's performance was nothing admirable compared to a high school cheerleader's dance routine. What happened at the end? I don't care. After watching the \\"Mighty Ducks\\" boy wrestling with another guy in bed, I had to turn it off. Thumbs down kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Copy","review":"This is a copy and I am not happy about it. Great Film.

Compared to previous versions (1987's \\"Dangerous Laisons,\\" and 1987's \\"Valmont\\") the film will appeal to a younger generation obsessed with the films stars. Phillipe and Witherspoon (who fell in love during shooting and now are expecting a child) and Gellar give stellar performances. Christine Baranski once agains proves to be a scene stealer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it BUT DO YOU","review":"I think this film is excellent. It's nothing compared to the original ofcourse, it's been transformed into the ultimate teen flick and is bound to be incredibly popular.

But if your looking for a movie where the good guys win, go ahead, but be forewarned. There is plenty of graphic sex talk, and some of the scenes are really graphic too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb!","review":"This movie was just... not very good!

There is just no getting around it, the plot is well developed and the twists and turns that happen in the movie are very well done.

Since I haven't read the book or watched the 1988 movie, I really enjoyed this movie. The cast is good and gives a great performance (I found Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance to be a little annoying and not very credible, but since most other reviewers seemed to like it, I assume it's because I'm just got used to her Buffy persona too well). The soundtrack is great, and the DVD has plenty of extras (such as a director's commentary, video clips, deleted scenes, behind the scenes documentary) - all of the standard ones, nothing special or extraordinary, but still very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Movie.","review":"From begining to end this movie will captivate you. The opening scene featuring the arogant therapist is a scream. I find Ryan Phillippe's character hard to belive but still fun to watch and well played. The scenes he plays with Sara Michelle Gellar are hot. And then there's \\"The Kiss\\" which if you don't know about by now need to see it. The ending was a little blah but still not bad enough to ruin the movie. Definatly something to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hip, smart retelling of Dangerous Liasions!","review":"The only word to describe Cruel Intentions is phenomenal! Everything about this movie shines. The stars are perfect in their roles, the soundtrack rocks, and the plot draws you in from the beginning.The story follows young playboy Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) and his stepsister Katherine(Sarah Michelle Gellar). The two make a dangerous bet: Can Sebastion sleep with the headmaster's virginal daughter (Reese Witherspoon)before school starts in the fall? These roles are played expertly by the talented trio. Gellar, in particular, shines as the evil Katherine. She was awarded an MTV movie award for best female performance for her work here. Selma Blair, Joshua Jackson, Christine Barinski, and Swoosie Kurtz all appear in humorous roles throughout the film.Do yourself a favor and buy this modern retelling of Dangerous Liasions.

They could have decreased the importance of sex and drugs quite a bit and still the idea would have been great and the movie would have joined a wider category of people. I still loved it. I mean, the scenario was great and the end was not too cocky. I especially loved to watch Witherspoon. We could feel that she really believed in her character and did a great play. However, Gellar is so mean and wild, her play sometimes gets confusing and we feel that it's not really her.It was a great idea to introduce a totally new aspect of sex in this movie. This movie finally shows that if you really love someone, you're gonna stick with him or her, no matter how many partners you had before, because \\"love has its reasons that reason ignores\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"geller is stellar!","review":"I didn't think this movie was as good as it's predecessor Dangerous Liasons, the acting was much better in Dangerous too. With the exception of Gellar. She is really a good actress, but from what i have seen her in for movies, she doesn't pick them very well. unless they are picking her. She is wasting her talents in this movie. Reese witherspoon is the only other actor in the entire film besides that i feel has any true acting ability. the rest of the cast is wooden, and ryan phillipe maybe cute but he couldn't act his way out of a paperbag. i gave this movie two stars..one for sarah and one for reese."},{"rating":"2","title":"U have to SEE this movie!","review":"Ok, I know this movies isn't the best movies i have ever seen but u have to see it at least once!

The few actors in this movie do a good job at keeping the movie going. Ryan Phillipe is a charming, rich kid with evil intentions to hurt other people; particularly women. But when his beautiful stepsister, played buy Sarah Michelle Gellar, bets him to seduce their dean's daughter to lose her virginity, actress Reese Witherspoon's innocent personality forces his plan to backfire. Phillipe soon gets lost between what he wants and what his heart wants. This movie has good humor, an emotional ending, and a very good soundtrack. It's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"Despite the unnecessary sexual parts between Sebastian and Kathryn, Cruel Intentions is a very good movie. It's a great story on how a player turns good and falls in love. The ending is way to sad for my taste but it was still good. It would have been funny to see his death be a joke to his sister Kathryn. There were a lot of funny parts in the movie, my favorite being the one at the retirement home with Sebastian talking to Mrs. Sugarman. It's really funny and really shows his personality. I loved how they introduced Sebastian. At first you think he's a bad guy turned good at therapy and then it shows you how cocky he is. Reese Witherspoon was really good as the \\"good girl\\" in this movie. The character of Cecille has no point in the movie in my opinion except to make it funny when Sebastian pushes her off the bed. It's a really romantic movie at the end but the sex scene between Sebastian and Annette was a little long in my opinion...we got the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most enchanting movie of the year","review":"Reese Witherspoon is to die for as a goody twoo shoes that teen pimp Ryan Phillipi is trying to woo in this movie of seduction and sexual energy that lights up the screen with three young stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for the \\"R\\" rating","review":"This is appalling.

This waste of celluloid plods along without ever really displaying any of the passion that is promised in its previews/trailers. Recommended only for those who have trouble sleeping at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS.","review":"This movie was so bad, I wish I could have given it no stars. The acting was horrible and the plot was dull and predictalbe. I knew he was gonna get hit by that car, and I was glad. That whole sex scene between whats-her-face, and whose-that-guy was stupid. She's a virgin and it just felt that good? Gimme a friggin' break. And whats the big deal about the kiss between Selma Blair and that one chick who isn't that hot and has no talent? It didn't turn me on one bit. This is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through in my life. People who like this kind of movie deserve exactly what they get: CRAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good movie!","review":"I thought this movie definatly deserves 5 stars because it had a really good plot and the characters were perfect for their roles. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest you rent it because I think you will really like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is just one of the greatest movies of all time.","review":"Cruel Intentions is an excellent, hip, adaptation of Laclos' timeless novel. It was made in such a great way that it appeals to guys (for obvious reasons) and girls because it has such a great story. Five stars all around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was awesome!","review":"This movie was really great and everybody who is a Ryan Phillippe fan should see it!It is a movie that teaches you that being cruel to people doesn't count because in the end you only get it back ten times worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon (who's good in other things) and Ryan Phillipe (who isn't good at all) got married after finishing this shlock. Maybe they'll become so enamoured with each other that they won't have time for another cheap sex flick. Reminded me of a bad soap opera, and I've heard Gellar used to act in one so it makes sense. Stay away from this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it just as Sarah Michelle Gellar said in TOTAL FILM","review":"I love this movie . Everything in it is just perfect . I believe this movie that would rise up Sarah's fame more than Buffy the vampire slayer the tv series did . Just watch it and garuntee the internaiment that you will have . It is REALLY an execellent retelling of DANGEROUS LAISONS . And my last advice about it . BUY IT . It worth more than it's prize ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip, sexy re-do of \\"Dangerous Liasions\\"","review":"I saw this in the theater and enjoyed every minute. Reese Witherspoon's character was completely believable, as was Ryan Philippe's. His was that of the master manipulator who finally meets his match in Witherspoon's character (someone he can't seduce). The ending was sad, but also made me glad to see Kathryn get what she deserved. Check out the soundtrack; its awesome! And Ryan Philippe is hot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disapointed by this film.","review":"I was very eager to see the movie Cruel Intentions because it had a lot of my favorite ppl in it. However, it wasn't as great as it was made out to be. It was an unrealistic plot, which was all about sex, and they way you can turn yourself into this monster, this sex crazed monster. I would not recommend this movie for anyone under 18.....it is jus too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.............","review":"This could have been so much better if they had cast the right actress to play the part of Kathryn. Sarah Michelle Gellar (\\"cool\\" as she may be), certainly was not able to pull off this part. She came across as a 12 year old stealing a sip of champagne from 'mommy's glass'. Ryan's character came alive during the scenes between him and the ever brilliant Reese Witherspoon (who I might add, was the only actress and character worth caring about). Selma Blair just irritated as the 'naive' and downright pathetic Cecile. The 'kiss' between her and Ms. Gellar was completely pointless and had zero relevance to the actual plot (guess the far superior 'Wild Things' was the inspiration - huh?) Sarah may 'kick' as Buffy, but as Kathryn she limps. I've seen better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool Movie!","review":"WOW!! i liked this movie alot the DVD has some good extras and the movie itself is worth the purchase of the DVD.This movie is about a brother and sister who are bored with normal life, and using their money and power, try something much more mean: destroying a young gir's life.the DVD has lots of extras including 2 music videos, some deleted scenes, and more. it's a great movie to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an overall good movie","review":"I actually watched this with my teenaged daughter or I would have never chosen it to watch. However, I found myself totally lost in the plot and really loving it. It was just one of those movies that you didn't have to really try to analyze, it was just basically about two spoiled rotten people who would do anything to get what they want. I really started liking Sebastian towards the end, when he decided to come clean! I thought the acting was great. Just one of those chic flicks that would be fun to watch with a couple of good friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie is great for teenagers and is also great for adults to. You have to see this movie to figure it out for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I have watched \\"Cruel Intentions\\" like a thousand times. It is my favorite movie of all time. I love the characters and the plot. If you have seen the movie, I hope you agree. I recommend everyone see it, but after seeing it, skip \\"Cruel Intentions 2\\" and go straight to \\"Cruel Intentions 3\\". CI2 sucks and CI3 is quite impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruel intentions, a unique way of getting back at the world","review":"The movie 'Cruel Intentions ' is a unique movie about young people dealing with stress and unhappiness. Two stepsiblings develop a strangely corrupted bond which involves making other people miserably simply because they have all they could possibly want and are still very unhappy souls. Their cruel games are simply how the two brother and sister deal with their unhappiness... by making other people unhappy. Their relationship is a strange one filled with hate and sexual desire which makes it even more interesting. Although it is no oscar winner, it is still a delight and a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully cruel","review":"First-time director Roger Kumble concocts a wickedly attractive update of Dangerous Liaisons, this time set among rich and spoiled Manhattan teenagers. The screenplay is interesting, the settings are sumptuous and beautiful and the actors shine--with the exception of a sorely miscast Selma Blair, who looks like a thirty-year-old woman playing a five-year-old girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing Piece of work","review":"If you enjoy sex, drugs, and betrayal then this is the movie you should watch, it's amazing, the acting (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe) is incredible, they have that sort of sexual tension going on all the movie. The plot is well thought and carefully represented in the movie. Great acting, great scenes and an amazing cast!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh. My. Goodness.","review":"I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart.But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"When i saw this movie i was in shock for a couple of hours because it was soo great and the actors and actresses did such a great job. But there is only one bad part to the movie that i think ruined it and i think that part is the ending. Im not going to tell u what happenes at the end but i was greatly disapointed by it. It would have definetly been the best movie i have ever seen in my life if the ending wasnt messed up like it is. Every part of the movie kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The movie would have been the best if the bet was followed through and ryan got together with sarah michelle gellar. That would have been the best ending instead of what happened. Other than the ending the movie was great and i recomend that u watch it weather u rent it or buy it, either way it is worth it. Enjoy the movie and i hope u enjoyed it as much as i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie and Great Proformances By Gellar and Phillippe.","review":"This movie is sexy funny and very interesting. To me Sarah Michelle Gellar did A Great Job she quickly glues you in the movie then Phillippe does.Most people should watch this movie because is worth all the money you spend on it and on sarah alone plus the other actors is just a huge bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"The tale of love and betrayl gets a face lift...and breast implants. In this sleek movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, and Reese Wheterspoon. A kid makes a wager with his STEP sister that he can deflower a girl who promised not to lose her virginity until marriage. If he wins he gets intercourse with his step sister, if he loses, he loses his '54 Jaguar Roadster. Some twists and some crude moments are on the road ahead, so beware. I thought this was a sexy, profane, and wonderful movie. A must."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's something about this movie!","review":"First of all, I want to say that I didn't think that this should be considered a teen movie! There's WAY too much sexuality to this movie and if I had a teen I don't think I'd be too keen on them watching it. HOWEVER, I thought it was excellent! I thought Sarah Michelle Gellar did an excellent job and it also gave her a chance to be a little less \\"buffy-ish\\". A WAY different side of Joshua Jackson's ability to act (he's GREAT). Very sensual...much better than Dangerous Liasions in my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A hate crime waiting to happen","review":"This is the most homophobic movie that I have ever seen.

Some idiot at my group rental summer house rented this pile of feces, and insisted that about a dozen of us sit and watch it. After the first half hour I made the conscious decision to get absolutely heinously drunk, because I had to do something to take my mind off of how badly I wanted to plant my foot up the rear end of the idiot who rented this flick. I actually wasted over 2 hours of my LIFE on this video, and I urge others not to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"I'm baffled why anyone, save the most mentally impaired, would choose to watch this movie when the far superior (in every conceivable way) \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" is available. The actors are pretty to look at but their acting is so poor (especially from the unforgivable Ryan Phillpe), one is forced to ask the eternal question, \\"Why?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid and histrionic","review":"Can someone explain the fascination with Ryan Phillippe? Aside from his boyish good looks, I can't see an ounce of talent in any of his performances. You can actually see the words on the page as he's saying them. And this performance is no exception.Save your time and money. For a lesson in how this story should be told (read: beautiful Directing and Acting), rent 'Dangerous Liaisons' with Close, Malkovich and Pfeiffer. You'll understand why this story was told... not just see pretty young actors stumble through scenes with nary a thought in their heads. Reese Witherspoon does actually pull off a nice performance, but it's a little too late to save this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie proves Amazon needs a zero star rating!!!!","review":"Even Ryan Phillippe and Reese Whitherspoon could not salvage this childish script. The \\"sexy\\" scenes were unimaginative and boring (and completely unbelievable!) Watching Sarah Michelle Gellar try to seduce every man-and woman-in her path proved to me that she is not ready for an adult movie career (unless she is looking to move into porn roles). I recommend skipping this movie and watching Dangerous Liasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking and Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"An excellent film. I found myself laughing at the great performance of Selma Blair one moment and then gasping at the sick and twisted world portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe.There is wondeful chemistry between these characters and enough plot twists to keep you guessing.The ending is typical of the entire movie -- leaving you with a wide range of emotions one after another.I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sudductive and intriguing performances","review":"This film was incredible and yet intriguingly naughty.Great for all audiences who are of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This movie has it all.

Don't miss this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was an awesome movie, Ryan Phillippe is incredible!","review":"I saw the movie in the theater and can't wait until it's available to buy. Ryan Phillippe is my favourite actor and played the part of a seducing sex maniac very well. The chemistry between Ryan and Reese Witherspoon was remarkable and I only hope that they star in more films together. My favourite part was when Katherin(Sarah Michelle Gellar) gets hers in the end. The ending was perfect even thought I wish that Sebastian survived so that he and Annette could be together. It is definitely my favourite movie at the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Movie on Corrupted Teenagers","review":"A teenage flick banking on popularity of the currently hot stars (Gellar, Phillipe, Witherspoon). The movie is full of bad morals and bad role models. Most of the movie only focused on sex, deception, obsession and rich kids who are lazy, show-offs, rude and oh, just morally corrupt. \\"Dangerous Liaison\\" was at least tolerable because its characters are adults playing deadly games and the costumes were gorgeous. \\"Cruel Intentions\\" is just not a good movie to recommend. The 2 stara are for the fine acting by Witherspoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seduction at it's Finest","review":"This movie was so amazing and I was extremely attracted to the theme. The story involves alot of seduction and betrayal. I call that the perfect mix for a teen movie. I am a teenager myself, and I found it to be quite interesting. The cast was great, and I think that made the movie even better. It was a movie involvong every type of character, the good girl, the evil whore, and to top it off, one guy for both girls. I would reccomend seeing it, but watch out because the content is a little intense sometimes. I hope you see it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark schemes and lost love - what more could a girl ask for?","review":"The reason I liked this movie the most was that it was so refreshing. Although it does feature 'true love' it isn't half as mushy as some teen videos, and Kathryn's viciousness is brilliant - at last, someone who isn't nice! I also really enjoyed trying to work out what was going to happen next and I thought the dialogue was great (I don't think it sounded too mature and, hey, I'm a teenager myself!) I admit the ending is a bit soppy (though not half as bad as some I've seen) but at the time I found it really good. I think it's a bit unfair to attack the movie because the bad guy (or girl in this case) gets her comeuppance because if she hadn't, we'd all have felt cheated (I was cheering at the end!)

Then those of us who are superior intellectually can easily avoid wasting our valuable time with snot brained rat rectums like yourselves by simply avoiding anyone with blood pouring down their backs!

Oh yeah, because he's just so darn cute. Please. I have more faith in my fellow woman - those of us with an ouce of class, dignity or sense of self worth aren't that easy. And why should we be?

Not too many people have heard of these guys, and I just happened to stumble upon them one day. I picked this album up at a Newbury Comics, and I must say that the sky is the limit for this band. Their songs are so patient and beautiful, while not lacking a sense of urgency (Bitten by the Tailfly comes to mind). I would say that anyone who is a fan of music should get this. Comparisons to Radiohead and Coldplay are common place, but Elbow IS their own band. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more!","review":"This album is absolutely beautiful, it evokes the best of Talk Talk with similar atmospherics, but with a big difference being the vocalist, who can sound like Peter Gabriel when he decides to soar to the high notes.

If you like your music to take you to another world, then please buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead Meet the Beta Band","review":"Radiohead recently toured the US with the Beta Band as their opening act, an inspired pairing. If you have any interest in hearing what they'd sound like if they were one band, spend the cash to check out the import-only debut of Manchester's Elbow, Asleep in the Back. Elbow purify the best qualities of both bands - namely, Radiohead's sonic palette and Beta Band's rhythmic savvy - without the intolerable shortcomings of either at their worst. Vocalist Guy Garvey sings without mannerisms - Thom Yorke refined - and bandmates Richard Jupp (drums), Craig Potter (organist), Mark Potter (guitarist) and Pete Turner (bassist) root the songs, what they call \\"prog without solos\\", in recognizably minimal forms. Like anything progressive the songs do go on (though rarely lose interest). And while they don't rock they do compel - no more so than on \\"Powder Blue\\", where ambient Bowie meets Catherine Wheel croon, and \\"Coming Second\\", where Pink Floyd does the backwater stomp."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic 90s alternative rock","review":"Elbow's Asleep in the Back sounds a lot like Dave Matthews Band, to the extent that sometimes I had to give the track names a double take. It's no wonder that Elbow sounds so familiar, though, since their music informed a generation of alt rock bands. Asleep in the Back possesses the quintessential melancholy soft rock sound of the 90s, and is a classic of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Debut","review":"This CD creates an atmosphere of desperation and at times uneasiness. My personal favorite is \\"Don't Mix Your Drinks\\", although the collection of songs plays almost like a concept album of sorts, each song being important to the whole collection. The band seems to drift from one song to the next, often in a different vein, but it makes sense. This album is not upbeat by any means, but I highly recommend it.

'Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy, When A Man Loves A Walnut, and Deck The Halls With Buddy Holly were hilarious and had great illustrations. However, I was really disappointed with this one. The \\"misheard lyrics\\" seem much more contrived (does anyone really hear \\"my goat knows the bowling score\\" instead of \\"Michael, row the boat ashore?\\"), and the illustrations (which are the real meat and drink of these books) were not only unimaginative and badly done, but many were blatantly sexual, which I feel goes against the simple, childlike atmosphere the illustrations are supposed to create. There's nothing wrong with a blatantly sexual misheard lyric, but my problem is with the illustrations. I'd been looking for this book for a long time, so you can imagine how disappointed I was by it.If you're looking for a book on misheard lyrics, get his other books. They are hilarious, and I love the pictures in those."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst use of paper ever","review":"After hearing only a few of the terrible excuses for a \\"mondegreen\\", which is the technical term given by the author to describe the misheard lyrics, all of which were blatantly made up by the author because of the terrible examples given, I was astounded that this book made it to print. One horrid example is from Bob Marley and the Wailers, \\"Jammin'\\", We're jammin'-I hope you like jammin' too. His example is as follows, \\"Pajamas-I hope you like pajamas too\\".

Perhaps it's because I don't like Kevin Costner, or perhaps it's because he was meant to be as uninteresting and unappealing as possible, but I found this movie to just drag and drag on. Another candidate for blame in making the movie an awkward and confused two hours: Demi Moore. Why? That's all I could think every time she appeared.The film seems undecided between making Moore a central focus, an almost equal or equal storyline, and relegating her to entire secondary status. It comes closer to the latter when it comes to screen-time -- but there's been no proportionate scaling down of script and plot. Moore plugs on with lines and scenes that suggest she's an equal lead but doesn't get the corresponding recognitions in other elements of production. The end result is that the movie seems busy and her attempts to give her character a fuller personality and more complex motives are distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie made better on Blu","review":"I'll admit that I didn't have a real interest in Mr. Brooks when I first heard about it.

Half of the movie about what the psycho thinks that the FBI agent played by Demi Moore does not have enough time to resolve the main question - who the killer was. The only dicovery she makes is that it is not who she thought. It is one of those movies that you think they finished in the middle. It has some good sceens and I personally liked Demi's performance. The funny thing was how Demi got her first and the only suspect - by pure intuition she was so sure about it. My objection is that the movie is not that much about investigation, but it is about the way the psychos think, this is what the movie promotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was ok","review":"the film was interesting,but predictable.

It had a good cast with Kevin Costner and Demi Moore in lead roles and a wonderful co-starring role for William Hurt as the alter ego to Mr Brooks. In fact, the film started well but thereafter fell apart.My major criticism of the film is that it just became plain implausible and far too contrived. Perhaps many people are credulous and just accepted the plot. I couldn't manage this part. By the time the film ended, I felt relieved. Murder had been heaped upon murder with each twist of the plot becoming increasingly unrealistic.Overall, given the quality of the cast, this film left me feeling cheated.

The killing in this film is not done for a higher purpose, it is not done in self-defense, it is done purely \\"for pleasure\\". Kevin Costner, who plays the killer, is made to appear cool and suave. His character is made to appear likeable and noble.

There were aspects of the plot that seemed a bit disjointed but it holds together reasonably well. I think they cheesed the ending a little bit, however.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double indemnity","review":"Mr. Brooks is a delightful movie, spiced of black humor about a very respectable personality, labeled as \\"The man of the year\\" who has a dark behavior. A lovable wife, a peaceful life, a beautiful daughter but in last instance a boring life who induces him to find in the murder an exciting motive to live, eluding the multiple rules that govern him here and there.His alter ego, William Hurt is his hidden mind, his dark side of the moon as so speak. In many ways this film keeps a narrow resemblance with an overlooked cult movie of the past decade \\"Fight club\\" . The main difference is that this one works at four levels. Mr. Brooks, the female detective, Mr. Smith and finally his own daughter and these four stories are solidly developed to bring us an attractive script with many riddles to solve.Watch it. It's rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smeagol and Gollum are One","review":"This movie is easy to rewatch and easy to recommend. The movie production is pitch perfect in every way. There are no misses in the casting, the set design, the dialogue and story. The audience is never insulted with any pleas that Mr. Brooks is the innocent in the clutches of an evil separate demon. His daughter is a born gold digger who treads carefully around her rich parents accordingly for fear of losing her inheritance. I didn't really get to see much of Demi Moore in this movie. Kevin Costner really dominates and Dane Cook gained just enough weight to be off-putting. William Hurt is for once not grey and beige and vague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't What I Expected, But It Still Rocked","review":"I was certain Mr. Brooks would get caught in the end, so that was my first surprise. The second was seeing Kevin Costner playing a bad guy. Despite being an evil serial killer, he was still a \\"nice guy\\" evil serial killer. Costner just can't shake his everyman nice-guy image, even when he plays such a despicable character.I guess my favorite part was when he helped Demi Moore with a personal problem.

Can you imagine clean-cut Kevin Costner as a calculative serial killer? Can you imagine the eclectic and cerebral William Hurt as the intellectually aggressive alter-ego of said serial killer? Well... maybe! But can you see comedian Dane Cook as the over-zealous protege of a serial killer? Last but not least, imagine the dishie Demi Moore as the romantically disgruntled intuitive investigator on the chase. Please!!! Without revealing the storyline, if you can imagine that cast of characters in those roles you may enjoy this movie.

I for one, however, enjoyed the added intellectual stimulation of the doctrinal controversies.Aside from the heresy issues, which play a fairly peripheral role in the actual crime in question, this is a fairly standard (by Brother Cadfael standards) murder mystery. As always, romance plays a big role in both the heresy subplot and the murder investigation.I normally give 4 stars to Brother Cadfael mysteries. I'm giving 5 here for the added value supplied by the heresy issues. Those who have no interest in theology and church history might want to give it a 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Inverted Theology","review":"This is not a book I can recommend. There was no depth of character, or plot. I expected some twists and turns, but it was all predictable. The characters are indelibly flat. Of greatest disappointment were the heresies, for the author just seems to pass by them as unimportant. There are some major Pelagian defects in the thoughts of one of the protagonists, and the magnitude of the defects is swept aside by the characters we are meant to bond with, who decide in favor of the heresy through simple platitudes! The primary character, Cadfael, seems to contribute but little to the book or the mystery, and I found great difficulty in caring for any of these characters at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this book","review":"I had never read a Brother Cadfael book before this and I don't plan on reading any after. This book was bland, boring and butchered the English language. It was set in a sanitized version of the middle ages where everything sparkled besides, of course, the prose. If you want to read a good book with similar elements, try The Name Of The Rose by Umberto Eco. It's also about heresy, a mysterious book and a monk who investigates crimes during the middle ages.

Now, the question is A) If you havnt watched one of the movies why would you spoil it by reading about its scenes? and B) If you have watched one of the movies why would you read a description of something you've already seen?

However, I quickly found out that it only looked the same. The spring mechanism was too weak to allow the sifting blades to return to position after squeezing the handle when using more than a half cup or so of flour. After less than a dozen uses, the plastic part which attached the spring to the blade broke. Unfortunately, it appears as though Kaiser has instituted the same sort of \\"cost takeout\\" process used by many companies to maximize profits at the expense of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This sifter is so small.

Most of the small stainless steel sifters that have the spring loaded handle will pinch your fingers. I hate the one that you swing back and forth to sift... what's up with that?? If this product had stainless steel vanes and actuator, I would have given it 5 stars. In any case, you can't go wrong here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get an old fashioned sifter","review":"I've had this sifter for about 15 years. I bought it at Kitchen Etc. The sifter never worked correctly from the start. You squeeze the handle and the blades move but they don't retract because it get stuck on the part that connects the handle to the blade. It doesn't seem bent or anything. So what I ended up doing was squeezing the handle just a little bit (1 cm) very quickly so that it sort of works but it can be tiring.This morning I'm making pancakes and having to use the sifter for the confectioner sugar. I'm just fed up with it that I'm on Amazon to get a new sifter (I'm going to get the old fashioned one, Mrs Anderson 3 cup sifter with crank) along with some new steak knives.The only positive about this sifter is that it still looks good 15 years later.

While the composers were certainly rigth to do so (after all, who's going to top Elfman at his own game?), in my opinion they did not create a new and refreshing work, but rather another mediocer Hollywood score. What makes Elfman, Shore, or Williams so memberable is the fact that they compose self contained musical works that happen to be attached to a movie. In contrast, Zimmer and Howard have composed a few minutes of mood music that, without Nolan's film filling in the blanks, convey nothing of importance. This makes for an excellent movie, but a rather uninteresting score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Begins (Soundtrack)","review":"This soundtrack is both exciting and relaxing to listen to. Whenever I go to the movies there's two things that I'm looking for in flim: A good storyline and the type of musical store that encompasses the film. The musical score fits the film very well and the film's composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton add an interesting and dramatic blend of sound effects and orchestra music throughout the entire film and soundtrack. The songs have both a haunting and mystical rhythmn that fits perfectly with the persona of Batman who has become a timeless legend in the hearts of young and old alike. If you like the previous soundtracks of the Batman genre you'll definitely love this CD. It's well worth the time to listen to it and it also helps to relax and clear your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING","review":"As a dynamic soundtrack collector, I must say that Batman Begins is one of my all time favorite scores.

One of those scores that you could listen to without ever having seen the movie, and it would still stand on its own merits. Haunting, powerful, dreamy. Zimmer, to my mind, is today's equivalent of Beethoven, Wagner, Bruckner and Sibelius, all rolled into one. A worthy heir of a musical tradition that's languished under the yoke of modernist distortion for far too long, relegated to musty 'concerts' or being adapted for pop-culture and consumption by those who can't relate to music without watching the music video, or those who need it all packaged up into 'The Best of XYZ'.The score captures the mood and pace of the movie, with its ebb and flow, its highs and lows-and ultimately it goes one better and transcends it.It doesn't come much better than that.Till Noever, Author: Keaen, (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Out!","review":"I really enjoyed the score to Batman Begins, from things that made it and things that didn't make it to the CD.

As you most likely know this game is across the internet so like anything else that means it could get hacked and almost anyone who has played could tell you about there experience with that happening to them. In my case some loser hacked it and did some horrible things to some of my best friends. And got me to a place I wasnt aloud. Then whoever the heck it was decided to write me up (...) and now I am banned from the game until I can get the IP address changed but then Im not wasting (the money) so someone can take everything I worked my rear-end off and enjoy for themselves.

Constant system crashes 4.) deaf Customer Support 5.) at least 5 program-driven error messages per hour.

This game needs a lot of patience, and knowledge of what you are actually doing. I was walking around some village for longer than 2 hours until I came across a woman who said she could help me. abaut then the game crashes, stating an illegal operation has been caused.

Its buggy, laggy, everything moves slow, the 3d graphics are blah for the most part. Its a joke.

Bad enough I already lag badly playing UO but add that to the screen jerkiness and you can see my disapointment.

It will take them a year to fix all the problems they're introducting into the game TODAY.Customer service is so bad that it's almost comical.

UO, once the king of the hill for online gaming, has slunk into the ditch with this latest \\"effort\\". Graphically a step backward, this game sacrifices performance for badly done 3D. If you run(assuming you manage to install it) this game expect to crash often. Lag is the norm. Bugs abound, though they are patched hap-hazardly during log on to OSI servers. However, the patches themselves oft add to the problem and are patched the very next day. You may be lucky though and the game might like your hardware configuration, but doubtful. If you have problems, please expect to continue have them, customer service is not a priority for this company.

First of all, every so called feature is less than a minute long and they start off with some incredibly bizarre informative video by Principal Figgins. They are followed by redundant heavily edited interviews that are very short.

After I watched an episode, I was hooked. This show is fun and fresh with great songs and singers. The plot, although at times unbelievable, always keeps you wondering whether your guesses are right. It can, at times, be a bit strong on the message of being yourself, but I didn't mind because it is a very important message.The only thing I have an issue with is that Fox has decided that nine more episodes will be included as Season 1, and I'm not looking forward to pay out another twenty-five dollars or so in order to buy the second volume of the first season.I'd recommend that all music lovers give GLEE a shot.

You can't help liking Will, who teaches Spanish, coaches the Glee club, goes at it tooth and nail with Coach Sue (played by the incomparable Jane Lynch), and deals with a difficult wife (well played by Jessalyn Gilsig), who fakes a pregnancy for a while.The choreography is effective, as are the story arcs involving teen pregnancy, jocks, a gay student, a young man in a wheelchair, an Asian girl who is faking a stutter, and cheerleaders.

I understand that Fox is gonna make their money, and release it in a fairly retarded way to get it, but I feel like if you're a fan of the show you're going to want it in your little paws ASAP. At least I did. Haven't gotten to the bonus features yet, but the quality is good, it's a pretty sweet bargain for a 4 disc set (though I'm not sure why 4 discs were necessary), and I can't wait to watch it over and over.

I didn't expect much. I am sooooo glad I was bored that day!This is a great show. It is definitely not your typical high school show as it doesn't showcase the popular kids. This is the high school show that showcases the rest of us-- the handicap kids, the over achievers, the geeks, the gay kids, the big girls, the pregnant teens-- the high school outcast population. The show is funny and heartfelt, and the music is often better than the original versions of the songs.My only complaint is that I don't know how far this can be taken. I can see a season for sectionals (this season), a season for regionals, a season for state, and a season for nationals. I can't see it lasting longer than that and that makes me sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a scream to see this!","review":"I don't watch all that much TV, and didn't realize this set contained 4 DVDs.

However, if you are going to buy the show, WAIT UNTIL THE SUMMER OR AT LEAST THE FALL. It's true that fox originally opted for thirteen episodes, but since the show's ratings went thru the roof, the decided to add nine more episodes to the mix. They also contradicted themselves by saying they'd release the full season on DVD. Therefore this release is a complete scam and ripoff, and not worth the effort to go out and buy.

They always deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of the year? YOU DECIDE!","review":"A lot of people bailed out on Hootie & the Blowfish after their huge success with the debut album Cracked Rear View. Well, those bandwagon jumpers need to hop back on!! This album is full of incredible and unique music. Upbeat rockers like Deeper Side are just perfect to blare out of your car with the windows down. Innocence takes the power ballad to another level, I guarantee it'll send you fishing in your pocket for a lighter. I'll Come Runnin and When She's Gone slow things down too, but everyone will still be singing along! And when Hootie rocks on with Space and Go And Tell Him (the Soup Song), you'll forget why you ever left this band in the first place. And if you (like me) are someone who's stuck with Hootie through it all, this album is all the reward you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"they are back, sounding as great as ever!","review":"Make no mistake, HBF are back, and they sound as wonderful and full of energy as ever. yes, the new album is full of ballads, but also some very good classic Hootie tunes as well. From the opening bars of Deeper Side, to the ending of the hidden track \\"alright\\" this album rocks and proves that the boys have not lost their magic touch. You get a distinct Cracked Rear View flash back when you hear Space, and I'll Come Running, and you will be playing this cd over and over again. The catchy, surprising tune, \\"little brother\\" was an awesome addition to their classic sound. Darius' voice has never sounded so strong, and the guys sound better than they did back in 1995. Get this cd, you will not be disappointed. It has not left my cd player since I bought it on the release day."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one falls short big time","review":"The writing was on the wall. When a band that's been together as long as Hootie & The Blowfish has individual band members persuing solo projects, you know the band as a whole has gone very stale. Most are never capable of recapturing what they once had as a band collectively.With that said, this case is nothing different. Hootie's follow up to \\"Musical Chairs\\" is a sorry excuse for such a talented band. Hootie put out 3 extremely good albums, and I hoped for nothing different from this one. But this album can not boast one song I would call \\"awesome\\", and most of the album is just filler. This is a B-Side album. Not your tpyical Hootie release. Very disappointing to a big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best song is the \\"hidden\\" track","review":"I'm a fan of Hootie's other albums, but this is a dud--one bland, vanilla track after another. It sounded more to me like an early effort, before they hit their stride, but no! The songwriting is stale, and no tune \\"hooked\\" me, until the final bonus track, \\"Alright\\": _that_ one I wanted to listen to again and again (hence the 2 stars).

But she came across as a teenager. He referred to her throughout the book as a child, as \\"little one\\". Rather off putting, especially in bedroom play. Not that there was lots of that. Why did Ms. Brown employ her age to such distraction? Why make the age issue such an issue? It really took away from the story for me. Even in the bedroom scenes, she was wearing modest, high neck, white cotten nightgowns.

Vai is a cool guitar player but his musicality leaves much to be desired,he went to great lengths describing the inspiration for each piece,what a joke,these tracks were thrown together at soundchecks and it really shows.

If you like Faith Hill's pop you will like Set this Circus Down. If you like country and Tim's earlier stuff, you probably won't.

The things that have made me a Tim McGraw fan are his keen sense of how to pick good songs and the poignancy in his delivery of those songs. Both of those seem to be lacking for most of this CD. With the exception of a few songs, everything else seems to sound alike - that commercialized, countryish rock. McGraw does hit the mark with \\"Angry All the Time\\" and \\"Grown Men Don't Cry.\\" But I think I'll put this CD on the shelf and keep listening to \\"Everywhere\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed every Tim Mcgraw cd I've purchased, but this one just doesn't grab me.

Tim forgot what \\"COUNTRY\\" music is !!!","review":"Ok, I could deal w/ & even enjoyed some of Tim McGraws' previous CD's but \\"Set This Circus Down\\" is a circus that needs to be shut down , closed and never reopened.I think he's made a cheesy mix of poorly produced country~pop i.e.,(ANGEL BOY) w/ the exception of the thought provoking \\"Angry All The TIme\\" & only country tinged \\"Cowboy In Me\\".

The rest of the songs are just average.

The Cowboy In Me is ok, TELLURIDE is so so, You Get Used To Me is so so, Unbroken is one of the songs that do make this cd look good (and then this isn't that great), Things Change definitley is the only song that makes this a 1 star cd the song Things Change is a 5 star but without this song on the CD it is a 0 star.

Well, there's only a few tolerable songs on here. \\"Angry all the Time\\" sounds like the best stuff McGraw's ever done, but I've heard Robison's version and McGraw's just doesn't come close. If your looking for a \\"country\\" album to buy, this is not it. Don't beleive all the popularity and hype about Tim McGraw. Circus is filled with weak songs that all sound the same. This guy really needs to use a wider variety of instruments and different styles of songs. It seems like its the same thing over and over...a fast 80's pop-rock song, then a slow 80's pop-rock song.

There was no songs which jumped out to me on the first listen of the cd, unlike A \\"Place in the Sun\\" where I was hooked straight away. However when i went back to listen to the songs, i mean really LISTEN ,I found myself pleasantly surprised and after many more listens I would rate the cd ahead of Everywhere, but slightly behind A place in the sun. This cd sees Tim move slightly more main stream with a more mature range of songs which examine a diverse range of issues in a light hearted yet meaningful way. The standout songs on the cd are \\"The cowboy in me\\",\\"You get used to somebody\\",\\"Things Change\\",\\"Set this circus down\\" and the brillant \\" angry all the time\\"where he collaborates with great effect with Faith. It is well worth the buy for any fan of Tim's or good music. Just give it some time to grow on you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Awaited but Very disappointing","review":"I am so upset. I waited and waited for this CD because of my great love for Tim's music. If you are like me, you play Tim's other CD's all the time and still enjoy the songs no matter how much you have heard them. This is not the case here. I have tried VERY hard to like this CD, but I cannot get into it. None of the songs have that special McGraw \\"kick\\" to them. They are dull and lifeless, with the exceptions of \\"Telluride\\" and \\"Grown Men.\\"I keep trying to convince myself to keep this CD to have a full McGraw collection. It isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good!","review":"This album is not as good as \\"A Place in The Sun\\" or \\"Everywhere\\", but it is good. Although it is not the true country music that we all are used to hearing from Mr. McGraw. I didn't like it the first time I heard it but it has grown on me. Good jod Tim. The only problem with this record is this: I saw Tim and Faith together at Baltimore Arean in Dec. of 2000 and he played \\"Let Me Love You\\" at the end of the show, but instead of him being solo, like it is on the record, it was a duet and it sounded better that way. None the less it's still a good song and a good record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not his best CD but still a good one !!!","review":"Ballads, ballads, ballads, that is all I can say about this new CD. I have read the two negative reviews, which were stated ahead of mine, before I bought this CD so I was really curious........It is definitely not his best CD but still a pretty good one with wonderful songs. In my honest opinion, \\"Let me love you\\" is the only song that does not fit at all because this spanish typed version is not Tim McGraw\`s style.Keep on listening to this CD and you will appreciate it more and more each time you play it...... :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim McGraw Hits Another Home Run!","review":"This is the great music that we have come to expect from Tim McGraw! All of the songs are wonderful! A great mixture of fun and heartfelt songs that you can sing along with! I can't wait to see this in concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim does it again!","review":"Tim McGraw is an amazing artist. He started out his career as a bad boy, we all know his reputation but as he's gotten older he's gotten more mature and that show's in Set this Circus Down. There is still the underlying bad boy in his songs (The Cowboy In Me), but you get to see a softer more insightful side of him in songs such as Angel Boy and Take Me Away From Here. Grown Men Don't Cry and Smilin are also great songs. Tim McGraw is THE MAN. He is goodness in a black cowboy hat and I would walk for miles and miles to hear his music. Tim, I love you man you are the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"70's rock rehash","review":"This is the worst album I've heard in a long time. Egotistical, self centered lyrics,( he compares himself with Hank Williams and Elvis?)sung to a rehash of old 70's style rock. I'm surprised this stuff still sells. If \\"Things Change\\", it isn't evident here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Set This CD Down","review":"Say it ain't so-Track 1- The cowboy in me attributes every questionable quality in the singer to \\"The Cowboy In Me\\" - what a wonderful depiction of the cowboy.Maybe I got off on the wrong foot with this album, but too many of the songs have the same overproduced shiny sound as his last album. There are exceptions, though, \\"Angry All The Time\\" is an amazing song to begin with, and Tim and Faith's versions is as strong, or stronger than Bruce Robison & Kelly Willis's. Telluride, takes Tim's heartbreak to the ski slopes and has some great lines, and it an original take on an old country theme. Forget about us, written by Mark Collie, is another tune worth a listen, simple and sad and wonderful. Other than that, Angel Boy's vocal doesn't fit the mood of the song. Smilin' is Where the Green Grass Grows with a alternate lyric. Needs less pop arrangements, and more country ones. Tim McGraw was one of my favorite country artists. Things Change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang 'em up!","review":"Everybody knows that Tim McGraw is a talented guy, but I guess that most of his talent has been consumed recently by his relationship with Faith Hill. The catchy tunes and nice rhythms that seemed to explode out of his last album, \\"A Place in the Sun,\\" are not present here. And what's up with this circus stuff, anyways? Maybe he should just leave that over-rated wench wife of his and join the circus. Heck, after this album, they might not want him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate it a zero, I would","review":"I used to be such a big Tim fan. I have most of his cds, but then I bought 'Set this Circus Down'. I would say its one of the worst cds in my collection! Listen to every song on the cd. It sounds like he's whining about his love life in just about every song. Yeah, we know you love Faith but do you have to keep shoving it down the fans throats? I only like two songs on the whole cd. Tim's best was 'A Place in the Sun'. Circus has to be the worst cd he's released. The day he got married was the day the music went out the window.I doubt I'll buy another Tim cd. His next work will probably just be more whining. The same with the next and then the next. It's a cycle of crap now. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo Hoo","review":"This guy sings all over the radio that he doesn't know why they say grown men don't cry. Because they don't. Stop being such a wimp!He has a good-looking wife, though. Buy her stuff instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CIRCUS needs HELP!!","review":"I am still shaking my head after waiting so long for this new album by Tim McGraw. I am a huge fan of his but after this latest release, I may not pick up his next and wait for his next Greatest Hits Volume 2 if and when it ever comes out...this new cd has some good tracks....TELLURIDE, THINGS CHANGE, ANGEL BOY, ANGRY ALL THE TIME, and WHY WE SAID GOODBYE. The rest is just ok....maybe it will grow on me....but buyers be aware and listen to it first before purchasing online or at a record store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate Nashville, please explain","review":"Tim McGraw can't sing, let's start with that. Toneless and unemotional, his success is a complete mystery to me.Then there are the songs...\\"Angry All The Time\\" is a woman's song, obviously. The story is, it was meant for Faith, but she was pregnant and wouldn't be able to tour and promote the song, so Tim cut it. Great rationale, huh?\\"The Cowboy In Me\\"....does he have something against cowboys? Those are insulting lyrics, I hope he knows.Essentially, I think Tim McGraw lacks both native talent and basic judgment. Of his numerous megahits, I can count on three fingers the ones I actually enjoy. This does not square, proportionally, with his success. There must be some powerful corporate mechanics at work giving him the career he has somehow obtained.If I could give a share of his success to more deserving performers, I would choose Collin Raye and John Michael Montgomery, both of whom have all the goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crime of the new century","review":"I imagine loyal fans of Time McGraw will appreciate this new album. But I have to say the rendition of \\"Angry All the Time\\" is an absolute crime. The song was written by Bruce Robison and recorded on his album WRAPPED. Bruce's version is true music for the soul with heartfelt, tender vocals reminiscent of Don Williams. Tim McGraw's version is like fingers against a chalkboard if you've heard the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Set This Circus Down on less than solid ground","review":"Tim McGraw's latest effort seems to lack the musical and lyrical creativity from his previous two CDs. Although his interpretation of each song is as inviting as those found on \\"A Place in the Sun\\" and \\"Everywhere\\", somehow the selection of songs seems ho-hum in terms of what we know Tim is capable of expressing. As a result, the majority of songs sound flat, and lifeless despite Tim pouring his heart and soul with each breath. \\"Set This Circus Down\\" falls far short of the heights both \\"Sun\\" and \\"Everywhere\\" have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"I found much of this album to be dry and lifeless unlike McGraw's previous efforts. The soul seemed gone from both lyrics and music. Perhaps McGraw has been spending a bit too much time being a dad and not enough on being a musician true to his craft. As an example, I actually believe one song in particular would have been better served by a latin artist....\\"Let Me Love You\\". Not only does the music actually go faster than McGraw can seem to catch up to, there is also no urgency to his voice in a song which should be filled with emotion. Sorry to say, McGraw needs to back to the studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!","review":"There are a lot of you out there who would call this CD too far from \\"true country\\" but I only have one thing to say to that, in the words of Tim himself \\"some say it's too country, some say it's too rock n' roll, but it's just good music if you can feel it in your soul\\" (track 5, Things Change). It is good music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful album.","review":"Tim McGraw's latest effort, \\"Set This Circus Down,\\" is a hit! After I listened to the second song on the album (\\"Telluride\\"), I knew this CD wouldn't be leaving my CD player. I enjoyed this album and I thought each and every one of the songs on it were amazing. One of my favorites is \\"You Get Used To Somebody,\\" which is a beautiful love song. Another song on here that really stands out is \\"Grown Men Don't Cry,\\" which proves that guys do cry! I was also pleased when I heard that his wife, Faith Hill, was singing in the background of \\"Angry All the Time.\\" I definitely recommend this wonderful album by one of country music's best male vocalists."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW-THIS IS HOT!!!","review":"I cannot say enough about this CD, I have to admit that the only reason why I bought this was because of the song \\" \\"The Cowboy In Me\\". Yet after listening to all of the tracks, I can say that I was addicted, I felt as though I could relate to all of the songs. One of my co-workers is a big \\"McGraw\\" fan and I keep on her that she needs to get this CD and that she will not regret it. I believe that I have her convinced. Like I said on one of my other reviews of albums \\"This is the BEST of the BEST\\". It can only get better from here...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim is Great!","review":"Well, for me this is a great Tim McGraw CD! I loved almost every song on the album. Cowboy in Me and Angry All the time are two of my favorites on the album. Faith and Tim as usual hit the mark with Angry All The Time, and Cowboy in Me is the most country on the CD. Angel Boy, Telluride, and Unbroken are more on the rock side for Tim and I love them. This is a great CD and well worth the wait. Tim never disappoints me. He is definitely one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"He does it again!","review":"Tim McGraw's latest CD is just as incredible as all the rest. The sound of Set the Circus Down is a little different. A lot of it is kind of mellow. This CD is all about his vocal talent. You really hear him over the music. BUY IT! If you're a fan...you won't be dissapointed. Esepcially love Track #2...a new hit for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it A Chance","review":"At first I was kinda dissappointed with Set This Circus Down, but after listening to it through a couple of times it has really grown on me. There are many songs that could become potential number ones. Smilin', Angry All the Time, Angel Boy, and Things Change are all certain to be big hits. This is Tim McGraw at his best and his wide range of great music proves why he is the best country singer today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"As a Texan who has achieved a still-unbelieveable level of success through a combination of lofty financial contributions, misadventure, and gross social blunders by immensely gifted contemporaries, McGraw has baffled industry nay-sayers by racking up CD sales in the millions. He does this through his deft song choices, and here Bruce Robison's wonderful \\"Angry All The Time\\" bolsters this effort and makes it almost listenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grown Up Tim","review":"I heard this album last night on a radio interview with Tim McGraw. He definitely displays some maturity in the songs. He seems to have outgrown the faddish country music-although great tunes, did not have depth. This new album certainly finds a large degree of depth and insight. Tim McGraw has found ways to make his audience identify with the stage of life that he is in right now. It shows in the music, overall bringing together a compilation that will leave listeners wanting more of this new Tim!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Set This Circus Down---In my head....","review":"As a fan of Tim McGraw since 1993, I have always kept up with his newest albums. I thought after \\"A Place in the Sun\\" debued no other album could top it. But I stood corrected with this CD! Tim is a great example of how life goes on and only gets better. His voice is carried with me throughout the day because I cannot get his songs out...but there is no complaint there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the country Tim?","review":"I am a huge fan of Tim McGraw. He is very talented and sexy, but he needs to get back to his country sounding albums. The albums \\"Not a moment too soon,\\" \\"All I want,\\" and \\"everywhere\\" blew me away with the talent this man has. \\"A place in the sun\\" was ok, but this latest effort is so horrible that I traded it in at a used cd store. I couldn't believe how different his music style sounded. Except for \\"the cowboy in me,\\" all the songs [bad] and sound like \\"filler\\" material! I feel guilty saying this because Tim is so cool, but it's the truth about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim has done it again!","review":"With this new CD, Tim McGraw is clearly singing songs like he as never before. On several songs he sings in styles not heard in his previous albums. This CD is different than the others so Tim McGraw fans may need to get acquainted with the new styles. But Tim does an excellent job with singing songs with an old country sound to them. His voice shines and so does his talent. I waited for a long time for this album and I am very pleased. This album is great for Tim McGraw fans who like his past work and are open to hear a little different sounding Tim on tracks like \\"Let Me Love you\\" and \\"Things Change\\". Rock on Tim!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for the undergraduate","review":"The language experts give this book a good rating, but I, the undergraduate, see little value in this book. The author's native tongue doesnot seem to be english. The book focuses on things like why \\"their\\" is an execption to the rule \\"i before e except after c\\". This book is far from simple to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed - Poor edition of a great book","review":"I just wanted to agree with the other reader who said this was a poor edition of a great book. On my version, either the cover is upside-down, or all the inside pages are. Sure, it still *works* fine, but having to turn a book upside-down before reading it is just ... wrong. No, this is not just reading from the back like a Hebrew Bible, this is actually upside-down. I've seen other editions of Gesenius without this problem, so I know it's just this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware which edition/copy you buy!!!!","review":"Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar is the \\"industry standard\\" for Hebrew Grammars. However, when I ordered the book new, directly from Amazon, the copy that came was, in itself, useless. The publisher's note says that it was a book that was reprinted using optical character recognition software and that the typos have NOT been fixed, because it would cost them too much to do that. There are way too many typos in this copy (put out by \\"General Books\\" or \\"RareBooksClub.com\\") for it to be useable in my college/seminary/parish studies. Nor is there any index or such system in the copy I received. If I were you, I'd make sure it's a copy published by Dover (Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar (Dover Language Guides)) because I know that copy is reliable and has a good index, it's what my classmates use. Don't do what I did: I ordered new, directly from Amazon, and that version was the bad one. Hopefully I can help out some fellow biblical scholars with this review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all Hebrew to me","review":"Being a Catholic Priest, I studied Greek and Latin in my Seminary training, some years ago now. I always had a desire to learn Hebrew so as to be able to read the Old Testament in the original language. Whenever I picked up a \\"Learn Hebrew to easy way\\" book, I saw refences to Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar and thought, \\"this must be the book to have on this subject!\\"I must say that I am only in the early stages of working through this very thorough text, but so far I believe that it is a classic and will be worth the effort of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor edition of a great book","review":"I recently bought Oxford's hardcover edition and its a damn shame that for the price of the book what you get is a glued photocopy of the original edition. I won't get into the content of the book. Gesenius' work is legendary for those interested in the subject. But I do warn those interested in this edition of what they'll get. It is sad that such a fine publishing house as OUP is getting into the habit of selling expensive editions of books that basically amount to a cheap reprint of the original. Instead of advertising it as expensive hardcover editions they should be more frank about what they are really delivering."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most extensive grammars of the classical Hebrew.","review":"This work is an outstanding example of the scolarship of the classical Hebrew language. The work covers nearly everything on this matter. The print is sometimes too small and the structure of the book is a bit complicated. I recommend it for a person who wants to dig into the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera","review":"Overall this digital camera is great for novice users. The camera is very easy to use because of its well-labeled parts and simple menus. With all of the features and for the price, the pictures and movies are great. The only problems that I have found are that the camera has no flash, there are beeps when turning it on that will not shut off in any menu, and without a memory card it does not hold very many pictures. In the end, this is a great, cheep camera for low level to mid level users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great point-and-shoot camera and camcorder!","review":"This pocket-sized camera is a great tool if you need a digital camera and camcorder for your family. With its built in memory alone, it can only record seven or so pictures and only about 10 seconds of video recording. It is essential to buy a CompactFlash Card to boost its memory, I recommend a 256MB for around fifty bucks which allows about 100 pics and 50 min of recording (I got a 512 MB one for $99). Having well-lit surroundings is imperative because this camera has no flash and does not preform well in low lit arenas. If you have a great picture, you could always edit the brightness with you PC or Mac. This camera also has some drawbacks. One, niether camera nor camcorder has a zoom feature (so it is the same distance as a disposable camera). Also, under quiet conditions, there is a buzzing or humming sound in the backround. However, if you will use this outside most of the time, you should have no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE don't waste your money!!","review":"This item was a TOTAL waste of money. I acutally bought 2 of these (one for each of my kids ages 7 and 9). The first part that was awful was the battery life. The batteries only last about 2 hours TOPS. Secondly, the pictures were awful. Also, the battery compartment broke on BOTH cameras after about 1 week of use. Maybe this is because we were constantly opening the battery compratment to change the batteries. Also, if you do not have EXTREMELY bright light, you will not be able to view your picture. This camera is pretty easy to operate and is small but that is the only good feature. Both of these cameras have ended up in the garbage with only about 2 months of usage. Please don't make the same mistake I made.

I found it easy to use, and the software and written instructions were very simple and easy to understand. I downloaded pictures to my PC in record time.Now for a little bit of bad news. I wish this camera had a light, either a microfiber type light to throw a little exra light on my close-up subjects or a flash. This is a perfect camera with no frills and simple and easy to use. Make no mistake, it is a strictly daylight camera.I did notice some of the lighting balance problems discribed in the other review.

It is a little light weight and i feel as though it wouldn't withstand a fall and the memory is really limited so invest in a flash card.

Also, the LCD screen is able to be turned off and on, so when I turned it off and my wife went to use it, she thought the screen was broke, so make sure you let the other person know. The battery drain sux, but we got rechargeable batteries, and it only cost us 15.00 dollars.

Overall this camera is pretty bad. It also doesnt have a flash so you cant take pictures in low light. You also have to turn on the backlight to see the picture on the lcd and there is no zoom. The viewfinder is almost impossible to look through and it sucks up battery life like a hoover.

What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical, predictable BORING DS","review":"Once again, Danielle Steele cranks out a boring, predictible book about a rich, young girl and an older man and their stupid choices and foolish mistakes (and they were supposedly such smart, worldly people) until they come together again and almost live happily ever after. I could barely get through the first couple of chapters. Then I just skimmed the remainer and realized same story, different names. Save your money and borrow it from the library!! I will never again waste my money on Danielle Steel!! I would have gave this book zero stars if I could!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredictable","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. It did take some patience getting to the plot. Incidents that occured did not always turn out the way I wanted them to and sometimes they did. I am recommending the book for sure to those who like Danielle Steel. Others will enjoy the book also if you love romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money with this one","review":"This is the worst novel I have ever read by Danielle Steel. If you enjoy spineless female characters and emotionally abusive, childish men then you may like this story. I only kept reading because I was hoping it would get better; unfortunately, it only got worse. I didn't even finish the last chapter. I skimmed it, hoping (in vain) that Kate would come to her senses. Instead, she continues to pine after a man who has admitted over and over again that she will never come first in his life. I have no idea what Danielle Steel was thinking with this one. I think I'll stick to her earlier works and toss this one in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have read every Danielle Steel book and own most of them. This can't be written by Danielle Steel. This book is slow, with very dull spoiled characters. I couldn't stand the \\"hero\\". He was childish, selfish and cowardly. I hated the beginning. I hated the end. I hated the middle. I think Danielle Steel needs a long vacation. Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kate, please get it in your head he's no good for you","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I thought that Kate finally got over Joe when she married that other guy who really loved her. Then Joe came back into her life and filled her full of lies so she divoriced her husband. Joe's character made me hate him. I kept hoping that Kate would finally leave him. I wanted to toss the book, but I had to see if Kate would leave him. I don't think anyone should put up with such abuse from a man. He didn't wan't her baby, he never wanted to be home, he really never wanted Kate. Joe just used her through out the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It","review":"This is the most trite, insipid book I have ever read. The characters were so incredibly shallow that by the time I got 3/4 of the way through I quit. I knew Joe died from the very beginning, so why waste my time reading the rest of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a GREAT book! I haven't read a really good one in quite awhile. I'm a BIG fan of Danielle Steel. I read all of her books, no matter what. Once I started reading Lone Eagle, I couldn't put my book down, I had to finish it. I finished the book in 3 days! I'm passing this book to my mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive & wishy-washy","review":"At first, I thought I was crazy when I couldn't get into this book, but found that others felt similarly. I couldn't get into it! Danielle Steele described the characters' feelings with the same words & emotions throughout the entire novel! All it seemed like was that Kate aged biologically, but not emotionally. At one point in the story, I was getting really annoyed at her for sounding like a nagging wife (though her concerns seemed semi-legit). Don't we have enough \\"nagging wives\\" across America? I really couldn't like Joe the way I could \\"like\\" other characters from Ms. Steele's other novels, probably because he admitted first and foremost that airplanes were his first true love. Yes, there are many men like that out there, but Danielle Steele novels are supposed to be an escape - and aren't supposed to be thinly veiled portrait of some man we all knew..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeating Eagle","review":"The story is good, but she repeats the same information over and over again. This book could have been ten chapters shorter and been a great book. I can't beleive she got Lone Eagle published!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I have read all of danielle steel's books. I feel like she is just cranking out the books.The ending was blah... I could of cared less what happened to these two characters. She protrayed the main character as a whinny woman who has nothing to do but wait around for her man to come home to her.. A normal women would tell this man to take a hike a long time ago.. This isn't true love it is co-dependancy. I'm also sick of women who easily fall into bed because the man shows up on the doorstep saying \\"honey i'm home\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe it was Steel","review":"I read some of the other reviews and I have to agree with the ones who believe that someone else wrote this for her. I have read most all her works and this one is at the bottom. Not only does the prologue tell you ending before you get started, but the book could have been written in a 100 pages if she wouldn't have repeated herself over and over and over.If she did, in fact, write this, then I suggest she takes more time and writes one great book every six months or year instead of trying to have her own book-of-the-month club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steel not up to par on this one.","review":"Although the story line is good, the writing is repetitive. The reader is constantly reminded of what he/or she has already read. It's also dragged out and is a long book as it is. I have read a lot of her books through the years and this one disappoints. Each time this star-crossed couple gets a set back in this book, it starts over again... the best thing about it was the ending when it finally came - and that was anti-climatic. One wonders if Steel actually did the writing.I have outgrown Ms. Steel, I do believe, as I have been reading a few authors lately that really grab your attention and don't let go, that is what I like. I would not recommend this to someone that wants more substance in their reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read another DS book","review":"There are too many Danielle Steel books to read, don't bother with this one. It was was good but you will hate the male main character, Joe. Joe is the most selfish, arrogant man. You pray that Kate gives him the boot. If only she did then we'd get to watch Joe cry over losing her once again. He wants her, he doesn't want her. Then she moves on and is fine and he doesn't like that so he wants her again. Unfortunately, she keeps taking him back. This book only proves your mother is usually right (as much as daughters hate to admit it) They usually know what is best for us but it's not clear to us until later."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, too, miss the old DS","review":"I have loved Steel's books for many years. Her stories and characters have always been very real and her descriptions of places were outstanding. Her last few books have been a disappointment, as the stories have become less and less interesting. I have always tried to ignore her annoying writing habits (And she did this. And they did that......). In this book the bad writing is just made worse by constant repetition. I thought if Kate ran her lovely long fingers through her dark shoulder length red hair one more time I would scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too much\\"break-up, make-up\\"","review":"I hadn't read a Danielle Steele novel in a few years but decided to give this one a try since I am always interested in the 1940's time period - as well as romances set around WWII. I won't be reading another of hers anytime soon. It seemed like the plot was stuck in one place and didnt EVER go anywhere. Throughout the entire book, it was \\"Kate loves Joe, Joe is no good for Kate but he loves her too... fate keeps bringing them together, they break up.... back together - even though he is still bad for her....\\" on and on. Frankly I was disappointed. Guess I'll stick with some other authors who can actually write a story that has more than one theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended for Lovers of Love","review":"I enjoyed this book until just before I was half-way through. The love connection is amazing, the behavior is bad. If you like conflict, you'll like this book. As a woman who works very hard at being married and getting your man to commit... this book infuriated me to no end. I love the way she writes, but she is duplicitous and negative. She portrays a troubled relationship as a good one. It is a contradiction of true love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lone buzzard","review":"I quickly finished this book in a bookstore. Danielle Steele is SOOOOO predictable. For all of you addicted to daytime soap operas, here's your book. Though why you would bother to read more than one is beyond me - just substitute different names and you have a \\"completely new\\" Danielle Steele novel. Where's her editor? She has a ton of spelling and grammar mistakes. It's a funny way to kill a half an hour. Just remember: Eagles may soar but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over and Over and Over","review":"I agree totally with the fan from Saco ME. She just kept drumming the same thoughts into our heads over and over and over and......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Drivel","review":"My sister warned me when I was into the book about 25 pages that by the end of it I would hate these characters. Truer words were never spoken! I hate to say it but I think Danielle is getting senile. She repeats herself CONSTANTLY. All through the book she describes these people over and over again ad nauseum. I bet these tired descriptions take up half the book. Surely she doesn't need the money that badly that she's cranking out this drivel. Telling the ending at the beginning was a huge mistake. After that, you basically knew what was going to happen. I used to read her books from cover to cover but this one, I'm basically just trying to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just finished it!","review":"This was one of Danielle Steeles' best novels. How appropriate for it to be released the same time that Pearl Harbor came out, being that it is based around WWII. I couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you read one you read them all","review":"I love Danielle Steel but this book is becoming boring. It may be because I read Wings a few weeks ago, if you have read one romance/airplane/wwII book you read them all I guess. It's similiar in that she's younger he's older and he has misgivings about the age difference just like in Wings. I hope it picks up soon or it may be a no finisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for Steel fans","review":"I've read every book Danielle Steel's written and have only been dissapointed a time or two. Lone Eagle is one of my favorites. I read it during a difficult time in my marriage and it really helped me through. In typical Steel style, it is somewhat predictably romantic, but true fans won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me the good old books!","review":"I agree with everyone who rated this three stars or lower. What has happened to this woman's writing abilities? She must be truly in it for the money. I was taught in English class that it was not a good thing to start a sentence with \\"and\\" or \\"but.\\" She does it A LOT!! Also, as so many people say, she repeats and repeats! I, too, have read most of her novels but I'm not going to bother any more. After reading reviews on \\"The Kiss\\" and \\"Leap of Faith\\", I'm sure of it. It's really too bad because I loved the early ones like \\"Palomino\\" and \\"Daddy.\\"I hope Danielle reads all the reviews and takes heed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing book","review":"Ever since i picked this great book and started reading it i couldn't put it down. If you look for a great romance book this is one for you. I seriously couldn't put the book down. I read it all in one day and enjoyed every moment of it. READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointed by Lone Eagle","review":"Do not waste your money on this book. I am usually a big reader of her books but this one was slow,boring and the guy for his age needed to grow up . There is no good part in this book sorry to say. I hope her next book is better. Maybe she needs to take a long rest between writing her books. I'm glad my sister lent me this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danielle is slipping","review":"I've noticed in the past 2 years that Danielle Steel's books are slipping. It's taking me forever to continue reading this book. I find myself putting it down. That never happened in the 1980's and 90's. Her books were gold. My husband used to joke that I would get one of her books and pretty much finish it in 1 day, 2 the most. Now her books are not written as well as they used to be. I think the last good book I read of hers was The Wedding and Bittersweet. I have continued to buy her books (up to date) hoping they would be like they were in the past, but they're not. I don't know why her writing has changed or maybe she's putting too many books out too fast.I miss the old Danielle Steel writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER AND OVER AND OVER","review":"How can she say the same thing over and over, and still get us to read her books?? She needs to go back to writing school and learn about plot development. When she gives the whole story away in the first chapter, who cares what else happens? And character development, she tells us about them, but doesn't develop them any further. I used to like D.S. but I think I'm about to give up on her!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS WHAT WOMEN DREAM ABOUT?","review":"I was really disappointed in this novel by one of the best-selling writers of our time. I kept waiting for the characters to grow and get some depth. The woman, Kate, was a seventeen year old bright shining star when the story began. I kept waiting for her to get a grip and get rid of Joe, who was a selfish self-centered baby who wouldn't commit (and god forbid he get some help for that!) For example, on page 380 it was STILL HER FAULT. \\"She thought constantly about what had happened to them, trying to understand her part in it...and in time she could see how her reaching out and wanting more time with him had panicked him.\\" YUK! Kate's life was really depressing, waiting for Joe to come home and throw her a bone once in a while. It wasn't another woman, but his obsession with his airplanes. I had hoped that the book would have Kate making some healthy choices. She showed such promise at the beginning..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly Away Already!","review":"I read romance novels for fun and escape not for a great literary experience. This novel is one of Danielle Steel's worst. The writing is so basic that at times it sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. There is absolutly no depth to these characters. At the begining of this novel you really want these two to be together but by the end I found Joe very dislikable and wished he'd just leave Kate alone. How many times can you be burned before you learn not to touch fire? Most of this novel takes place during the first 15-20 years of their relationship and then all of a sudden at the end of a page Ms. Steel skips ahead 17 years??? We totally are ripped off of the supposed happy ending. However I don't think I could have stood another chapter of this book but maybe I would have liked Joe more. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring!","review":"I have read all of Danielle Steel's books and this by far is her worst. The last 5 or so have not been up to her scale as when she first started doing novels..How disappointing it is not to like her book. Danielle go back and read your first few novels and take some lessons. I will not purchase anymore of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Waste of Time","review":"After finishing two recent releases by LuAnne Rice and Kristen Hannah I have decided after reading Lone Eagle that I will never waste another moment of my time reading another Danielle Steel novel again. The characters in this book were the most unlikeable duo I have ever encountered in a story line. By the time this book finally ended I couldn't believe Danielle Steel can continue to embarass herself with these ridiculous novels. Your time would be better spent reading a book with \\"real\\" characters and interesting storylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"What makes an Australian artist tick & then some.","review":"I'll keep this simple, Norman Lindsey was one of Australias outstanding Fine artists and a grand cartoonist.

All he really liked to do with it was take the balls out of it and throw them around and turn the train upside down to see how it moved. He really didn't play with it much and it sat on the shelf most of the time.Suddenly around 14 months of age he became very interested in this toy and liked to make it run, put the balls in it, and chase it around. He likes to experiment with trying to get it to run over different surfaces; the carpet, wood flooring, tile, and rugs. I know it is rated for 9 months and up but my son personally had to be a bit older until he really loved this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I have the same toy?","review":"My long-awaited, spoiled baby daughter has so many toys a lot of our friends comment that we should open a daycare center (no thanks!). This is one of the toy purchases I truly regret. I am putting it in the attic because it NEVER gets used. I keep showing it to my baby, who's now 21 months old, but we both think the same thing - BORING. BTW, we've had it for about a year now, and she's never been interested in it, so I don't think she ever will be. Save your money and buy the Playskool Busy Ball Popper instead - loads of fun for about the same amount of money. As an added bonus, even the older kids from the neighborhood love to play with the Ball Popper (even up to age 14), especially when it has fresh batteries and the balls pop all over the place!

A VERY DISAPPOINTING LEE FILM! 1 1/2 STARS!","review":"I love horror films and can be very forgiving, but 'Theatre Of Death' is one that doesn't really have many good points. It's slow moving with little action and the dialogue is boring. I found this film on a double feature DVD with 'Circus Of Horrors', which thankfully is a far superior film and made the purchase worth while. I'm sure some Lee fans will watch anything he makes, but this is one of his most disappointing films I've ever seen. On the plus side on the double feature it has a short feature-ette with Mr. Lee, some trailers and a stills gallery. If your a fan of the film the transfer looks very good and enough effort in the extras to make if worth your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goody goody!","review":"The first thing you should know, is that this is more of a murder mystery than a horror movie. It's definitely not a bad one, but definitely not scary. There seems to be some confusion, as if two separate scripts were filmed or one swapped for an other during the filming, but the result is quite good. There are some really beautiful actors / actresses, good score (if my memory serves me properly, by a female composer) and a nice dark overall mood. The backstage feeling is quite realistic as well and presents a good picture of what the life of an avant-garde theatre personality must have looked like in the sixties. And more important, the sound / picture quality (wide screen) of this DVD (Momentum / Kino, with a mustard-toned cover) is so good it is really difficult to explain to the non initiated viewer that this movie is 35 years old...."},{"rating":"2","title":"PJ in the Big Easy","review":"Pearl Jam's show in New Orleans is a solid, but not spectacular show.

What a joy to read a history book on the development of a revolutionary Marxist leadership in the United States that's written by a lifelong participant. Dobbs, a working-class militant in the Midwest, tells how he became a communist because the Marxists were the most consistent fighters for the workers. In this book, Dobbs traces the continuity of revolutionary Marxist leadership from its origins in Europe to the United States. He describes how indigenous revolutionaries joined with immigrant fighters to form the early U.S. communist movement. In light of the current U.S. war against the peoples of the Middle East, Dobbs' account of the challenges to maintaining revolutionary communist perspectives in the context of imperialist war is particularly important for revolutionaries today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrels love these logs!","review":"Best squirrel food I have found.

It definitely doesn't hold up to his other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic plot.....simplistic writing....very shallow overall","review":"This book is a major letdown, like his last novel. The plot and writing are shallow and simplistic; there's no depth here like in a good Koontz or King book. Good thing I checked it out from the library instead of paying for this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I read the less I liked","review":"I was very disappointed with this novel by John Saul. I'll have to say I'm not one of his biggest fans but there are several of his novels I have truly enjoyed, like Midnight Voices. This book was dark and sadistic. There was no \\"guilty pleasure\\" in reading this book as alluded to by a previous reviewer, only a feeling of disgust. I finally started skimming the pages just so I could find out who the maniac really was. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"Saul has always been a dark writer, and I've enjoyed many of his books (Shadows, God Project, Creature)This one turned my stomach when I read several portions. And when it didn't, it was just plain boring. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ver disappointing","review":"Don't waste your cash. If you're a hard core Saul fan, pick it up at the library...it's a quick read. Starts good, nice character build-up, then bam! it's the end. Lots left hanging...no explanation. Unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK, YUCK, YUCK","review":"Horrid, absolutely horrid is the only way to describe this book. Last few John Saul books have been the same. Last book of his I read. You have to wonder: what happened to John in his childhood to have such gruesome stories come out of his head.Don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Not the supernatural take, read/heard in some of Saul's other publications but it maintained the good vs. evil/loss of innocence approach that make his reading enjoyable to me. Listened to the audiobook & think the narrator did an excellent job conveying a genuine creepiness/perverse tone when appropriate (made the skin on my neck stand up). Not a book for everyone - some of the subject matter could make people uncomfortable but I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I really enjoy John Saul's books. They are creepy and scary in a \\"everyday\\" manner. Hard to explain, but usually very intereting and fun read.Now comes Perfect Nightmare. Uh! what happened? The book is slow to the extreme and the main characters are not likeable in the least - which would be great if they were interesting. Lindsay is so whiny that I wanted to smack her upside the head a few thousand times. The whole family dynamics did not work.However the more horrific part is that this story was just not very scary or enjoyable in anyway. No suspense, no dread feeliing - nothing.Pass on this one. I think John Saul missed the mark big time -0"},{"rating":"1","title":"No chills, only ills","review":"When I read the back of the book I really thought this would be an interesting read...but I was wrong. Although I finished it from front to back I still found it repulsive. There are issues in peoples lives that are not worth addressing in fiction and this was one of them. Unfortunately, to a lot of young girls monsters lurk in corners to invade their innocence and rip away the very essence of their self. They do not need to be reminded of the torment in any form. I do not condone reading anything that crosses the line such as this book. The most appauling part was when the author tried to make you feel sympathetic to the monster. I found it sickening to say the least. I still like John Saul, but if any other book is written like this one, I will wave goodbye to my favorite author forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Count the One Sentence Pargraphs in this Book?","review":"John Saul is a writer for new readers who haven't yet learned what good writing is (teens). Forget about metaphors or real imagery appearing in his books, and all those one sentence paragraphs! How irritating are they?The story is what is now almost a cliche type of kidnapping story. A teenage girl (Lindsay) is kidnapped and held prisoner in a basement. Another girl is already there and a third is soon kidnapped as well. A serial kidnapper (and worse?)is on the prowl. Saul creates some poignancy in this novel with the mother of Lindsay (Kara) and her sense of desolation and sorrow. A decent mystery is here, but one has the sense that all this has been done before and done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"I disagree with a few of these reviewers. I thought that this one of his Saul's best. Good story, suspenseful. Worth your time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and not very believable","review":"The whole storyline is not very believable. Why couldn't they wait till their daughter graduated to move into the city? She was in her senior year of highschool, so it would have been less than a year.I could see a psychopath looking up girls to kidnap by searching houses currently for sale, but not the character who was doing it...and especially not because his sister molested him one time when he was little.The author tried to throw suspicion in 3 or 4 different directions, but the way he did it made it obvious what was happening.I've read other books by this author that were pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks.","review":"I can only drum up the courage to give this novel two stars. The storyline is old but what I really didn't like was the wordy writing. This was not tight writing and certainly not a typical Saul piece of work. I guess what turned me off was the character inconsistencies...especially the girl's father. Anyway, I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book should be","review":"This was the first book by John Saul that I have read, and it has to be the best book I have ever read. It is true that it may be a bit much for some people, I liked it because of all of the suspense. There were multiple twists and turns that surprised me and made it even better. I would recommend his book to anyone who likes these type of books. I am not going to give away any spoilers, but if you like being on the edge of your seat, this is the book fo you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Nightmare","review":"John Saul never disappoints. He lures in the reader with clear protagonists and plot. He then makes you turn page after page. I started with his 1st. novel and always look for the next. He is just plain weird and scary!! LOVE HIM!!!!! And you owe it to yourself to start with \\"Suffer The Children\\" and enjoy the creepy world he creates in each and every book that follows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast for the Mind and Eyes","review":"Those who say that \\"The Man Who Fell To Earth\\" (1976) was Nicolas Roeg's last great movie either have not seen \\"Insignificance\\"(1985) or have vastly underestimated it. All the trademarks of a Roeg film are here; surrealism, spectacular visuals and a uniquely intelligent story.The idea that Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstien had an intimate relationship is explored here with great gusto. Misconceptions about Monroe's intelligence and Einstien's intellectual elitism are shattered here although her baseball player husband(DiMaggio)is what the viewer would expect.The climax is both unpredictable and mind blowing. All in all, Russell and veteran cast are great and Roeg's craftsmanship is uniformly excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple GPS, good value for money for casual, no bells or whistles","review":"Simple GPS, good value for money for casual, no bells or whistles.

I get that she's young (21) but seriously? She's still that irresponsible and flat out dumb? We're supposed to believe that they're in love but all that was displayed was lust and a severe case of doormat on Tabby's part. The fact that he called her a slut and a hussy at what seemed like every chance he got was gross and I guess we're supposed to think that it's all because poor little Christien misunderstood something he saw when they were both younger? GMAB! Despite the fact that they both finally told each other that they loved each other NONE of that felt sincere or believable. Both Tabby and Christien are poorly written characters and their story is just sad (as in bad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LG best book","review":"I am a big fan of LG and I believe that this is her best book ever.

The only cloud on Tabby's horizon is Christien.

I had read it years before when it became the 'phenomenon' it has been labeled since its opening. But unless you see it onstage with all the magic played out in front of you, you are likely to feel you are being preached at. Yes, it is the first play of its kind to put modern society's true feelings towards homosexuals and AIDS under the microscope; but it reads like Kushner tried too hard to find just the right words to preach at his audience.

The author is abusing the audience. I have friends whom are gay and they never talk like the trash that represnt them in this book, they hold themselves to a higher level and have class. The author creates gay hatred instead of encouraging people to embrace the gay culture. This book makes you think gays have no sense and that they are wierd instead of just average people.

I bet I was the only student in my school who has even heard of it. This is a pinnacle of American drama and Kushner is taking it to levels of the highest theatricality. To me, this play is reminiscent of Williams, O'Neill, with hints of Beckett's absurdity, Marquez's magical realism, Lorca's passion, and Larry Kramer's themes. It is impossible to due these plays justice by comparing them to those of their predecessors-it is a masterpiece all its own. Using the recurrent theme in modern drama-homosexuality-Angels brings home many issues that we face as a human family.

I read them all in about two days as once you start them you cannot stop. The paper quality is a bit low, but what can you expect for the price. You get the full story, plus it has additional stuff to the film and more depth. This shows off Miyazaki's amazing drawing skills and his ability to weave a story with a message is renowned. This has strong environmental themes and manages to make a point without ramming it home. You have to read these in the traditional Japanese way (I.e. back to front from a western perspective) but this only adds to the charm and overall experience. A brilliant intro to Miyazaki's anime.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest manga series ever","review":"There are two versions of this.The first is a perfect bound edition. The second is the larger version here.Both are excellent reads but the larger versions allows you to see the brilliance of Miyazaki's artwork (from a guy known more for animation). I have been told that the newer version is a more accurate translation but, not knowing Japanese, I can not confirm that. It is certainly an easier read because one does not have to squint.In terms of story, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a masterpiece. It blows Lord of the Rings out of the water. And this is coming from a person who hates almost the entire post-apocalyptic genre. I did think the ending came a bit suddenly and it did not necessarily wrap up every question I had.However, it is still one of the best graphic novels you can get.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"the seller is promt","review":"i recived the item today and it is brand new in the box with all the pieces and it is a fun track my son loves itthank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"cloying and repulsive","review":"I didn't like this book at all. I find Bradford's writing style far too wordy and she tries too hard to be cute in her observations. She really just comes off as cloying and out of touch.

It reflects her good taste in decorating homes in Indian style. Eventhough it is nice to see some of the maharaja styles decor she definitely includes examples of decor of regular households and contemporary looks that could definitely be applied.Most of the decorating items included in this book could be found in Indian arts and craft stores. The colors are so vibrant and enticing in each and every photograph. I read this book so many times, actually it is a very nice relaxing reading companion.

Great information about the best runner in amrerica to ever live. Tom Jordan has packed this book from cover to cover with intense stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone who considers themselves a runner.","review":"While Tom Jordan's writing style is quite straightforward and easy to read, it quickly becomes predictable. Fortunately, the subject, Steve Prefontaine, comes to life through a series of personal experiences, Prefontaine quotes, colorful races accounts, and reflections of friends and family. Prefontaine comes across as a brash, energetic, and competitive young man with an indomitable spirit. His lesson for aspiring distance runners is that hard work, discipline, toughness, and determination are the traits that lead to success in distance running. For the competitive runner, Prefontaine's style and approach are well showcased by the book. As one reads the account of \\"Pre's\\" life and running, it quickly becomes evident why he has become an icon to distance runners. The account of his most important race, the 5000 meter at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, is poignant. Overall, a very satisfying book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time!!!","review":"After reading this book I was greatly inspired by Pre.

You have to understand that before you pick it up and start reading. Never-theless, there are smatterings of anecdotes from family, friends and former competitors of his; and also words from his contemporaries. I found myself much more interested in what they had to say than with the details of his races. What he had to say intrigued me and gave me an understanding of his personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!","review":"Well I read this book thinking it would be just like the movie \\"Prefontaine\\" But I was wrong this book is excellent much more detailed in every way compared to the movie.

I'm not going to read this book because I know it will break my heart, but I will say this: the best thing about Pre lives on in his ability to inspire, even if it's just one high school kid. I've read all the wonderful reviews, and I don't have to see the film or read the book to be filled anew with the emotion of seeing Pre run. The most wonderful thing about running in those days was being there, at that time, when you never knew just what night happen any day or night there was a track event at the U of O. Keep running kids, and you make us fast again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow this book sucked","review":"This is one of the few negative reviews I have ever given.

Its great how they put European and American versions of some videos on here. I really like that. I haven't really had a chance to watch the \\"Emotion Pictures\\" documentary, I've only watched the videos. This DVD is only for hardcore 'Chair fans. If you're not a fan, before getting this DVD, buy all the albums and get the Best Of CD which contains some B-sides of Chair songs that can be found on soundtracks (like \\"Untitled\\" was on the \\"Godzilla 98\\" soundtrack and Punk Song #2 can also be found on the \\"Scary Movie\\" Soundtrack) or other sources that are unknown.

Pam Dawber makes a delightfully sweet little mermaid, and Treat Williams is great as her distant love. Karen Black makes a splash of a performance as the sea witch, and Helen Mirren turns in a nice performance as the prince's wife. It's a very good version, but I wouldn't say it's the best version of this story. I really, truly loved it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awsome software, bad management.","review":"RoboDemo does a pretty good job of recording demos, but the company is so scared of piracy that they made the software impossible to use in certain situations: for example, if you want to record something on your laptop and edit it on your desktop computer you have to buy two copies of the software. There is no way around this. If your computer crashes and you have to re-install it, you have to endure a 30 minute wait on hold to get someone to give you a new product key so you can install it again.In addition, if you want any tech support you have to pay eHelp hundreds of dollars for them to even talk to you.This company needs to get a serious clue. eHelp should be rename eNoHelp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this item","review":"My wife is disabled and has difficulty with fine motor control. Using even a large-button TV remote is difficult for her so this would have been an ideal item had it worked. While setup is not difficult, the unit would recognize her spoken commands only occasionaly. It would send random commands to the TV and change channels constantly without any user input. We tried every remedy outlined in the manual to correct the problems but after three days, we gave up. This remote was used only with one user and only for a TV, even though the manual claims that it will control several units and can work with four different user voices.

When I called the company directly, the business(?) phone is answered \\"cash n gold\\" and the enterprise sounds like it operates from a warehouse with loudspeakers interrupting anyone you are speaking with.

Operations defined in the manual often don't coincide with what happens when you follow the instructions and press the keys. It simply is a bad piece of product design, however well thought out it may have been, in the concept stages.To make matters worse, just try accessing the manufacturer's web site.

Don't know why - it would just change channels in the middle of a show and when you tried to tell it the station you wanted, it wouldn't change. So for all that training - it didn't seem to hear a difference in voices and any sound apparently will trigger it to take an action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Contemplation","review":"This small book by Pulitzer Prize winner, Stephen Dunn, was a very quick and enjoyable read. Mr. Dunn sums up some of our ordinary thoughts and feelings in the poems Lucky and The Lost Thing. In Replicas, Mr. Dunn provides insight into the masks that many people wear to cocktail parties where appearances can be very deceiving.The poem Signs illustrates some of the ridiculous connotations in some of our traditional signage, such as Slow Children and Falling Rock Zone. In his words are the memory of a kiss, the aura of the aftermath of making love and Mr. Dunn's attempt to memorialize time. These are all moments that we share in common, just like everything and everyone else in the world. It is in our sense of commonality that we identify with these simple portraits preserved for all time by the written word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have a bunch of Photoshop books, and being a digital photographer, I did not find this book helpful at all for my interests.

The book is very heavily influenced by Zen Buddhism, and many of the thoughts and suggestions flow directly from Buddhist beliefs. For example, if one does not believe in reincarnation, many of the suggestions in the book make no sense at all. The book is mostly well-written and I suspect would be appreciated best by those with a strong belief in Eastern religions. Personally, I can't say I benefited much from this, though some points were quite interesting, such as that 'desire' is generally a source of pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure","review":"This book is very interesting, and rings true for me. It seems the question of what death is requires one to look deeply at what life is, which requires one to look deeply into what it is that is asking the question. This book is filled with stories of people who have done this exploration, and also with meditations to help lead oneself or another into the process of asking the questions and providing guidance to the fearful and confused mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loss as teacher","review":"Not a subject everyone is comfortable, in fact, a subject few are able to face but this book is the best on the topic.

It delves into how we live our lives, what creates joy and what creates suffering and how to accept both. Taking responsiblity for ourselves and accepting the truth of pain in life is the first step towards happiness. Levine urges us to be present and thoughtful in our actions. Through painful self evaluation, one can find acceptance. As with most spiritual writing, the reader must be ready for the teaching to appreciate it. Read what rings true to you, what draws you in and you will have a better understanding of how to be close to your soul. Keep the book around, and you may find an openess to other chapters, as you make your way on the path of growth. Every time I read it, there is a new teaching that I am ready to hear. This book, though philosophical, is not dry. It contains Levine's profound personal stories which illustrate his points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book before you die!","review":"Very few books make reflection on death so calming, so refreshing.

My father died when I was very young and that event left me terrified of death. Then I read \\"Who Dies?\\" and realized there was another way to look at death.

Not that she has is a very well put actress, but her collaborations really don't even hit that nail on the head. Her latest single, Hold You Down with rapper Fat Joe is a very wimpy and not even well put song. It actually sounds more like it is very bland. They've both collaborated before on Fellin' So Good which was a little more upbeat, and catchy. This song isn't even as close to adequate from Jenny from the block.

Save your money and buy the DLC for one of the Mass Effect video games that you already own- you're going to enjoy that much more!If you feel strongly about buying anime, though, I would recommend the Ghost in the Shell seasons or films involving Miazaki.

It follows the early career of Alliance Marine James Vega, an NPC in Mass Effect 3, providing some background to his character in the game.I found the overall quality of the anime to be very poor; substandard - from character design and plot, to the scripting and the voice-over acting. It felt more like watching a bad Saturday morning cartoon animated by high school students, than a top-notch production the Japanese and BioWare are notorious for producing.

Maybe I got one in a bad batch. However I'm sending it back for a refund rather than a replacement, especially because the technical support for it is so poor. The icing on the cake was when I was trying to fit it back in its original box to ship back, and I accidentally knocked over a glass of water on my printer.Thanks Evoluent.....for nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"I'd been suffering with wrist pains for over a year now.

NO PAIN!!!","review":"I've been using the vertical mouse for well over 2 years now.When I first got the Version 1 mouse, I had a problem knocking it off my keyboard tray as one other user wrote on CNET. This is just because I wasn't used to the height of the vertical mouse compared to a normal mouse. It didn't take long to train myself to pick my hand up higher off the tray when swinging my arm from the keyboard to the mouse.Ever since using the vertical mouse, I no longer have forearm pain.The optical scroll wheel in the vertical mouse 2 is a great improvement over the old version 1 vertical mouse. However, I liked the rubber grips on the old version 1 mouse better. Just as the first mouse took me a while to get used to, I suppose I will eventually get used to this one too.The only thing I still don't understand: Why didn't they design the original mouse this way?I'll never go back to a standard mouse as long as I can get a vertical mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elbow rest essential","review":"I was going to return this but then tried it with an elbow rest on my chair and it's much more comfortable that way.(made even better with the following freeware programs: MouseTool, Voice Flux Pro). . . . . . . . . .Update 2006-10-22I'd like to drop my review to 2 stars.

No exceptions: there is no likeable character in the book. The dialogue is stilted for the men, unbelievable for the women. The plot does constant 180's for no apparent reason.

Being placed in the 1930's, I was almost expecting to be taken to a time and place alien to me. I was astounded in the way O'Hara's society hasn't changed much from the one today. The only difference is that the issues in this novel are more plevalent today than in the hidden crevices of yesterday.I attribute this comparison to his level of writing. If everyone could write like this, all books would be timeless. As well as the lush descriptions of New York, from the start, it is difficult not to feel for Gloria. The rest of the story tries to explain why she is such a person to feel for.I enjoyed seeing a colorful portrait of the thirties as well as getting swept up in the tragic story of a girl who has an inevitable future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two of Mann's best songs on one CD single!","review":"Both songs are incredibly catchy pop hits! \\"That's Just What You Are\\" is featured on the Melrose Place soundtrack.

Most Star Wars novels seem to compete with each other for whose characters can wield the most amount of Force, so in one book they're destroying a planet and the next they're destroying a solar system, until finally somebody has the galaxy in the palm of their hand.Sheesh.This on the other hand is more about characters you can actually identify with, good solid writing with back stories and culture and history, and enough tension to keep you going. It's a fine set of characters. The plot twist was easy to spot a mile away, but had just enough doubt to keep you suspended between hope and angst.Really this is more like something George Lucas would have written, with MUCH better dialog: a set of otherwise fairly normal people, set in extraordinary times.

But don't pay more than 10 bucks, cause it isn't any 15 dollar movie. It comes as a twin movie pack with Invaders from Mars-with Karen Black for under 10 bucks. Shop around online.

The 50's environment was so exciting and since it was my favorite decade it was a pleasure to see. The storyline was simple but good - not great, but good and the characters were wonderful.

I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I think most people will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"It's obvious that the producers had good intentions for STRANGE INVADERS.

The acting is ham-fisted and this \\"spoof\\" of 50s alien invasion movies is almost a complete wash out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Horror, Bad Wishmaster","review":"This was a good horror flick but a terrible Wishmaster. The Djinn gets physical instead of mental. Seems like the Director made this film for younger audiences ( set on a college campus ) A true Wishmaster fan would't mind if it was an insurance siminar!

Don't buy it. Rent it !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish for Andrew Divoff.","review":"This movies lacks in many areas. First, it lacks seriously in creativity. It starts out with a young college student suffering from nightmares and trying to deal with a tragic accident that happened when she was young. From there she finds the hidden gem and unleashes the Djinn. Second, the Djinn that they have in this movie does not come close to the Djinn from the previous 2 movies. Also, this Djinn only shows up in true form only a few times in the movie. They probably shot all of the Djinn scenes over a few day period to save money on makeup costs. Some of the death scenes are somewhat entertaining, but they could have thought them out a little more. The movie could have been made with a little more effort and probably would have had better results. Hopefully they can correct their errors on Wishmaster 4, which I heard that they are making."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH,YEAH,OKAY,SURE?","review":"A cast of 10, a collage campus you can use during spring break.The only creativity in this picture was when someone found the Djinn's costume in an old wardrobe department.After this I refuse to see the fourth one,lmao!!Never paid attention to the fact that the Djinn neded 1000 souls first.But what the hell, had a couple real taste bud babes in it, and that is all you really need for a great movie, right?....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Burned this one!","review":"This was THE worst movie I have ever seen. I love Wishmaster 1&2 but this was horrible! It didn't even have Andrew Divoff (the djinn) in the movie. It didn't follow the Wishmaster rules. Like he would force people to make wishes rather than trick them into selling their soul. After the movie I was so depressed that I had spent any money on that movie, that I burned the movie in a burn barrel rather than ever even look at that movie again!Take my advise, if you MUST see it, RENT IT.

I do admit that if you like gushing blood....there is plenty here to see.I hope the original is better then this installment but i have no plans of watching it after this pile of evi(less). You might want to watch it to complete the trilogy if you enjoy the first ones. This movie is just so lame from beginning to end....didn't scare me one bit. Bad direction to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely amazing!","review":"To be precise, a very gory and violent film. 'Beyond the gates of hell' proves horror films can simply exceed bats, vampires or haunted houses. Witness some genuine horrifying stuff here.

Even if you like the Wishmaster, this one is tough to watch...","review":"Easily the worst of the four Wishmaster films. Andrew Divoff doesn't play the Djinn in 3 and 4 (wisely, I'm afraid) and the film suffers for it. At least he is entertaining to watch even if nothing spectacular happens. It doesn't even seem like they tried at all to make this movie any good. They ignore most of the mythology of the first two movies, and the actors involved are downright awful. Do yourself a favor and pretend they never made this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"Wishmaster 1 and 2 were both excellent films, part 4 was not so bad. I did buy this part but the seller did not have it, so I went for a long time without caring to watch it. I was on a horror spending spree and I finally got this film. What a snorefest! I did fall asleep during this movie because it was so friggin boring. The acting was bad, the person who played the Dijin wasnt so great, the gore was decent, and the story sucked. I'm surprised they made a part four after this crapfest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad and stupid movie","review":"I loved wishmaster 1 and 2, they are my all time favorite horror movies. this movie isnt a thing like the first 2. It is a discrace to the series. it was a low budget film so all the effects are cheesy, the djinn looks different (bad costume). a different actor plays the djinn (very bad actor). the dialoge of the movie is bad as well. remember how the stone was in a statue in 1 and 2? well now its mysteriously in a stupid puzzle box, the djinn throws people around and acts like an idiot. he has powers even if hes not wished to do so. there is pointless nudity in it common to cheap horror flicks. its just an all around BAD BAD BAD movie, nothing like one and two. I rented this movie, if I had bought it i'd return it or burn it. never watch this movie if you liked one and two, it will only disapoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!!","review":"Now after seeing the first 2 'Wishmaster' movies, I had high expectations for this movie. Apparently, they were too high...what hurts this movie, is that it's a total 360 turn from the first 2 movies. What this movie tries to be is a 'Scream' & a \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" movie...which isn't saying too much, since they were mere silly movies, than horror movies. Too many just average actors & no pazzazz to it. Jason Connery as the human form of the Djinn isn't convincing. Andrew Divoff, who played the first Djinn character, was great. Such evilness to him. If you're a fan of the first movies, go see it, but don't expect a horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AT ALL ENOUGH FOOTAGE OF THE DJINN DEVILISH MONSTER!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What ruined this movie was the fact that the Djinn(who looks like a devilish monster)was only shown for about 8 minutes(or less)throughout this entire 90 minute movie.(I did add up the minutes).And for most of the time,the Djinn was transformed into a blonde guy with beard and mustache that looked SO BORING!!!!!! When I watch a horror movie,I want to see a hideous looking monster for a good amount of time not only for 8 MINUTES or less!!!! Especially of the fact that the Djinn in devilish monster form looks extremely realistic and frightening.Too bad they didnt show much more of him in this hideous form.Im very upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does this movie suck?","review":"I own the first 2 Wishmaster films and they are supremely excellent. I got this one, 'cause I figured \\"What the hell?\\". How wrong I was. This movie was about as interesting as root canal. Whoever that guy was playing the Djinn should've read up about the character more. I agree with a previous review...give Andrew Divoff what he wants so that he'll make this Wishmaster entry a good one. Or at least a decent one. From what I've seen of Wishmaster 4, it seems as though it might be a bad one as well. Hopefully for Wishmaster 5, Divoff will return for one last Djinn movie. We can all hope, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror movie, not Wishmaster","review":"This was a great horror flick but terrible for the Wishmaster series. Seemed like the director was trying to lure younger audience by staging it at a college. If you are a true fan of the Djinn, it wouldn't matter if he was at an insurance siminar! Also, two different people played the Djinn. For the Djinns sake and the Wishmaster movies, PAY ANDREW DIVOFF WHAT HE WANTS AND BRING HIM BACK!!! He is the only one.

I was REALLY impressed with the first. It was original, gory, disturbing, and....SCARY! It had some genuine creepy moments that surprised me!Part 2 was OK. Definitely not as good as the first but not AWFUL. It still had some fun moments and was just cheesy enough to get by.This movie, however, was devoid of all scares and almost completely lacking in the Djinn department. Seriously...what were they thinking when they wrote this??? It's the worst franchise sequel I have ever laid eyes on! Not a scare in sight and some of the WORST, most poorly put together gore scenes ever. Soooooooo completely lame and non-scary. VERY disappointing. I am watching part 4 now and am thinking it is going to turn out very similar to the way part 3 did. So far, it's looking more like a cinemax softcore porn then a horror film. Maybe that will change...oh well!Pass this up!!! COMPLETELY WORTHLESS GARBAGE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Stupid. The Djinn goes crazy on people through the climax without anyone having wished his powers loose. On top of that we had a wonderful excess of college kids running away scenes. The characters were garbage, the plot forgettable and the whole ending totally forced. Fastforwarded through plenty of the film after I got sick of pointless or extra long scenes, just stopping long enough to catch up on the plot. So maybe I missed some single line of dialogue that redeemed the entire film but actually that's entirely unlikely. It was awful and unwatchable. Luckily there's no connection between films after the second one so if you're looking to watch the entire series, you can skip from Wishmaster 2 right to Wishmaster 4 and not miss anything. But if you're like me and really want to watch the whole series, just keep your finger on the fast forward button so you can save yourself some bad film hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"Honestly, who can live without them?

It was more a string of events than a story.

There is no plot ! 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it's even badly written. Don't know if Patterson thinks about writting a 6th, but don't count on me next time !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinko","review":"I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent. This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading. The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful. I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed. I ask you how many women do you know that use a term like \\"skirt hound\\" for a man who chases women? I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me! It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue. Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"If you like Patterson and dont mind that nothing particularly new is added, you will like this book also. It follows the well know pattern and is for sure good entertainment. It's just that all his books by now seems to be so similar that they are becoming difficult to distinguish from eachother, and as readers we should expect more.I will likely keep reading his books, but as a writer, Patterson has dropped significantly in my ranking."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Patterson fluff","review":"When I first started reading Patterson's novels some years ago, I enjoyed them very much. But since he's turned into a book production machine I can't say the same. The 5th Horseman has some ingredients for a good novel but it is so hastily put together that it ends up as fluff. Save your dollars and spend them on an author who puts time and thought into his/her novels rather than chasing the almighty buck at an ever-increasing frantic pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madrebooks","review":"I never received this book and was never granted a refund. TOTAL rip-off!

I would definetly order from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 5th Horseman","review":"I have read all 5 of the Womens's Murder Club series and look forward to another. If you like to read about successful women, this series is for you. They are fun to read and very exciting. Happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he even writing anymore????","review":"After reading his last few book with \\"co-authors\\" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the \\"co-author\\". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed but not giving up","review":"The 5th book in the Women's Murder Club is probably the worst James Patterson book I've read so far...other than those flying kids. The first book in this series got me hooked on Patterson, and I will continue to read his books, but this book left me disappointed and confused. I kept waiting for something to tie in the two storylines, but that never happened. The book ended, and I felt like...\\"this is it???\\" Too many things left unexplained and unanswered. The sixth installment of this series will have a lot of making up to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short","review":"I am a big James Patterson fan. However, The Fifth Horseman is by far his most disappointing. There seemed to be two different stories (neither of which was quite concluded). Also, in the women's murder club series there is usually a lot more team work and interaction. Written by two - seems like it was written by about 20 students taking their first creative writing class."},{"rating":"1","title":"5th Horseman","review":"First of all, let me just say that I am a big fan of the Women's Murder Club Series. That being said, this book just did not measure up to my expectations. The Car Girl murders and the hospital murders did not have anything remotely to do with each other, and therefore felt completely random. Also, the book did not have an exciting or gripping conclusion, it just sort of ended. Also, how does a person manage to get a syringe on an airplane with post 9/11 security? I really loved 1st to Die and 2nd Chance, and the two following those were decent though not as good, and this one just plain stunk. I really hope the next one impresses me or I may have to give up on this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost writer: James Patterson","review":"I found nothing in this book that would let me believe James Patterson wrote any of it. The story line is trite. The characters are flat, predictable and boring. For example, there is a chinese mother/daughter with the chinese mother trying to match (for marriage) the daughter with every available 'single' doctor, with the doctor protesting her \\"wonderful\\" old country mom. All the chapters are 2 to 3 pages in length - making it perfect to read in the loo. Many of the chapters say nothing except that the women are scared, or tearful, or worried, or ...James Patterson should stop lending his name to books by every mystery writer that asks. I will no longer buy these books. His name only adds to the price - and they are expensive. If you want to read something by the co-author, find something where the co-author's name is the only one on the cover. Books co-authored with Patterson have come to mean poorly written and very expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 5th Horseman","review":"The book moves along at the usual Patterson fast pace, but it was disappointing at the end. The ending lacked surprise, thrill and tension that hallmark many of his previous novels. Throughout the story there was a general lack of pizzaz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I simply can't understand anyone giving this book FIVE stars!! It had three different crime plots and none of them were explained to me WHY the killer did it!!!! I thought I was reading three different books. Mr. Patterson is not being fair to his readers. I have purchased nearly every Patterson novel. I will not purchase anymore of the womens murder club series - frankly I think they are too \\"hoakey\\" or perhaps I am too mature."},{"rating":"1","title":"PU","review":"He's churning them out way too fast. This one has high school dialog, is loaded with cliches, and has a plot that has been done a thousand times before. I'm sticking with the Alex Cross series and checking my pre-publication orders to make sure that nothing else coming this year from the Women's Murder Club"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I felt the story was very unrealistic, especially when it comes to the medical part. A hospital would have launched some formal investigation on these suspicious deaths. Nobody is admitted with broken bones unless some severe trauma and I have never heard of a Chemo drug \\"accidently\\" given instead of a percocet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 5th Horseman","review":"It is difficult for me to review this product because on the last disk I was unable to hear the end of the book because of damage to the CD - The packaging holding the CD's was smashed down a bit when I received it but I did not notice until I listened to the last CD that there was an impression on it from the CD next to it in the package that messed up the disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripping over clichés and mistakes at every turn.","review":"I anticipated another great Patterson story on audiobook as I popped the CDs into the car changer. It only took the first CD to tell something was wrong. What a disappointing book. I almost didn't finish the book, but did finally finish listening with painful groans. My wife started listening to it with me, but ultimately abandoned listening before the end--it was too frustrating. The storyline is packed with fluff. The medical mischaracterizations and outright mistakes are criminal. I doubt James Patterson even read the entire manuscript before it went to the publisher. Otherwise he would have demanded corrections of multiple factual mistakes, would have seen to it that dead-end branchings of the storyline were complete and removed the fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and Disappointed","review":"I've been reading Patterson books for a while now and have found most of them pretty good and recommendable, but this one really falls short. I was expecting for the Lindsay and Joe story to expand a little more and was also looking forward to hearing more from my favorite character, Claire.There are 2 cases in this story and Patterson seemed to explain more about the less interesting one. And the ending? I just don't get. Another thing I didn't like about this book was that the title was awful. He just made a quick reference to it, just to get it out there. That was pretty funny actually.It was a quick read because the font was huge and the chapters start in the middle of the page. It really wasn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson is Back","review":"I know that I had a huge sigh of relief when I finished The 5th Horseman. Patterson is by far my favorite author, but his last couple of books have been so disappointing (I actually could not even finish The Lifeguard). I was to the point of thinking that I would never read him again, but luckily, thought twice about that and purchased this book. Patterson is definitely back with this latest novel! It is excellent story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book","review":"This wasn't the best of the series but still a good read. Of course it leaves you hanging #6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Bad Books in One!!","review":"This was essentially two books crammed into one with neither being fully developed or resolved. I gave this book two stars just because it was kind of interesting and held my attention to the end...where I was expecting the two stories to be tied together or somewhat related. That never happened. This was probably the worst James Patterson book I've read. Don't waste your money if you are expecting a complete book. You only get half of two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"5th Horseman - A Definate Read!!!","review":"I loved all the interaction with the characters in this book. I really found myself involved the moment I started reading it and then when I hit the middle it was like coasting downhill the rest of the way. The book was a quick read for me and I'm happy to say that again Mr. Patterson you didn't disappoint. The plot was great, the climatic ending was just in Patterson's style. I only had one question though when I was through with the book, what's going to happen with Lindsay and Joe??? Maybe I'll find out when I hop into the 6th book. I loved the edition of Yuki to the group. This is turning out to be a superb series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5th horseman","review":"This book was a bit worn but readable. I was happy to read it. And neither disappointed nor pleased on the books physical appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Sadly, this is a terrible amalgam of plastic characters, pathetic dialogue,and ridiculous science. \\"i'll kill her with this syringe of insulin!\\" impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 5","review":"i ordered the 5th horseman by james patterson from you.while the book was a really good read when i recieved the package in the mail it looked like it wasn't handled very well because there was one or two holes in the corners of the package and in the middle of the package there was a really worn spot that was almost tore up as well and the book was a little beat up when i pulled it out as well at the corners where their was holes in the package.i'm not upset or nothing cause i know people cant control how an item is handled once it is shipped out but just letting you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"Try another Patterson book but don't buy this one. The two plots are unrelated and end abruptly with some of the most unsatisfying conclusions I have ever encountered. The book contains a lot of filler with numerous chapters adding nothing to the plot. Do not buy this book. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"No depth","review":"Although I orinally liked Patterson and have read all or most of his books, he is now obviously writing for quick money. There is no depth or character development in this one. I have purchased my last Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glaring lack of medical knowledge","review":"I have enjoyed so many of his books, but I had a difficult time concentrating on the story line with so many mistakes regarding hospital protocol and medical practice. If he is going to write a book regarding medicine again, I would suggest he hire someone knowledgeable in the subject to review and edit before it goes to print. The glaring mistakes made the entire book unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder & Mayhem, M.D. Style","review":"Since so many others have outlined the general plot of this story (huge lawsuit against a hospital; suspicious deaths that may or may not have been committed by a doctor) I'll simply leave a brief comment. Although the story isn't all that complicated, it was still a quick, enjoyable read--and the ending was one I didn't see coming. Please be aware, though, that THE 5TH HORSEMAN is NOT an Alex Cross novel, which seemed to be one reviewer's complaint. This is the story of Lindsay Boxer, SFPD Lieutenant and her fellow Women's Murder Club friends. I found the story to be heartfelt and emotional, full of action-adventure, and, as I said, a very quick, satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"I have read most of James Patterson's works including all of the women's murder club books. I just couldn't finish this. Ever since Mr. Patterson's books have been put out in assembly line fashion they have been at best of journeyman quality. It is hard to believe that these later books were written (or supervised) by the same man who wrote the truly excellent early Alex Cross novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The pacing is uneven. I'm sorry to say that the reliance on co-authors to do so much of the work for Patterson is causing his books to suffer.Although I appreciate the use of San Francisco for the locale, the geographic inaccuracies are jarring. Frankly, the research is sloppy and I wonder if the co-authors have even been to San Francisco. Lindsay Boxer meets Yuko and Keiko in front of Union Square, but by no means is this \\"out by the Golden Gate Panhandle.\\" In another section, the Hotel Triton can't be fronting Union Square steps away from the cable car line and also be across the street from Chinatown. Sloppy, very sloppy. Reading this is like watching Dustin Hoffman drive on the Bay Bridge the wrong way in The Graduate on his way to Berkeley."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth in the Series is Just What You'd Expect","review":"As you might guess from the title, this is the fifth book in the Woman's Murder Club series. The legion of fans that have developed for this series will not be disappointed. I'm not going to divulge the story here, except to say that the deaths are mysterious, the people at the hospital are a mix of hard working professionals and administrators who care a lot more about their public image than they do the dead people, the court battles have their surprises.Great Literature, no. Will it be studied for three centuries like Shakespeare is, no.Is it a good way to spend an airplane ride or a rainy weekend. Absolutely."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 5th Horseman","review":"I bought the first five books in the Women's Murder Club series on sale after having heard good things about Patterson from other people, and knowing that it was now a television series (that I have not seen). What a colossal disappointment! It seemed to be pretty much just an outline. The characters have no depth and I couldn't really drum up much interest in any of them; the plots were simplistic and not fleshed out, and the writing was the laziest excuse for prose I've seen lately. I read every book, hoping for improvement but was let down each time. Churning this junk out one after another must be the ideal source of quick income! Suffice it to say, I won't be reading or recommending number 6!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5th Horseman review","review":"This book was an excellent read. I read it in two days. It kept your attention and was a real page turner. Excellently written. Made you care about the characters and what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast-Paced, With a Twist","review":"Fast-paced, fast-read, there are actually 2-1/2 mysteries with unexpected endings. A book to bring on the plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"I believe that James Patterson, with his reputation, could write directions in Chinese on how to use a can opener and it would most likely be a bestseller. I believe that because this book, as horrible as it is, is #5 on the New York Times Bestseller List as of the date I write this review. Unbelievable!THE 5TH HORSEMAN is truly one of the most pitiful excuses of writing I've ever read. This is a book for people who do not want to take any chances with the books they read, or challenge themselves in any way. As far as the story itself, it actually could have been interesting had there been any more thought or detail put into it. Unfortunately, those one page chapters seemed to interrupt the flow a bit.I can't recommend this book at all, and I'll be reluctant to read any future books by this author and his associates."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy story and crummy character development","review":"Terrible story. I really wish I could get my time and money back. There are two crimes that need solving at the same time...turns out they are totally unrelated. Seems like the two crimes were written in the same book just to fill pages. The ending of the first crime happened so quick and uninterestingly. The crime with Dr. Garza was so predictable but yet it was so poorly explained. Ultimately the \\"major\\" crime is solved with absolutely ZERO detail. The police just \\"get\\" the bad guy...the end. Its the sloppiest and most incomplete ending I can ever remember reading. The book is not worth your time or money. If you do read it...I predict you'll be disappointed with the whole story, especially the ending. But once it ends you'll just be glad its over and you can move on to a new author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bad Book with Patterson's name on it!","review":"This is another example of misleading book titling. A simple comparison of writing style, composition and grammar shows that Patterson either did not write this book, or has become an early case of senile dementia.Putting his name on the cover is misleading, and this book would get NO stars if that were an option!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Book","review":"I made myself finish this book-as punishment. Bad writing, one-dimensional characters, chapters that are about 23 words long. Never again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 5th Horseman","review":"If you have read books 1 through 4, then you'll love The 5th Horseman. It's filled with suspense. It was definitely an excellent book to read. The ADA, Yuki, you definitely see a lot out of her in this book. So if you liked 1st to Die, 2nd Chance, 3rd Degree, and 4th of July then you'll definitely would love The 5th Horseman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 5th Horseman","review":"As with all of Patterson\`s books he kept you on the edge of your seat till the end . Wonderful"},{"rating":"1","title":"5th Horseman","review":"I have read many James Patterson books and started to get involved with the Women's Murder Club series. I read 1-4 and was excited to get to the 5th. I was extremely disappointed as this one moved much too fast and had an extremely terrible ending. It left me with a huge question mark as to how the murderer was found. There was nothing in the whole book that I could remember (and being a kindle edition was hard to go back)that indicated there was anyone else involved.I think he should slow down and think about what he is writing and look at the reader's side for interpretation. I will now go and read other authors for a while since the Women's Murder Club books have lost their appeal for me at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"5th Horseman","review":"Once again a great read from James Patterson. I could not put the book down waiting to find out who done it. I like the short chapters it helps me stop if I need to. The one thing I will say and this is why I did not give it 5 stars. The ending is terrible it just ends. All that build up to who done it and it just ends. I hope when I get to book 6 it will pick up where this one just ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"books","review":"this book was only in fair condition but is very good and i am half way through this book. this has been the best series i've read in a long time. so glad my son got me started on book one."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I want to say a few things about this book. First off Patterson needs to stop writing with Maxine Paetro. They are terrible together. This book was as bad as his last one he wrote with her. The book jumps around and there never really is character development. So in closing I thought the book sucked. Hopefully he will write the next one by himself or with someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Patterson","review":"Again the author kept you guessing right to the end. Can't wait to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleah!","review":"This is the last Patterson (+co-authors) that I will read. It is very sexist - refering to female characters in demeaning language - as well as racist. The story could have been interesting but the writing is so poor that it detracts from the plot which never does get developed well. I listened to a library audio version and found the reader to be simply awful. Most ten-year-old children can read better. Her performance is an additional distraction to the book's weaknesses. I guess those guys belong together."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found disappointment in a book that I wanted to love...","review":"I found disappointment in this book. I've loved all of the other 4 installments of the Women's Murder Club, but this one was flat. I found myself not really caring about the story line. It was all over the place and didn't really interest me. I think that part of what made the other books so good was that you cared about the characters and the friendships that each one had with the other. There is very little in this book that resembles the other 4. The end seems rushed as well, as if it could have been another 100 pages long, but the author decided that it was long enough and needed to end the story.It took me 3 months to read this book, while the others only took about 4 days. I hope that this is not a trend in James Patterson's books. I've enjoyed most others that I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner","review":"I'm not sure what it is about these books that grab me, but they do. I normally don't like books in the \\"suspense\\" genre but I pick one of these up and can't put it down until I'm finished. Fortunately, they are quick reads. It isn't great writing; the plots all have some holes in them. But the characters and the quick pace have captured me repeatedly. This time there are 2 unrelated sets of murders going on - both grabbed my interest and I almost become Lindsay while I am immersed in the book. Start with #1 if you haven't read that yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used Book Order","review":"Book was ordered as used and was delivered to me in a timely matter and in excellent condition.

On page 9 Union Square is moved out to the Golden Gate Panhandle and it only gets worse from there. At least find out where the major landmarks are. And just for future reference of the great researchers San Francisco doesn't have Hellmanns it has Best Foods. James Patterson should be ashamed to have his name on this book and the publisher should be embarressed. I never did figure out what it had to do with a \\"women's murder club\\" or whatever. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 'Club' makes a comeback!","review":"After a couple of less-than spectacular entries in this series, 'The 5th Horseman' marks a return to the more suspenseful tone of the earlier books. The plot, with its possible connection between big-city hospital corruption and a series of apparent mercy killings, will definitely keep readers guessing!The ladies of the 'club' have a few more personal conflicts than usual, which adds a few wrinkles to their friendship, and breathes a bit of fresh air into the usual characterizations. Each one has a significant role to play, in contrast to the last two books which focused more on Lindsay.This is a good jumping-on point for those who are new to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a terrific and fun ride with the ladies!","review":"Another super mystery with the Women's Murder Club. I listened to this book on tape and fully enjoyed it. I simply adore all the female characters and unlike so many authors, Patterson writes great women characters.

Then there was the time when she had to cut her way out when trapped in a car by her seatbelt. Funny stuff and real human interest. If bizarre things can happen to the first lady of the land the can happen to anyone, can't they?

His writing style is smooth and keeps one hooked from the very first page. I was not crazy about the plot - though it was filled with twists and turns, some suspended belief to a degree. That's fine in crime fiction obviously - I just felt this one was a little TOO over the top. Still a great read nonetheless; if you like Box and the Pickett series, you won't go wrong here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best entry in this series","review":"This particular volume in the Joe Pickett saga was off the mark. It's the first book I've read by Mr. Box that I seriously considered not finishing. The pacing in the first half was slow and the story not all that interesting or likable. It wasn't until page 222 in the hardback edition that things started to pick up and even then the action was just layered over a convoluted and gory mess of a story that just never came together very well. What's sad to me is that this book had an interesting premise. I'm glad that Trophy Hunt is not representative of Mr. Box's talents because if this had been the first book of his that I'd ever read I have wound up missing out on a fantastic author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Pickett is very believable","review":"I can easily imagine what is being described in the scenery and the views that Joe has while doing his required work as a Ranger (game warden). I also like that he takes it upon himself to pursue justice. He manages to outsmart his \\"betters\\" with use of his Ranger (game warden) skills. Likable and totally believable novels by this author, C. J. Box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trophy Hunt","review":"I truly like the Pickett family and their interaction with local folks. Nate for me however is a stretch and seems to be made for TV. In this book, Nate's connection with the bear lacks depth and goes beyond the limit of the \\"suspension of disbelief\\". In some ways, Nate goes beyond the boundary set by Tomlinson, the funky, hippy, baseball playing, sidekick of Doc Ford in the Randy Wayne White mysteries. And the bear, falls well short of Shardik, the mystical bear, in Richard Adams second novel. I have read them in order thus far on my Kindle (thanks for having a Kindle edition) and will read on because I like the writing. Where can a reader find a protagonist of integrity, a husband and wife that love one another, children that are properly peculiar, and a pain-in-the-neck mother-in-law - where - in a C.J. Box novel. Buy one - just not this one. Hope the next book returns to the simple rules of its predecessors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting fourth installment in the Joe Pickett series!","review":"CJ Box's fourth book in the \\"Joe Pickett\\" series is an exciting and suspenseful work, perhaps the best of the series so far. Throughout the book, the suspense builds slowly but steadily around two mysterious murders and several strange cattle mutilations(so much so that I, as a reader, was feeling on edge and felt like I was there in the small town of Saddlestring, Wyoming, experiencing what was happening and wondering what would occur next) and then comes together in a complex yet fascinating way. This book is excellently crafted and offers a great continuation in the Joe Pickett series to those who have read Box's other books. If you are new to this series, I have no doubt that this book will get you hooked. I am hopeful that there are many more installments to come in this great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trophy Silliness","review":"I was extremely disappointed by the last Pickett novel and hoped this one would return to the quality of the first two. The book opens with an intriguing mystery-the inexplicable mutilation of wild animals-followed by two horrific murders. Joe Pickett has found his moral compass again. The portraits of Joe and his family are superb. The first half of the book is a page turner. Then, the resolution.... The villains were ridiculous, the solution of the murders was extraordinarily contrived. High hopes for this outing--not fullfilled. I'll pass on Pickett five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to run for sheriff","review":"Another great story rewards the reader of this Wyoming mystery.

Colleen Sexton is an incredible Lucy. I am a huge Christiane Noll fan and was initally disapointed that she wasn't on the DVD, but the woman playing Lisa...er I mean Emma does a fantastic job. If you only get it to see them perform \\"In His Eyes\\", it would be worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity the rest of the cast","review":"The cast (except for David Hasselhoff) was superb. And the filming of the musical is the best I've seen for a live production. Especially memorable were the songs, \\"In His Eyes\\", \\"A New Life\\", and \\"When This All Began\\". But Mr. Hasselhoff, for all of his 'star quality' was a profound disappointment. \\"This is the Moment\\" should be a show-stopper, but his performance in this great musical scene was mediocre at best--really it was embarrassingly bad. Mr. Hassellhoff proved that he can neither sing nor act on the stage. What is it about producers of Broadway shows that induces them to cast 'stars' who can't sing? Also, I found the screening edition warning (Property of Goodtimes...), repeatedly displayed on the video, to be ridiculous. It truly damaged the video presentation. All in all, this video was a true disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not do justice to this musical","review":"I originally saw Jekyll & Hyde when it first was created here in Houston and have seen it live several times, before and after it went to Broadway and it is my all-time favorite musical, bar none.So, even though this production had none of the cast I had seen, I figured the musical was so awesome that it would be good regardless.Well, I was wrong. The songs I loved are there, but this cast doesn't begin to hold a candle to the ones I had seen live and David Hasselhoff is terrible. And the girl playing Lucy can't begin to hold a candle to Linda Eder, who I saw originally create the role. I could barely finish watching it.Don't waste your money. Instead buy the CD of the original cast and just imagine the visuals in your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can things get any slower than this?","review":"I loved the CD of this show - I should have stuck with that! This version of the show drags like someone is pulling it up hill and through mollases in February. If you like the music, skip this video and buy the CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"better with a real singer","review":"David Hasselhoff was not the right man for this role. I saw this musical with it original cast (wich was very very very very good) and a local playhouse performed this musical (which was also very good). David Hasselhoff can not sing at the broadway level. he can sing pop, but not broadway. He was not able to hit all the notes and left me a little dissipointed about the play. The other actors make up for it. His acting was differnt, I thought it was really good. I gave the video a 2 because of Hasselhoff's not so great singing ability in this role."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good chance missed","review":"I saw \\"Jekyll & Hyde\\" several times on Broadway with Linda Eder and Robert Cucciolli. Very enjoyable BUT it takes a fine actor who can pull off Jekyll / Hyde especially when he's having a \\"converstaion\\" with himself or, rather, the two personalities. Cucciolli was marvellous at this as well as being a fine singer. Hasselhoff has not one iota of talent so why he was filmed in this is beyond me. I recommend the show but not this travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This musical is one of my favorite of all time. The 2 female leads in the show are awesome. David Hasselhoff is the weakest link in the production. Still he does an ok job and the rest of the cast make up for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Musical","review":"When Jeckyl and Hyde was on Broadway in NYC, I went to NYC 8 times (from CT) to see it.I also have to confess that I cried when I heard the show was ending.This DVD is so terrific ! David Hasselhoff plays Jeckyl and Hyde and altho he can act, he can't sing.However, his performance doesn't detract from the overall DVD experience.I LOVE the story, the music, the special effects and the superb acting...Try it....you won't be disappointed.Just another ''Jekky''"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary, but not in a good way...","review":"I will always have a warm spot in my heart for David Hasselhoff, who has provided me with ten priceless, hilarious minutes as he bellows his way through \\"This is the Moment\\" and transforms himself into the leering, jabbering Edward Hyde. It's to Mr. Hasselhoff's credit that he is at least trying (all actors should stretch themselves now and then), but he truly has no business being either on stage, or in a musical. The producers should know better. As for the show itself, my God it's dour and humorless. Even \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" which is about a barber who kills people and his mistress who bakes them into meat pies, is a funny, witty show. But that's a Sondheim musical. This is a Leslie Bricusse/Frank Wildhorn one. Enough said. Call me a snob, but folks, quality is quality. And this just ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me Sebastian Bach!","review":"David Hasselhoff.... Oh my god... Could they have picked someone LESS talented to play Jekyll & Hyde?? David, your resume did not benefit from your performance.. ugh.. Someone I would have liked to see in this filmed version of the show would have been Sebastian Bach, a rocker from the early 90's, who took on the role on Broadway back in 1998 or so, and who, I've heard, did an amazing job. I love the entire cast featured on the Broadway cast version of the CD, mainly Linda Eder, who I love, but for something a bit different, instead of hearing Broadway trained actors playing Jekyll & Hyde (such as Anthony Warlow, Chuck Wagner and Bob Cuccioli), it would have been nice to hear someone who could really hit those high notes with some attitude! Anyway, just to warn those of you who are planning on purchasing this joke of a DVD, beware. You'd be better off renting it if anything else, and even then, you'll know why I'm giving it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Hasselhoff is LOUSY","review":"I can't believe anyone would defend the \\"singing\\" and \\"acting\\" ability of David Hasselhoff. Jekyll/Hyde is a very demanding role, one which can make or break a show. Well, this poor show was definitely broken by Mr. Hasselhoff. It's such a shame because the rest of the cast is good, but Mr. Hasselhoff's presence just ruins this show. He is so cheesy that he actually made me laugh. I've had the pre-Broadway concept CD for several years and saw the touring show with Linda Eder and Robert Cuccioli. I was looking forward to seeing this DVD, but was sorely disappointed. Do yourself a favor, buy one of the CDs with the money you'd waste on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad. Hasselhoff ruins the whole show!","review":"I've had the original Warlow/Eder CD's for some time and was thrilled when I found out I'd finally be able to see the show. It was horrible. I returned it immediately and am trying to forget I ever saw it. Hasselhoff is no match for Warlow. He's not even competent. He can't sing, and isn't even trying to act. If you're a fan of Hasselhoff, you \\"might\\" like it, but if you're a fan of \\"Jekyll & Hyde,\\" stay away!! This DVD will only upset you."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD","review":"I've seen this show 3 times on the big screen as it toured the UK and I have to say that I could find no fault with it. The casting is superb - particularly Coleen Sexton (Lucy). She plays this emotive part with conviction and as well as being utterly gorgeous, her singing is completely entrancing!Buy This Vid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Any one who thinks this is good obviously did not hear the original broadway cast production. This was originally made for Linda Eder and her extraordinaryvoice. And lest we forget, Robert Cuccioli was nominated for a tony for hisportrayal of Jeckyl/Hyde and a voice that is so beautiful and rich that thehairs on my arm stand up everytime I hear it! Who, in their right mind couldever think that Hasselhof should ever have been allowed to ruin this greatproduction. My apologies to the rest of the cast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have stuck with baywatch","review":"David Hasselhoff has had no formal voice training and it shows in this production. He has no control, especially when it comes to virbratto. And to add to his lack of talent was a weak story with undeveloped characters. When some of these characters are killed, you feel nothing for them, because there seems to be no reason for them to exist in the first place. The film version seems chopped up. The music does not match the music on the soundtrack. If you were to buy this film for one song imparticular, \\"Bring On The Men,\\" you will be disappointed. It is not in this feature, and has been replaced by a rather horrible song, one which changes the personality of the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, bad example","review":"I'm a huge musical fan and I must say that Jekyll and Hyde is absolutely one of my favorite shows.Before seeing Mr. Hasselhoff's version of the film I had seen Sebastian Bach live in the role of Jekyll and had also listened to Robert Cuccioli (my personal favorite) in the soundtrack extensively, and I have to say that of the three most famous men to play the role, Hasselhoff is not exactly my favorite.He simply does not do as well as the leading man of a Broadway show should. His vocals are mediocre at best, and pale in comparison to Bach and Cuccioli.His performance, however, is not to say by any means that this show or this film in specific is bad. It is not. The score is absolutely golden, and George Merrit (Utterson) and Coleen Sexton (Lucy) are superb. This show is truly awesome, but it is simply not the best example of the show I can name--it is just the only one on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my new favorites","review":"I absolutly love this play. I've always been into musicals and I first saw this on HBO, and couldn't believe that David Hasselhoff was the star. But i was plesently suprised at his talents. His may not be the best singer to play this role but his acting is admirable. I also have a new favorite vocalist becuase of this show. The woman that plays Lucy Harris is unbelivably talented, I am suprised not to see more of her. Her voice is incredible. I suggest anyone that likes history, musicals, talent, unforgettable songs, and a passionate struggle to watch this play."},{"rating":"1","title":"great show but badly cast for video","review":"Having seen J&H 4 times on Broadway I was looking forward to having it on video to watch when I pleased. However, the joy quickly turned to disappointment with the cast that was used for the video/telecast. Robert Cuccioli and Linda Eder were - in a word - superb. Ms Eder has the voice and presence the video lacks. Cuccioli is a splendid actor whose transformation of Jekyll to Hyde was thrilling and far beyond the ability of Mr. Baywatch. Cuccioli, with use of body language and voice, makes two different characters believeable. His dialog between Jekyll and Hyde near the end was remarkable. Not so the video.Stick with the Broadway recording and let's HOPE someone has the sense to film it with Eder and Cuccioli."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Hasselhoff belongs on the beach","review":"I bought this DVD from a friend who coudn't stand it, but I thought I'd give it a try. I'm a big fan of musicals and was excited to see a production of Jekyll and Hyde, Hasselhoff not withstanding. Unfortunatly he dosen't come close to meeting the vocal and acting challenges the dual roles require, and in the most intense scenes only succeeds in looking (and sounding) comical. Hasselhoff only looks more untalented next to the superb cast, namely Andrea Rivette and Collen Sexton. Buy it only if you're a big fan of musicals, or are willing to pay to see two brilliant performances diminished by a big name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I admit to not being a David Hasselhoff fan but I bought this video of Jekyll & Hyde because I love the show and figured if he got the part on Broadway, he must not be as untalented a singer as I thought. I am sad to say that this video was awful. I cannot imagine how David Hasselhoff got this part anywhere much less Broadway. I do not mean to be cruel to him, but he just cannot sing and his acting was a close second. I could bearly sit through the entire video because I was actually so embarrassed for him. I think the \\"live\\" audience was either his fan club or friends and family. The most intense parts of the show were too forced on his part. It was if he made certain he could sing just as loud at the intense parts of songs as past performers but his voice just does not have the quality of the others. As I said, I do not mean to be mean to him, but I would really advise you not to buy this video unless you really like David Hasselhoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the CD.....","review":"While the video and sound quality of this DVD is excellent, the acting and vocal talents of David Hasselhoff really make this one DVD worth not wasting your money on. I've known this show for years. I saw it pre-Broadway when the story and score were different and again on Broadway pre-Hasselhoff. This show can be SO much better.....buy with caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who invited David H. to sing?","review":"I agree with Michael P. Nolan comments but the music.I think the music score is great. The production sucks. David H should stay with cars and the beaches. He destroyed the songs. People, who gave 5 stars probably did not see the original cast on Broadway or didn't hear the CD. I saw 15 minutes on HBO and switched to Disney channel. I would not even spend $3 to rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Where Oh Where Are the Voices","review":"Jekyll and Hyde is Frank Wildhorn's greates creation. I wasn't fortunate enough to see this play on Broadway but I have heard the soundtrack and was blown away. Not only was the music amazing, the story, the songs, and the voices! Where is Linda Eder? Not that Coleen Sexton did a horrible job as Lucy but the role was written especially for Ms. Eder, it only seems right that she should sing the part on the movie. Am I wrong?And then there is David Hasslehoff. I bieleve thats all I have to say on that matter. With all the amazing voices in Broadway (i.e. Colm Wilkinson and Michael Crawford) they choose David Hasslehoff! What were they thinking? Bottom line people, its a great story with great music, but by the soundtrack and use your imaginations.And for those of you who think I'm being harsh, buy the movie after you've heard Colm Wilkinson, Linda Eder, and Christine Noll. I all but guarentee that you'll agree with every word I just said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Stop the Madness","review":"I was very surprised to see that so many people enjoyed this version of Jekyll & Hyde, though I might ask why. David Hasselhoff is understandable (who gives this guy the idea that he can sing?) but the rest of this cast wasn't much better. Coleen Sexton's voice is extremely whiney and at times she looks like she's struggling to hit the high notes. Linda Eder did a much better job than she did and the role of Lucy is an alto role, not a soprano role. Andrea Rivette, I also didn't like much, she sounded like she was singing through her nose and her wig is just awful. Is Emma Always doomed to have terrible hair? On the plus side, she's better than Sexton. The rest of the cast isn't that great except for George Merritt and Barrie Ingham, they were just outstanding. If you want to hear them sing, buy the cd version of this where you'll hear much better singing and no Hasselhoff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hasselhoff isn't the star...","review":"While David Hasselhoff may be the marquis value of this item, the true star he is not. The supporting players outshine him with wonderful performances, and astonishing vocals. Andrea Rivette is my personal favorite in this production, followed by the amazingly capable George Merritt who play Emma Carew, Jekyll's fiancée, and best friend, respectively.While Jekyll & Hyde has never been one of my favorite Broadway productions, the producers of the DVD have done a beautiful job transferring a stage show to a very limiting television screen. While there are some campy shots that are just laughable, for the most part, they have captured wonderful angles, and crystal sound quality. Even those who hated the original stage production might enjoy this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never been so horrified!!!","review":"I think it to be a most incredible CRIME that David \\"Hasselputz\\" was actually allowed onstage to completely destroy this amazing musical sensation.I felt an insuperable amount of sympathy for the talented actors on stage that had to work with him. I'm absolutely sure that these other actors were quietly biting their own tongues not to completely lose control of their own performance on stage.If you want to listen to a talented actor sing this role, look to Anthony Warlow in the concept album. This is shear brilliance and beauty in a rare male broadway voice. (though Anthony's voice shows clear operatic training)Buy the concept album but DON'T, for you own health, but this DVD. It's far too painful!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!!","review":"Seeing Cuccioli, Eder and Noll on Broadway took my breath away. Curiosity got the best of me and I PURCHASED Jekyll and Hyde....and then watched it. I am now ... poorer and wasted 2 plus hours of my life. The female co-leads were very good. Whoever decided to cast Hasselhoff, instead of begging Warlow or Cuccioli to step in should be fired. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but Hasselhoff killed this show. At least for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good example of the dangers of casting big names...","review":"Okay, so I admit I'd never heard of David Hasselhoff, but given the huge play he got (ie, name above the title), I knew he was supposed to be a big name, so I worried about how he would fair in a fairly vocally challenging role. I was right to have worried.Whoever cast him should be forced to listen to him trying to sing \\"This is the moment,\\" which USED to be one of my favorite songs.Oh, and the supporting cast is adequate if uninspired, the costuming is trite and boring, the camera work is tired, and I still like the original music better, you know, before they cut \\"Bring on the men.\\" It might not have added anything to the story line, but it was a good song!Rent it if you must, but don't buy it. Send your money instead to my new favorite charity: Voice lessons for washed-up stars who want to be on Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHHH!!!","review":"jekyll and hyde isn't the greatest broadway show of all time, and sometimes gets consumed in its own weepy ballads. however, in saying this, i am happy to acknowledge that when done by a terrific cast, the musical truly becomes something above average and fairly decent. i'm talking from the experience of listening to bob cuccioli and linda eder: two terrific singers, especially the former. these are the kinds of people we need on the broadway stage: singers and actors of unbelievable power.but we got stuck with david hasselhoff. oh.my.god. i do believe other reviewers have put it better. robert cuccioli, for instance, pulled this show UP with is gorgeous voice. mr. h. pulls it down, and it becomes CRAP.save yourself.write a letter to frank wildhorn and ask him to film a version with cuccioli and eder, or even warlow and eder. and then proceed to kick hasselhoff in the nads for ruining an already shaky show."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was too painful to watch. Don't!!!","review":"Simply put, I couldn't finish watching this horror of a production. None of the acting (especially that moron Hasselhoff), none of the singing (of particular note, the poor child who had to follow the amazing voice that belongs to Linda Eder), nothing could compare with the Broadway production and it was just awful. Thankfully, I was watching it for free on TV. If I had actually spent money buying this movie, I would have found a way, anyway to return it and get my money back. Words cannot describe how terrible this was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few big flaws, but still good","review":"Let me start by stating the two big flaws with this video. #1 David Hasselhoff. As Jekyll he's terrible. His acting is pathetic and he tends to worbble while holding notes. #2 This is the inferior Broadway production. Why they chose to film this production I'll never know. It's a badly butchard version of J&H. They should have filmed the US Tour. If you've never seen the tour though, you won't miss anything with this videoNow here's the good. Hasselhoff's Hyde is actually very good. He looks truely insane and sings certain parts in really different, really cool ways. The rest of the cast is brilliant. I don't think they could have casted them better if they tried. The camera work is also very good.All in all this is a good video with a few problems that can be tolerated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst show ever?","review":"Heralding the oncoming death of artistic creation, Frank Wildhorn's three note melodies retain their power to shatter glass even in digital transfer. Everybody who was planning on kidnapping Andrew Lloyd Webber to prevent further atrocities against the human race can put a new number in their collective rolodex. To all who wish to purchase Jekyll & Hyde on DVD, a piece of advice: send me the money, and drink bleach instead (it's more entertaining)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why David Hasselhoff???","review":"To bad that they chose to record David Hasselhoff in this production. After seeing the show on Broadway and in a touring production, I couldn't wait to get this recording. It's hard to believe but he single handedly ruined the entire production. His comments about coming a long way from a talking car to Jekyll & Hyde weren't exavtly true. KITT could have done a much better job!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad production of a great show","review":"Having been fortunate enough to have seen the original cast on Broadway, this disc is fairly pathetic by comparison. It captures none of the excitement of the show and makes one constantly hit the fast forward button on the remote. David Hasselhoff's acting and singing talent is a far cry from Robert Cuccioli and Andrea Rivette is definitely NOT Linda Eder. Side by side comparisons of the music of the original cast recordings and the performances on this disc makes this rendition seem more like a badly done high school play than a Broadway hit captured for posterity. Too bad because when performed by the talented, it is an amazing 135 minutes of theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunt casting","review":"I won't go through a long treatise on the shortcomings of this version - other reviewers have done that quite well. I saw the show on tour, and was blown away. The lead on the tour was an actor named Chuck Wagner, who has a HUGE baritone voice.You can sample and buy his version of \\"This is the Moment\\" and several other songs from the show here:Chuck Wagner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Some of the voices in this production are wonderful; Hasselhoff's, unfortunately, is shaky and thin. But what really disappointed me was the insipidity of the words, melodies, and staging. This musical does not begin to compare with other Broadway shows. I'd rather watch Les Mis again and love it than wince through another viewing of Jekyll."},{"rating":"1","title":"good show. bad actor","review":"I really like the show and music....when done with actual musical theater actors. Putting Hoff in just to add a better known name was just a hail Mary to try to keep the show on Broadway. I saw it in 2000 on Broadway. DVD should have been made with less popular names who were much better singers and actors than Hoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be better to wait but...","review":"I was fortunate enough to see the Original Broadway Cast on Broadway with the exception of Robert Cuccioli. I saw his understudy but have a really hard time believing Cuccioli was better than his understudy. It was an absolutely amazing performance. The reason I saw his understudy was that his understudy did all matinee performances because the role of Jekyll/Hyde was so demanding on the voice. The role requires a big voice and I don't think Hasselhoff had it. I don't think he destroyed the role. I just saw better. This is the only reason I give this a four out of five, instead of five out of five. They are planning to make a feature movie from Frank Wilhelm's Jekyll & Hyde so it might be worthwhile waiting. Unfortunately, there is no timeline on when this project might be finished. They still haven't held auditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh....","review":"First I'm going to say I never saw or heard this musical before I saw it on DVD. I bought it because I've heard good things about the musical. BIG MISTAKE!!! I thought the music was good in most parts, but David Hasselhoff is just terrible. I can't believe that they cast him in the musical. Let alone make the video with him in it. It's the first time some people (like me) will hear it or see it.I'm not that sorry I own it, though, for two reasons: Coleen Sexton and Andrea Rivette. They have have amazing voices. Too bad that David has to come in and ruin most of their songs. The only two songs in here without him that are worth listening to are \\"In His Eyes\\" and \\"A New Life.\\" Although now I like a lot of other songs from the musical, these are the only two I can stand on the DVD. Final note, those two actresses almost make up for the price of the DVD, but David Hasselhoff will gain no fans for the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Hasselhoff... blargh.","review":"I love this musical. For seven months I did nothing but eat sleep and drink this musical. I performed in the role as Sir Archibald Proops on stage. This is quite possibly my favorite musical of all time. However, that nearly changed when, at the cast party, someone popped in the DVD. David Hasselhoff was horrendous as the title character... Really watching this movie and watching his reactions were heartbreaking. For instance, \\"Dangerous Game\\" is traditionally a lust song, but more of a longing lust, not a \\"oh, I want to rape you\\" kind of lust. Hasselhoff turned it into rape. It was cold, unemotional, unfeeling. The Transformation scene was rediculous as well. When the drugs finally start to kick in with a vengance, he spasmodically dances around the stage, only to finish it with a Baywatch-esque swim across the glossy floors... I did buy it, though. It wasn't for me to sit there and watch and enjoy it as a musical. Oh, no.

This recording is worth something for the other actors and the technical aspects, but don't watch it and then believe you have seen a true performance of Jekyll and Hyde. Buy either the Concept Album or the Original Broadway Cast Album and hear what this show should really sound like. Even if I did not appreciate Hasselhoff's performances in Knight Rider and Baywatch, I could at least respect them. This was inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined, I say, Ruined!","review":"I bought the Jekyll and Hyde CD long before I saw the show. The original cast was outstanding, and I saw it two more times on Broadway. I also saw it on tour with Chuck Wagner in the lead role. It's not the best Broadway show ever, but it is good entertainment.But there's just no escaping the damage David Hasselhoff does to this piece of theater. He's horrid. Oh, his voice is passable, but his Jekyll never quite manages to shake that dear-in-the-headlights-with-the-makeup-of-a-ventriloquist's-dummy look. And his Hyde looks like he's doing a deranged Marty Feldman impersonation. \\"This is the Moment\\" is stripped of any value as he rushes through the lyrics and walks as though there's a foreign object in his trousers.The rest of the cast is stellar, which is the only reason this production deserves any stars at all. It's worth watching in a \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" kind of way, but unless you're a BIG fan of Jekyll and Hyde, or of Baywatch, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why oh why did they choose this one to film?","review":"I saw this show on Broadway with Robert Cuccioli. I saw the pay-per-view version with David Hasselhoff. Two totally different shows. Hasselhoff is not equipped to carry off this role, although it seems that his bankroll is what brought him this far. Anyone who has seen this show with Cuccioli in the starring role knows that there is no comparison. Please tell me someone filmed the version with Robert Cuccioli and Linda Eder in the leading roles. It's perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"David is not the Star","review":"The movie is good, but they could have picked a better lead then David Hasselhoff. His singing is annoying and his acting is dull and boring. HIs co-stars outshine him by far. Coleen Sexton is my favorite performer in this show. True her voice isn't as good as Linda Eders but it is still strong and powerful and her acting is amazing. The rest of the cast is great but she really stood out to me. So get this if you want a good movie, but don't expect much from David because in my opinion he stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No day at the beach!","review":"Yeeesh. It's a good show, and the Lucy and Lisa are almost worth the effort it takes to sit through Hastlehoff's terrible performance. So, I'm not sure if it is a good thing that the Dolby 5.1 Soundtrack is very well mixed and impressive. I hate the fact that this DVD is not divided into tracks because it makes it harder to skip the Hastlehoff numbers. He is out of his element here... he makes no effort to create character for Henry Jekyll and his Mr. Hyde characterization stops at his hair and Spooooky voice. He is uncomfortable in his body, and this is the most labored performance I have seen since the Gary Condit interview with Connie Chung. If you've got the money, it is worth it just to get a sense of what this show could be with someone like Colm Wilkinson or Anthony Warlow in the part.

I do believe it is a legitimate one. If you do not think so, please defend that position.

They must have thought it important enough to answer it in a detailed way) I'm willing to wager that most \\"thoughtful\\" people, such as yourself, would agree, once you understand what the question actually is.

Of course if you can't even try to understand different thoughts of your own, your feelings won't be different of some reviews full of \\"ad homimem\\" arguments in this site.It's also interesting to check the many Barker's texts freely available on his site. His texts helped me very much in my hurting transition from modern Christianity to the freethought.In time: I'm agnostic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring","review":"Dan Baker's book is boring in everyway. All the arguements he uses to refute Christianity have been articulated better by better atheists and agnostics. Baker essentially misunderstands Christianity and is therefore a poor critic. What Baker needs is a library card so he can read what some truly thoughtful atheists have had to criticize in Christianity. This book will be a waste of time for deep-thinking atheists and a hindrance to amatures. His style is droning. He over-simplifies everything showing no apptitude for understanding the complexity of the issue. The general mood is of a teenage boy who revels in talking bad about his dad.

Humanism used to show more restraint and compassion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic refutation is just silly","review":"This book is full of refutation that is sophomoric at best.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Christian (I'm agnostic), but I think you should be fair in assessing Christian theism...Barker isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan studied theology and realized it was man-made doctrine","review":"A typical example of someone who stops believing because the evidence is simply a logical fallacy. Dan started to realize the Bible was nothing more than a fiction book. He does a splendid job in the contradictions chapter of noting how the God of the Bible is evil and good. Depending on what lesson the believer needs to reinforce. It's an excellent reference easily read for the intellectual skeptic who has decided to think for himself. He doesn't elude that God doesn't exist, the person who has conjured up God in their head has the burden of proof and Dan gives some simple contradictory scripture to show its fallible confusion. A positive step toward progressive thinking of humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Atheist. Book. EVER.","review":"Dan Barker manages to tell his amazing story of conversion from a preacher to atheist while simultaneously unravelling the myths behind Christianity and their god. Barker's work is interesting, and even funny at points. Chapter 19, \\"Dear Theologian\\", is the absolute best atheist work I have ever read. I personally can't see how anyone could still have the same belief in their god after reading this section. I do have one minor complaint about this book, however. Much of the material is rehashed. Many of the \\"chapters\\" were actually originally articles written for Freethought Today, a freethinking newsletter. If you had read all these articles, you may get bored with the regurgitated material. Overall, if you are a freethinker or thinking about becoming one, you must read this book.

Notice how the people who didn't like it can't offer any specific criticisms? That's because the arguments and evidence in this book are overwhelming for them that they're left to retreat, clinging to the bars of the cages to which they are so attached. Get over your fear already, people. There's no god. You're going to die. And that fact makes this life much more valuable then the vision presented by those who say, \\"Oh, without religion whatever will we do?\\" My answer: appreciate this life. Feel how valuable it is.

Well, after having devoured it, I'm sorry I didn't get it sooner.

I'm starting to read it my second time through now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Losing Faith in Faith","review":"I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it anyone.

He couldn't prove this nor name a philosopher who believes this. If logic is a function of the brain then two and two can equal five! And, Barker would have to believe this!

I did not. robert j. norrellOnce you get past all of Barker's egotistical ramblings about how brave he was in coming out and how he was rejected by \\"fundamentalists,\\" You come to the portion of the book where he addresses theistic argument. In 10 pages. George Smith's \\"Atheism: the Case against God\\" is upwards of three hundred pages and still doesn't deal adequatly with the subject. I particularly enjoyed Barker's \\"critique\\" of C. S. Lewis's \\"Mere Christianity,\\" where he completely missed the entire point of the moral argument.

Yet, he forgets that his own interpretations are JUST as useless and non-absolute too! Barker says Christians are no better off than atheist because they sin just as much as atheists do. We never said we were better than atheists. We're BETTER OFF (meaning, we'll be with our Father in heaven) than atheists but not better than atheists. Really, this book hardly challenged my faith at all. You should read what James Patrick Holding says about Barker.

Do you disagree with me? Maybe your brain is telling you that my criticism is wrong, but get this, I think that you're wrong if you think that I'm wrong, and since I think you're wrong, you really are wrong! Make sense? Probably, not. But don't blame me...that's Dan Barker for you. There was a time when Barker said that he would be happy to know if there was a god. Well, no matter how much evidence he's given, Barker will never believe. If God decided to write \\"Made by God\\" on every DNA in the world, Barker still wouldn't believe. Why? Because his worldview presupposes that order comes from disorder (namely, evolution); so, whatever seems like order and design ISN'T. Losing faith in faith? No, kidding!

Let me just say that Dan Barker does not know the Bible well at all. It's no wonder he is an atheist. For instance, in a debate he had with Michael Butler, he says that Jesus' views on slavery was not a \\"contextual thing.\\" Yet, later he admitted that it was contextual. Why would he contradict himself like that? It's because he's desperate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imperfect...not worth reading","review":"One of the worst critcisms of Christianity! This is high school stuff. Speaking of high school, Dan Barker is rather childish when it comes to the question of induction. He says he believes in induction, then he says he doesn't believe in induction, then he thinks the question of induction is not important. So, which one is it? He's scared about what the justification of induction entails...a Christian worldview! Anybody who debates him should bring up the question of induction because he doesn't know anything about it... and he knows it's important. Every philosopher and scientist in the world has to believe in it. Not believing in it is foolishness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Waste Your Money?","review":"Like I did. I bought a copy of this book before I saw his debate with Michael Butler. It seems that Dan Barker fell into every trap that Butler left for him. Barker constantly begged the question on issues of morality, made ad hominem arguments, and couldn't justify morality. You can pick up on all this fallacies in this book. What's most disturbing and troublesome is that he doesn't have \\"one hundred percent\\" confidence in induction. What kind of world does Barker live in?! You have to believe in induction. It's like telling me that oxygen doesn't exist, yet all the while you're breathing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book misses the mark.

There is more to Christianity than fundamentalism. Something much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Bible for yourself","review":"I just looked at the online version of this book...and it scared me. Mr. Barker's quotes from the Bible are really taken out of content and are representing the Bible in a very misleading. Please read the Bible for yourself. Forget what anybody has ever told you about it( weather it was a pastor, Jehova's witness, Mr. Barker, or even an angel from the sky). Bible has been the most controversial book in the history so it is much more worth reading than all the commentaries written on it. So read the Bible FOR YOURSELF and decide weather YOU believe that YESHUA ( Jesus ) is the messaiah, weather the Bible is the word of God, and weather you believe it or not. May God Bless you all (including Mr. Barker ) regardless of your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not threatening in the least","review":"Mr. Barker made a 180 degree turn in his beliefs. He went from being a preacher to being an atheist. He obviously never had any firm beliefs in the first place. I've read much more intelligent and thought-provoking books on both sides of the debate; this book is just disturbing. Does anyone really care to hear about this man's \\"deconversion\\"? Thousands of people fall out of Christianity-he says himself he can't stand the idea of a \\"judgmental\\" God- so what makes him so special? He wrote a book about it? So what? And he says the Bible invented sin. He seems to have a skewed view of things. His story is truly sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atheism Develops a Media Culture","review":"Lately, I have noticed the rise of the \\"tv evangelists\\" of free thought. When a Christian, Barker was involved in producing some of the most groan inducing versions of the mass marketed American version of \\"Christianity.\\" He has simply switched products. One cannot play his atheist music, for example, without fealing a bit guilty. His \\"Happy as can be. . . I am your neighborhood atheist\\" gives Shatner a run for his money for unintentional musical parody. Do yourself a favor listen to his music... and then consider: if his music is this bad (where you have some ability to judge and where his \\"credentials\\" are strongest), what does that suggest about his philosophy?Barker has little or no training in philosophy and then deals with what he has read in a juvenile manner. His story begs several questions. . . including personal motivations for leaving the faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do You Dare Face the Facts?","review":"The single, greatest book ever written about Atheism v.

There are many books on Christian apologetics, some by not-so-literate writers, and many which this book by Baker would sufficiently question and perplex. But honestly. Take a look at Kreeft's Handbook and you'll find Dan Barker is out of his league. The problem with him seems to be that he has personal issues (clearly shown by his bio) which prevent him from researching these questions to the intellectual limits."},{"rating":"1","title":"One question...","review":"Upon reading Barker's account of going from \\"Christian\\" preacher to avowed atheist, I honestly wonder if he was really a Christian in the first place. There is more to being a Christian than what you do with a chunk of your time. It's about whether you are in relationship with Christ. A Christian is who you are, not what you do. Barker seemed on the outside to be devoted to Christ, but in his heart it appeared more like he was going through the motions and \\"playing Christian.\\" I don't think that the book is really about Barker's conversion from Christian to atheist as much as it is about his choice to be open with the unbelief that was already there in the first place.So in terms of how we look at the book, it's not written from the perspective of an atheist that converted from Christianity, it's written from a perspective of an atheist who is a product of a lifetime of unbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan is Still Preaching,,,,albeit Dans word not God's","review":"As an ex-Atheist raised in a Christian home....I thought this book would be interesting, and useful in debate.

The truth is that this guy was the equivalent of a Pharisee: The religious who believe in their own rules and laws and thus try to force them on others. This is warping Christianity to its extreme because it is living a total lie. No wonder he hated it and turned away from it.Im not even going to comment on the rest of the book because it is solely prejudiced blasphemy against Christians and Christianity. Any man who could do so hates the Love of God. No other religion preaches this message and im certain he never did so from his heart when he was a 'preacher'."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are all wrong","review":"Both believers and non-believers that have read this book don't know what they are talking about. You all fight for your little opinions. Atheists don't want to believe because they would have to change their life and theists want to believe because it gives them assurance. Only a person that doesn't know reality becomes a believer/non-believer. Once you know reality belief is not needed. You don't know reality and so you become a believer or a non-believer, which is the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"Would that more sincere doubters and truthseekers would get their hands on works like this! Dan has been on both sides of the fence -- believer and atheist, and therefore, can speak with a certain authority that few can claim to have. I read this as a defecting minister myself. I found much of the information helpful.The book is segmented as a compiled series of articles on varying topics. Dan begins by telling his story and then moves into dealing with different themes throughout the book. The book is not exhaustive and not extremely indepth, and is arguably a little too personal in its style of presenting facts, but still easily makes the cut as an excellent work that should be read by anyone looking to examine atheism vs. Christianity or freethought.(JH)www.ministerturnsatheist.org"},{"rating":"2","title":"Occasionally simplistic, but overall very good","review":"Some of the reviewers complain that some of his arguments aren't very scholarly. And, I can agree somewhat. He touches on so many subjects, that he doesn't really delve deeply into any single one. But, I don't think his goal was to try to do a scholarly defense of each of his claims. He was trying to give an overview of many of the arguments against theism, too much depth would probably loose a lot of his intended audience.Sometimes, I found myself surprised that he acts as if he doesn't know how a theist would answer some of his challenges. Given the fact that he was a preacher for so long, this sometimes seemed strange. But, overall, I'd have to say that the strengths far outweight the negatives. So, 4 out of 5 stars is what I rate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't refute the evidence refute the author!","review":"This is an excellent anthology of an ex-Christian who has found the path to reality. Most of the critical reviews below appear to come from devout Christians who have not taken the time to even read this book. Barker has already answered most of their questions and arguments. His book takes the reader through the tortuous journey from Christian to Atheist. In spite of the ludicrous arguments from Christians claiming that anyone who deconverts was never a \\"real\\" Christian, Barker was a \\"real\\" Christian. He does a rather good job showing the fraudulent world of the supernatural pushers. His bottom line is - where is the evidence? His answer is - there is none."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite frankly, I was amazed by this book","review":"Losing Faith In Faith is a very fair, objective view of Christianity. Barker does not sit on a high stool and wave his finger and say, \\"Christianity is bad.\\" Rather, he says \\"I don't believe in Christianity and here is exactly why.\\" He takes what is in the Bible and critically evaluates what it actually says and how people interpret it. It is also is a humorous/sad account of how some (by NO MEANS all) Christians react to him when they find out he is an Atheist. The book fascinates me. I showed a friend of mine a three page excerpt of it and he immediately ordered a copy.One warning - read it with an open mind.

If there were any way to rate it less than one star, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I remember reading this book in 6th grade. I hated it. See that kids review up there? That pretty much summed up how I felt about it. It confused the hell out of me, that Park kid never stopped day dreaming. I didn't like Park as a character.I remember we all had to read books in groups. I saw Parks Quest and thought \\"Oh cool Vietnam!\\" I had this obsession with war book back then, and I just read this really cool journal about a solider who was in the Vietnam war.I also remember the back of the book being misleading. It seemed way cooler when I read the back. But its just all boring garbage. Terrible story. I regret reading this.Out of all the books this author has written I feel that this is her WORST.Want to read a cool book about Vietnam? Read The Journal of Patrick Seamus Flaherty. That was the journal I was talking about. It also gives you more of a real feeling about how the war actually was.Don't read about Park and his terribly boring quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeously written and deeply imagined work","review":"This novel is a pure pleasure to read -- among the most poignant and beautifully written books I've ever come across. From the very first few moments, reading the exquisite love letter that opens the novel, I was seduced. August Kleinman, the story's protagonist, is so powerfully and vividly imagined, so complicated and human, that he will linger with you for a lifetime. Though some might complain that the rich panorama of Kleinman's life ought to have been stretched out into a much longer novel, I don't agree. This gorgeous gem of a book, elegantly structured (brilliantly even), held me unerringly in its grasp. It would be very difficult to remain unmoved by this book's poignancy and beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant journey back into time","review":"Ethan Canin's 'Carry Me Across the Water' is one of the most sensitive novels I've read in a long time.From pre World WarII Japan, to a cave on a Pacific island, to modern day life in Boston and New York, and back to Japan in the present, Canin takes the reader on one man's journey to finally deliver a letter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read........","review":"Beautifully told.

Buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Help Spirituality Is Too Gung Ho","review":"Rabbi Dosick apparently believes that the way to help people become more spiritual is by using the self-help mode: do this exercise, think these thoughts, Know God Loves You, et cetera. Thoughtful analyses of the doubts that hinder all too many people from becoming spiritual won't be found in this gung-ho manifesto filled with trite one-sentence paragraphs. The book might work for someone who's already a believer and doesn't need much of a push to become more spiritual. But if you're troubled by questions about God's existence and purpose and you need well-thought-out answers, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops!","review":"We got Suddenly! for my three boys (ages 8,6, and 3) and they loved it.

This is a very well paced story which doesn't lag on detail and moves quickly (for a Victoria Holt book that is) Holt has an elegant writing style and no explict love scenes. She relies on good storylines and her characters are believable. Overall, I thought it was a great book and I don't want to post any spoilers but I'll just say I found the ending to be too intense.

While there was much amusing information, this seemed like a college thesis which had been rearranged into chapters and had a cover slapped on it. The Brits are known for dry humor, but this was simply dry. With so many references to hoaxers names (both those previously mentioned and those for which information was to come), it was extremely difficult to keep track of what any individual or group had done, let alone how these frequent references fit in with the current hoax under discussion.

ST:NF basically tells the stories of the USS Excalibur and its crew - and it's so good! The truth is that you need to read these four books together because they tell one story, they are not stand-alone.I love the characters, they are real heroes in the old sense of the word. The female characters are strong without being bitchy or arrogant. And the plot, I really like it. It would have been great to see the special effects on screen. But the best part? The dialogs!

As a picture reader, this book has icons for Curious George, the yellow hat, etc (about 16 total).

It is awesome, a definate reccomend. The only complaint i have is that the other sim games ran really fast on my computer, and this one takes about 5 minutes for the game to load into the neighborhood section. its ridiculous, but its worth the loading time.

You should definitely get this expansion pack if you want to get the most out of your Sims, but if you have a limited amount of money and want the best bang for your current buck I highly suggest getting Hot Date, Livin' Large or Vacation. However I must add that if you do get the others and plan on getting this one the expansions have to be installed in the correct order (Livin' Large, House Party, Hot Date, Vacation).Basically I'm saying it's a good game but if you're choosing which expansion you want go with this one last."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many options","review":"The Sims is a fun game, but it lacked that little something.

There are loads of extras too, like if you get a swinging party going Drew Carrey turns up to dance! And a ghost will appear when you tell a campfire story when you have a bit of charisma. There are loads of hidden \\"cheats\\" for the game too. Like if you explore your Sims files in your compter you can put your own .mp3 files into the radio stations folders and listen to your favorite music while playing the Sims! I suggest this for anyone who has thier favorite music .mp3 files on your computer (who hasn't?).

What is not planned ahead is the fact that he will be a high-schooler again.The interactions with teachers, fellow students, love interests, and his dorky cousin Patrick make this movie quality for the genre it belongs in.Good soundtrack and memorable quotes round out this lost flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"New DVD is 16:9 Enhanced","review":"The new Lionsgate Lost Collection DVD *IS* definitely 16:9 enhanced.

I Luv this flick!","review":"Sure I wasn't really old enough to see any of the great 80's flicks when they first were released but I've seen 'em all lately and 'Hiding Out' is BY FAR my fav! I was totally head over heels obsessed with Jon Cryer after seeing 'Pretty in Pink' but when I was convinced to watch the movie 'Hiding Out' on TBS, I instantly knew it was a GREAT one!!

What a great find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"It's a fairly lightweight sunglass, but you can't hardly tell from the picture that it's not a smooth wrap lens, which is what I thought it was. Instead it's a somewhat ugly lens which is creased in the middle, and it's striking to see when you get it. It takes away from the cool look it could have had if it was a bubble or wrap lens. It also puts uncomfortable pressure on the bridge of my nose, so that after a little while, just after a few minutes of wearing, causes my nose to feel like it has pressure points on it and stuffed up. I hate irritating feelings on and in my nose, so I don't plan on wearing this again. I ordered another pair of sunglasses for about $18 which I got today, and it has no rubber nose pads, just a cheap plastic thing, and I feel perfectly fine with them except I think I feel a slight residual pressure feeling from the bolle sunglasses I'm reviewing here from having worn them for hours, yesterday, but not yesterday night.

Don't buy, anything else it better than this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I hear?","review":"My doctor indicated to me that I have a hearing deficiency. He suggested headphones for amplifying sound. I purchased these after reading the reviews and I heard nothing, in fact my hearing was worse.

I pluged in the headphone, and I couldn't hear anything. The volume was around the 10-15 area, and the player only goes to 25. I could hear music on 20, but it was still too quiet. I put it on the highest volume, 25, and automatically I heard distortation. I was very unhappy with these headphones. They are just so quiet. Just save yourself the money and don't buy these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koss headphones","review":"The Koss headphones created a lot of attenuation to the input audio.

I've had 3 pairs of the exact same model. Same result in roughly the same timeframe. I am not hard on my headphones, unless you count 7 or so hours of daily use being hard on them. I don't crimp the cords, I don't even wrap them. Yes, they're cheap but the money adds up. Don't buy the KPH/6's."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay for price","review":"it is okay for the price of $5. It is comfortable and durable. However it is not that loud as other headphones and the sound is spread out. Anyone around you can hear it, which is okay at home. I sometimes hang it around my neck when I need to hear something and i can still hear it. The spread out sound can used in a good way if you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for the Price","review":"I recently bought these headphones as for a low cost replacement set for the office. Although they were very low priced at $5, I find them to be dissapointing all the way around. They feel brittle when adjusting, grab your hair, feel itchy and uncomfortable and the cord is very thin. The worst aspect is that the volume control only allows you to adjust it a small amount. So if you're on a PC you still have to use the computer to adjust or mute the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT KPH-6","review":"If you search on Amazon for the Koss KPH-6 headphones, these (KPH-5) model appear.They are essentially the same headphones, however, the KPH-6 model has an inline volume control.

Don't waste you money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was severely disappointed with the quality of this product. Whilst they worked these headphones were serviceable enough- sound quality was iffy, especially with rock or music that contained a heavy bass beat to it. At loud volumes an annoying buzzing sound could be heard in the background; just loud enough to be distracting. Also, the volume levels were poor, could not go nearly loud enough. So long as I had working headphones however, I was willing to ignore these problems.The real problems started after about two weeks of use. Completely unexpectedly, sound started to play only in one ear, then would switch back and forth at nearly every other syllable. This made the music almost impossible to decipher, no less enjoy! Sometimes the sound would even go quiet for several minutes, before switching back to working in only one ear. I do not intend to buy another electronic product with this brand name again, these were so disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Headsets","review":"I am very pleased w/ the product, though the mailing cost was however more than I anticipated!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stereo Headphones","review":"I bought this item for my son, who has Autism. He uses them for listening to his MP3 player or when on the computer. He is a little rough on them and I am happy to see that an extra set of the foam ear cushions are included.Sound quality is fair. If the sound quality was better I'd give it a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty amazing","review":"I was reserved when buying these. I saw their low price and was nervous to throw out money for low-grade headphones. However, this was not the case. The shipment arrived on-time, a day early actually, the packaging was strong and when I plugged them in, I was surprised. I'm a basshead and always have my equalizer set to Full Bass on my Mp3 player. The bass on these headphones was brilliant and completely blew me away. They were the cheapest headphones I ever bought (price-wise), but the best headphones I ever had. I'm actually buying another pair. The reason why I 4-starred the comfort was because when you wear them for more that three hours, your ears feel a bit squished and they look red as a cherry. But all in all, a beautiful product both price and sound-wise and I recommend them to anyone, including bassheads like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Batteries","review":"One of the batteries lasted less than a day.

As others stated it takes a few moments for them to \\"power up\\", but other than that they are fine. Anyone that said they don't last must be doing something wrong. On average they last the same 6-7 days that any other battery does. For the price even if they last a day less it is still a deal.Edit: I got a new pair of hearing aides that must use more power and these batteries were not usable. Many times my hearing aide would say the battery was low right after putting them in. Like I said it must have to do with the power output of these. I would recommend the power one batteries for new aides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major perfection","review":"The transaction was flawless and painless. Arrived much before expected. Zero charged for shipping. Everything about it makes me smile. Now about the batteries. The price is right and the batteries work as well as any I have had before. They do include a note in the package that advises to remove the yellow stickers 2-3 minutes before inserting into the hearing aids. Adding that this is true for all brands of batteries. A thing I had never known about before, an inconvenience to be sure but if it works, worth it in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries that last less than a day!","review":"The reason these batteries are so inexpensive is their lack of life.

Did not wear them until mid 2011. Left sole began delaminating from the shoe after 3-4 months of wear. Continued to use them and attempted to glue sole back with Shoe Goop(tm). Did not work. Finally gave up and sent an email asking if poor quality stitching problem had been resolved since I would like to buy another pair. I have owned at least 15 pairs since 1975 and all of them have failed after 3-4 years of extremely hard wear and never once has the sole come apart.

It reduced support and made the inside feel rough and not very comfortable. I wore them for a time over the summer and the sole on both has split in the mid point of the front. I had owned Topsiders from Sperry before and they lasted for years, dealing with salt water from my sailing and other activities.It will be a long time before I can be convinced to buy a Sperry product again.

I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old. They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft. Also, there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them. I've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent shoe.","review":"I am very picky when it comes to my shoes. I require both comfort and look when I consider shoes and will not sacrifice either. This shoe is easily the most comfortable boat shoe out there. I have tried on others and there is no comparison.

I did not try them on, and instead, returned it hassle-free and that went well. I chose a brown/brown replacement as it looked like my next best choice, but the size seems to run small.

I slipped these on for the first time and they're amazing. They look incredible and fit like a dream. I usually wear size 12 but I got an 11.5 and could have probably even went to 11 with these. As far as shipping goes. I ordered them on the 15th and estimate said I'd get them by the 19th-24th. Well before noon on the 18th, here they are.

The point he does make is his idea of creating 'leverage' by contacting your prospective buyer and at the same time contacting his boss, and his boss's boss - along with other 'leverage points.'

I mean, how many times was Dan going to say ADMIRINGLY to Melanie 'You're one tough cookie\\" after she's articulated another bad idea or after she'd indulged in her favourite pastime of incessant whining???The plot was terrible. Slice's narration was particulary awful. Mz Martinez should've stuck to inserting bits of spanish dialogue in order to break up the monotony and left off trying to write 'street'.

For someone who attended and graduated both Harvard and Standford Law Schools I expected the author to have a clue when it came to grammar.

I'm sure this is the killer's internal dialoge, but it would be nice to have sometype of prompting to that effect. Instead, the reader is plunge into writing that reminds me of reading \\"Incidence Reports\\" of D.O.C. juveniles!

However, as other reviewers have also said, the religious overtones in the book are a bit distracting, and some parts are completely pointless. For example, on the section of what foods to avoid he is talking about shellfish. Then, at the end of the section, he tells a story about how he turned on the TV one day and saw this minister talking about this little girl who had cancer and was dying, and was just sorry she couldn't support his cause (monetarily). Ok, it was a nice story but it had NOTHING, absolutely NOTHING to do with avoiding shellfish!! What the heck??So, overall I say avoid this book. There are plenty of books out there that are better and are more scientific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Very Careful","review":"Yes, this book contains some worthwhile information. The problem is knowing what is worthwhile and what is questionable. While he raises good points about fiber consumption, he ends the chapter with advice about colon cleansing, along with an invitation to \\"call my office\\" for more information, something which appears in the book several times. There are also endorsements for a certain kind of water purification system. His biography lists degrees in \\"science\\" (?), business administration, biology, chemistry, psychology, and exercise physiology. He's also a \\"licensed nutritionist\\". OK, what's missing? The names of the universities that granted all of these degrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too negative","review":"I found the book had a tendency to run \\"on and on\\" in regards to certain subjects, such as aspartame, etc. After the point was made, the author continued to ramble on the subject, to the point where I found myself wanting to skip to the next area, so to speak (in fact I did so at times). I also was beginning to believe that the author is of the opinion that \\"everything\\" will give you cancer. I found myself saying \\"take what you need and leave the rest.\\" Also, when I realized that the book was published almost 10 years ago, I have to question the validity of some of the points made. Things change in ten years."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there","review":"This book is very rudimentary and maybe has value for someone who knows absolutely nothing about nutrition. Most of the points are quite elementary, such as avoiding trans fats and high-fat dairy. Also, this book was written in 1999 so some of the information seems dated.

For myself, I would have liked a more thorough resume of the author, stating which Universities he attended, what degrees he holds, in which fields those degrees are, and what he is currently doing professionally (and has done), but that deficiency is not enough for me to lower my rating.

Anyone who likes credible information backed up by facts. As he accurately states in his chapter Avoid the Concealed Dangers, \\"... I feel like a cross-eyed discus thrower.

One cup has water coming out of it's mouth if tipped forward, but what was the point of putting a large hole on the bottom. Most of the water flows out for the bottom before I pour it out of the mouth. The point is having the kids pour the water out manually , and not by gravity. Also, it would be more fun if the water trickled out slower. Only one cup did that. My twin daughters who just turned two were not interested after day one. For $18, this toy is too pricey.

Clannad is a very up and down story with funny lead-ups to a depressing situation. The emotion that is communicated is only intensified by the fact that you become attatched to the characters as the story progresses. For the people who thought Clannad was good you probably want to watch Clannad Afterstory too, seeing as the first season was a very well thought out intro to the second season.

No way to repair according to SPRI. I wasn't particularly hard on the ball, but I didn't check the floor each time I used it either. I assumed it was more puncture resistant. I think it may have snagged on something. I would recommend the Elite ball, which is more expensive, in the SPRI line. The gym I go to uses the Elite ball and it looks much thicker. Why call this ball \\"Professional Plus\\" if it isn't all that durable?"},{"rating":"2","title":"really excellent book!","review":"This book is really great. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days after I finished it. It's also a book that can appeal to a wide range of people. I read it first (im a 13 yr old girl) then my dad, then my mom and after that my Grandfather. We all liked it alot. The book seems very real, you can tell the author definetly must have lived on a commune or really interviewed and researched about what it was really like. The characters are very real and the book overall is interesting especially because I've never read any book with a topic close to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book - read it","review":"This book was fascinating. The characters were very alive and the story compelling. Don't listen to the bad reviews. Just read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had enough of Boyle for a while","review":"I am so happy to finally be finished with this book.Boyle is a gifted and imaginative writer, but I really disliked most of the characters in this book and couldn't wait to put it down each day. I forced myself to continue with it because it's on the 1001 books you must read list.Drop City, the fictional one in this story, is a commune in California whose members decide - after a young girl is raped in their presence, and the authorities are cracking down on their lack of plumbing - to move to Alaska. The Drop City crowd quickly learns how ill-equipped they are for life, that the fantasy of living off of the land is, in reality, not for them. In the same way, I realized that the fantasy of being a hippie in the 60s perhaps would not have been my cup of tea. I quickly grew tired of the free-love, as Star, one of the hippie-chicks, figures out early on, is a better deal for the guys than the girls.I think I've had enough of Boyle for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book This Summer","review":"I read the second half of this book in one afternoon, I just couldn't put it down. T C Boyle will make you feel as if you are right in Drop City. You will feel the California sun beating down on you and the bitter below-zero cold that settles in come October. Would love to know what becomes of Pam, Sess, Star and Marco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly engrossing.","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It took me to other places, another time, and was not too depressing despite the harsh realities in each venue. I cared about the characters and saw hope for the ones that I sympathized the most with. This book was so good that I neglected housework and stayed up too late reading. It made me think about life, I tasted a slice of Baked Alaska (ha ha) and it was a great adventure! Bravo T. C. Boyle! I will try another one of his books to see if it can measure up to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"drop city shines","review":"T.C.Boyle writes beautifully, you actually believe you are in the story, the characters are real and their personalities shine through involving you in the lives and adventures. Tortilla Curtain probably the best book I have ever read and Drop City is written in the same vain showing the interaction between vastly different people, but pitting them against natures different elements and the effects it has on the characters, recommended to people who enjoy excellent contempory fiction.4 Stars as I loved it but did not impact on me as much as Tortilla Curtain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Didn't like anything about this book--not one character could I feel any empathy for or relate to in any was--couldn't wait for it to be over--It was my Book Club book. or I never would have taken the time to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop City","review":"This book was very entertaining and illustrative of reality of the \\"hippie\\" era. It was a compelling read with a lot of flavors of the time. It was not politically or racially charged, as one would expect from a book reflective of that period. It delved into the life of a commune - the view from within. I liked the descriptive elements of the book and the story was satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste...","review":"I don't know what kind of people are reading and enjoying this book, but it was a waste of time. I hate leaving a book unfinished and this was by far the hardest book to push through. Just a cheap attempt at fictional hippy society. I felt as if the author was attempting to live out some fantasy through the book.To find this book enjoyable is to admit a lack of morals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally, like, boring and worthless","review":"Maybe if you were there and have fond memories of the drugged-out, young life of a hippie commune, you will relate to this book. Otherwise, you probably won't want to bother. It's hard to care much about the characters who are mainly spaced out on dope, groping for instant gratification, and don't give a hoot about much of anything else. If this was \\"fun\\", I'm afraid I miss the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop City","review":"I just finished Drop City and I have to say it's completely forgettable. I cared for none of the characters and was quite disturbed by the author's fixation on gruesome, harsh animal death. Sure I understand that it is the wild wilderness and all, but hitting a horse, salacious details of a writhing porcupine, wolf's broken spinal cord, etc. etc. The ending tells us that Marco, Star, Cess, and Pamela live happily ever after? It ends with Cess riding his dogs, on his way to the Christmas celebration at Drop City North; who cares! what happens to Drop City in the long term? The author is surely thrown in personal vendettas, as the \\"bad people\\" wioll always lose to the \\"good people.\\" The only truly well developed character is Norm, and he disaapears from the story without a trace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you're interested in life on the Yukon in the 1970s, read \\"Coming Into the Country.\\" If you are interested in hippies and communes, read something by Joan Didion or Tom Wolfe. Just don't read this book, where you will be forced to spend an awful lot of time with some pretty unsympathetic and uninteresting characters without picking up much insight along the way. T.C. Boyle does craft a shockingly original (to me) way of killing off one of his characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please come to L.A...","review":"I find nothing more entertaining than reliving my childhood stories vicariously through others.

Hippie idealists get back to the land in Alaska ~ will they survive? Plus some biting satire of hippie hypocrisy and redneck violence sprung from boredom.

I first checked it out of our library, but it was such a good read that I knew I needed to have it on my own bookshelf.There's a few small bits of decorating advice, but this book is awesome because it gives clear details on how much stuff you should really have and really great ideas on how to store it even in small houses with kids.

A BOBO doing a song like that is just so unexcusable. That being said, there is no other weak track on the record, (while I can't say that I like the song Good Life, its still a decent cut.) My favorite song here is without a doubt Black Coffee, where Anthony B, does absolutely nothing but bigup the black woman, its easily his best song, besides Fire Pon Rome of course. I also like All God's Children, Rally Round and I Will Never Bow Down with the brilliant Stephen Marley. Overall, like I said, minus Fire Dance its a very good record. Listen to it on a portable cd player or on a remote controlled stereo system, so you won't have to get up to skip track # 6. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for any information security awareness program","review":"This book is a must-read for anyone building an information security awareness program. Ms. Herold lays out a fantastic game plan for security awareness for not only the sake of information security, but to meet regulatory compliance as well. For me, this book was used as a reference guide. When I was tasked with developing and improving upon an already existing security awareness program, I used many tactics right from this book. The concept of measuring the effectiveness of the program throughout is woven throughout this book. Being able to show the effectiveness of an information security awareness program is important in the best of times, but as budgets shrink metrics become absolutely critical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like any other doll, just with Gwen's face","review":"I got this doll and the Bananas doll for my two girls.

The author doesn't try to stretch the episode to fit 275 pages, but instead fills in all the extra with background for the characters, both major and minor, so that we have a better idea of who we will be seeing through the series.It is relatively well written, although a few scenes do fall flat on their face when the author fails to adequately convey sarcasm or humor, and the prophets just didn't make the transition from TV to novel very well.All in all, if you are a DS9 fan, this is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual, J.M.

Just reading the names intrigues you, like Singin' Hinny (a Northumberland griddle cake).I especially like the author including her sketches representing different regions. The rustic farmhouses and other scenes fit well with the many recipes.

Although this book has a heavy religious overtone, I would not say that it is a religious book. There is a clear story here, told in glorious detail that allows you to visualize every page. The author is a master of leaving you wanting more. Anyone who is looking for a deeper religious meaning will be able to find it if they choose so, but it can easily be enjoyed by the nonreligious.

It worked great for a couple of months then it just died. We sent it back, it cost nearly $40 to ship back to the manufacturer. Customer service was great and we received a new unit within a week. This was in about April 2010. Now here we are in May 2011 and it has just died. We weren't even running it continuously, it was on at night. I've been looking at some reviews for these types of units and it seems that this is about their life span. That's pretty disappointing. Now I'm looking for a new unit, hopefully one that will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to use","review":"It is very quiet and very efficient, but it is next to impossible to use it in a continuous drainage pattern. The hose is not included and all the explanations of the Technical support don't make any sense. They told me to buy a \\"surgical tubing\\", that no one in the hardware store has any idea about, then gave me the wrong size of the tubing and would not clearly explain how it connect it. The bucket is tiny and it is not easy to take out, so without a constant draining it is useless. Waist of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it !","review":"I replaced our older dehumidifiers with this one and I LOVE IT.It is quiet, in fact silent, on the lowest setting and works beautifully.Finally a dehumidifier I can live with !!HOWEVER.....I purchased two of these units, and one gives off a lot of heat.It does dehumidify, but it also heats the room which I definitely don't like or need.I wonder why one does this but not the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 18 months","review":"Liked this dehumidifier for compact footprint and quiet operation. Also appreciated the ability to connect a drain hose that was high enough to drain into a condensate pump without putting the unit on a pedestal. After 18 months the unit stopped working. The fan still blows and you can hear the compressor turn on but it is not producing condensate even in high humidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd one of these...","review":"I purchased this unit because it was rated very quiet by others on Amazon. It also has the optional drain hole to attach a hose to it so you can forget about having to empty it all the time. Although it is quiet, the unit only lasts a year or so. I know because I have purchased several of them.. I haven't found any dehumidifer on the market that is this quiet and that's my main concern since I have it in my TV room. It would be nice to have a quality unit available from some vendor but it looks like that won't happen any time soon. It's all made over seas now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...for awhile","review":"I purchased my first unit about three years ago. It's whisper quiet performance was probably the biggest draw. Temps down to 50 degrees seemed to cause no problems. Unfortunately it began leaking coolant at 13 months, just past the warranty date.With some hesitation, I purchased a second unit. This time, the compressor/coolant issue occurred at about 7 months of use. Small appliance stores won't bother with repair of dehumidifiers. Even with the warranty, cost of shipping back to the company just didn't make sense.Bottom line, if it works, it works great. But the durability of this unit and some difficulty reaching the company to address such issues will keep me from purchasing Soleus again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Keeps our walkout basement family room humidity under control at all times.Would recommend it.

When I contacted Soleus they said it didn't matter that the replacement lasted only 6 months. The warranty starts from the time of purchase.

Purchased mine in May, 2010. Used sparingly during the humid summer months. Worked well for about 2 years but failed catastrophically without warning. Fan still blows and seems like the condenser is attempting to run as it gets quite hot and pulls 2.1 amps of current (rated for 2.9 amps) but no water condensing out. Seems to me after reading numerous other poor reviews that a seal somewhere in the coolant plumbing fails and all the freon leaks out all at once. One day it works well, next day....NOTHING.

While it lasted it worked well, and very quietly. It seems to be built as a throw away, with no reasonable option for repair. My previous dehumidifier was a Whirlpool, and it lasted for about 12 years until its coils began to ice up, so in my opinion the Soleus is not built to last. My advice is to stay away, unless you feel that 3 years of service is acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"Worked well until it stopped working. Bought in late 2007, noticed it was still blowing air but that the compressor wasn't coming on mid-2011. Local repair shop couldn't get the ice sensor for it to fix it. Just called Soleus and they don't sell parts for it. The parts are in China where it's made, the Soleus rep said. For them to inspect it would be $45, I would have to pay to ship it to them and pay the return shipping, and there's no guarantee that they would have the part.

Emptying the contanier is tricky, but if you hold it on each side it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compressor died between seasons","review":"This little dehumidifier worked beautifully for two and a half seasons. This spring when the heat was finally no longer necessary, and the rains began, the basement started to dampen up a bit and I flipped on the dehumidifier. After it chugged away for a few days and the water collection bin remained completely empty and my basement got that familiar musty smell, I realized with sadness that I was one of the unhappy losers whose compressor failed for no reason after just two and a half seasons. I am back to purchase another dehumidifier, and this time I will try the frigidare.

Was impressed at how quiet it ran and ease of connecting hose output to sump. But never dried out the basement as well as prior units. Sometime in summer 2008 (not sure when) it stopped collecting water (didn't realize it wasn't working because the fan and compressor seemed to be running). Owner's manual says to check input and output ports for blockage, but the plastic case is held together by four non-standard screws, so I can't get the thing apart to clean it.

We called the company and of course it has a one year warranty. Of course if we want to spend a lot of money sending it to them to look at we can but they cannot guarantee anything.

It worked well for the first summer - quiet and dehumidified the air. After storing it away for the winter, the machine did not work anymore when we needed it last summer. The fan worked fine but no water was collected (compressor problem). Fortunately, we were still within the warranty period and the company shipped us a refurbished machine. Took about 3 weeks. We had to pay for the shipping of the defective unit. That replacement worked well again for a year... Now I took out the machine and it is not working again. Same problem. It appears that if you store the machine away for a long period of time, the compressor part just stops \\"talking to the rest of the unit\\"...

When we received it, we had a heck of a time getting it to power on. Once it did, it DID do a fantastic job at removing the humidity and it was very quiet....but it stopped working after a couple months. Something to do with the power on button itself, we think. So, my husband played around with it and finally got it working again. Wouldn't you know it? We had a power failure during a storm a day later.

However, after about one month of use I noticed that the compressor works only at the highest \\"Dry\\" setting, and it never shuts down. I used a watt/amp-meter since it is difficult to tell if the compressor is on or off just by sound.It cost me $38 to ship the unit back for replacement and they only replace it with a refurbished one.

After less than three months, one has stopped removing moisture from the air. The second dehumidifier, is currently working well. At this time, however, I do not know if the warranty is worth the paper it is written on.I live approximately 45 miles inland from the Gulf coast. It has been my experience that while the outside tempurature was still warm, one dehumidifier could lower humidity 10% or less in the room, form 60% down to 50%. Now that it has been cool this past week the still functioning dehumidifier has brought the humidity down from approximately 48% to 39%.During the higher humidity level days, the dehumidifiers filled their tanks two times a day. Therefore, I am glad that I purchased the larger capacity model CFM-40E. (Both the CFM-25E and the CFM-25E have the same size tank, supposedly the later removes more moisture from the air in a given time period.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited Range of Control","review":"We bought this dehumidifier for my 84 year old mother who has breathing problems and requires low (35%) humidity. We were shocked to learn, upon receiving the dehumidifier, that it had ONLY 3 settings, for 50%, 60%, and 70% humidity. The machine turns off the compressor when the humidity gets down to 50%.If you are looking for dehumidification down to only 50%, then I would rate it a 5 -- a nice (smaller) machine, but not enough range if you really need dehumidification.It arrived promptly from Amazon with Prime 1 day shipping"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good buy","review":"This is the first dehumidifier that I have had so I don't have a lot of comparison. But, I am so far very impressed. I have had the unit for over a month now and I am amazed at the difference it makes in the comfort level of my partial basement.It is very quiet and seems to be rather efficient. It is not too heavy or big for the space that I have and is much more pleasing to look at than all of the other brands that I researched.I would at this time highly recommend this unit for basic needs in around 800 sq. ft.

Knowing that I cannot get any exchange, I decided to open and see what seems to be wrong (I am an electrical engineer.) The reason it no longer worked properly was that some mechanical parts went rusty, which made it not working properly and the compressor (still running) was extremely hot. How come Solues makes a product dealing with humidity (or water) that goes rusty inside after one year?So, it's like I spend $20/month to dehumify.

I first noticed there was a problem when there was water all around it on the floor. I removed the back cover thinking the drain hole was plugged up but then noticed the coils had frozen over and also encased a small sensor/controls circuit board mounted behind the filter. Of course the circuit board was shorted out and rusted up. Called the company for a replacement board and was willing to pay for it but their reply was \\"we do not carry any internal parts\\". So I am dead in the water after less than 2 years of use. Of course warranty was only for 1 year. Product is great and runs well but will not last long.

That's wonderful, but there are two small annoyances. I'm taking one star off for this two small failings.First, they put a big advertising sticker listing various features on the front, and it cannot be removed with a lot of effort. The sticker de-laminates and becomes a sticky mess once you try.Second, the unit includes a handy cord minder on the rear, but it immediately broke. Basically, it's a nice little holder for the power cord, with a snap to hold it shut. The snap broke the first time I tried to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very efficient and extremely quiet","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but since I value them in making an intelligent decision, I think this product deserves my applause. Definitely the best of several dehumidifers we have purchased in our over 50 years of wedded bliss, and free shipping offered by Amazon.com is always a big consideration for this frugal lady. I like the option of collecting the moisture, or using the hose connection which empties directly into the drain, bypassing the collection bucket which is still clean and dry after several weeks of use.

This winter, after we took it out of storage (in its original box, as recommended by the manufacturer), it has basically stopped working. The fan operates but it no longer pulls any water out of the air. I've noticed that the coils in the back seem to be freezing up. Customer service was no help. From my Internet research, this seems to be a common problem for these units, a problem with the compressor that is too expensive to fix.

I think it's defective.In short, a mixed review: it does a good job, but it has significant faults.Update a year later: it broke (the sensor mechanism connected to the bucket failed, so I can only get it work with a crude override of sensor, and can no longer use the bucket.

After countless times of trying to get in touch with customer service, I was finally told to clean the air filter, which I did, and it still did not work. Customer service told me that the dehumidifier was no longer under warranty and they would not fix it. Overall, one of the worst products that I ever bought and the worst customer service to match!

I would have given it 5 stars, except I'm not thrilled with their design for removing the water reservoir. Just not as user-friendly as I have had.

The \\"full bucket\\" light will not go out, therefore the unit won't work because it thinks the bucket is full. I refuse to spend another penny on this unit to return it to Soleus in California. I based my purchase on the good reviews that this unit received. I can't believe my luck......I had to get 2 defective units.

It is very quiet. I can't hear it unless I'm right next to it. And it sucks moisture out of the air although its humidity setting can't be set as low as my previous dehumidifier and doesn't get the garage as dry. The biggest issue with this device is the \\"float\\" to detect when the reservoir is full. It does NOT work reliably. When the reservoir becomes full, the water overflows onto the floor (about 2/3 of the time). And it is very difficult to remove a full or nearly full reservoir without sloshing some of the contents onto the floor. SO, unless you enjoy checking and emptying the reservoir frequently (in my case, twice a day) OR you hook it up to a drain hose and don't use the reservoir (hard to do in below house level garage), this is not the unit for you. I would not purchase this unit again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soleus 40 Dehumidifier","review":"In very few words, this works really well. On low, it's as quiet as a church mouse.

I followed the recommended maintenance as many other owners have. The unit just stopped dehumidifying. The fan and controls continued to work, but no water output. It was quiet and effective when it worked. My review is very typical to many other reviews on the unit. So, since I paid about $180.00 for the unit, that figures out to about $60.00 per year for dehumidifying.I think that Soleus Air should get to the root of the re-occuring problem so the unit has a longer life span and a more satisfied customer base.

The first day this machine took over a gallon of water out of the air. The musty odor in the condo was gone. We even noticed that condensation on our drinking glasses went from dripping wet to DRY. This machine is very quiet. Per instructions, the louver lid on the top MUST be open. The sound DOES increase if you tilt the louver down so the air blows out sideways. We leave it fully open and it's no louder than the white sound of a ceiling fan. Also, when you turn it off it resets back to the Default setting of \\"CONTINUOUS RUN\\". Which means you need to set it back to your preferred \\"Dry\\" setting, otherwise it will keep running.My only criticism is the wheels are too small to roll easily over carpeting.

Before the end of the third month the unit stopped working.The unit we purchased was quite noisy and it generated quite a lot of heat. It did work well initially at pulling water from the air. I do not know why it stopped working well. The units are not sturdy and the sensors on the water reservoir are delicate. The reservoir will spill when it is removed if it is full.

When I turned it on this year the fan came on but the compressor never kicked in, so even after 24 hours of operation it didn't collect any water. I called Soleus but they said the product is out of warranty (one year warranty). In order to get it fixed I would have to pay for shipping both ways plus parts plus labor.

Unless it was on the \\"maximum\\" setting, no water was removed from our humid laundry room, even though the compressor on the unit would run. In addition, the bucket to empty the dehumidifer was very poorly designed, causing water to slop onto the floor every time it was removed. The design of the bucket also made it nearly impossible to poor the water out neatly, without spilling everywhere. Finally, after 8 months of use, the flimsy piece of metal, used to detect when the bucket is full, broke off when we removed the bucket, rendering the entire unit worthless. Without the flimsy metal piece, the device registers that the bucket is always full, and the unit will not run.

They were great while they worked, but both stopped working after a little more than a year, within a couple months of each other.There is no reasonable repair option, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice dehumidifier with a big flaw","review":"The dehumidifier worked fine until a thin metal tab that is activated by the basin float caught on the basin as it was being removed. The thin metal tab was slightly bent and now the unit will not operate. Once the tab is bent, it isn't possible to get it bent back into the correct position to operate the switch. According to Soleus customer service, a replacement switch is not available. A small, hidden, fragile metal tab that gets caught on the basin during normal operation and turns the unit into a $200 waste... seems like a really terrible design.Mine was about 2 years old when it died; hopefully they've fixed this on more recent models. If you chose to buy one of these, be aware that availability of repair parts is spotty, and the design has at least one fragile point that can render the entire thing useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"All Soleus junk is just that- JUNK. Mine lasted 5 months, and the next summer it wouldn't pull any moisture. Called Soleus and was told too bad, the warranty is up.. They have no repair people in the U.S., they don't repair them themselves, and won't sell you a part if you could fiqure out what is wrong with it. All they do is import them from China and cash your check. Buy American."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great while it worked, but...","review":"Worked great for a couple months, then died. Fan still works, but no water... and trust me, it's still plenty humid in my Seattle basement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Good to be True","review":"I purchased my Soleus Air 40 pint dehumidifier after reading the glowing reviews about it. The unit ran no more than 8 hours then completely stopped working. It is currently enroute for a refund. It really is quiet, since it does not run at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine!","review":"It sucks up the moisture restoring my books to their former (drier) glory. Wish the water pan were a little easier to handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our old Kenmore works better than this!","review":"We have a super old Kenmore dehumidifyer that is years old. It's like a Mac truck and is bulky and loud...but it works like a charm. The reason I wanted a new one is it's hard to watch TV because it is so noisy.The new Soleus just doesn't do the same job at removing moisture from the basement. It's been assigned to the back room, and the bulky Kenmore is once again in the TV room. The Soleus is just not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Bought 2 of these, they both stopped working within a few months of each other after just over a year. There is essenitally no repair option, except to pay shipping both ways to the manufacturer and $45/hr labor plus parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"apswws","review":"Works very well, very quiet even on high. The water bucket is a little hard to remove and empty, tends to spill because it is filled so close to the top, does not seem to be adjustable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Effective Dehumidifier","review":"This dehumidifier has been really effective in keeping the humidity level down in the basement - it ran non-stop during the hottest, most humid days. Since I have had it only a month during the summer, I can't comment on its durability or its functionality in cold temperatures, but based on other reviews I expect it to be durable and work in colder temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not purchase again","review":"Definitely would not purchase this product again. The flimsy on/off switch apparatus fell off after about 6 months of occasional use. I was able to reinsert it which rendered the unit usable for awhile. My bad for not calling customer service at that initial breaking point, although after reading the other reviews it appears they would have sent a used unit to replace mine. No thanks. I called customer service to locate a repair facility- there are none. You must ship it back at your expense. My unit was 10 days out of the 1 year warranty. They will not make an exception and replace the unit. I ask to speak to the customer service manager. I'm told she's out to lunch and will call me after lunch. Still waiting for Cheryl's call- a week later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy, never great, broke after two years","review":"Bought this dehumidifer in 5/06 after reading reviews and tired of replacing the metal-box units sold at Wal-Mart and hhGregg. Was impressed at how quiet it ran and ease of connecting hose output to sump. But never dried the basement as well as prior units. Sometime in summer 2008 (not sure when) it stopped collecting water (didn't realize it wasn't working because the fan and compressor seemed to be running). Owner's manual says to check input and output ports for blockage, but the plastic case is held together by four non-standard screws, so I can't get the thing apart to clean it. Soleus web site offers support only for those in warranty (1 year), I sent them an email but do not expect results."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Like all of you I read the reviews to help make my decision. I read the two negative reviews about it breaking in 2 months against all the positive reviews. So I decided to take a chance. Yeah, well, 2 months later it broke. It's no longer pulling any water from the air. Now I have to begin the long process of trying to have Soleus replace it. Again looking at what the 2 negative reviewers had to say about that, I don't hold out much hope. So 200.00 bucks for 2 months, doesn't seem like much of a bargain. Needless to say I wouldn't buy a Soleus product again. And if my review steers someone else from buying this shody product, it was worth the time it took to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but for only six months","review":"This worked well at pulling water from the air in my very humid coastal Florida master bathroom. But it failed just six months later. After reading these reviews, it looks as if I'm not the only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this product less than a year ago. The float device broke so now it constantly thinks it is full. There is no way to repair this. I will not buy from Soleus Air in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work after 3 months, returned next one lasted 2 months","review":"Do not buy this product. I bought it new one year ago. It worked for 3 months. I spent $25 to return it and they replaced it. The new one lasted 2 months. I will not send this one back because I need a dehumidifier that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soleus - Terrible Customer Service","review":"We purchased our Soleus through Amazon.After approximately 1 year the unit stopped working.I attempted to contact Soleus to see how I could get the unit repaired and could not get a response. This unit cannot be worked on locally as they cannot get parts. I would never buy anything from this company ever again.If I could rate them a negative 5 I would. I read a lot of good reviews about the product. I suspect their service dept. is busy posting positive reviews instead of answering customer service calls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dehumidifers for Dummies","review":"Having just bought this, my second Soleus, I'd like to share what I learned: The CFM-40 does *not* have a larger tank than the CFM-25, they're the same size. The 40 has a faster moisture removal rate, I guess. The six liter or so tank has to be emptied more frequently. Duh! (slap my forehead)It's way quieter and lighter than the Haier units I had, one of which quit working btw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it next day","review":"Read the reviews and ordered this to give it a shot. Unfortunately, the model I got leaked oil into the water tank, and hardly took any water out of the air at all.

What a God sent, the Soleus is so quiet, you don't know it is running. The old LG was very loud. I have my Soleus hooked up to my AC drain pump...so it works 24/7 without any human intervention. It will fill over two pails with water a day. I think I might buy another for the church's food cupboard. Wonderful engineering. Thank you Amazon for the fast/free shipping as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great reviews - WARNING: Will Last Only 2 Years!","review":"Like you I read a million reviews on dehumidifiers and Soleus seemed like a great choice.

The search continues...."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 months tops!","review":"I purchased 2 units based upon the reviews on Amazon.com. Maybe it's just a bad batch of units, but both units stopped extracting water from the air after 2 months of use. I've tried every setting; unplugging for a day, etc. One unit even overflowed in my basement causing us additional cost in pulling up a commercial carpet and drying everything. My suggestion: move on and buy a commercial unit. Thats' what I'm going to do. Look great but don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 6 months of use","review":"It was great while it worked.... quiet and efficient. after one summer's use (appx 6 months) we put the unit away and pulled it out again to find that it wasn't drawing any water out from the air. called customer service and they stated it is a compressor problem and that i need to find a repair person on my own to have it fixed since it was past the one year warranty. the repair person suggested we junk the unit and buy something else with an extended warranty. very disappointed with the unit and their customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well as long as it was powered up","review":"I purchased the Soleus CFM40E to dehumidify our basement. It was a mid-range unit out of the three that were on display at our local national chain. After a year and a half of nearly continuous use (dehumidification set to mid-level 'two drops'), I powered it off so it wouldn't need to run while my family was away for a week. Once we came back, I powered it up. The compressor was VERY loud and the compressor shut itself off after several seconds. I powered it back on again and it was fairly quiet - a slight hum coming from the compressor area - but it also shut the compressor off after a few seconds. It will no longer dehumidify, although the fan still runs and it acts as if it is working.Perhaps I shouldn't have powered it off!Soleusair only warrants this unit for one year. I've replaced it with a different name-brand dehumidifier with a five year compressor warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well while it lasted...which wasn't very long.","review":"I've owned 3 of these. The first one work well so I bought another one for another area of the house. I bought the second one in Winterand didn't use it until Spring when I realized it didn't work at all. I called Soleus and they said I'd have to pay to send it to them since I had it over 30 days. It was about $40 to ship it and they sent me a new one.The third one worked well also for about 1 1/2 years and then stopped working...about the same time my first one stopped working. So I got about 3 years out of the first one and a year and a half out of the last one. Maybe this is a normal lifespan for a dehumidifier but I don't find it acceptable and won't be buying another Soleus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a year or 2 but that's it","review":"My Soleus is less than 2 years old. The compressor locked up when I turned it on a couple days ago. Basically, that means it's totaled. Searching the web, I find this has happened to many people. They last for a year, 2 or 3 and then they lock up. The one year warrenty is no help. They're a great unit when they work, but my old GE costs a lot less and lasted 2x as long. I'm looking for new one but won't be considering a Soleus"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"This thing doesn't work.

The fan runs but it has pulled no water for over 24 hours despite trying every trouble shooting point.We've ordered a replacement through Amazon... we'll see if it's any better. BEWARE, this seems to be a hit or miss product... but great when it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"My first Soleus dehumidifier worked fine for nine months, then stopped working. The motor ran, but it no longer pulled any water out of the air. Since it was still under warranty, I got another one at no cost. The second one worked fine for eight months, then stopped working. Same problem: motor runs, but doesn't dehumidify.Since the one-year warranty is now up, I'll have to buy a new dehumidifier. I'm not really convinced that getting a third Soleus is worth the money. Call me old fashioned, but I expect my appliances to last for more than a year or two -- and certainly for more than a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet, but not efficient and not made well","review":"I bought this unit because all the reviewers marveled about how quiet it is. I suppose quiet is what you get when the device doesn't do much. It hardly removed any water and has cheap, flimsy construction. I returned this unit after a week. I also bought and strongly recommend the Frigidaire 50 pint unit. It's louder but removes 5 times the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I purchased this unit for my fifth wheel trailer I live in full time.

I have never written a review ofanything before this one - beware this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Removes amazing amounts of water from the air","review":"This works great! The tank was more than half full running overnight. Since I've used it more the tank is a bit less than half full overnight. Quiet mode is like white noise and not too loud if it is not right next to you.It feels much warmer and I am using less heat this winter and feeling more cozy. I live near a bay and it can get damp.It would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't so heavy. It is portable but still a chore for me to move around. I have no place to hook up a drain hose which would make it easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Should have read the reviews","review":"This unit worked okay at first. Nice and quiet.

More junk from China"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after fifteen months - no support","review":"This unit worked very well for approximately fifteen months. I was pleased with the quality and value. Then the compressor stopped functioning. I called technical support. They said they would do nothing outside of the one year warranty, which is fair enough I suppose. The thing that got me is that it sounded like the customer service representative fielded many of these calls every day. The attitude seems to be if it is out of warranty, you are out of luck and we don't really care, but at least we don't care politely. Even pretending to have a modicum of sympathy or concern would have been nice. I shall never purchase a Soleus again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but died after 2 years","review":"This unit worked well for three years EDIT: (3 seasons of use, just over 2 years of actual operation) //EDIT and then decided to quit. I would think that it would last longer, especially since it replaced one that was 10 years old. Good thing I did not get rid of the old one (it's a big ole 2.5 foot cube and quite hefty), it's back in service.While it was working, I liked this unit. Small and relatively quiet. I just expected more longevity out of it.EDIT: After replying to a comment and thinking about it, actual run time for this unit was only about 12 months since I only use it during the summer months. I have downgraded my rating from 3 to 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very quiet dehumidifier - decent power","review":"This product did not disappoint as far as the noise level. It is truly much quieter than my LG, however it doesn't seem to pull as much water out of the air as the other. The LG also offers a digital setting for humidity control, where the Soleus only has dry, medium or moist settings. The \\"dry\\" setting keeps the humidity in my basement level rooms under 50% but lower if it is dry outside.Anyway, I recommend it if you are not looking for a heavy duty dehumidifier. I think the fact that it is so quiet seals the deal on my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product concealed by pretty packaging","review":"Soleus gets one solid star and kudos from me for one thing: doing a nice job of concealing a lousy product with neat, expensive looking packaging. I owned this model for exactly 15 months, during which it worked without a hitch, then suddenly it died. The motor still runs, but there is no moisture collecting in the bin. The unit was never abused, since it was only kept in the basement of my house and turned on only during the humid months of the year (March through September). I called Soleus Service Line three separate times, and they all said that there was nothing they could do since my 1-year warranty had expired. No manufacturer rebate on the next product purchase. No tips on DYI repair. They offered nothing. Bottom line: Soleus is perfect for you if you are willing to pay almost $200 for 15 months of dehumidifier action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for less than two years","review":"I bought this dehumidifier less than two years ago. It worked great for the first year and was quiet by comparison to other dehumidifiers. It started not pulling water from the air (I live in the rain forest in Alaska) last winter - I had always cleaned the air filter and there was no other maintenance to be done as the unit is closed. I removed it this spring when our rains started and the house humidy shot up. I would not recommend for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed","review":"Worked great for a year.

As with many people, they work great...until they don't. First one stopped working and leaked on the floor after about one year. The second one after about 3 months of light work. They are so much quieter than anything else on the market, that I got sucked in a second time. Never again. I have a noisy frigidare that has worked great for a couple years. I guess I will put up with the noise over the Soleus garbage. This should really rate a minus three stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"Like others in this review section I installed the unit and it worked very well. That was last year. When the summer season began I put the unit back in service and found only part of that worked was the fan. Calling their customer service I was informed that the warranty began the day of purchase and ended one year later period, no exceptions. OK, so how do I get this fixed? No fix! There are no parts for these units so no fix. Bottom line: for $ 187.00 you get 6 months of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I've had it for a couple months and it has worked great.

It no longer collects any water. I guess this is meant for short term use.Previous review: We bought this dehumidifier for our basement. It really helps reducing the humidity there. Now it's no longer damp and smelly. We really like it because it's lightweight and it's very quiet. It doesn't heat up the place either. If only it has something to show the current humidity level of the room, it would be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"lucky? worked for 3 years","review":"I purchased mine in April 2007 and it has worked pretty well up until now.

I borrowed an LG dehumidifier to help out and it is working pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"THIS WAS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: We are so pleased with this dehumidifier. We needed one to take down the humidity in our living area of our home that does not have a basement or crawl space. It has done an excellent job of taking down the humidity. It looks nice, can not even tell what it is. It has quiet operation (doesn't disturb TV watching or talking in the same room). It has a sizable bin for the water to collect but I am sure one would want the larger size unit if using in a basement. It is very easy to empty with no spill over and we feel very comfortable with the automatic shut off when it is full. It was packaged very well and delivered very quickly and the price from Amazon was a savings compared to other stores.I AM NOW CHANGING MY REVIEW!!!
