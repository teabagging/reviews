After that it turns into a boring rts game. All the hype and previews over this game were just lies. I feel like i was taken for a ride on this one. And to make matters worse,the camera angles and controls are awful in the rts stages. I even wasted money on a guide. Don't buy this game if your thinking it will be something different. And now with the first patch,the sound is all screwed up. I uninstalled it and wish i could at least send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying DRM scheme","review":"You can only install the game up to three times - overall. That means if you get a new PC every 3 years, in 7-8 years you'll find yourself unable to play the game. So it's really more like you're RENTING it.My 30 year old copy of Atari Combat works just fine; why can't PC games do the same?Oh, and you pretty much need internet access to activate the game, and if you want different people to be able to play (like a save file for each sibling) - forget it.A version without this DRM crap would probably rate 4 or 5 stars - as it is, you'd be doing yourself and your computer a favor by ignoring this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM? Only one problem with this game","review":"I'm sure by now you've read a few of the other reviews and heard about how terrible the DRM on this game is.But there are other reasons to avoid this game. Most importantly, after two years of hype and anticipation, this game is not as revolutionary as it could have been.There are issues with bugs, hassles built into the gameplay experience, and the main focus of the game, the space section, is just one repetitive grind fest.Take my advice.Don't buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"I wasn't even able to run the creature creator! After watching the Discovery Channel documentary, reading some pre-reviews, and watching all of the commercials I thought this would be the game of the decade! But, after seeing all the problems that people are having, and having problems with just the basic creature creator, I decided not to buy the game. EA Sports is not showing any promising signs lately: continued reliance on old franchises (Madden, NBA Live, different iterations of The Sims) and this bomb all make EA Sports look terrible. It's a shame that a game that took that long, and cost $75 million to make is so lame. I wasn't a fan of computer games to begin with, and this gives me another big reason to stick to gaming consoles.

I upgrade my pc's alot as well as format a few times a year, just to get some performance boosts.

I can't jump well and don't like fire... staying away"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time - DRM is part of the problem","review":"The DRM by itself is enough to make it a no buy, as there is no reason for a game to REQUIRE you to verify so often.

Perfect example of spending more on marketing than on development."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM + Bugs = A terrible experience","review":"For the most part, the game is an interesting concept. However, like so many awesome concepts before it, Spore fails for several reasons. First, the aforementioned DRM which limits your machine to a rental and leaves you at the mercy of EA (fantastic...). Secondly, the one facet that really ended it for me was this: During the tribal stage, I told my primates to attack an enemy tribe, and they all stopped at an invisible wall on the hill between myself and them, except one who went into the enemy camp and was slaughtered. What is wrong with developers that they think that this is acceptable? This product is not worth $20, let alone $45."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM and being dumbed down is another killer of a potentially would-be worthwhile title aka just another sims game","review":"EA is up to their typical consumer cynicism again, mistrusting you, their should-be loyal customers with over the top DRM. Not only must you activate your game, but you are only allowed to do this a few times before EA will lock you out and interrogate you over the phone asking why you are trying to use your already paid for game in an unauthorized manner.Further, this game has been dumbed down to appease the ritalin-munching ADHD generation, and everything is just about as linear as you would expect from the next generic sim-insert_title_here clone. Things are based totally on stats and not at all on what your creatures and creations cosmetically look like. If you're ok with supporting publishers such as EA who are constantly pushing DRM-laden software of mediocre quality out to their customers, well then Spore just might be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre At Best--But Ruined by DRM","review":"I agree with most previous posts citing DRM drawbacks. Because of its DRM, this makes the game an expensive rental. I was so hyped up for this game too.

It only allows for 3 installs. After that permission must be granted from the company. If the company no longer exists or if the game is no longer supported, or if the company for whatever reason decides to deny me permission, my copy of the game will be useless.

If need to install over 3 times (like if you discovered the precaution software in the background, uninstalled, then reinstalled noticing the precaution software won't go away, then reformatted to get rid of it, then reinstalled trying to avoid the precaution software) then you find you must contact EA to let you play the game you bought.No company should treat its customers like thieves, it saddens me that it has to be this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems, i had a lot of issues, do not buy this game.","review":"I have a very good computer, but i had a lot of trouble installing the game and making it work, because of the DRM and all the bad malicious software it installs !I have returned the game to the shop.Do not buy it.

I'm starting to hate EA like i hate Steam because of the draconian DRM policies that i'm forced to adopt just to play a game, and it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is out of control","review":"I really was looking forward to buying this game. But the DRM that the publisher has decided to use is just too much. I keep games forever so the three install limit and online authentication is a real problem for me. I buy a lot of games but I won't be buying this one.I recently purchased a low spec ultra portable and dipped in to my extensive game archive to load it up with low spec older games like Starcraft and Diablo. This would not be possible probably with this type of DRM on Spore as they will likely have shut down the authentication servers 10 years from now. This is more like a rental.And the really shameful thing is that if I wanted to pirate it it would be simple to do as it is widely available as are all games people want to pirate. They have only succeeded in punishing the paying customer for NOT pirating the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game so-so, DRM show stopper","review":"The game is only so so. After years of build-up, I had hoped for much more. The most compelling portion of the game, the creature creation, unit building, etc, see almost incidental to the gameplay. That you only have 3 activations before you are denied the use of the game you have paid for is a show stopper. I would not recommend the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM - Manage This","review":"Spore looked like it'd be great fun, and I loved the marketing leading up to the launch (Creatures reacted by famous people, for instance), but the DRM makes it a no-go. Simply put, there's no way I'll pay $50 for a game that requires external authority. I feel offended as a consumer that EA feels they can treat me like dirt and expect me to still play their games. Just being activated externally is bad enough, but to limit it to three is adding insult to injury. I frequently replay games from years past for the fun of it, and knowing I'm buying the game to play through maybe once more means its a game I won't buy.Additionally, I wouldn't even ever pick this up used, since it may not have activations left. Just shoddy management all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy because of DRM","review":"I was excited about this game. I actually bought the creature creator and spent quite a bit of time honing my design skills with it.I was concerned that the creature design would have little effect on game play, and several reviews here confirm this. But I would have bought the game anyway, just for the joy of cruising around a user-designed galaxy, collecting specimens.But the oppressive DRM is the nail in the coffin. I've purchased every game I've ever played. I have lost money to DRM, and I don't need Spore, so I'm not going to buy it. DRM is for games that won't be successful in the long term - the kind of games that need to sell out in the first week to maximize profits, because no one will buy them after the reviews get wide exposure."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is a dealbreaker","review":"I've been looking forward to Spore since I first heard the concept. Sadly, the intrusive DRM means that I won't be buying it. It's a sad result both for me and for Spore's development team.Just to be clear, I won't be pirating it either.

Until then, not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another voice in the anti-DRM choir","review":"I think I would have loved this game.

I would have no real qualms about this, but the DRM made it bad. This is probably the worst DRM I've seen in awhile. If it wasn't that I didn't know about the DRM till install, I would not have bought the game. I had enough trouble getting it to work I eventually searched the web for a patch to take out the DRM.

I suffered through a DRM nightmare with some other titles and it's something I'm loathe to repeat.

However I will now wait until I can buy it for a true rental price of less than $20.With the limit to 3 activations, I would be done with activations within a year or two. In order to keep my machine clean, and to upgrade components, I re-install my operating system every 6 months to a year. Give me only 3 activations, and the game is dead to me after a year and a half. Plus, this gives me far less flexibility with which pc's in my home to install it on. I have 2 PC's and a laptop, and would be forced to basically pick one for the install.Very unimpressed. EA and Maxis, get over the DRM fiasco. It is ABSOLUTELY hurting your sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly anticipated game destroyed by DRM","review":"It is sad that EA decided to treat its customers like criminals by using the incredibly restrictive SecuROM digital rights management software.

Amazon is getting a return on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently I rented this game, not bought it","review":"The REAL reason behind 3 total installs is so that it is a major pain in the caboose to resell the game. Game publishers are tired of us making money off of reselling games and people saving money buying used. This is their way of preventing us into never selling or buying used.EA couldn't make up their mind how to proceed with Spore. Is it a casual game, or hardcore? A mix of both? Well, the gameplay has suffered, as it is a series of minigames that are uninspiring, repetitive, and just not very fun at all.Ten years in the making doesn't mean anything when your core focus is to make money via expansions, ala The Sims. It looks like the investors of EA ruined this game, and the developers let it be ruined. It's sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA, please think about your customers","review":"I bought this game, and I have to say it is quite amazing.

The first is the DRM....I don't really have anything to say about this that hasen't been said...suffice to say I beleive DRM has a decent shot at running PC gaming into the ground if this goes on.

I got bored with it and decided to sell it only to find that the email address that I used to authorize it cannot be changed. The new owner could not log-in and use the online features because he would have to use my email address and password. For as long as the Spore CD I bought remains in existence, it is tied to my email address. EA will reauthorize only for an additional fee.This is an outrageous elevation of the interest of the company over that of the purchaser.

I suggest you pass this game by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Years of hype, just to be let down.","review":"The Good: Beautiful colors and graphics. Unique game that is fun to play for a while.The Bad: EA put too much hype out there about it for way too long. They had everyone drooling over this games possibilities for YEARS. Talking like if gamers played this game every day, all day, it would take almost 80 years for them to explore all the games possible stars in the galaxy. And of course when the makers of Sims say something like that, it's very believable and appealing. But the game just didn't live up to the hype.The main goals in this game are eating, growing and evolving. There's not much more to do then that, except picking fights and making friends.Summary: It's a fun game, but I think they made it out to be more then it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"18 months is not that old","review":"Sigh.

It takes them 3 patches before things are even feasible to play. SPORE is a very fun game...when it's working. First, the obvious. The DRM issues are ridiculous. I had to wait hours for the server to become available before I could activate. Second, graphical issues are rampant. I have two 8800 GT cards in an SLI configuration, and the game wouldn't even load because I was using an \\"out-of'date\\" video driver. Just happens that my \\"out-of-date\\" driver was the latest WHQL released nVidia driver. I had to install a beta driver just to run the game in SLI. Once I FINALLY got the game running I was plagued by random crashes, shader corruption, and numerous other graphical problems.Technical issues aside, this game is fun. The fun, however, wears thin as things become very repetitive. I guess all-in-all I would have to say this game really isn't worth $50, but then again, is any EA game?...ever?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's about principals","review":"Great game to play. It's just that you're paying a company (EA) to install a rootkit on your machine, monitor what you're doing, and generally treat you like a criminal.

Amazon also has a \\"get-it\\" factor - witness their recent move to DRM-free MP3 sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way","review":"I was really looking forward to Spore, it would probably have been one of the best releases of the year. I'm a firm beliver that if a game is worth having, it's worth paying for. But there's no way I would pay for a game that can only be installed 3 times.

No money for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you value freedom and decency, then do not buy this game, or any other game with this nasty DRM virus","review":"Game looks incredibly fun. I was very excited to purchase it. Unfortunately, this is the latest in a series of games that EA is ruining with an insidious piece of DRM software that limits you to three installations and screws up your computer.Pirates will steal, EA.

Geez just stab me in the heart and kick in my stomach why don't you.DRM = bad for society, for you, for gamers, for games, for music, for movies, for everything and everyone. To put it simply, regular users LOSE, while the game can and has been pirated anyway. So whats the sense of it all? I say let pirating roll in now, because DRM cannot be allowed to continue being found on forms of digital media. This must be punished.Fact is, if someone can code something, it can be cracked and it will go free of its \\"DRM\\". This is a stupid and useless attempt of protecting a product from piracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back as soon as I get it.","review":"I preordered this game through Amazon a couple of weeks ago, and unfortunately I didn't really take notice of the DRM implemented into this game. Since Amazon shipped it out before I took note I was unable to cancel my order beforehand. Based on personal research and reading this forum as soon as USPS delivers this puppy it's going back (must remember not to open said software box). If EA takes note of this DRM nightmare and fixes it, maybe I'll consider reordering. Until such time my $50 is better spent elsewhere, perhaps on some blank writable media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful DRM policy","review":"I was very excited over this game and pre-ordered well before release.

There's nothing wrong with the game itself; the game is excellent, and while I have seen other people playing it and greatly admired all of its aspects, I simply refuse to buy a game that'll only work for a few months for $50 without a guarantee that I, as the person who purchased the game, can get more activations.As someone who owns four computers that are regularly used with rolling OS reinstallations every three months and builds a new computer at the end of every year, this scheme just doesn't work for me. It's too bad, too; this could have been a great game. Too bad I can't buy it rather than rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spore is an infringement on rights.","review":"DRM has infected this game, and I can't really support the use of DRM in any product. It doesn't protect anyone. If you buy this game, you will be forced to use EAs terrible SecuROM activation scheme.

And I BOUGHT the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of DRM and being treated like a criminal","review":"DRM is like gun control: if you outlaw guns, then only the outlaws will have the guns.

First they saddled Mass Effect with overly intrusive and potentially system-damaging DRM (there are people who have had their DVD drives rendered permanently inoperable because of it), and now they do the same to SPORE. Both of these games were at the very top of my list of game purchases for 2008, but now, even though I've seen and played both on a friend's computer, neither one will ever touch my hard drive. EA made certain that Maxis and BioWare, two studios I am more than happy to support, will not see my money after all, and I'm just one of a large number of consumers who are doing the same.

All one should need to play a game is the game itself (on a disk or as a download) and a computer. No activation servers, no install counters, no rootkits that surreptitiously run in the background monitoring your usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I am very disappointed with this game after all the years of hype. The game play is not innovative or anything new. Plus the DRM means that you only own this game temporarily so its way overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad decision EA","review":"The game is fun, for what it is. The actual gameplay is somewhat limited, but the creator engines are very fun if you're into that. I've been having a blast making different creatures. I know that my mom and others in my family would probably love this game.Unfortunately, I would not recommend this game to any friend or family. The game is limited to just 3 lifetime activations, and uses a draconian DRM policy to enforce EA's \\"rights\\". I probably would have bought several copies as christmas presents, but not with the current price/policy. Eventually the price will come down- and maybe $10 for 3 activations is worth it. However, unless EA changes their policy or the price, I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"I bought this.. and due to install issues I was finally out of active installs. Now i've spent $50 and i've got no game. Thanks a lot EA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No To DRM","review":"Whilst i would like to purchase this game to play during down time from MMORPGs the DRM issue is one that will make my shy away from purchasing the game.I would like to add I currently have two copies of Warhammer Age of Reckoning currently on pre-order from Amazon if they come with DRM protection they will be returned with a request for a refund.Given that reports indicate the DRM protection for Spore has already been cracked it seems ludicrous that the law abiding citizens who purchase the game are the ones who are made to feel like criminals and pay for the privilege too.I did think EA were getting better as a game company, but now I'm not so sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draconian DRM and too dumbed down.","review":"First and foremost, EA have successfully crippled this game with draconian DRM. It was cracked within a day and hence doesn't affect the pirates, but if you buy it then you'll have malware called SecuROM forced upon you along with limited activations and other such garbage.Once we get to the game itself, it could have been excellent, but instead it's very dumbed down. It's basically 5 basic mini-games stuck together, each quite different from the others. Plus most of the design decisions you make in the game are useless. It's just the statistics of bits which matter, not how many of those bits you have, how they look or anything like that.If it had no DRM, it may be worth trying out, but with the DRM this is one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not with my money","review":"I was so excited about this game - then I read the details!There is no way in the world that I am paying for a game that won't last long enough for me to play it properly!I have needed to re-install Windows twice so far in the last two weeks (we all know that this happens sometimes!) and even Microsoft recommend that for best performance Windows should be re-installed regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not very interesting sandbox locked in a cage of DRM","review":"There's an undeniable charm to creating creatures and taking them through to the end... the first few times. Unfortunately due to the simplistic nature of the 4 stages of growth, there's very little actual gameplay here. Good for a few days of entertainment, but the lack of depth, challenge, and variety causes boredom to set in quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spore","review":"Bought this game on day of release, the installation code was accepted during install, but flagged as invalid when registering on internet, so I can only play it offline. A complete Joke!!Further reading on the DRM setup where i can only install the game 3 times before having to ask EA for permission is ridiculous. I rebuild my PC a few times a year to clear out any garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you bite the hand that feeds...","review":"When are companies such as EA going to get a clue??? Don't they realize that all DRM (especially totalitarian DRM such as SecuROM *should be SecuR4PE*) does is punish the people who actually paid for the game... Jeez, I could just get on ***Torrent and download a copy that I wouldn't ever have to activate, and I wouldn't have to pay for it! Maybe we should all just do that... Then maybe someone sitting in a comfy leather chair in front of a luxurious mahogany desk will get a clue... *end rant*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Game","review":"I already beat The last stage on one of the planets, and this game is amazing, except, some parts in the creature stage are repetitious, In all The game gets 4 stars and im going to have to refer to the flash mob here,and say DRM is the reason for 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"The first part of the game was a blast: Swimming around in the ocean, eating other little bugs, then moving on land.

The DRM is still buckwaas (look it up, its Punjabi) because it's yet another legal virus that run in the background without ever asking for your approval. On a closing note, let your lil bro/sis work through the first 3 worlds. Then in space age, conquer other cities by depriving hem of economic resources, only to throw religious propaganda (not propa-ganja) at a later time. Does it sound familiar to anyone out there in the middle east?"},{"rating":"1","title":"defective by design","review":"Honestly, this game was the most fun I have had with a game in a long time.

I payed for it I should be able to play it whenever I want for the rest of my life.Not only that I've seen on the newer videocards Spore crashes about every 30 minutes(in space age) with no auto save or quick save options.

Unfortunately, due to the draconian DRM, I won't risk losing the ability to play a game I purchased if I upgrade my computer or have to reinstall the operating system, nor do I want to have the DRM software running continuously in the background degrading performance and stability. I'm sad not to be able to experience Spore but the DRM gives me no choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS BEFORE BUYING","review":"Many people here posted 1-star reviews due to the DRM in Spore. Now, many people are posting positive reviews because they seem to enjoy the game. Guess what? The positive review people DO NOT UNDERSTAND what they're saying. People are posting positive reviews because they do not understand the nature of DRM. They don't notice the problems now, but they will - because DRM can shut down your ability to play the game you bought. Anyone who gives Spore a positive review simply doesn't understand the horrible problems that come with any game which contains DRM.The 5-star reviews are all written by people who do not understand how computers work, or what DRM does deep-down within your computer. In short, these people are ignorant. Don't be ignorant. Don't buy this game. You WILL regret buying Spore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Install","review":"This game can't be installed unless you let it install a rootkit which phones home to EA periodically.

It is so easy that it is not fun. It is more of a simulation than a game. The different stages of this game have some similarities to various video game genres but each stage is like its own terrible game. The stages aren't even glued together very well either. On top of all that even after spending $50 you don't really own the game because of the DRM. You only get 3 installs and if you run out and call them they will think you are a pirate. Also EA has terrible customer support as usual. Do not buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is a failure","review":"I wanted to play catch.This wasn't just going to be a normal game of catch.This was going to be an incredibly innovative game of catch, where I crafted the ball myself, and when I finally was able to throw the ball, it would changed based on how I crafted it. Then, catch would adapt to how I threw the ball in the first place. Then it would share my ball with everyone else who was playing their own version of catch.Then I found out that I could only play catch in my back yard, and if I wanted to play with anyone else, they would have to sit on my shoulders.DRM doesn't work.

If you wish to install it a 4th time, you will need to call up EA and beg them that you are not a criminal or pirate and if they feel like it, they will allow you to install. This is the biggest insult to any legitimate gamer I have seen yet from EA or any company. I waited three years for this game, and would like to play it, but I refuse to support this ridiculous attitude to fair usage, so I will pass thanks EA. Why would anyone pay to be inconvenienced when they could download the game illegally and not be hit by all this nonsense? What should have been a bright highlight for PC gamers has now turned into another nail in the coffin for the medium. Hopefully this DRM fiasco will affect their sales. Poor Will Wright, being saddled with EA as a publisher..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DRM will ruin even the best games.","review":"SecuROM DRM is crippling and does not uninstall with the game. The game itself is fun supposedly, if lacking. I had a terrible time installing, and also sharing the game with my brother is not possible, since EA has decided that you need to purchase a second copy of the game for that. In retrospect it would have probably been easier to wait until someone cracks the DRM and play the hacked version instead. Way to ruin a good thing EA, thanks for all the hype, if I can get it to run without SecuROM crashing my computer, I'll be happy to give it more \\"fun\\" stars.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great product ruined","review":"EA has ruined a great game by it's greed. The DRM on it would be kindly described as draconian. If the install limit was not bad enough they limit the number of accounts you can have per product. I enjoyed the game, but cannot in good conscience recommend it to any other buyers unless EA ever decides to remove or opt for a less restrictive DRM. It is unfortunate that the best option for people who want to experience this game and don't want the worst sort of DRM shoved down their throat is to pirate it. Hopefully someday EA will learn that people don't have to put up with being treated like criminals if they become criminals, but until then they are their own worst enemy 1/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lost sale due to DRM","review":"I was going to buy this game but refuse to support any game or product with this sort of DRM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this game","review":"I was interested in this game but since it has DRM I will not buy this game ever, and I recommend others not do buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES!","review":"When I preordered this game months ago, I was aware that game publishers used really annoying DRM schemes, but upon receiving the game, I was shocked at the effort EA made to render Spore unplayable. Had I known, I wouldn't have bought it to begin with. I'll chalk this one up to a hard lesson learned. What happened to Maxis? Remember the good old days when they just made fun toys with great extras? A Maxis game was worth buying just for the user manual and the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call EA to complain about DRM","review":"I came to Amazon today to buy this game, but after reading about the DRM issues I've decided not to give EA any money. I do not support companies with such anti-consumer policies (e.g. Sony), and I boycott them.Warning other people [here] about EA's DRM is good, but complaining directly to EA's management is better. I called them and said, \\"I was going to buy Spore today, but instead I've decided to boycott your company's products for the foreseeable future because of your aggressive DRM practices\\".I recommend that you do the same. To find their phone number: Go to EA's website and click \\"corporate info\\" at the bottom of the page. In the new window, click \\"investor relations\\", then \\"more information\\", and \\"contact information\\". This will display the main phone number for the headquarters in Redwood City, CA.Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"BioShock all over again...","review":"A short while ago I purchased BioShock, a program that uses the same DRM software as this product. When I first got BioShock I was super excited because it was the first PC game I could afford in quite a while. I installed the game and quickly found out that my graphics card was not up to par. SO, being the guy I am, I went out and got a new graphics card. Not much, I think it was on sale for $50.Well, I got the new graphics card installed and updated all my drivers just so I could be sure the game would be good to go. When I launched the game for a second time BioShock decided that I needed to reactivate the game. So, in just getting the game installed and running for the first time I used 2 of the 3 activations.I was so paranoid that my computer would crash or that the game would be reactivated I didn't turn my computer off or restart for a week. The game sounds great but sadly I will just have to wait until this game goes to the discount rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price.","review":"This game is not going to knock your socks off with its amazing features. However, I have enjoyed playing it, and I feel like I got my money's worth. I should mention that I am simulation game player in general, so this game was right up my alley. There are a few frustrating things while playing. Specifically, the creature creator mode was not as user-friendly as I would have liked. Overall, it is a decent game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"I enjoy playing this game, the characters are cute, and I enjoy selecting body parts when I level up.

Why? Because it's a quality game. Now, I'm already regretting my purchase, because I enjoy the game, and that means that at some point, I'm going to have to fork over 50 dollars more if I want to continue playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game, but with flaws...","review":"This game is so much fun. It really is unique and original. However, when I graduated the cell stage to the creature stage, the game crashed and i had to start back at an earlier level.So I give it 5 stars of fun, and 4 because it crashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, a few flaws, but still great!","review":"DRM simply means Digital Rights Management. You have to have an internet connection for initial activation, and you cannot activate the game more than three times. I knocked off a star in my review because of this DRM, but I would not rate the game only a star as many are doing. The actual game is awesome! Really awesome! If you like Sim City 4, then this is for you. NOT AN RPG! THIS IS A SIMULATION GAME! I found the cell stage to be easy fun, while the space stage was hard, and full of things going on. (Kind of frustrating at times.) The game has some glitches, but the overall experience was fantastic! You get to control cells you create, as well as creatures. You also get to command the actions of a tribe, and create cities. Finally, you create your own spaceship, and travel the galaxy! Have not tried the internet feature, so I cannot comment on that. Great game, lots of fun.

So I just downloaded it to avoid all the DRM issues people are having. Even though it was free for me, it still sucked so I just uninstalled it. The game is pretty boring to a hardcore gamer like myself. Simulation and AI engines are weak. I think EA released this game before it was done to help with their financial issues.

Save your money and don't believe the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM scheme makes this $50 dollar rental a rip-off","review":"The DRM scheme only allows three installs. I have had to reinstall Sims2 more than 6 times on my computer. This makes the game effectively a rental.

After your 3 activations limit is hit, you'll be forced to find a pirated copy to even play your own account. I think it's disgusting how EA is trying to make more money by attempting to get their customers to re-purchase this game. I reformat/reinstall the OS on my computer every 3-4 months. My game would be useless in less than a year. Ridiculous!DRM is a menace to society.

It was an extremely creative and risky endeavor for Will Wright, and I think he delivered admirably. And for the most part, it's just plain fun.Unfortunately, I can't judge on the gameplay alone. The security measures that are shackled to this title reach a new level of customer abuse in the name of anti-piracy. I also know for a fact that pirates had already cracked and started distributing the game before it even officially released.

The DRM is frustrating for exactly ONE of the pirates, and for ALL the rest of the legitimate customers. The only people it doesn't bother are ALL of the pirates, and the few customers that don't realize how much simpler and faster the pirated version is.I feel like the people who add DRM to their games are saying \\"The beatings will continue until morale improves.\\" The game itself was interesting, but hardly earthshattering.

We want to buy your products when you make something that looks as good as this, but you are driving us away by wrapping them up in DRM that complicates installing and running the game and in too many cases breaks the game for the people who bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"is it just me or does securom look like scrotum?","review":"So EA killed just about every game on console machines by dumbing down the \\"sequels\\" and releasing more sequels because people stopped buying them. Now EA is killing the few good PC games that were new and unique. Pitty, but at least there are other fantastic properties out there to actually own.I was actually going to buy this for many of my friends, as this is the time for birthdays, but i think we'll all play a different game instead (It probably won't be the new red alert).EA may feel like they can't win. And the answer is yes, you can't win with your current tactics. But at least you'll own most of the franchises even though they don't sell. There's a good win!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre game but installs malware on your computer","review":"A rather lacklustre evolution simulator that unfortunately comes bundled with incredibly restrictive DRM and installs a virus-like rootkit called SecuROM on your PC. The rootkit is authorized to call corporate servers and send specifics about your computer to Electronic Arts. It also disables some programs (WinDVD) and interferes with the operation of other programs (sometimes even anti-virus scanners) while using up system resources permanently. It cannot be removed, even if you uninstall Spore.Consequently, this game will be unusable a few years from now and the SecuROM DRM is considered a hazard to your PC's health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment...","review":"I have looked forward to Spore for years, only to find out it contains the equivalent of a company-sanctioned virus. A friend of mine installed it and can no longer burn (LEGAL) music CDs because of it. I can't say how disappointing it was to have to return this game before even getting it installed. I will be boycotting EA products until they see fit to fix this game and allow us to buy it instead of renting it. Please do not buy this game until EA sees its mistake and repairs it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt to block the secondary market","review":"As someone who purchases half of my games used, I cannot support a company that wishes to eliminate the resale market with their DRM.

Though the quality of the phases is uneven, (the only stage I truly disliked was the tribal) the experience as a whole is one that is not to be missed. Creature creation and evolution are engrossing, and the subtle technical wizardry that underlie it is convincing.However, the DRM is truly a shame, and such draconian efforts are surely contributing to the wane of computer gaming.

Video games are one of the few forms of media I actually think are worth the money spent. I'm a coder myself and I know a lot of work goes into these games, and I'm happy to support that effort. EA's inclusion of SecuROM malware in Spore has tainted what could have been a great piece of software, and discouraged me from ever supporting their games again.

I was quite dismayed to find no help/support pages on EA/Spore AT ALL (hopefully that's been fixed by now).I found the game itself interesting for about 2 hours and then it lost my interest - I never did get past the 2nd of 5 levels in the game.

Spore's DRM makes it so you have to reactivate every time you change a piece of hardware, when you upgrade your computer, or when EA decides that they want more money from you to keep on playing. And they achieve this by installing a malicious, insecure backdoor, akin to malware, that cannot be removed or destroyed. Many people have reported this has caused performance problems, crashes, or even data loss.And DRM does NOT work. Its only use is to make the game that you BOUGHT harder to play by imposing restrictions. Pirates are still copying this game. Spore has already been hacked in less than a few days of its release. Pirates out there are already playing the same game you bought, only that their version is BETTER because it has no stupid restrictions.I do now wish to pirate, nor do I wish to play an inferior version when I cough up $50+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draconian DRM ruins fun for all","review":"Unfortunately, what should have been an amazing game experience for gamers of all ages has been overshadowed by Electronic Arts' Draconian efforts with Digital Rights Management (DRM). As a consumer, it's important for you to understand that purchasing this game guarantees you an expiration timer which, when tripped, means you will never be able to play the game again. Essentially what you are doing is renting a game from EA which they can revoke the license to at any time without your consent.It's important for consumers to stand up to companies like EA and let them know that when we purchase their product we expect to be able to keep it and use it for as long as we like, not as long as they like.

Normally insults seem to be the way of the extreme, the lack-of this insane feature. However terse my language, SPORE is disappointing on two fronts.1) DRM. I am all for buying games and for paying the creator, but to limit the installations to 3 is like telling me when I buy a sound system I am only allowed to play 3 genre's of music.2) Simplistic gameplay with an unrealistic concept of conquering. I am in space phase right now, but the stages before this phase were nothing but a disappointment. Simplistic style of gameplay without many options for strategy made me feel like I was playing those old \\"Magic School Bus\\" games from my elementary era.

The one-star reviews are unnecessary.That said, Spore is a fantastic experience. If you like creating, then you'll find plenty to do here. The best part is that you can share your creations with others easily, either using the built-in Sporepedia or by simply sharing the data-embedded PNG files through emails or message boards.

When you destroy a product, such as SPORE, with the a DRM that only allows 3 installs, you are pushing normal, dedicated customers to start file sharing.

All of the people who are going to steal the game already have and they are playing the unhindered version right now. The rest of us get to choose to not buy it or rent a game from EA. In a given year, I probably upgrade something in my computer once or twice and reformat at least once in addition. That means I'd have to pay $50/year to play this game.... No thanks.

I'll start off by saying that I don't like the DRM thing any more than anybody else here does. However, I kind of have the feeling that if you buy a game with DRM, you don't really have the right to complain about it, because you knew it ahead of time.That said, Spore is boring as hell. The gameplay doesn't really seem very realistic and requires that you have an inhumanly long attention span.

Have to do more research, but so far we haven't been able to identify the problem. Old software, newer computer and operating system can be a problem, but if it isn't compatible, they should tell you.

I can even understand limiting the number of installs you can make with a game. But to be limited to 3 installs of a title, especially one as hyped as Spore, is infuriating. When I buy a game, I play it for several years, over numerous computer upgrades.

How many people are you trying to illegally share it with? Why would you need more than one or two at most? I have enjoyed learning the game and my knowledge of the game is evolving just like my creature. I can't wait to discover more about the game than I do know.

I give it 4/5 for the content of the game itself.Though not many people many agree with evolution, but being able to create from sketch a civilization is the first of its kind and the idea that this game stands for is a major creativity breakthrough that has been so lacking in game published recently (most of the most profitable games are sequels... COD4, GTA4, etc) This game definitely puts the innovations from Will Wright's simulation series into people's mind, again.While not mind-blowing, the graphic of the game is itself sufficient to present the structure of the game flawlessly.All the goods, however, doesn't make one poor decision of EA. It is obviously that the publisher is having a lot of loses because of piracy.

Although the basic premise behind it is rather simple (experiencing evolution through several stages of life), it gives players an unprecedented level of creative freedom.

It just simply doesn't work for me. The initial start of the game was interesting and entertaining as you are a single celled creature attempting to advance and develop. Relatively entertaining arcadish game play in trying to avoid other creatures.Once I 'advanced' to a land creature the game just ground to a halt as far as entertainment value is concerned. You basically run to other creatures, hit buttons to 'sing' or 'dance' or 'emote' or 'whatever' and they do the same thing back to you.

Most systems are highly repetitive and there is little reward past the creature stage for any well planned evolution of your creature. You're hyper carnivore can easily become a tree-hugging hippie in tribal with no consequences, nor do you have any advantage at combat. The same is true for the reverse situation.Very simply, it feel like the stunning revolution we were promised is a world stunningly empty of content.

The way the restrictions are enforced would be described as malware if it wasn't a big name company behind it. Without any notice, it installs software that checks to see what programs are running (you cannot run a virtual CD program and then Spore, even if you have shut down the virtual CD program). This code hides from all the normal ways of listing and shutting down processes, and it's not automatically uninstalled if you uninstall the game, and if you use the instructions given out to uninstall SecuROM, it only partially uninstalls...the reinstalls itself on the next reboot.

However, none of the the stages in the game are especially complex and won't tax a hard-core gamer.Sadly the game is crippled by the ridiculous DRM scheme that limits the number of installs you can make. Many users will legitimately find themselves stuck with an unplayable game after making changes or buying a new computer.

This was hyped as the most grand and ambitious game ever made, yet the actual gameplay is really simplistic, not fun, and not intuitive to comprehend. I actually had to read a walkthrough to understand what the heck I am suppose to do to get the silly gestures right in order to advance. Yet despite the boring simplistic gameplay, the overall design feels a lot more annoyingly complicated than it should. No wonder the price for this game has already plummeted. The game just isn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read reviews, won't buy.","review":"After seeing much of the hype I was prepared to purchase this title. I waited because I was in the middle of another game. I am very glad I waited. Amazon is a great site to be able to see the reviews and after reading many of them here I will not buy the game.

With that in mind I will not purchase this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great","review":"I had high hopes for this game when I read about it a year or so ago. It could have been the next generation of game. Unfortunately the publisher, Electronic Arts, decided to implement a draconian digital rights management scheme.

I still play games like The Incredible Machine, Loom, Sim City 2000, Civilization II, and Final Fantasy VII (from back when Eidos was distributing it for PC. Remember that!?) on a regular basis. I think Spore has the potential to be that sort of long-lasting game.But I've lost count of the times I've upgraded or replaced my computer since I started playing those older games. What would have happened to them if I had only been able to install them three times!? With a three-install limit, Spore wouldn't last me much more than a year or two much less the decade these other great games have. Sorry, I'm not signing on to a game with a built-in expiration date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is there no half star?","review":"This isn't a game, it's an abortion. Amazon recommends writing what I would have liked to know before buying the game. How about DRM that cripples my system and makes me feel like a Japanese schoolgirl in an adult anime, or the american people after Dubya got through with us? Or the limit to the number of times I can reformat my hard-drive and re-install the game. I bought the stupid game! Why does that make me a bad person?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another person who won't buy this now....","review":"I refuse to purchase this game, I was looking forward to it, but after reading about the absolute b.s. of the install and the downright MALWARE they install... absolutely no way.Congrats EA on ruining what would have been a great sale.

I had issues with the game play too as it feels to much like a little kids game.Do not buy this game as you are not buying it as much as you are renting it from EA. Could be fun game if cost was $30 or $40 and the DRM was gone or at least paired back a lot. EA has killed the game and Wil Wright you should be mad at EA for doing this to a game that could have done so well.I also bought Spore for the iPhone and I have to say it is an ok game but needs a lot of work. Way to much crashing.

I ponied up my money and waited forever for a download link to arrive--it never did.The combo of the absurd DRM and the 3-day wait for a software download purchased over the net make this perhaps the worst game release I have ever witnessed. The publisher's predatory attitude toward consumer rights is unacceptable and I would encourage anyone who reads this to avoid all EA products until such time as they stop installing malware on customers' computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, let us honest people just play the game.","review":"I'm sick of the intrusive DRM that EA in particular continues to inflict on those of us who just want to buy and play a game.I bought Sims 2 recently and didn't install it after I realized that the version I bought was all SecuROM-ed up.Likewise, I wouldn't buy and install Spore unless I had a spare computer just for it and other hosed up SecuROM games. And although I have lots of computers lying around, usually only one of them at a time is state of the art. I use my machine for too many other things that are actually important.If I could install Spore with a minimally intrusive DRM like what Direct2Drive uses, I'd already be playing it. But, EA, thanks but no thanks. And Will Wright, sorry, I don't know why you are joined at the hip with EA, but maybe you should become un-joined someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now matter how fun a game is DRM kills it","review":"Does not matter how fun the game is, the DRM removes any enjoyement. the DRM software and hidden OS changes make the game unplayable do to damage to your O/S.

It has been such a ridiculous experience there is absolutely no way i will buy anything from EA again, no matter how great the game is. I really want to support game developers by paying for games, they definitely deserve it, but if they keep publishing through EA I will have to resort to piracy. Not a threat, just a sad fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Buying Now!!!","review":"I have been very excited for this release. It has been my most anticipated game the past few years.

SecuROM and the DRM are pointless.They already had a great way to protect the game by making it only 1 customer account linked per CD key.

And what happens in the future when EA stops supporting the game or if they don't believe that you're reinstalling it? Well, then your installation set is useless.

I could not wait. I rushed out to buy it right after leading worship service the Sunday it was released.But then I found out about the DRM. It broke my heart to hear that I could only install this game on '3' computers. I am the kind of guy who is constantly upgrading my computer which triggers another install credit. I know I will be left with no more installs in only a couple of years.I feel like I have rented this game, not purchased it. I now know to check for this kind of DRM before I buy an EA product.

I encourage you to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac version performs terribly, Insane DRM","review":"The concept is great and all, but the delivery sucks.First of all, this isn't even a real Mac title. Sadly for Mac users, all of the games that EA releases for the Mac are \\"emulated\\" by Cider, a hyped up port of Wine to Darwin/OS X. This translates into EXTREMELY POOR performance on even decent Macs. I own a Macbook Pro 2.16 Dual Core with 2GB of RAM and the Radeon X1600 - and I simply could not play the tribal stage because of the terrible frame rate. Mac users are better off installing Windows on Boot Camp and then playing the game.Secondly, and more importantly, no more than 3 installations! DRM is proven to be harmful to both software and users - so why the hell would they make such a move? Congratulations Spore, you just won the title of the most pirated game ever - kind of contrary to what DRM is supposed to stop, isn't it? Well, you deserve it.Don't waste your time with this, there's plenty of other great stuff on Amazon worth your $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"We should have got Sim City 5 instead","review":"Life is tough for Will Wright. After coming out with The Sims he seems to have painted himself into a corner with his new release, \\"Spore\\". The game is novel at first and most of the fun to be had is found in the editor portions of the game. However, beyond that the game is too simplified and I feel that it doesn't have enough replay value. The final space stage is tedious. You never get more than 1 ship and there are constant disasters at your home world. Combat is really hard as well. The real problem with Spore is they had to put 5 scaled-down games in there, so no one part of the game really shines. I've been a fan of Maxis since the original Sim City, so I wanted to like this game. Sadly, I can't give a good recommendation. The whole DRM situation and vice-like grip that EA now has on the title is another downside. I would say, stay away from this one. Sim City 4 is much better. It's years after release and I'm still playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reinstalled windows a few times now I can't install it","review":"I reinstalled windows a few times while having trouble with some hardware issues. After everything was working, I tried installing this game and was told that I have already installed it on too many computers and would never be able to install it again!

Of course, EA has shown how they value their customers. If you build your own systems, or ever plan on upgrading to a new machine, AVOID games by EA.It is too bad Maxis could not have partnered with a decent distributor, instead of EA...

The publisher of this game has a screw loose!EA's insistence on punishing a paying customer to play their game is unnecessary and arrogant. While the hype for Spore has been incredible, and hence the percent of pirated copies that statistically will occur will result in large numbers and losses, a DRM the likes of SecureROM discourages paying customers more that it deters pirates. No matter how secure the DRM, there will be ways around it.

This new business model is going to kill EA unless they wake up to our needs and expectations and respect the users. There are plenty of users that buy the game, despite piracy.

If they manage to mess that one up, they are done forever in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"If you were planning on buying SPORE, DON'T! This game is only mildly entertaining. The most horrible stages of all are the creature stage where you run around repeating monotonous actions over and over again. The tribal stage sucks even more, I found it confusing and the actions of my tribesman sluggish. The worst part of this game is its Digital Rights Management. You can only install it 3 times before asking for another \\"license\\". Apparently this license doesn't matter because I know thousands of people have already downloaded it illegally, leaving all the legit people who actually bought it (AKA me) feeling stupid. Don't buy this game or you will be disappointed after 4 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I went out and bought this game the day it came out. I later discovered the horrendous DRM. I am very disappointed and I will not be purchasing other EA products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped it, Waited for it, Played it, HATED it.","review":"As a college student, $50 dollars isn't the easiest to come across, but boy did the media hype this game up. So I go an buy it, and wow I was awfully disappointed. After going through the awful, most terrible experiences one has ever had to go through with DRM. Next is the hyped up game quality. Now, I have no time to rant, so I'll be as quick as the game's playability is. Easy, Pointless, Annoying, and oh God the DRM!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SecuROM (see below)","review":"After going through this SecuROM nightmare once already, there is no way I will purchase another product that uses this DRM. SecuROM does way more than \\"protect\\" just this game -- it also prevents users from burning various DVDs and CDs, logging attempts and sending this to some other computer on the internet. There's more, but that should be enough! If you want to limit the abilities of your PC, make it slower, open it up to rootkit exploits, and remove your privacy, then go ahead and buy this game.The SecuROM removal procedure takes a long time and is a real pain, and sort of leaves one wondering if it was actually removed. You can't even play these games if you remove SecuROM, or it will reinstall it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not buy with DRM","review":"I really want this game, but I mess with my machine's installation too much to worry about useless DRM. Like others mentioned, relying on a publisher to ALLOW the use of a game I PURCHASED is more like renting than what I believe in. Put barriers in place for the people that copy it (and they will never stop the determined ones) but it is an insult to punish the people that want to support the developer of the game!I am not an avid gamer, not enough time in the day for that, but I really have liked this developer ever since the Maxis days with Sim City. I would love to support them with my purchase.Hopefully EA Games rethinks their position and release a less draconian version. Until that happens I will be staying far away from this game. Been burned way to many times with DRM to even try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper","review":"My son bought this on release day and played it to death.The game covers a lot of ground, and is quite entertaining, at least once. Each game stage is very simplistic. I can't see playing it for long like most sandbox games. This is more like a tried it, done that, well let's play with creatures game. It is as if Creature Creator was the apex.Rating it down for draconian copy protection (DRM) by EA. You have to be connected to the internet to install and play the first time.I would suggest waiting until it hits the bargain bin or the DRM is removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"The only cool feature in this game is the creature creator, which you can get separately for $5. The actual game involves 5 rather boring single player games, first two action games and then three strategy games, as your species progresses from single-celled organism to a sentient species capable of space travel. None of the games stands out, and some are downright dull. The others have been done before, much better. This game completely fails to live up to the hype surrounding it.It's also one of the first games to use EA's new call-home activation, which lets end-users activate the program on at most 3 computers. Changing hardware can make one computer count more than once. You have to contact EA to install again. Even if the game were good (Which it isn't), I would advise against buying it to try and discourage use of this horrible DRM scheme. I have nothing against corporations protecting their copyrighted material, but DRM should never cause serious issues for legitimate users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are customers being treated like criminals?","review":"For one reason or another, EA hasn't learned from its mistakes in the past. I fully intended to buy this game but was disappointed to learn that it was laden with restrictive DRM.

I'd avoid this game at all costs until Electronic Arts removes the draconian DRM. The pirates don't use it, why should I pay for it and be saddled with their spyware/DRM?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but flawed game crippled by idiotic DRM","review":"Like many other reviews on this site, my thoughts are pretty much constricted by EA's simply idiotic decisions regarding DRM. Even many of the music studios got over their objections to MP3s and relented from their obsession with DRM - why can't EA?All it does is hurt legitimate customers. The pirates already found a way around before the game even hit the shelves. By making legit customers into criminals by default, EA makes their product unacceptable. Get over it and you'll get customers again, EA."},{"rating":"1","title":"spore works today, but how about the next minute.","review":"Spore's great, once you are actually able to use it.Since it is DRM enabled, what happens when it becomes your favoritegame and the company is no longer able to afford to keep theirDRM servers running? You are SOL. I can play games created 10 years agoby other companies, but just forget about spore. It is around only as long as EA is willing to support it. 2 years? 3 years? maybeI refuse to be locked into a game where my ability to play it is completely in the hands of someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long awaited DRM laden game that I will not be purchasing","review":"I loved the Civ series right from Civilization, Sid does an excellent job designing games but when EA is allowed to load the DRM known as SecuROM v7 onto the game it's just not worth it any longer. Being locked into 3 installs max verified by some online server that who knows how long will be running (I still play Civ 1) ruins the game for me. Several people have mentioned that this seems similar to Sony's rootkit fiasco and I defiantly agree. Keep in mind that if this game quits functioning or your anti-virus won't let it install (DRM is often essentially a virus) you CAN\\"T return the game, your stuck with it!Don't let this DRM take over your computer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two problems with an otherwise great game-","review":"Problem #1: DRM.Problem #2: EA.Take those two giant flaws out of the picture and you've got a great game.Such a pity I looked forward to this game for so long, only for it to surmise to this.Shame on you EA."},{"rating":"1","title":"So my son can't play?","review":"If I buy this for $50 my son can't play if I create an account.

Due to a computer glitch Spore was released almost a full week early in Australia legitimately. Only a couple of days after these mistakes a fully pirated and cracked version of Spore began circulating the Torrents and Newsgroup by Reloaded.This should be more then enough proof that DRM does nothing to slow down hackers. Being a hacker (in other areas of computing) I can assure you that the typical hacker mindset is only encouraged by stuff like this. Hackers like to destroy security measures that \\"challenge\\" their abilities.All the DRM is doing is hurting the users. The pirates not only have easy access to the game but they had it before the game was even officially released globally. DRM didn't even stop an early leak from showing up pirated on the internet, do you really think it has any effect at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless thanks to DRM.","review":"Because of the DRM, the game is essentially a rental. And to get more activations, you'd have to contact EA support to get them to reset it.So basically, you can't even resell the game to anyone. And if you ever wanted to go back and play it a few years later, you might not be able to, because you ran out of activations or EA shutdown their reset \\"service.\\"Let's not forget all the system instability and security issues that SecuROM brings. It has a long record of screwing up systems and security holes. It has no place in a computer.I don't see how the DRM helps to limit piracy or do anything except piss off legitimate customers. You're better off pirating the game than you are buying it thanks to the useless draconian DRM scheme EA decided to implement.Show EA what you think of their ridiculous DRM scheme and spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM Sneak Attack!","review":"I recently purchased Spore from my local Wal-Mart, because I have been looking forward to playing this game for a long time. I installed the game, and then had computer troubles that have forced me to reformat my hard drive 4 times in the last week, and now the game has LOCKED ME OUT!!!I was really looking forward to enjoying this game, and from what i did get to play, it was an alright game. However, the DRM crippleware has severely impacted my customer experience, and I doubt that I will ever purchase a title from EA again. $50 for a week worth of gameplay! what a way to spend money! They should indicate, ON THE BOX, that there is a 3 installation limit on the game, burying the line listing that particular nuance of the contents of the disc in section 6, paragraph 4, line 5 of the EULA that the majority of consumers do not read is not the way to say we told you about the DRM. Thumbs down EA, Thumbs way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor form.","review":"Just as we as consumers are trying to assert our rights to privacy and to legitimate ownership or licensing, you have to admit that this short sighted activation will never hold in the future. I somtimes pull out my cd of Simcity 2000 and install the 1 minute install to play for 3 hours. That's what Maxis was and is all about. EA is ruining all that they tried to be with these moves. I'm returning my copy since I doubt that in 3 years, I'll be able to reactivate my \\"quite legit\\" copy of the software.So EA.. congrats on stifling Maxis and their creative possibilities.. Your greed to stop some pirates did nothing more than turn off thousands of actual purchases here and will turn away thousands of others as word of this gets out.I bet Maxis is happy that you're at the helm and they can look forward to the same sales stopping efforts in the near future.Oh and where is my Madden 09?.. I have a Rumblepad and wanted to play.. That about piracy too?~J"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mile wide, an inch deep","review":"Widely hyped and highly anticipated, Spore turned out to be a fairly large letdown for me. While the premise of guiding a civilization from the cellular stage all the way to space faring is excellent, the gameplay is largely simplistic, repetitive, and boring.Casual gamers may very well enjoy it, but it's not likely to hold the more hardcore contingent's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxis majorly blunders","review":"I paid 55 dollars to download off EA's website and never saw any warnings that I was only renting the game. I couldn't register the game so I was forced to reinstall, which I tried twice. So now I cannot play the game. DRM may be responsible for my issue, I have lost all respect for EA, Maxis and Will Wright and will never buy a game from them(except EA because they own everything). Thankfully the pirated version works great but no online content or game patches. The gameplay is pretty fun, except civilization phase. The Galactic phase eventually becomes unbeatable or annoying due to being attacked and biological disasters. Also there is no real freedom or pacifism in Galactic phase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since my first was removed","review":"Since my first negative review was removed, I ma-... Wait just a moment.

I've been looking forward to this game for what seems like forever, but it was a massive disappointment. Game play is shallow and the design feature, while extremely well done, got really boring. By the time you've finished the civilization stage, not only have you redesigned your character countless times, but you've designed 9 vehicles and 4 buildings. The first building was alright. Same with the first vehicle. But when you're going on 7 vehicles and you find out you have to design another one, you start to wonder whether this is a game or a CAD program.I got to the Space Age within about 4 hours of play, and once there, it's hugely mundane. This game could have been amazing. Instead, it was short, disappointing and, on the whole, definitely not worth any more than $5, let alone $50. This is definitely a game to listen to Yahtzee about - pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: SecuROM","review":"I could rattle on endlessly about how quickly I lost interest in Spore, its limited overall strategies (aggressive, or passive), the tendency of past decisions to pigeonhole you into a single strategy, the lack of depth of any kind except for what your units look like, or any degree of gameplay complexity that might require forethought or skill, etc, etc, etc, but that would all just make it a mediocre game, not a terrible one.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little great game","review":"The game is great, i've bought the gallactic ed. months before the release, the expectation was very high, and then...

There was no mention of it anywhere on the net prior to release, or if there was, I was unaware. It's sad that EA has gone to such great lengths to impose restrictions on the game, instead of focusing their powers on increasing the user experience, or promoting it.

Luckily I didn't waste money on that additional time. The first stage is like pacman, the second stage really isn't much better, the third stage is a boring RTS game with no strategy, and, finally, the fourth stage has some neat ideas but its essentially like playing a very dumbed down version of Civilization.There's no real creature interactions and most disappointingly of all there is nothing even remotely resembling evolutionary mechanisms.

Permanent RootKit from SecuROM!","review":"Hi,Based on having the Spore game simply stop working a few months after installation and then trying to fix it, this MIT graduate can give you a few hints:1. This installation leaves behind a rootkit that cannot be easily removed. To remove it you have to go into Windows \\"RegEdit\\" function. If you make an error while using regedit, you could end up having to re-install your operating system.2. EA's online help info in this area is pretty useless.3. Kids do like the game, but it is simply not worth your time or the risk to your PC. There are reasonably credible reports on the web indicating damage to the operating system in some machines from the rootkit.4. My family will no longer purchase ANY PC games from EA, or any other vendor, with this form of Digital Rights Management (DRM). We suggest you do the same and let EA and the others know about your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not buying yet","review":"I'm not buying this game until the DRM copy protection is removed.

I WOULD buy Spore and Red Alert 3, but only if they remove this overly aggressive copy protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not good","review":"Many of the people reviewing this game are mad about the DRM. And many are disappointed that the game was changed considerably from the trailers the designer showed during the years the game was being developed. That's why they rated the game as one of the worse ever.However if you just look at the game itself, forgetting about the DRM and the hopes some people had for the game, what you find is a game that's just not good.The game gives you very few options during each stage. Or at least very few options that are meaningful. You can change the way you look but the way you look has little to no effect on game play. Much of the game play is forced and gets old quickly. The computer controlled creatures never do anything interesting or surprising, but that's mostly because they never do anything.As other reviewers have said you can find better games for free on the web."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is bad for legit users","review":"Spore not only has a piece of software that runs in the background, but it only allows 3 installations EVER.

Nothing too spectacular once you get over the creature creator. In short, the meat of the game is the creativity offered in the create a creature mode. Other than that the games that your creature occupies is a very simplistic. Most everyting is cosmetic in terms of how you equip your creature and how the gameplay differs.WARNING: I built a new computer and now the game fails to registers due to the insane digital rights manamgent. The game is essentially worthless. Then again, given the gameplay, it isn't a huge loss. This software sets a very bad precedent in terms of people who are honest and pay good money for games.

I've actually played through it a few times, but never past the creature stage.It's not fun, and it's completely underwhelming given that it's coming from my favorite game designer of all time. Any potential depth that this game could have had has been removed from it during development. I would have been fine with that had the creature editor been fun to play with. It isn't. The few creatures I have created have turned out to be ugly, graceless blobs and I am utterly flabbergasted at the minimal texture options here. The game is way too graphically intensive and has crashed my computer a few times. And WHERE is the AutoSave?! It's practically a required feature on all games these days.I'm making these comments independently of my feelings on the horrible DRM.

I started to read the reviews, surprised at all the 1 stars...then I stepped back. For those complaining that the DRM shouldn't be reviewed with the game, it IS part of it and does affect the game in and of itself. For myself, I asked a friend who had bought it to let me try it out at their house...definitely a disappointment with very little link between the various evolution stages. It's very much a kids game...even though I think my kids are too intelligent to find it fun. As for the DRM...with all the trouble my friend has had with their game, their 3 installs will be gone shortly. Best of all, SecuRom is sending information from his computer to EAgames...You have to ask yourself if $50 was a good price to let EA spy on your computer and give you a fancy coaster...or if they should be paying you for that information."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DRM is ridiculous","review":"This game is fun, especially if you are into designing things.

And calling some EA outsourced flunky to convince them to let me install it beyond the 3-install limit doesn't cut it either.All these 1 star reviews can't be wrong, and they are not.

My policy has always been the same: I will not pirate software. Because I will not, I also expect software companies and game developers to not treat me like a f***ing criminal.I've passed up a few games in the past over this issue, but none of them were are attractive to me as Spore.

However, if current trends continue (which they probably will), I will be calling and pleading for EA to let me reinstall the game I purchased. If this game has the staying power I expect it to, I could very well be calling EA again in 5 years time.

I haven't bought a single Sony product since the rootkit debacle.

Given the 10-year advantage of Spore, I expected the graphics to be much better. Spore also ships with the Sony rootkit SecuROM, which as an anti-copy program that will bork your PC and requires basically a disk wipe to eradicate it. Other recent games that have used SecuROM are Armed Assault, S.T.A.L.K.E.R (European), Neverwinter Nights 2, Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, Tomb Raider Anniversary (demo and full version), Overlord, BioShock (demo and full version), Hellgate: London (single player mode), Rayman Raving Rabbids (PC version) and World in Conflict.

Bluntly, when Digital Restrictions Management systems fail - and they always will - they screw over paying customers. Meanwhile, no DRM system is crack proof, so the hacking community will simply rise to the challenge once again. All SecuROM does is provide the corporate game publishers with a security blanket against the piracy bogeyman at the expense of their paying customers.I'd love to buy, install, and play Spore on my computer, but the real price is a rootkit."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM...ha!","review":"I will wait until this game is in the 9.99 bin because no one wants to deal with the DRM.

If you are a carnivore you will go around killing animals (which sounds more found than it really is), and if you are a herbivore you have to go around dancing and tapping making friends ?!? I wonder if a creature does get smarter by dancing and singing???Evolution is completely irrelevant in the game, you may have a creature with 6 feet and at any moment decide to have only one foot then you can go ahead. In reality evolution is a gradual process and prior mistakes may severely affect your future (you can become an evolutionary dead end like the Neanderthals).So in conclusion, do not buy it. It's boring and in my opinion extremely overpriced, maybe for 10 or 15 bucks sure I would give it 2 or 3 starts, but for 50$ I expect something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"I waited half a decade for this? Go back and watch the 2005 spore videos to see what the game could have and should have been. Its been reduced to a collection of mini games, and frankly the tribal mini game stage is terrible.

The sludge/creature stages are interesting, though the creature combat gets tiresome and the control scheme is terrible.At the tribal stage the game basically takes an enjoyment nosedive.Given that it takes ~ a few hours max to get to this point the game is pretty bad value for money.

Off the get go the game was interesting and engaging. The game starts being awful when it lasts less than one hour on each stage and on the hardest difficulty offers less of a challenge than taking a nap for even the most casual gamer. The game lacks depth. Perhaps if they stuck to the original game concept with a more prehistoric and less googley eyed squeaky baby theme, they would have put out a decent product. What's with only allowing you to install 3 times? I do NOT recommend this product. I'm currently trying to pawn it off to an unsuspecting friend for half price. OVERALL: Biggest let down ever. I can't believe this game actually got PC game of the year in some places... What a disappointment. All who rate this game with 5 stars are not being honest with themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another game I won't be playing because of draconian DRM.","review":"The DRM included in this game pretty much makes it unattainable for me.

I don't understand the need that EA feels to only allow 3 installs before turning the game off. Thats just too limiting.It doesn't bother me so much that it HAS DRM, but that the DRM is so limiting. And has so few activations. I'd consider buying it if there were 5. I'd buy it, if there were 10. I'd also consider buying it with 3 if it cost less.

Even when not playing the game!+ The DRM will be cracked, and then the pirates will have a great time with the game, without any of the downside that the paying clients have to endure.EA, why should I pay to have an experience that will be more negative than a pirated version?Since I can't buy the game, and can't play it, I get no fun.

This would be OK if it were just the 2 of us but I'd like to let my son play too. But with 3 of us we're limited to 2 planets per and will end up unlocking things that the other 2 haven't earned yet etc...This user limitation is just dumb.

Seeing the demo videos and trailers... and it coming from the Sim master himself, I figured this game would be tremendous fun.I tried the Creature Creator utility (sold seperately) and had some fun with it.Sadly, they managed to mess up this game. The creatures do not evolve, they only Level Up. Aside from the ability to customize the LOOK of your characters to a marvelous degree, the ABILITIES stay the same. If you level up two completely different-looking creatures - say one with blades for hands and bipedal... and the other some gentle looking thing with 6 legs... guess what? They BOTH have the SAME abilities to hunt, walk, mate and Level Up if you play them the same way.I think that's the biggest failure of this game.

That is until I found out about the DRM it uses. I will not buy software with DRM ever again, particularly if they limit the installs to something ridiculous like 3.Update (9/12/08): I just learned that EA limits purchasers to one account per household even though the manual states that multiple accounts may be used per installation. What does that mean? Well, say you have 4 people in your house that want to play spore on 4 different accounts.

But it will cost you 5 gigs, 50 bucks, you have to insert the CDROM every time, and you can only install the game 3 times. If you upgrade your video card, that counts as an install too.Please note, all of these costs (except the 5 gig) only come with a legally obtained copy, like I have. If you are going to buy this game, prepare to be punished for doing the right thing.If EA was so concerned with piracy, they should have just stuck to consoles. They are apparently too greedy for that, so now they have a product on the market that people have mixed feelings about. It's not too late EA, do the right thing and fix it!

What securom does is prevent you from installing the game more than the number of times the company wants you to. It is a difficult to remove, wastes resources, and can prevent you from playing the game you paid for. After installing 3 times you must call EA customer support and beg them to let you play the game you bought. This is not a toll-free call.This game should be considered a rental. I suggest not buying this game, and if you do, keep in mind that you may not be able to play it in the future. I bought the game but am returning it because I don't want to end up with a game I can't play because I got a new computer.As for the game itself, I find creating things with it very fun, but there is really no story and even on hard it's not very challenging unless you intentionally handicap yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo on EA","review":"Boo on this game's implementation of DRM.

I installed the game without a hitch, it took about fifteen minutes to run the installer, and the game will not open. It shows the process in the Task Manager but the game never completely opens, I've tried running it as an administrator and in XP compatibility mode with no luck. Luckily I've not had an issues with the DRM (I would not have bought the game if I had read these reviews before, my fault for not doing my research) since I can't even open the game. I did not buy Spore from Amazon, I bought it locally and the store won't take an opened game back, so I guess I'm out $50. My suggestion is don't even bother buying the game, if you can actually play it the DRM will screw everything else up.

However, now that I know about the DRM I will return the game as soon as it gets delivered. I routinely uninstall and reinstall games over many years. I play until I beat the game or get tired, then let some time pass until I pick it back up again. With this new DRM system, I can no longer do that. The game will stop working at some point because I've reached their limit of 3 installs or because they go through another round of server shutdowns and remove the activation server.I'm sure the game will be great, but I will return the game when it comes in. If they remove the DRM I will consider buying it then. As for other EA games, I will never buy another one that contains DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is a dealbreaker","review":"I have been really psyched about this game for a while and have followed its development since the first public demos.

After the installation limit of 3 was reached the DRM took over and now the game will not even open with my registration code. I even contacted EA and they were of no help. It is quite disappointing that a paying customer cannot play the game they purchased. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I looked forward to Spore for almost 4 years, and after all this time I'm already bored with it. All the cool stuff we heard about during development is only there to bind together some mediocre mini-games, and the game plays through almost exactly the same regardless of the choices you make in evolving your creature.The DRM certainly doesn't help any, either. EA shows once again that they're unwilling to step up into modern times by adopting copy protection methods that are friendly and safe for their paying customers to use.If you want to be bored to tears within a week and don't mind EA's hostile attitude towards their customers, then this is the perfect title for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"$49.99 to much for game rental","review":"$49.99 + DRM is too much to pay when the game is only a rental after the DRM. $29.99 would be an acceptable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More EA PC Games for me","review":"I don't own consoles.

So for me, I'll just sit and wait until EA patches the DRM out of existence, until then - no way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing gameplay","review":"Maybe this game was marketed towards kids - but I found the game to be extremely unsatisfying and limp. The creature editor and the ability to customize your creatures and buildings etc seemed utterly pointless to me since they did not actually affect gameplay in any way - just a waste of time to amuse yourself since a meaner looking creature with more wings or a nastier tank with more lasers made no difference in gameplay.Overall it felt like a number of mediocre and shallow games (pacman, baby RTS and baby galactic empires) mashed together into one - I found myself wishing it would end.I would not recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Buying until DRM is gone","review":"I would love to own this game.

Don't buy it, and tell your friends and everyone you know not to buy it either","review":"Spore is the perfect example of corporatisation destroying creativity and innovation. Where we could have had a deep, complex, satisfying game, EA has delivered a dumbed-down, lowest-common-denominator piece of garbage.What's more, EA has surreptitiously bundled SecuRom, a piece of corporate spyware, along with Spore. SecuRom installs itself to your system kernel and cannot be removed even by uninstalling Spore, and can cause serious performance problems with your PC.Do not buy Spore. Do not buy any EA Games products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It was 2 days of boring play. After that I couldn't give the game more time and asked 7 years son-in-law to try it out. The ability to customize your character caught his attention for about 1 hour, then the game itself for additional 2-3 hours and then he asked \\"what else?\\" - the question I've been asking myself several times. For a game that was waited for many years, this is a total failure of Will Wright. I mean, how the creator of SimCity and Sims could get to such low-level boring game without visible AI - computer player is predictable and is not fun at all.Not worth buying, not even worth lending from your friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM will not allow the game to launch","review":"I was very excited with my initial purchase of this game... Spore really looked like a very fun, novel idea that had been long in the making.Though I read that there were DRM issues associated with Spore, I did not let it affect my decision to purchase the game. Well lo and behold, I installed the game on my high end Vista system, and I immediately get locked out it of by the DRM software SecuROM.I have sent 2 emails to EA, and we are still in the process of \\"unlocking\\" the game. I have owned Spore for 2 days, and have yet to play it.To Electronic Arts: when one of your customers pays $50 dollars for your software, please do not treat that person like a criminal by including DRM software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the game, but the DRM is broken","review":"The DRM on this game makes it a very frustrating gaming experience. A quick check of the torrent sites shows that it's already been cracked, so the only people who are suffering from the DRM are the legitimate customers.The game covers several genres: 2-D scroller, third-person explorer, two different RTS games, and finally a 4X space sim. The 4X is the most involved and complex game, and every habitable planet you visit has its own game going on. The other games are almost mini-games compared to the space section, and you can get through them in 5 or 6 hours tops. The 4X is the longest and most involved, and the control system is a little wonky, but overall it's very enjoyable.Cut the DRM and this would be a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draconian","review":"What could have been a fun game was ruined by repetition and a intolerably draconian reinstall policy.Don't buy this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lost Sale","review":"I came to purchase Spore, but after reading the reviews, I have decided not to purchase the game. Its an awful large expense for no more than 2 years of play, judging by EA's deactivation of other games. Any program that gives itself elevated system privileges is just asking to be targeted by a virus capable of serious damage. The activation limit does not bother me terribly, but being unable to separate my creatures from those belonging to others in my household is another inconvenience.In a way, this is actually two lost sales, as I will not be buying the upcoming Red Alert 3 unless the DRM is removed or is changed to be less invasive. I have purchased the previous installments in the series, and they easily rank among my favorite games, but I am choosing to vote with my wallet on this issue. Its just too bad that this had to happen to two amazing games."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more business for EA","review":"Well I thought the game was a lot of fun until someone informed me about the DRM. I don't care how EA defines their DRM and how they mince the words. Its obscene. They can claim its harmless but so did Sony when they had their rootkit issue.I will not be buying anything from EA for quite some time. Thank you EA for shafting legitimate customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say \\"No\\" to DRM","review":"DRM only punishes the legitimate user. \\"Pirates\\" have long since gotten around it. Boycott EA and any group that would punish its customers for the crimes of a few!! I have been looking forward to this game but now it has no place in my house, it's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure most of the 1-stars will be removed but...","review":"... they actually were useful to me, anyway. I had intended to purchase Spore, not realizing it used SecuROM. I purchased Bioshock, which used SecuROM, and to this day the disc is nothing more than expensive coaster because I've never been able to get its null-byted registry entries to work correctly in XP 64-bit Pro.Like I said, I imagine most, if not all, of the 1 stars below (and possibly mine as well) will get removed, but it saved me money at any rate. I really want to play Spore, but with this restrictive garbage included, I doubt I'll actually be able to, and I'm not willing to gamble another $50 to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother, Mac Users","review":"If you buy spore for mac, be prepared for disappointment. I put the disc in my computer, and get no playable response. I guess an Intel-based laptop with maxed out ram running leopard STILL isn't enough to meet system requirements.I would say i'm disappointed, but based on the rest of the reviews, I'm thinking the game isn't worth the bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM Woes","review":"I bought this game before I knew about the DRM it used. I figured after the backlash over Mass Effect that EA would get a clue, but I guess I put too much faith in them. First of all, you already make a Spore Account with the game on top of the DRM protection measures. It is over-cumbersome and redundant. The ironic part is that a week before the game was actually released there was a cracked drm free pirated version online. The protection failed before it was even implemented.Its a shame such a good game is crippled by EA's over zealous approach to piracy. Seriously the User generated content is enough incentive to get people to buy the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lost costumer","review":"As has been said multiple times: The DRM.If I purchase a game I'd like to be able to unistall/reinstall it as many times as I like on my system. If I want to do a reinstall of the game every day I should be able to without fear. That's why I pay 50$ to buy a game. I don't want a rental.I was really looking forward to this game but the DRM is just a deal breaker for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re: Business","review":"\\"....even if EA keeps the activation servers going, there IS going to be a time when EA will simply cease to exist because of financial issues or federal laws (like most business eventually do).\\"I truly hope so.

Customers being treated like potential criminals is not kewl."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was going to buy multiple copies....","review":"I heard about Spore in a game store about 8 months ago and it seemed extremely interesting. As I learned more about it, I decided that when it came out, I would buy copies for me, my daughter, and probably a friend of mine.However, after reading about the DRM in various venues, buying this game is not an option, nor is it for any other program with securom or DRM. I buy new computers and/or repurpose them frequently and if I buy software, I \\"own\\" it and will move it around between computers as I see fit or need. (\\"own\\" a license to use it on one computer at a time)Not only will I not buy this game, I have forbidden my daughter to do so with her laptop because of the DRM software that is reported to be installed. I'm not considering any comments about the game in my decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treated like a thief after buying this game","review":"Anti-piracy software embedded in this game left my son unable to play it even though he'd handed over his $50+tax, an error message appeared suggesting we were software pirate thieves.It is simply unacceptable for any digital rights management measure to prevent even one honest paying customer from using the product, particularly when no-one will issue a refund for opened software.So what happens now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't. Buy. This.","review":"I was looking forwards to this game, but... after learning about the steps they've taken to keep it from being piracy, hell no.Not only does a fourth installation require begging permission from an EA call center (which WILL stop functioning eventually - if only because EA itself, like any software corporation, isn't going to be around forever), but it auto-installs Securom, to monitor your computer against your use of other software that might possibly be pirated. Auto-installs. No choice. Runs in the background, eating resources. Can't be removed by anything short of reformatting the computer.Don't buy Spore. Or anything else that EA produces with this sort of intrusive, disabling insult to their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game! No problems!","review":"Honestly, I have no idea what all the commotion is about. I bought the game and installed it without any issues whatsoever. The whole process took less than 10 minutes and the only thing involving registration was typing in the serial number for the game to register it with Maxis. This is a problem? If there's anything going on with my computer behind the scenes I can' tell and Norton doesn't know about it. The fact that you are interactive with Spore servers is cool because, I believe, other players' creatures that they created can actually be in my game. It's a wonderful game that can be understood and played by anyone over 10. It should be fun for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"RootKit Seals the Deal","review":"I pre-ordered this game and was looking forward to playing it. However now that I know it will have SecureROM installed, I refuse to install this DRM/RootKit onto my PC. I'll be sending it back for a full refund.While I'm sure I'll miss a good game.. I'm doubly sure I won't miss software installed on my PC that I can't uninstall or control in any way at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't shut us up here...","review":"If you value the rights to your PC and the games you purchase you will avoid spore and any EA or other offering that includes DRM and other spyware bundled with their product.No promise of gaming fun and pretty colors is worth allowing these companies to enable the pirates and punish the paying customers. AVOID SPORE AND MAKE YOUR STATEMENT!It wouldn't surprise me if EA makes a bid for amazon just to have the ability to edit and remove these reviews just like their own forums. Personally I find it very helpful to see actual comments from real users about products such as spore."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM requires you to reduce computer's security settings","review":"This game's DRM required me to reduce my computer's security settings in order for it to function, as it requires root control over sensitive areas of the operating system. This is extremely bad from a security standpoint, and entirely unnecessary for a game. Plus, since this requires security settings to be lowered, it makes your computer more vulnerable to all sorts of viruses and malware unrelated to the game.Besides that, the game is absolutely horrible anyways. It's all about making pretty creatures rather than evolution of functional traits. You can beat it within 30 mins and it's all boring after that. I can't believe I eagerly anticipated this game for years. Uninstalled and restored security settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"More hype than game","review":"I'll leave the DRM arguments to the other people here. I've played the game now and gotten all the way to the last stage in a few hours. Honestly it was fun but I really can't see how you could re-play this game. The scenery might change but it's pretty much the same game. I've watched this game since it's inception and I've been nothing but excited. When I finally got to play it I was sort of disappointed. The biggest thing was that it was supposed to roll game play like Civ and Warcraft into one big universe. And it does but Spore's version is akin to buying the playschool version of Civ. Fun? Yeah for a bit. Honestly i wouldn't worry about the DRM 3 install limit, you won't be in this game long enough to need to reinstall it. You'll play it for a week... then put it on the shelf and back to WOW or Xbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever in Theory, Disappointing in Execution","review":"I'd been looking forward to Spore for months but unfortunately a combination of repetitive gameplay elements and restrictive DRM hold this title back. Not worth $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not a criminal","review":"I could have downloaded the game 4 days before the official release from one of the many pirate sites but as always I try to do the right thing and support the game makers by paying my $50. So to return the favor EA will get me the game 4 days later and make installing and playing the game a lot harder then if I would have installed a pirated copy.This is a windows game. I and almost everybody else has to rebuild their machine every six months because the operating system gets itself in a twist. Also I seemed to have to upgrade the system on a regular basis. On each of these occasions I will have to use one of my three installs because the EA copy protection system thinks I installed this on a different machine. I will reach my 3 installs quickly and I am not happy about having to convince EA that I am not a thief every time this happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Very disappointing, especially on a Mac. First of all, it requires Leopard, and won't work on Tiger? Huh? Leopard isn't even a year old. That's even *worse* than coming out with a Windows game that runs on Vista only! Give me a break.Also, video is very slow, even though I have one of the best possible video cards on a high end system with lots of RAM. I have to lower all the settings to low to run at full resolution.As for the game itself, it looks nice but the gameplay is very simple and I lost interest very quickly. :( Let's hope someone makes CIV 5 sometime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken, Intentionally","review":"I bought this game yesterday and installed it. It didn't work with my video drivers so I followed a suggestion on the site and reinstalled it with some modifications. After a few separate attempts, I think I finally nailed down the problem.Unfortunately, we'll never know because I ran out of \\"installs.\\" Electronic Arts popped a message up informing me that this game was only \\"good\\" for 3 installs, and I was holding a brick. If I wanted to install Spore - this game, that I own - again, I had to call a hotline and plead my case to a phone jockey.I decided to plead my case to a business that didn't consider me to be a paroled criminal instead, namely the store where I bought it, which offered me a refund as per their grown-up customer service policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good if it would actually run","review":"Spent over 4 hours trying to get the game to run without success. Windows Vista, 2GB RAM, 512MB Video card... clearly meets the specs but can't get it to run. I'll be contacting EA for a refund... and apparently after reading these reviews instructions on removing any DRM rootkit they might have added to my machine as well. Very disappointing, my kid was looking forward to playing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM *is* part of the game","review":"If you intend to play through this game once and then throw it in the trash, the DRM may be no reason to dissuade you from purchasing this game. But if you are like me and intend to install the game at various times in the future, the DRM is a deal-breaker. I pull old games off my shelf all the time to enjoy them again and again.Some reviewers are giving this game 5 stars and claiming that the DRM is not part of the game, that we should focus our reviews on the game. The purpose of reviews is to help people make informed decisions about potential purchases. Not merely to indicate whether the game is fun. The packaging does not indicate that you will only be allowed to install this game three times, so it's up to the community to disseminate this information to the uninformed. It seems unlikely that people would prefer to make this purchase ignorantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the heads up","review":"I was waiting for this to come out to purchase it for my daughter. Not now. I do not buy games with draconian DRM in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxis: Good, EA: Bad","review":"I feel sorry for the developers. It's a fun game, but I cannot handle the notion of asking permission to use something I already purchased. Install limits, background processes and fears of a new Sony-esque \\"Extended Copy Protection\\" aside: I shouldn't have to call Penguin Publishing to verify when I want to read a book I bought, or Universal when I want to watch a movie. If we truly do not own the content we purchase, then simply call it what it is and charge a service access fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spore sucks!","review":"Game is full of bugs and after fighting with multiple installs on two PC's to get it running I cannot install it anymore due to the registration system. Called EA and they said they would forward a request to open up more installs on my account but it would take 48 hours. No suggestions on the numerous install problems and game crashes. Oddly enough it plays ok on my Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being Returned Without Even Opening","review":"I am sick and tired of companies hijacking my computer, my operating system, and my time with DRM software like SecuROM. I am so fed up that I will be returning the pre-ordered collectors edition that is scheduled to arrive tomorrow morning. I was very much anticipating spending some real quality time with this game, however I will not put up SecuROM or any other method of copy protection that puts these sorts of draconian limits on what I can and can not do with software that I've purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was going to buy first PC game in years, Not Now!","review":"I have not bought a PC based game in years, but I have bought plenty of console games.

I am no longer interested in buying 3 rental installs of a game that installs additional software on my machine that is nearly impossible to remove."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent but won't purchase because of DRM","review":"I saw this game at a friends house and thought it was ok but after reading all the reviews and seeing the game it's not worth the money to deal with the DRM. EA should know better. :( Stay Away"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-Ordered, may be returning.","review":"I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this game for years and pre-ordered it months ago. I am now bitterly disappointed to learn of the outrageous DRM policy. As someone who has a lot of hardware who tends to reformat hard drives from time to time, this is a real problem. Much as I was looking forward to Spore, I may now simply ship it back. Disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't even let me run the game on my old 1998 computer","review":"I checked the System Requirements on the Spore website and I thought that it would be no problem to install and run the game on my old 1998 PC. But after I bought and installed the game on my computer successfully, I started the game and it gives me an error message say that my system doesn't meet the system requirements, the game will quite. I spent my money to buy the game, and I didn't even try the game yet. The Spore game is developed by the same developer of The Sims 2. I ran The Sims 2 on my old Windows XP machine without any problem. My computer is actually much lower than the System Requirement of The Sims 2. I don't know why Spore game would give the Error message and exit out instead run the game on the lower systems. I will look forward to the future on the Open Source alternative similar to Spore game for the older hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM is BAD","review":"I've been following this game for a year and I won't buy it because of the DRM.

Too bad it crashes under Mac OS X 10.6, 10.6.1 and 10.6.2. On top of that EA claims that the problem is Apple's or ATI's, so it won't fix it. I don't care whose problem it is - that's not the point. The point is: until bug is fixed, if you're running 10.6.x then save yourself the disappointment of repeated crashes. Get another game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refuse to buy","review":"I refuse to by a game with THIS type of DRM. I'm not necessarily against DRM but this is too strict and hurts the customer.

While it may be fun to tinker around with the creature creator, it loses energy quickly and devolves into a rather lackluster experience. It's decently-good looking, but it just isn't that much fun.Don't forget the Digital Rights Management (DRM) hoops that you have to jump through, just to prove that you legally bought the game, made worse by the limited number of times you can install it and the need for Internet access to constantly verify that you didn't somehow steal a copy.

What do I mean? Well, let's put it this way, I'd really like to play Wasteland again, however the company no longer supports the game, which means I can no longer play it as I don't have the manual anymore. Can this company promise that in 30 years when I want to dust off a copy of Spore or Mass Effect that they'd be around to help me get it installed?

Stay Away!","review":"After seeing a preview trailer some years ago, I eagerly awaited the release of this game. Upon purchasing, I was incredibly disappointed. First of all, the main point of the game, evolution by natural selection, was completely ditched. The creation of your creature has virtually no effect on its success or failure. It's more akin to dressing up Barbie dolls.Secondly, the multiplayer feature was completely dropped. You can, however, download different models for the various creatures, vehicles, etc. that other players have made. Big deal. I've never been a fan of single player games and I feel as though I've been duped into thinking this was not one.Lastly, the whole DRM thing is a bit ridiculous.

The game play is far form lack luster, if you play it like halo and try to rush to the end (center of the galaxy) then this is not your genre.

While not a bad game I've found the free creature creator is just about as enjoyable as the rest of the game. Fun for awhile but gets boring after too short of a while for a $50 LEASED game.Also the DRM preventing me from ever installing this more then 3 times without calling an EA toll phone number to beg to be allowed to run software I already purchased is ridiculous.I won't be fooled by any EA hype again.DNR free or No Sale to me!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Game, Bad DRM","review":"This game (having played it at a friend's house) is all kinds of fun. The sad thing is that he can only install the game 3 times, and then it won't run anymore. So, if you want to pay $50 for a game that only installs three times, be my guest. If, on the other hand, your computer has EVER broken or MIGHT EVER break, or if you plan on replacing your computer eventually, you'll run through those 3 installs pretty quickly.

Even to someone who doesn't think about things like DRM, the idea of limiting the number of times you can install a CD that you BOUGHT turned her away from the game.Sorry EA, you lost another customer.

Of course, there is always IMDB to find out the film's english title. The point is that the interviews included here are very good with very few exceptions (the Terence Stamp interview is a joke). Argento's is great and so is Fulci's. David Warbeck gives a very good interview too and check out Tom Savini and Gianneto De Rossi.

It has a unique sound that is somewhat different than the other previous TTF releases - many different alarm sounds, bells, and jungle-ish effects. Hard to explain. The first disc is a bit better than the second in that the songs seem to link together better and the harmonic aspect of the beats are more in-tact; not as erratic.Iif youre a fan of Trance, this is a good investment from one of the best techno mix series.

I have to confess that I am a person who feels more in touch with animals than than I do with most people.

It is easy to read and full of wonderful anecdotes from the author's experience as a vet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful ramble through an enlightened vet's mind","review":"I wish Dr. Schoen (which means 'nice' in German) was my little collective's caretaker. He has alot of experience and openess to a wealth of traditional, reeeeeeally traditional, and non-traditional health information. I think this book serves as an excellent introduction to alternative approaches for a variety of human-animal exchanges.

I'm all in favor of keeping an open mind and exploring non-traditional forms of healing. On the other hand, I think that your mind shouldn't be so open that your brain falls out. Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence.Just once, I'd like to hear Dr. Schoen say, \\"This form of therapy is complete clap-trap. I don't think it works, and it might even be harmful\\". Instead, Dr. Schoen embraces everything from acupuncture, to Chinese herbs, and all things in between.And on top of that, the author's tone is one of self-aggrandizement and condescension toward his \\"less-enlightened\\" colleagues.I'm a life-long animal lover and pet owner.

Although it is not as good as his fantasic album 'No Jacket Required' it still a good album with a couple of really good songs. It's not my favorite Phil Collins album, but it's still pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHIL IS BACK !!!","review":"\\"Both sides\\" was really big step down, but Phil reminds us that he still didn't lost IT. It deserves 4 and 1/2 stars. The best song is \\"wear my hat\\" to me...it's funny, it really puts a smile on your face. Title song is also great. I pesonally like 2nd part of album. In 80'es Phil was big star 'cause of his own albums and 'cause he gave us many great albums with Genesis. But in 90'es he dissappear. This is only album from 90'es that he shows us that he is still here...that he is happy, crazy and funny like always. Great album. There is easy listening like \\"the same moon\\" and uptempo songs like \\"river so wide\\". I love this album. I you like Phil, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Well, to be honest, I don't like pop very much.. I'm a rock/alternative/metal fan... but this album blew me away. Phil Collins has a talent.. and it shows. This album isn't that phoney pop stuff like Backstreet boys, this is real music... afterall, Phil writes and preforms his own stuff, including instruments! I personally like Love Police and his remake of that classic Bob Dylan song \\"The Times Are A Changin\\". Way to go Phil!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit better","review":"With more of an expiramental ege and less of a bad pop sheen then Phil Collins general fare Dance Into The Light is a 2 1/2 star album. Theres still a cover here and weak ballads and Phil did not even cowrite the lyrics of Lorenzo but theres some largly african world music here paralleling this album with (the much better music artist) Peter Gabriels Security and actually a few good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, Where?","review":"Since his solo career started in the 80's Phil Collins has been a mastermind of pop music from the second British Invasion. As his time came into the mid 90's, he had no place to go on the radio, and in the mainstream.His 1996 album, Dance Into The Light, is a bit more upbeat than Collins previous albums. Although the album is a complete turn from his 1993 album, Both Sides, the music proved to be a sorrowful project. The songs here are very much in-between, and only two songs stand out very well on the album, Dance Into The Light, and It's In Your Eyes. The music borrows the feel of African rhythms and effects, but is nowhere near Peter Gabriel's triumphs in African Beats. Surprisingly, the album was Phil's last studio albbum, before announcing his departure from Genesis that same year.Although Phil Collins created many hit songs, this album isn't as big of a keeper as his 80's albums, or his days with Genesis. Dance this one out of the light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This Light(Album)","review":"Phil Collins at his worst \\"Dance Into The Light\\" is awful. The title song is a joke and sounded very forced, like he rushed to make and bring out a song from the subpar album. The single \\"Dance Into The Light\\" has no rhythm much less a hook. If people thought his album \\"Both Sides\\" was bad and I am not one of them, then this album will make the think again, when was the last time a Phil Collins album only produced one song. The thing that is a shame about this album is \\"It's In Your Eyes\\" a song that could have done well if it was a follow up to a bad song, and wasn't released right away. This album is a far cry from the \\"...But Seriously\\", \\"No Jacket Required\\" days. \\"Dance Into The Light\\" is one of the worst albums I own, and I own some bad ones, thank goodness Phil redeemed himself with \\"You'll Be In My Heart\\" from \\"Tarzan\\". Phil will release better material than \\"Dance Into The Light\\" let's hope, from one of the best male voices in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I'm sick of white musicians singing about black experiences.What does Phil know about being black? He's lost it!Please take a cue from Billy Joel.At least he knows when to give it up!I guess I will always go back and listen to Phil Pre Both Sides,because his last great solo effort was But Seriously some ten years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-rated album!","review":"This album is a very nice contrast to Both Sides. If you like up-beat songs, this is a great album. I feel like this is a strong Phil Collins album, and it doesn't get nearly the credit it commands. Lorenzo, Wear My Hat, and The Same Moon are standouts on a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true \\"FEEL GOOD\\" album","review":"Phil Collins reaches beyond his own music to an African/Native beat. Getting away from his typical soft style Collins reaches out to make you \\"FEEL GOOD!.\\" This upbeat album is a rousing success for Phil. A great album to maintain his streak in solo success."},{"rating":"1","title":"A copy of Gabriel","review":"Dance Into the Light shows that Phil Collins do NOT want to be in new grounds himself. He has copy the Peter Gabriel and David Byrne style in this record. This is not a pure Collins record, There is a Gabriel/ Byrne record. But also, the non-ethnic songs are pure commercial songs. Collins has lost his own identity long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Rome got to do with this?","review":"Why, oh why would you write a novel where your main character is a complete and unredeeming idiot?!This book was very disappointing: the plot was too predictable (I guess for everyone but the heroine), Rome comes and goes and has very little presence so it's most definitely not a novel of piazzas (nor it is of passion); and the characters were uninteresting and lack depth.So, as someone has already said it's a complete BLAH! I guess if you are 15 years old and being forced to visit cousins in a lost town in the middle of nowhere... or maybe you have a totally self-obsessed friend and want to send her a hint, well this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Rome","review":"I thought chick lit portrays women to be empowered with brains, wit and to be upwardly mobile.However, the female protaganist turns out to be bird brained. She can't think logically, I keep tut tutting what a dim wit she is. She does not even have any intuition to process about what men say to her, strange as she is a woman. I guess there are some men in the real world who love bird brains like her and those who like witty women.The title is a misnomer. Less than one quarter of the book is devoted to the physical location, Rome city itself. The plot unfolds mainly in London. I thought the author could do better by weaving the bulk of the plot thru Rome's landmarks of which there are plenty, social scene of which it is very vibrant and local Roman characters which I am sure she can draw a wealth of Italian personalities to elaborate on.Not entirely an engaging novel. I thought \\"Weekend in Paris\\" by Robyn Sisman does more justice to its title by basing the plot in Paris."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"A very predictable story. I wish there had been more of the story taking place in Rome as the title implies. It is more about her job, boyfriend(s) and the trouble one can get into by not telling the whole truth. A few humerous bits, but not worth reading the whole book to find them."},{"rating":"2","title":"humourous, witty, and well worth reading","review":"I bought this book thinking, if Sophie Kinsella liked it, then buying it would surely be an investment. Turns out, It really was. This story is very funny, adorable, and not to mention romantic. Ince I finished reading the book, I couldn't help but fall madly in love with dependable David, the chap-next-door who cooks, loves movies, and is incredibly smart. Envious of fictional character, Georgie. Haha! However, despite my adoring this book, there was one thing I wasn't quite keen on, and that was the fact that Georgie was very naive about David. Surely, she had her heart in the right place, but I found it very hard to believe she would believe Mike over David. If she really loved David, she would have trusted him more (especially since Mike is a cheap, boring cad!) Still, other than that, this story was well worth the money. And to whomever decides to read this novel, happy reading. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Predictable","review":"This is one of those unfortunate books where you may not like the main character, Georgie Beauchamp, as I didn't. It seemed at various times throughout the plot, she was so dense to reality, you literally wanted to kick some sense into her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Chick-Lit","review":"This book is one of the few books that I've managed to read in two days and it's obvious to see why- it's a real page turner. Gemma Townley writes with a unique style of writing that is cute, sweet, adorable, and funny. I found myself really imagining Georgie was a co-worker or everyday friend of mine. I fell in love with David Georgie's over-protective, secretive, and sensitive boyfriend and personally I wouldn't mind spending a weekend in Rome with him!Don't be fooled by the title the major part of the story takes place in London but, the weekend Georgie spends in Rome changes everything in her life for the better-I love this book and continually re-read certain passages particilarly the parts in Rome or Georgie's interactions with her ex-Mike(who seems just as villanious as Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones).All in all this a good read for a chick that enjoys romantic comedic chick-lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"I hated this book. It was very predictable, you knew everything that was going to happen. I hated the main character, Georgie, she was so stupid; no one in their right mind would do the things she does in the book. If I could have given this book 0 stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Story About a Stupid Woman","review":"Why do some writers think they can base their novels on a brainless woman? Their target audience (women, I assume) is supposed to find such main characters inspiring?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Disappointing","review":"I love Rome and like this genre, so I was prepared to be enchanted by When In Rome... Instead I was disappointed by the main character, whose immaturity and lack of perspective ruined the book for me. The ex-boyfriend's character was extremely one-dimensional, making it impossible to understand why the heroine would want him back. Yet the current boyfriend's character is portrayed as near perfect, making the heroine's actions baffling to the reader. If the characters had been multi-faceted, the ensuing course of events might have been involving. Instead this attempted mad-cap adventure stubles before it gets of the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick lit does Rome","review":"I really, really enjoyed this book! My opinion of most chick lit books lately has been that there is too much \\"crap\\" published out there. Its not always good.This one is funny, witty and good. Our main character hooks up with her ex, while still with her current boyfriend. This, of course, leads her to all kinds of escapades, including a weird and totally impossible trip to Rome.I laughed out loud at times (which I rarely do when reading) and thought the writing wonderful.HOWEVER, the lead character was portrayed as so innocent and naive at times that It made me want to throw the book up against the wall. Come on, can we really be expected to believe that she never has a clue?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will keep you on your toes","review":"I first suspected this might be just another mushy, romantic type novel. I was grateful to find out that it is really much better than that. Gemma manages to squeeze quite a bit of stuff in there.....crime, mystery, international travel, spying, and ultimately, one woman's choice between two men. While the reader will likely be able to develop a good idea of what is really going on, Gemma manages to keep the reader turning the pages to find out if they are correct in their assumptions. Overall, a fun and engaging read. I look forward to her next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed a holiday..","review":"Roman Holiday is my favorite movie of all times and to find a book to reference it was a dream come true! Its a corky and funny story that will make you keep reading and hoping that Georgie will realize that the man of her dreams has been with her for 2 years. All she has to do is stop trying to live a fantasy life and start living her real one.She does a nunmber of mistakes that cost her a great deal of trouble to her and the man she loves but at the end she realizes who she is and finally understands the the true lesson of the film. Highly recommend this book!4.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree w/ the others - very predictable!","review":"The only reason why I borrowed this book from the library was because I heard of a movie being made called \\"When in Rome\\" starring Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel. Partway through, I realized they are not related at all. The main character is dim-witted, nave, lazy, and annoying. She has no moral values, no work ethic, and is a horrendous girlfriend and friend. It was fairly easy to predict what was going to happen throughout the story. The only reason why I kept reading was because I adored David's character. He is my absolute dream man!!! I was also expecting more from Sophie Kinsella's sister, but I won't let this book stop me from reading another Gemma Townley novel. I'm giving her another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Roman Adventure That Wasn't","review":"I picked this up hoping for a reminder of my vacation in beatiful Rome. The \\"Roman Holiday\\" lasted all of 63 pages of this 308 page book. It touts itself as \\"A Novel of Piazzas and Passion\\" but is very sadly lacking in both. This is an average story about the intriguing world of accounting (?!?) and corporate mergers set in dreary London offices. Looking for a real Italian adventure? Look elsewhere!(I would recommend Belinda Jones' \\"I Love Capri\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smelling spray","review":"Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.

It the type of thing I would use for funeral, not I night on the town and certainly not to look for a woman. It's very popular with stellar reviews, my guess with men over 55 though.

Looking at the bottle and its cap I realized that the bottle and the cap were all scratched. Also, the word \\"CODE\\" was not written in pure white, it was more like a beige, which is usually a sign of copied product. A bit despaired, I took the bottle to a parfum shop to compare the odor with another CODE. It was obviously different!I then wrote to the Amazon and the seller who wrote me back quickly and were very sorry about my bad luck.

I never smelled the scent, so I was taking a chance. After wearing it, he smelled like sweet cooking spice. We thought maybe the smell would die down, so he went to work with it on. He said that people kept asking who was wearing cinnamon scented cologne while he was there. He knew it was him, but he didn't say anything...LOL! I don't like it because of the constant smell of cinnamon spice which reminds me of strong Big Red gum. I kept getting queasy, so we just decided to throw it away. Maybe his body chemistry just didn't go with it. Overall, If you like the smell of pumpkin pies on your skin, then I would suggest this. If not, do not buy this scent.

This particular scent can be worn for any occasion for it is not weak and not too strong. Please keep in mind that this scent will remain on a man's shirt until it is washed out. I suggest that only a small amount be sprayed on the left and right collar of the shirt area since too much may be too strong for persons with allergies.

First, I wish the displaywas a little bit brighter because when you wear tinted lens it is sometimesnot as easy to read the display. Second, as with most GPS receivers, thebattery time is not very long. What I mean by that is that normal bike computers batteries last for months, while the Garmin Edge the charge is only good for hours(12 maximum). Third, I wish there was a wrist strap so when you get off your bike to run, you could take it with you instead of having to switch to something else.Considering all the factors, I'm glad I got the Garmin Edge...maybe I shouldhave gotten the Garmin Edge 305!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First GPS purchase","review":"Hi,I bought the Garmin Edge 205 (base model), it is my first GPS. I live in Qatar and cycle out on the flat featureless plains, surprisingly it is quite easy to get lost particularly during dust storms. Anyway as a novice user, I looked on Google earth for my intended route , noted the coordinates of various track points - entered them into the EDGE 205 - and it worked, the Edge led me to my destination. Returning to my car was even easier I just followed the arrow, I couldn't actually see my car but the Edge took me straight to it. The other really great thing is that you can upload your track onto Google earth by using Motion Based software. A very affordable product which does the job I want, in time I will use the training features.Kim in Qatar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I've used the Garmin 205 for three weeks and haven't had the problems that previous reviewers indicated. Don't know if it comes down to the individual variability of each unit, but distance and speed have been dead on accurate as compared to the Signa. The altimeter is another matter. As indicated by others, the altimeter reading fluctuates wildly. Standing still in my garage it climbed from 200 to 400, then back down to 100. The other quibble is the size and illumination of the display. If you wear dark sunglasses (a must in California)the display is very difficult to read. But other features are quite useful and enjoyable. If you are a solo rider who repaetedly rides the same route, the race against yourself features break up the monotomy.

Really nice being able to see speed, elevation, grade, pace and see if you were faster than the last ride.Bottom line really cool technology that works well.

Spending a leisurely hour one night I decided to hunt down the reciepies I wanted from the index by flipping thru the appropriate chapter and STILL could not find the recipies I was looking for.

The interviews are useful because they were done so close to the war, before politics, biased memories and self-justification really kicks in by these surviving German commanders who would write their own memoirs years later.The author uses these interviews to help justified his positions and theories of \\"indirect approach\\" concept which he have been harping on for a long time. Personally speaking, I see nothing really wrong with that since I enjoyed Liddell Hart's writing and see merits in them. The Germans who talked with Liddell Hart also seem to expressed that they too enjoyed his writing which may explained some of the openness they displayed.Overall, a pretty interesting reading material, probably considered as a mandatory reading for anyone interested in World War II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating material in a slanted wrapping.","review":"Certainly a very interesting book with information directly from the lips of the great German generals of WWII. This information is available only in this book, and for that reason alone, it is clearly worth the price. However, the work is rather marred by the incessant use of this vessel by Liddell Hart to, for all intents and purposes, point his nose at the world and say, \\"I told you so.\\" And whilst that may have some merit, it becomes rather annoying to see him inflate his ego by statements about his own infallibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to be read","review":"I am a WWII history \\"fan\\".

I even found the post-partum section in \\"What to Expect the First Year\\" to be more informative and helpful than in \\"Bouncing Back After Your Pregnancy\\". Incidentally, \\"What to Expect the First Year\\" is another excellent source for baby care issues, it's far more in-depth than this particular book.

The style is playful but not simple; the color sense is subtle and unique.

The first one of this single from Europe is called Don't let me be the last to know #1. This is Don't let me be the last to know #2. Britney is the best singer in the world and as Rolling Stone or New York Times or somebody put it, the video is sizzling. This cd is better than the first one because it has the video and stronger and oops remixes. The first one only has the radio edit of DLMBTLTK and two other remixes of it.

It also shows off some up and coming artists, like the John Spencer Blue Explosion, Taj Mahal and the Phantom Blues Band, and Pavement. There're hits, like RATM's Bulls on Parade and Beasties' Root Down, but it's dominated by lesser known, non-single, songs. Beck's folky Asshole and Blur's answer to Oasis, Beetlebum. The cd is spiced with a share of traditional Tibetan chants and music, so you won't forget why this album was made. As MCA Adam Yauch says at the end of Root Down, \\"Let's not forget why we're all here. To help the people of Tibet get their freedom.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This triple album, unless you want to support the freedom of the Tibet, is not really worth buying.

So, through out the whole book, she a high class prostitute, who never feels shame about what she's doing, as long as she's making the money. All of a sudden in the last few chapters she decides to become a chrisitan. My problem with the book is that I don't think Sabrina ever throught she was in the wrong for being a prostitue, she seem to be having a good time the whole book. If you like to see how a high class prostitue live, you will probably like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a contender","review":"This book could have been a contender. It could have been great, however, it was not. Poor editing, and proof reading mistakes plague the book. Exclamation points are over abundant. It seems that the characters are always screaming even when there is no reason to scream. Ever hear of the fifties singer Diana Washington? Never have I. All the other names of singers were correct but not Dinah Washington's. I was frustrated trying to read this book and I never could understand why the main character wanted to be a prostitute.

You cannot play classical music from tabs. This is not two-fingered power chorts in over-driven, clipped, electric rock and roll. So, regardless of one's native language, about 75% of this book is a waste. Even if you do play from tabs then the notation is a waste to you. If you really read music then the tabs are a waste. Yes, you can get some fingering or position tips from the tabs but that takes about one hint in a piece so the rest is completely wasted ink.

As I was watching, I found myself wondering what they saw that I didn't. It's a terrible movie. There is absolutely no development of the plot or characters. It's completely unrealistic (no fifteen-year-olds could live through that mess without any kind of emotional support). In fact, the only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack and Leisha Hailey with pink hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"Just to prove how much I disliked this movie, I never write online reviews. It was bad enough to make me go out of my way to post this. A movie that I thought would be about a friend/more-than-friends relationship was actually a one-sided love story of a butch pothead and and cocain-addicted hussy. There was hardly any plot at all and I was left with a feeling that there was absolutely no point. The only redeeming factor was Leisha Hailey from the Murmurs. She was the only thing that made the movie at all bearable. If the whole movie could have been like the last three minutes it would have been great! Overall it was a terrible, dirty movie that bored me to tears. If you want to watch this movie for a bit of gay cinema, I urge you to pick up \\"Better Than Chocolate\\" instead.

The story is hardly original or noteworthy; the ending is extremely predictable. The actors do a fine job in their respective roles; unfortunately, they are all given poor characters to play. What bothered me most was how cliche each one seemed to be...you have the \\"bad boyfriend\\", \\"the poor lost teenage girl\\", \\"the pink-haired, guitar playing lesbian\\" etc. The film's one redeeming quality is its soundtrack, with edgy riffs from some of the best girl bands of the 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time","review":"This movie was dreadful. I kept waiting and waiting for the plot to thicken, however it didn't. The plot, if there even was one, was extremely poorly developed. If you want to see a true movie about love and the boundaries it crosses, buy Lost and Delirious. That was definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen and it illustrates the the turbulent relationship of two girls at a boarding school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silence Can Be Golden For A Movie","review":"An enchanting movie, All Over Me stays true to the heart. A few days in the life of these characters doesn't leave you wanting more, but it does make you question your version of reality. If the events leave you wondering why the characters were sometimes reluctant to speak their minds and hearts, ask yourself if you have really seen the film. When we look for explaination in a movie, we are not looking for reality. Only in the facial expressions and emotions emitting from the characters will we find the solidification in this movie. It does teens great justice, because it leaves a bit of mystery as to what they feel and think. If you really get into this movie, as I did, you come out of watching it as satisfied with its entirety as you would having spent time inside their minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untouchable x","review":"I have seen this film a thousand times, and I still enjoy it...the trials and tribulations of someone that you can relate to is always worth a watch. If you haven't seen it yet, do! It provides a funky, fresh mix of heartache and happiness, and reflects on the human need to be loved. Each character needs, and while Leisha Hailey proves to be great eye candy, it's Alison Folland that you want to hug at the end of it. Definitely worth a watch...and if you like the movie check out the Murmurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My favorite movies...EVER","review":"This movie directed by the Sichel sisters (Alex and Sylvia) totally frames the early moments of Riot Grrrl in New York City. It's about a Girl (Claude) who is discovering who she is sexually and who she is in her friendship with her bestfriend Ellen. The soundtrack features Patti Smith, Helium, Sleater-Kinney and a tons more influential \\"lady bands\\". Leisha Hailey from The Murmurs plays \\"Lucy\\"- Claude's later love interest, and Pat Briggs (from the band Psychotica) and Wilson Cruz (from My So-Called Life) also star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This film is a beautiful piece of work. I was amazed at Alison Folland's acting in All Over Me, having only seen her as a troubled young teen in To Die For, which, by the way was not that great a movie. Being a teen, a band member-wanna-be and healthy in size, I completely connected with her character, Claude. Trust me, this film is simply incredible. A must see drama that will have you begging for more. Although some scenes seemed a bit slow, over all, the storyline seemed a bit rushed. No matter, timing isn't enough to spoil this one, go see it....really! GO SEE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!","review":"This was such a good movie!

It is informative and clearly written. She is obviously familiar with the noisy, at times chaotic, but oh-so-fresh \\"wet\\" markets and home cooking situations in Hong Kong.

The description of the Mogollon Rim country is beautiful and accurate. However, the details of the Pleasant Valley War are far from the actual history of the event. This is odd, since the events that took place, and the people involved, make exciting reading. If you want the history of the event, you'd be better off reading Arizona's Dark and Bloody Ground, and A Little War of Our Own.

For a intro to physics book, this book would be difficult to comprehend. The book does offer in-chapter examples, but the problems that are worked are straight-forward. However, the problems at the end of the chapters are hard and confusing. It does require thinking (which is a good thing), but some problems would take hours, literally, for the average physics student. The book does have answers to MOST odd number problems, not all. There is no solution to show how they arrived at the answer. The solution manual is a must to understand or to get started on hard problems.

My friend actually looks up the answers in the back first, then plugs in the numbers until she gets the right answer. She doesnt understand any of the concepts. Therefore, this book is not teaching her, but forcing her to try to teach herself. I spend all my time in class and during my lunch and free blocks at school with my teacher, in an attempt for him to teach me every single problem and the process in which to get the answer.

I completed physics in a class that depended heavily on self study, this book not only made it easy but it was also pretty decent reading, not just a compilation of physics formulas and derivations.

The text is often hard to read and sleep-inducing, while not being very helpful at all in teaching the skills we needed in the class, or on the AP test. While a few of the diagrams were okay, most of the other diagrams and example problems were very confusing. The arbitrary way the equations are derived and spread all over the place makes it worse. This is not a book for the beginning student, especially if you don't have *very* good math and logic skills.

Simply having a couple of novice examples throughout the chapters, and then being thrown into the problems at the end with no help but for the ODD answers at the back of the text is not helpful, and not conducive to learning. Frustration is not a good method to get people to understand and/or enjoy a topic. I would not recommend this book for the novice, but can see how it can be used as a good reference book for those of more learning in the topic. A solutions manual really does need to exist, as that is how one learns this subject, through trial and error, and the answers in the back are simply not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less babble, more physics please...","review":"The author starts chapters by giving simple (maybe too simple) introductions.

Then, a couple of simple examples that, in no way, go in depth or cover the scope of the subject discussed. Then, BOOM!

Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance, poor recording","review":"Everyone has their favorite Christmas music, and if you've heard these selections in the past and like them, then by all means order the disk. The performance is fine.The problem is the fidelity of the recording, which manages to sound both muffled and shrill at the same time. This has nothing to do with the time period in which the recording was made (splendid recordings from London and Mercury were made back then) but with poor technique. Sound quality wise, this is a dollar bin recording: it might sound acceptable in a car system or boombox but that's about it.However, if you are the type of person who cares only about the music you will most likely find it acceptable. For myself, I have to believe there are other well recorded orchestral Christmas albums worthy of your hard earned dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Christmas album worth having","review":"I still have the original record from the 50's, got the 8 track and now getting the CD-Thank God you have it- Christmas isn't the same without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs Ruined By A Poor Outdated Compilation","review":"This greatest hits CD is ruined by the presence of a number of live cuts. The applause from those songs fades out while the next song fades in. This ruins Sound Of Silence and Bridge Over Troubled Water. Of course, the live version of Homeward Bound is used and it is not nearly as good as the studio version. If you want a good single disc compilation, you may need to look at the import section, many of which fit about twenty tracks on a single CD. Also, the Old Friends box set has far superior sound. This is a compilation that was made for the LP age in terms of tracking time. It served its purpose thirty years ago but Columbia needs to issue a disc with the original songs, about 30-40% more songs, and an improved booklet with some background information on this historic duo. This CD, as it stands now, is a woefully inadequate package given the importance of Simon and Garfunkel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs - Poor \\"Mastering\\"","review":"What a shame! As others have it put it this is the S&G album to own if you are only going to own 1. I don't find the live versions annoying and the songs run into each as they did on the original lp. It's too bad the transfer to cd was so horribly done. In \\"The Boxer\\" the music can barely be heard. This is true for most of the other songs as well.

I found the music very beautiful and interesting which I found out is rare and peculiar for my generation (the one currently at the college age).I believe I first fell in love with \\"Mrs. Robinson.\\" Each song has a quality about it, it conveys a certain emotion.\\"Boxer\\" is despair, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is friendship, \\"Bookends\\" is memories, \\"Cecilia\\" is sexual excitement.There isn't an emotion that Paul Simon doesn't cover in his song-writing. Garfunkel complements his friend almost perfectly.The classic duo of popular music will remain a favorite of mine for the rest of my life, and the songs will have a certain value for me that I almost cannot describe, so I will not try.But perhaps my favorite song, \\"America\\" - I just find the lyrics, melody, and harmony very beautiful and magical."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BOMB!","review":"I first bought this record as a 13 year old in 1972. It was the first time I'd ever been ripped off by a major record company.

I remember thinking \\"they've got to be joking\\" when I played the LP all those years ago. Don't be mistaken - I am a fanatical S&G fan but this album was just (CENSORED). Thankfully Sony Music repackaged the album and replaced the live versions with the proper hit versions (see Best of S&G).

Everything identical - sleeve, tracklisting, order, running time of 44 mins 30 secs.There are much better retrospectives of their work around, more comprehensive and better value despite the higher outlay.

I wish these guys were still making music together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Splurge on the \\"Old Friends\\" box set instead.","review":"I must agree with those who express disappointment in this collection. It is not so much that some of these songs are live version, as in some cases (\\"For Emily,\\" and \\"59th Street\\" are good examples) they are better than the original studio versions.The problem is that sometimes these live versions interfere with some of the studio versions. For example, both the beginning of \\"Sounds of Silence\\" and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" even though they are the original studio versions, contain the audience applause spilling over from the previous live track. There was absolutely NO reason to do this and the result distracts from the songs. This is especially true in the case of \\"Bridge\\" which remains one of most moving songs of all time.So I would suggest that you save your $15.00 and use it as a down payment on the \\"Old Friends\\" box set. There you get all the hits, without the intrusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"All my favorites in one album","review":"The title says it.

People bought this thinking they were getting the versions they knew. There is ZERO indication on the sleeve that this has any live versions. Not only that, but they crossfade some of the applause into the beginning of the studio versions. How irritating!!Is this a scam to make people buy the full albums or singles that they really want? Probably. Did the producers actually think the live versions are better? They are not, neither artistically or sonically.

Once in a while the author takes the theme to another level, which I think they did with Frostburn to some extent, and Libris Mortis too. Sandstorm is almost a waste of time. The races, prestige classes and quirky magics are horrible and almost useless in any campaign. A good part of the feats are the same.

And what are supposed to be chocolate chips, seemed to me like hard stones. It was absolutely horrible and I struggled to finish an entire bar.I would advise you to stay clear of this bar as there are other viable alternatives offered by Met-Rx which cost around the same amount of money. One of them is the Met-Rx Big 100 Colossal Meal Replacement Bar.(Super Cookie Crunch or Crispy Apple Pie).

The cookie dough consistency is a nice change from the traditional protein bar dryness. The calorie count is high enough to make the bar a true meal replacement. It has enough protein for all but the most exacting weightlifter with a reasonable amount of fat (6 grams) for a replacement bar.

Maybe it wasn't designed for long use (we had played it for about 4 hours straight each time)?Regardless, I think you get what you pay for. It's cheap and from a no name company. Nextar? Who is that?

Frankly, the reviewer who stated he returned this book and gave it one star is an idiot of the first order. South Africa is an amazing country with very distinct parts, this book does a fine job of breaking the country up and giving the history and the highlights of each region. If you have any interest in South Africa or just like travel guides, then pick this up you wont be disappointed. As for South Africa itself, lord let's hope they dont elect another neianderthal to run the country, but from what ive heard the ANC has nominated another corrupt pol to be the next president..for what is considered the most forward country in Africa..ill grant you that is not saying much, just look at Zimbabwe..South Africa seems to be going backward..how sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"South Africa, eyewitness travel guides","review":"Basically this is a useless book.

Perusing these pages shows that the chasm between (representative) art and science is really not so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near miss","review":"I think the idea of this book was a good one, however the images were not that inspiring for me. Minimalism can be very spiritual if done with the right stuff. There are few pages that fold out making panoramic views of, well...uninspired images. This is not to say the book is a total dud. I found some of it useful.For a book that takes a similar approach, take a look at \\"Country and Modern: Contemporary Interiors for Rural Settings (Hardcover)\\" by Dinah Hall. The book, the images and ideas are more in the lines of the \\"truth to material\\" philosophy. This is a book I don't get tired of looking at. \\"Minimum\\" will just sit in the bookcase doing nothing I am afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimum For Sure","review":"I'm surprised by all of the good reviews. I don't recommend this book, unless its main purpose is to sit on a coffee table and look pretty.The pictures are decent, though many of them look grainy as if they've been blown up to fit the page. But perhaps the most disappointing part of the book was the text. Each picture has merely a paragraph devoted to description, and to compound that frustration, the font is so small (probably 6 point), I had to keep my eyes inches from the page. It would be understandable if the publisher were trying to save room, but clearly that's not the case, as an entire white page is devoted to a small paragraph, which is consequently crammed so near the binding that I had to pry the book apart to read the text. I realize that this style is probably meant to reflect the book's title, but I don't think moving the text to the middle of an already blank page would disrupt this.There are better books elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"minumum coherence","review":"I liked the idea of this book, but the execution seems pretty forced. Bunches of photos -- many of which are not particularly interesting -- that presumably illustrate minimum design. But it all seems a bit random and incoherent to me. Pawson may be a fine architect, but I don't think any clear understanding of minimum design is advanced here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute little ol' book","review":"If you can even call it a book. You'll breeze through it in less than a day, but don't let that discourage you. Its fun and interesting. Nice for the ol' coffee table as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite.....","review":"Unfortunately the book isn't quite what the name suggests. I bought this book pressuming that it was all about the art of minimalist architecture......it never quite got there. the book is small, not that much bigger than my hand but fairly thick, the minimalist style process seems to drag on a bit, which is fine if you've just discovered the sixties style, PAINFUL if your looking for works of art. SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a book more closely related to architecture and art, your certainly not going to find anymore than 4 pages on Mies, the MASTER and CREATOR of minimalist architecture and design and as far as fabulous interiors, i've seen better in local design mags."},{"rating":"2","title":"m i n i m u m' s .m a x i m u m .i m p a c t .","review":"the true beauty of Pawson's quiet polemic is his restraint. remaing true to the theme, little text is offered, save a small elaboration for each image included as an appendix. the other refreshing aspect is his control in image selection. little of his work appears, and when it does, he only credits himself in the appendix. i can appreciate this approach to an architecture book. it is obviously not a monograph or end-table book as is Richard Meier Architect. instead, it is a 'this is what i like around me' book. the inclusion of non-architectural images (note the B-2 bomber and a three-prong fork) reinforces the theme of the truly powerful restraint that could exist in all design."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book.","review":"John Pawson is one of my favorite architects, and this book perfectly highlights and demonstrates his minimalist approach. Light on text, heavy on beautiful photos. It's also gorgeously bound with a simple but rich cloth cover with beautiful type.

For a quick, fun and thought provoking read, Résumé should unquestionably be your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"After reading these reviews, I was eager to read this book. As a twenty-something Chicagoan who's lived in the city for four years now since college, I have to say it's not an accurate portrayal of our generation. True, many are unsatisfied in life, but they don't talk about it the way the Trixies and Chads in this book do. I found the conversations totally unrealistic, which is unfortunate since it's a dialogue-driven book. If these characters are supposed to be true Trixies and Chads, they wouldn't be so pseudo-intellectual. Maybe U of I journalists talk that way, but it's not representative of the typical 20-something.

The illustrations are simple, and yet full of interesting tidbits you can help your child find. It's amazing how expressive these little goslings are. I appreciate that the story is short and sweet. My daughter is not yet old enough to enjoy longer stories, but she is fully able to sit through this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny addition to the Gossie & Friends series","review":"My son laughs everytime we read this -- which is at least 10x per day.

I've basically stolen it from my friend and I listen to it alot. One of the things I've been hearing about Blink182 is that they sold out and their not \\"Punk Rock\\" any more. What the hell are you talking about? They may not be the same as when they first started, but no band is. Does't mean that their not punk any more. I like this ablum for the simple fact that it shows how they've grown as a band (and it's pretty funny too). So you can do one of two things, run (do not walk) to go buy this album, or wait until your best friend buys it and then steal hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Highly overrated band is a gooey pop nightmare!","review":"Enema of the State shows just how horrible the pop music scene is today. Blink 182 is an immature, boring band with one type of song repeating endlessly on this CD. The songs are sung in the same annoying manner (iambic pentameter gone horribly wrong - one feels as if they are on a roller coaster listening to the yowls of the singer on \\"All the Small Things\\"). The only half-gem on this bland and annoying CD is \\"Adam's Song,\\" but even that is soured by the obvious Nirvana ripoff and melodrama increasing with every lyric. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"by this cd at all costs","review":"blink 182 is awesome the best songs on the cd are whats my age again and adams song. even if it costs you 17 or 18 dollars buy it, even if you have to buy the edited version still buy it. get it today"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is a necessity for any punk fan!","review":"i really like this cd. it is so dope and u all need to go out and buy it because blink 182 is the best and they are the best punk band out there. this is 1 of my favorite cd's that i have and i listen to it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is good, but can be better.","review":"This CD is good, but it could be better by making a song like Dammit from Dude Ranch, and taking out Party Song.

Anyone who says Blink 182 is a trendy band, who wishes they were punk rock is stupid. They are aswome kickin' punk and the whole rules. Here is some stuff that rules about it: 1.They have two singers, Mark and Tom, they are both awsome, they have a type of Nofx, Less Than Jake type voice, but they don't copy, they have there own sound. 2.The lyrics are funny and very clever. 3.None of the songs sound the same, and there not just banging drums and smashing punk guitars (which sometimes I really like), they have a beat that carries.

Yeah, there are 2 songs that i listen to more than others, but all of the songs are GOOD. PLUS, it is an enhanced CD, meaning there is a hilarious video on it. Watch it...

I own Dude Ranch and anxiously awaited this CD comin out. I bought the day it cam out and its great...Travis the new drummer is excellent...much better than scott.

If you like thier old stuff, then i wouldn't reccomend this to you. If you like their new songs like all the small things, then get this CD now. It's good and i like it, but still prefer their more punk look. They are fading into a pop punk band because of some of their songs on Take off Your Pants and Jacket.

Punk used to mean something, it was the thought of noncomformity, of rebellion, and to Anarchy. Now we got a couple of poser punkers who go out and play some of the worst punk songs in the world. Now mind you, that this is only on the recent albums. They're older stuff was more true to punk then \\"All the Small things\\" Yet another group killed by the MTV genre. Speaking of which.. you ever notice that the heaviest of bands hardly get played on MTV?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Punk by any means","review":"I'm not entirely sure why this is called punk. The music certainly doesn't show it. And the lyrics! Don't even get me started!! The guitar and bass sound far too poppy, but the drumming isn't terrible. In fact, their drummer has quite a bit of talent. He should form another band. Punk is bands like NOFX,Pennywise,Rancid and old Offspring( new 'Spring{Americana,Conspiracy of One}sucks).In fact, go buy \\"Smash\\" by the aforementioned Offspring. And while you're at it, check out early Silverchair and anything by the great Nirvana.

So when I got this album I almost died. Enema of the State is the biggest piece of garbage since the new Less than Jake album B&B. The only decent songs are the Party Song, Anthem and Dont leave me. Blink should be ashamed of themselves trying to pass off All the Small Things as punk. I almost didnt buy the live Mark Tom and Travis Show but in that live album it redeems Enema of the State somewhat. If you are a true punk fan and not some stupid 12 year old whose loves NSYNC and Smashmouth go get some real punk bands like Dropkick Murphy, New Found Glory, Less than Jake (there old stuff), MXPX or NOFX or if you want to experiance the real Blink-182 before they sold there souls go buy Dude Ranch of Chesire Cat"},{"rating":"2","title":"BLINK is the best band, i wish they were going to woodstock","review":"Hell yea the best band can t wait for the new c"},{"rating":"2","title":"great record by the best punk band of all time","review":"this cd is sooo good. pick it up right now its just great1.

First of all I think the concept of selling out is stupid - so many bands are accused of selling out, and seriously who cares? They havent changed their music at all, they didn't turn pop or anything. they are still punk. They are still playing for the sake of playing the music and thats it.

Sure, call them sellouts (you know you'd sellout if given the opportunity), but what the band has produced here is cleaner pop-punk rock with a sound that hasn't smashed the Top 25 until now (give them SOME credit). The bottom line is, I have all 3 CDs and this is equally as good as the others. I like to see a band change rather than making no new strides over their career. Highlights of this CD are \\"Going Away to College\\", \\"Don't Leave Me\\", \\"Aliens Exist\\", \\"Anthem\\", \\"Adam's Song\\"...and oh yeah...EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM!

You'd think this album had some big splash it wanted to make, but for me it was more like just a trickle. I have told myself I'll give it another try. I'll listen to it some more sometime and see if somehow there's a profound message I missed. But I just can't get myself in any hurry to do so, and if I had to give it a one-word discription for now, that one-word would be \\"lame\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guy Below Me is a Idiot","review":"Now im not saying that this is a crappy CD but its defintly worth buying.

I'm no fan,I just wanna say \\"All The Small Things\\" is the only song I really like cuz it's kind of a rip-off of the Jesus & Mary Chain's song \\"Head On\\" from 1989, so if you know what song that is, give the 2 a listen & you'll see the striking similarities. Cuz when I first heard this song on the radio, I had no idea who it was, & could've sworn it was some unknown 80's song, so maybe these guys have some 80's influences, good for them. \\"What's my age again\\" gets on my nerves though cuz radio & mtv killed it.

The musical intelligence barely exceeds the lyrical intelligence - which is pretty much nonexistent. Catchy melodies make it more tolerable than crap like Limp Bizkit, but not much. This is just immature adolescent party music; it's amusing that a previous reviewer actually tried to distinguish Blink 182 from Britney Spears. There's no truly significant distinction.

Why Blink \\"made it\\" and the Hard Ons faded to obscurity is largely due to two factors, their name (less offensive) and the decade(punk is now a commercial commodity). The Hard Ons wrote hook-laden, hummable pop songs, played with jacked up, enormously huge/loud guitars. Blink does much the same, although they have tamed it a bit since Cheshire (they smell money), which is a shame since the world really doesn't need another softie punk band. For those who like the old Blink, check out the Hard Ons' stuff (if you can get it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's My Age Again?","review":"All the songs on this album is cool.

Sure- the songs are great.. all the tracks are equal to any new One Hit Wonder's song..and thats the problem.

For funny intelligent and fun pop/punk see the Dead Milkmen. For disrespectful ranting hilarious pure punk, see the Dead Kennedys. And for brilliant hilarious perverse fun, see the Frogs.

Actually, I think these guys are sadly overlooked as great musicians. They are tight, they play fast, and they write great hooks. The music is melodic and intense, not brooding, generally not angry, and the lyrics are pretty funny. I think we should support them for that complete mockery of the Backstreet Boys they did, if for no other reason.

I guess I have to be fair about it though considering Green Day would only release a greatest hits compilation between 1997's \\"Nimrod\\", and 2004's \\"American Idiot\\". However, I found this to be a mediocre album. It does thrash I'll say that much, and the guitar is way beyond aggressive, but the vocals sound like a prepuberescent teen's vocals.....very whiny, and trying to sound tough. I also had a hard time following this album as it seemed like they played almost the same song after leaving off the last one. The album cover is sexy that's a plus, but not worth my money. This is for those who never heard of Green Day, but chances are if you never heard of Green Day you would never have heard of these bums either."},{"rating":"1","title":"MTV killed them","review":"I like punk music, not pop. Before they were on MTV, they were punk. Soon, they thought they needed more listeners or $, so they changed their music and made a video.

One thing I don't get, is that I seem to be the only one who had never heard of the song What's My Age Again before I bought this cd. I never heard it on the radio. Oh well. I first saw Blink on MTV with All The Small Things and was hooked from then on. And then last week one of my friends played Adam's Song at our play rehearsal and I loved it.

The Dead Kennedys were punk. Bikini Kill was punk. All of those bands had integrity, and they were all angry about what was happening socially at the time. Blink182 is more concerned about telling sex jokes and getting laid. Yes, a lot of true punk-bands had songs about sex...but they were more than just that. Just because your music has a raw edge, that doesn't make you punk. If you're a 13-16 year old male poseur, then by all means, buy this album. Do not buy this album if you want true punk music.

They have to be the biggest sell outs in all of music history. I am ashamed to say I own some of their cd's. While they never were exactly \\"punk\\", they have slowly deteriorated into their current pathetic state of teenybopping, sick-humored (The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show...), trendy, highly overrated pop. I can only imagine what the \\"music\\" of the upcoming insult upon human ears-Take off Your Pants and Jacket- is going to sound like. We've already had our first preview with Rock Show.

I think this will be their breakthrough album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, could be better","review":"I've owned this CD, and others by the band, and let me share what I have learned. It deserves 4 stars because it is generally good, BUT...This CD = sub par!For anyone who doesn't get that, let me say that it's below Blink's Standard. The best song on Enema, \\"Anthem\\", pales compared to songs like \\"Touchdown Boy\\", \\"Sometimes\\", or \\"Dammit\\"! This is not arguable! The reason those albums were not top sellers is because they did not get any good, TRLish exposure. Did no doubt's first sell millions? Eminems? Anyone with real talent's? Not too often. Some bands like Unwritten Law, who have better stuff than this, still haven't made it. Sales/popularity does not equal talent! Check the first two CD's from this band before you get this one, and THEN get this one, if you've got extra cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different then Dude Ranch, but still good!","review":"I bought this cd a little while ago. I completely new what I was expecting, after I heard the song \\"What's my age again?\\" If you didn't know that is the first single of Enema. The Drumming is still very good even though Mark (bass) and Tom (guitar) lost former drummer and friend Scott Raynor. He was replaced however with the incredible talent of Travis Barker. The vocals have improved and so had the music in general. As for the tracks on the album, most of them are the usual blink 182 style but my ear really noticed Adam's Song. It is a really good song and different! This one is worth buying. Blink 182 has definitly grown as a band since the last record."},{"rating":"2","title":"their music changed a little but it's still good","review":"Blink 182 did a good job on this one and I think it's better then Dude Ranch. If you liked their old CD's, it has enough of that stuff for you, and if you like what gets played on the radio you should get it too. This is their best one yet, so just get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool music","review":"ok ill admit i bought the blink 182 cd enema of the state because i saw whats my age again on mtv/trl, but that doesnt mean i cant like the cd. i listen to (almost) all of the songs on the cd and theyre all awesome. my faves include dysentary gary (funny), adam's song (the saddest song ive ever heard but i love the part where he sings remember the time that i spilled the cup of apple juice in the hall...), the party song, dont leave me, and of course whats my age again although im getting a little sick of it being overplayed.. thats what makes the other songs on the cd cool.. but it would be cool to see waht some of the other songs videos might look like... anyway.. buy this cd its awesome :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all","review":"This cd is not very good except for \\"what is my age again.\\" It should of had a explicit content warning on it and it didn't.

Ask Blink 182","review":"Way back when Cheshire Cat first came out I was a huge fan of Blink 182, and lets be honest, I even liked Dude Ranch a lot. But with the release of Enema of the State, Blink has continued the selling out process they started with Dude Ranch. Bombs or Swingin' Utters if you want to hear what real punk sounds like. The best I can call Blink these days is a worn out pop band, none of their old disrespectful humor is evident in this release. One Star, this CD sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"This has to be one of Blink's best CDs!All the Small Things,Mutt and DysentaryGary(Ha!)are awsome.But then Going AWay to College and Adams song are awsome to.If you like Blink,funny songs,great guitar playing,or nice beats you'll love this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good album.","review":"The best way I can think of to describe this band would be a cross between Offspring and Green Day. Their music's a little more sophisticated than Offspring's and the lyrics are very reminiscent of Green Day's DOOKIE album.I don't really know how to review the album, really. Suffice it to say, it's a very enjoyable album. All the songs are similar in tone, but each is unique. They are all good and I have not been disappointed with any aspect of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"an album that u won't get bored of","review":"this has got to be one of the best albums i have ever bought. if you like punk you'll like this if you don't like punk you may like this to. thesongs are all different and once you've listened to them once you can't get them out of yor head. the superb drumming by travis on anthem and the... guitar playing on 'aliens exist'by tom, truly makes this album worth every penny. but i suggest that you listen to some of the other songs before you purchase it if you are buying it just because you like 'all the small things' that song is not like all the others. my favorite songs are 'adams song' , aliens exist, mutt and wendy clear but the rest are all as good. if you are contemplating buying this album i suggest you do, you won't regret it. katie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jam packing all the TRl fun","review":"I am from there hometown and I remember when this was genuine band trying to make good music.But in the last 2 or 3 years they seem to be trying to play up to girls 12 -16.You could see them at Soma after dude ranch had been out for a while they were playing too the bubble gum crowd.To all the kiddies go see a real san diego band like sprung monkey"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is decent but not as good as advertised...","review":"Not only is this not even the groups best album, it is definitly not as good as all the fuss would lead you to believe. Blink does have their moments on Enema Of the State but they are few and far between. All The Small Things is my favorite track and about the only one I enjoy listening to. A better \\"new\\" group out there is Lit and their debut album A Place in the Sun, it sounds less like NSync and Backstreet than this album that could best be described as adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not real punk","review":"After i bought Blink's chesire cat album, i've been a fan of them, but after this album, i'm not anymore.

It is fighting for what you know to be right and fighting against what you know to be wrong. It is resisting racists, homophobes, sexists, Nazis, religious zealots and all intolerant people. It is about helping those that need a hand and not about doing only what helps you. Blink 182 is none of these things. It deserves to be labeled teeny bobber, and to be lumped in with Ricky Martin and The Backstreet Boys. I am happy for you if you like Blink 182, but please don't damage a legitimate movement, the punk movement, by associating Blink 182 with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Response","review":"I think that is absolutely assinine that most people are giving the cd 5 stars because of \\"What's My Age Again\\". This song is not bad, but does not represent the style of blink182 fan. So for all you people looking for thirteen more songs that sound like \\"Whats My Age Again\\" you'r in for a surprise. I'm a big blink182 fan, and do not expect to be dissapointed by \\"Enema of The State\\", but im also not willing to give a cd five stars when i've only heard one song. If the rest of the cd is remotely like what's my age again, which most people seem to be hoping for, well the hell with this band, because they have been taken over by the teenybopping mainstream. For all you \\"real\\" blink182 fans out there lets hope that blink has stayed with their roots, and lets hope blink puts on a better performance than i have rated it with. A one is harsh, but all cds have to start there. (if you like blink give lagwagon a listen)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cd rocks!","review":"Listen, I have to admit that Dude Ranch was a little better than this, but this cd is one of the best compilations of songs i have ever heard. It is awesome and if u like pop, punk, rock, or just like trying out cd's this is definitely a must have. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not Punk","review":"This is much less of a punk album then it is a power-pop song compilation. Their gutiars aren't that fast, and the lyrics might as well be from a Weird Al boy boy band parody. The truth is, MTV became too tempting to resist for Blink, so they refined their sound, gave it poppy hooks, and the result is a fairly catchy and all too sugary sweet album. Dude Ranch was no masterpiece, but it earned my respect for it's much raunchier humor and Punk guitar jams. They were still punk-pop, but dang good punk-pop, sort of like Green Day on speed. \\"Enema\\" is obviously targeted at the MTV fanbase, and as a result, they got trendy real fast. That is not punk. Punk is loud, fast, and free-willed. \\"Enema\\" is loud...and nothing else. If you like their lame lyrics about girls and romantic triangles, the Descendents, who pioneered everything that Blink would be 80s, are much better. They're funny, and they really rock, unlike this lame Boy Band with gutiars."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE POP","review":"punk is supposed to be fast with no little stupid riffs or intros or anything.Blink 182 sold out completely.they started out a punk band,now there a pop group.all they do to be successful is make \\"funny\\" videos and write \\"funny\\" songs.they deserve -25 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is much better stuff than this out there","review":"Although many people seem to think that this album is a developmental step and worthy of its accolades, if you listen to any other smaller poppunk bands you will hear the same sound with superior vocals and better energy. The whole album is overly polished and smoothed to be just homogenous enough for the pop-listening audience it appeals to. Support a local poppunk scene and you will hear much better things. I listen to crustpunk, but, from the days when I enjoyed poppunk, I can suggest Youth Ahead, 5 Cent Deposit, LWL, Lanemeyer, Weston, Plan-A, Ann Beretta, Bigwig, or any number of other bands that haven't sold out and retain a great, infectious sound. To listen to Blink is ordinary and conformist in an extremely unappealing way. Investigate further; this album is not particularly interesting and no poppunk band is worth Blink's ticket prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it punk enough? Who cares!","review":"Every single time a band goes platinum, everyone starts knocking 'em. Wassup wit dat? Enema is a well-made album, Blink are doing the same thing they were doing 6 years ago, and guess what? They're getting more popular and are even (gasp!) turning new school kids onto Bad Religion!Yeah, so they're not exactly a Dischord band. Why is this so troubling to so many people? I still spend most of my time listening to the Dismemberment Plan or Pavement or Shellac, but I really like what Blink are doing. \\"Adam's Song,\\" as most people have written, is a great listen -- and the lyrics actually have some depth! The whole CD reminds me of plenty of other great punk bands, just as those other bands remind me of Blink. It's fun, catchy, mindless, meaningful, well-done music. I'd like to see them branch out even more on their next album, but until then, Enema of the State will have to suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing special, but by no means bad.","review":"Pop-Punk music in general is nothing amazing, and this CD is no exception. The guitar work is better than a lot of the original punk music I have listened to, though. The thing that really strikes me about this band is the drummer. Travis has some very good \\"melodic percussion\\" on this CD. The lyrics are pretty funny, though not terribly dry nor monstrously creative. Overall, the CD is a fine addition to a pop-rock CD collection, though by no means a ground-breaking or must-have album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't there anything better to do than this. . .","review":"Blink 182, get a life.I think that this band ought to be titled Blink 180, or Blink, turn 180 degrees and run. Every song sounds like the other. The poor rhythms never vary, and the monotone vocals drone on with these practically obscene, juvenile, and uncreative words. Perhaps these \\"artists\\" could not express themselves without such. Too bad.Read the lyrics. Listen once. Hear the expressions of fools without regard for daughters, mothers, or themselves. There are NOT so many years ahead to fall in line. Life passes like mere smoke. I would wish that Blink would take things a little more seriously.

Punks dont sing pop music like many other punk bands like Good Chalotte,Simple Plan,Avril...no thats not even close to punk.3.Piercings and Tattoos doesnt mean your punk at.4.Punks yell and do crazy things. Punk bands---Sex Pistols,Ramones,Clash,Distillers,Misfits,Dead Kennedys,Bad Religon,New York Dolls,Dammed...Watch videos of them or something watch how they act and complare them to newer punks...Dont call older punks \\"posers\\" cause they made it.6. Mowaks dont make you punk.7. Punk songs dont have meanings there just about random things not about how you love someone or how you miss them or even about someone trying to have sex with you then leaves.Think about it, I am not being mean I am just speaking my mind about real punks...Blink 182 is pop punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not best","review":"if you are new and want expert advice listen to me 1 dude ranch..............2 cheshire cat.........3 buddha................... 4 line up...............5 enama of the state"},{"rating":"1","title":"To be perfectly honest, they ARE talented young boys.","review":"Nothing more.

Who would care?","review":"I can clearly see the appeal here; I'll give them due credit for finding a niche that clearly deserves mining... and there is NO other Blink 182, that's for sure. Each and every song could stay in your head for days, and, unfortunately, they sometimes do. The musicianship displayed borders on my infantile excursions with pots and silverware in the kitchen. And it kinda makes me sick when someone says they're awesome musicians because they can play FAST. They must be awesome lyricists, then, too, cause they sing fast, right? When you play those same three chords over and over again long enough, IN THE SAME ORDER, mind you, you're gonna get fast at doing it.I just wish that everyone that liked Blink 182 would take the time to listen to Idlewild, or better yet, early Pavement. At least they do something in the genre that can be described as pioneering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blink sold out","review":"This album is a prime example of what happens to good bands when they get greedy. They sell-out and change their music style. Enema is completely different from past Blink albums in the way the music is not as raw. It is disappointing. This clearly enters them into the \\"pop\\" instead of \\"punk\\" category.Say it ain't so fellas'. I hope the next album has them return to their roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALTERNATIVE FAN? Get this CD.","review":"This is an awesome CD because not only is it a cool band, but their music actually is cool too! A song to listen to- Adam's Song. It kicks, and right now it's on TRL.

I recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Blink 182 proves that, once again, they have nothing to say. Their lyrics are empty - no meaning, nothing more than some talentless teenagers trying to say stuff that will sound \\"cool\\" to an audience of teenage boys, trying to get their record to sell. Unfortunately, this method, as proven by others such as Eminem and Kid Rock, always works. Just look at the cover of the CD. Is this a band that relies on its musical talent, or its shock value? In addition to Blink 182's inability to convey any worthwhile method with their words, their music also fails to stray from the norm. Every song sounds exactly the same. Their drummer knows only one rhythm (or at least uses only one) - his incessent 1-2-1-2-1-2. This CD left my asking \\"why,\\" as in \\"why would anyone want to listen to this?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess punk is dead","review":"I have some of the other reviews for Enema of the State and I have come to a conclusion: either punk is dead or all these younger listeners don't have a clue about punk music. I suspect Lou Pearlman formed this group of poseurs. All the tracks on this album sound hollow and shallow. If anyone reading this review should be interested in punk, please buy the following albums: Black Flag \\"Damaged\\", Husker Du \\"Zen Arcade\\", Dead Kennedys \\"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\\" or \\"Plastic Surgery Disasters\\", Minor Threat \\"Complete Anthology\\", Misfits \\"Static Age\\", and Circle Jerks \\"Golden Shower of Hits\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Punk This is NOT it!","review":"When I bought this cd I thought it would be like their previous stuff.

I enjoyed dude ranch, and thought it would be as good. but then mtv started to play there song 20 times a day, and for some reason these guys became huge pop stars. They were punk, but they have gone they way off other sell-outs. I was sad to see them play with bad religion on tour, although br blows right now, i felt sorry for them playing in front of screaming tennie-booper fans. i thought this album might have been good, becuase they got travis from the aquabats, but i guess a drummer from a ska band couldnt put an ska in put here. i mean ska had its chance a couple years ago. This album is the reason so many \\"punk\\" bands are mainstream now. when blinks next album comes up, and fails i hope they can realize that its not about singles and mtv, its about quality. listen to these bands for real punk-rancid, pennywise, nofx, dropkick murphys, anti-flag, the clash, dead kennedys, and less than jake"},{"rating":"1","title":"you call this punk?","review":"ha! i was tiring of that song all the small things on radio i thought you call this punk? now if you want to hear real punk music why not simply listen to london calling by the clash. not like these so called punk artists who thing they can make up for their lack of talent with childish humour and making their music as loud as possible. where is the rage to be found which defined punk music in the 70s. these guys are only interested in making money.

Weak, smirking, wussie music. This is bubble gum pop. Not much more complex or relevant than Britney Spears or Backstreet Boys. If you think this is punk...you need a musical education. Why not try: The Ramones, The Clash, Black Flag, Dead Kennedy's, Husker Du, The Stooges, (pre 1999) Bad Religion...and even Offspring and Greenday are more punk than Blink. Blink have started a wave of nu-punk that is really weak.

Cheshire Cat was an absolutley amazing pop punk album, probably the best pop punk album ever. Buddah and Dude Ranch were also great albums. So, knowing this and hearing What's My Age Again which was a decent single, I expected some good stuff. Boy was I dissapointed. The album is filled just bad songs that disgrace the name of punk. If Blink wants to make this music they should at least let their new fan base of 13 year old girls know that THIS ISN'T PUNK.

I bought it, not knowing it would destroy my love and respect for the band. I gave it away, I disliked it so much. There is a ton of new sound changes and back up vocals on this CD.

Additionally, the Milkmen's offering is not nearly as repetetive; they obviously get the point that a CD is not suppose to have 10 tracks that are nearly identical. Sublime's CDs are also an alternative, if you want to hear a little musicianship mixed with gut-wrenching, vile humor. Blink 182's humor is simply adolescent, Tom Green (of MTV fame... HMMMM... Now things are starting to make sense.) foolishness that became very stale some time ago.But if you really -i mean... REALLY- want a good laugh: listen to Default's \\"The Fallout\\" (See my review on this CD for a story regarding this comedic gem, if you please.) or Tantric's self-titled CD [They have a song called \\"Revillusion\\" that just cracks me the hell up.].

Blink has no talent, I play guitar and am able to play all their songs without a single problem.I am only giving this two stars because Travis really is an amazing drummer and the other star goes to the barely listenable songs.Tip: Have Mark sing, Tom sure as hell can't.And it isn't even punk, some people accuse The Offspring of selling out (they did not), I am surprised no one has accused that of Blink 182.If you want pure Punk, go buy Pennywise, or The Vandals, you want Punk Rock, buy The Offspring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell Happened?","review":"I'd have to say that blink 182 sucks now. Their older stuff was much better. Their first release was probably the best.I HATE PEOPLE WHO CALL THEM PUNK NOW. THEY AREN'T PUNK AT ALL. THE BAND EVEN CALLS THEMSELVES PUNK. THAT IS SO ANNOYING. This cd and band is horrible. After this cd and selling out, I lost my interest in the band. They were much better AND MORE PUNK with the old drummer. This band used to be good and now are just for teenybopper girls and homosexual boys. For some of the other reviews, blink 182 isn't the only band that writes their own music and plays their own instruments. If you want real punk, try Bad Religion (The best punk band ever), Pennywise, NOFX, MXPX, Good Riddance, Descendents (which blink 182 does NOT sound like), and any other REAL punk band. BLINK 182 IS NOTHING BUT A JOKE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love blink 182","review":"this is one of the greatest cd's ever along with lit's a place in the sun. u should buy it right now and listen 2 it 24/7. that's what i did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BLINK 182 ROCKS MY WORLD!","review":"This CD rocks! These guys are awesome. Be sure to check out the lyrics if you sometimes can't understand what they are saying. These guys have a grip on real life!

Also, check out Blink 182 in American Pie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blink 182 Cd by far!","review":"Dude ranch was a fair CD but it is nothing compared to enema of the state. Blink 182 still have a knack for writing catchy songs that teenagers can relate to. Best songs are Don't leave me, going away to college, whats my age again and mutt. Adams song is awesome in the verses but they should have left the chorus a bit slower, but it is still a great song, different than anything they have done. Their next CD should be sensational"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enema Of The AWESOME!","review":"I listened to this album on YouTube and absolutely loved it! I thought it was great, awesome, wonderful, yadda yadda yadda. It has a nice sound for a pop-punk record. I like this album A LOT. Only thing I don't like: knowing this group released the self titled Blink-182 record 4 years later. That was NOT good. Ugh. Enema Of the State rules! Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"they are good, but not that good","review":"While I do think that Blink 182 are three very talented individuals,all their songs tend to sound the same. When I went to the POP DISASTER TOUR and they came on stage me and my friend would be like \\"hey I like this song..wait a minute...I don't know this one\\" and we'd have to wait till they start singing to know which one it was. While i do like \\"Adams Song\\" and \\"All the small things\\" I would not recommend the C.D. The are a great radio band but I wouldn't buy the C.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy, colorful, crazy, marvelous punk!","review":"I first heard of Blink 182 when \\"Dammit\\" began circling around the modern rock stations a couple years back, and then suddenly they exploded with \\"What's My Age Again?\\" and I *had* to purchase their album. Every song on the disc is excellent and the little video on the Enhanced CD portion isn't too bad either. My only real criticism is that it's only about 35 and a half minutes long, and I wonder why they didn't put two or three more songs onto it? Lord knows they could have done it - and quite well as the other 12 prove. I recommend it very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sell-outs are rad...","review":"I LOVED 'Cheshire Cat'. I LOVED 'Dude Ranch'. I LOVED 'Enema'. I'm not a punk fan. I'm not a pop fan. I'm a fan of Blink-182...And will be as long as they make goofy albums that keep you rockin' from start to finish. If you've been thinkin' about buying this CD, go ahead. Make up your own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a sell-out","review":"Blink 182 did not sell out. So their videos are on MTV? Their songs are still like the older ones, fun to listen to, fast, punky, with lots of jokes and stuff. People have just gone way overboard with labeling bands \\"sell-outs\\". This is a really good cd. The sound may have changed a little, but not drastically. Some of my favorite tracks: The Party Song, Going Away To College, and What's my Age Again. And ok, All The Small Things is kind of a fluffy song. Not my favorite, a little too pop. It just makes me a little mad that THAT'S the one MTV and everyone latch on to. It's not the worst song out there, but it's not Blink 182's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tracks, though sound the same","review":"It seems that people have claimed Lit's A Place In The Sun as all tracks sound the same. Well, I love the tracks but no diversity. I love the songs What's My Age Again and Anthem. They seem to get me in an upbeat mood. Also Party Song was a pretty cool fast-paced song. Give it up for Mark, Travis, and Tom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk-Pop","review":"Hey, I have to say that this album is the worse of the Blink 182 guys !

If you wanna hear the true punk check out Dude Ranch (It's awsome) or Chesire Cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This and all their others","review":"At first i doubted that enama of the state would be good. I went and bought it on the 1st day out of loyalty to the guys in blink 182. Soon as I listened to it though i fell in love.

So it might not be punk or even pop punk, just listen to it with and open mind and you will find that is a great CD worth your money. Even if it isnt punk. The best songs are: Dumpweed, Aliens Exist, Going Away To College, What's My Age Again? Dysentary Gary, Adams Song, The Party Song, and Anthem even though pretty much all the songs are good. Buy this cd and if you like it you should check out Lit, Fenix TX, and Green Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This cd is one of the best.

This was the first Blink 182 album I bought, then I got Cheshire Cat, then Dude Ranch and then buddha. This album contains 12 good songs, they all sound good and they are all well writtem, but once I listened to cheshire cat and the other albums by Blink 182 I noticed this was not their best. Their other albums, may be hard to decypher for the newbie listener, but once you hear them over and over you will start to enjoy it, This album is a more 'popy' album than there others, give me good old 'cheshire cat' anyday over this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poser punk rock","review":"Some of the songs are great and the songs anthem and mutt alonemake this CD worth buying but it also has plenty of pop ( ) likewhat's my age again, All the small thing and the annoying adam's song which is more like pearl jam's last kiss than i can take.

Dude ranch was ok, but continually showed that Blink has no interest in changing their music because everything sounds the same. You can cover the issues of proctology and relations with goats so much before people get tired of their childish antics. Since the loss of Scott and the arrival of travis, it has become even worse than everything before. His drumming is horrible and he should've stayed with the hip-ska oriented Aquabats.

But if you buy it, your not just buying those two songs, because every song on the album could be a hit. Some of the other song I enjoy are \\"Dumpweed \\"and \\"Aliens Exist\\".

Thanks Blink182!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Blink cd ever!!!","review":"With this cd Blink182 has gone to a sort of new sound. They have written more full tunes accompanied with some stronger singing, and yes, harmonics. They took out all the intro crap from the last cd, which really detracted from Dude Ranch. I have every Blink cd released including Buddha, and this one just blows them all away. Everyone should buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cd could have been so much more","review":"This cd suffers greatly through the absence of original drummer Scott Raynor.

What was I waiting for? This is a great cd, and I can't believe I didn't get it sooner. There are some famous songs on here, but the best are the ones that I hadn't heard before, like 'Going Away To College' and 'Anthem'. My favorite song by and far is 'Mutt' (absolutely hilarious!).

With their hit songs off the album already, What's My Age Again?, Adam's Song, and All the Small Things, you've got a really great album. The only song I don't listen to is Wendy Clear.

You can have fun and listen to punk rock. Punk rock isnt all depression, drugs, and hate. Its also relationships, love, stupid people you know, and much more. Blink 182 didnt start this you know. Remember the Ramones, they did fun songs about serious topics, and so did the Descendents. Enjoy it for what it is, fun punk rock. If you think Blink 182 sold out, then you probably need to find more to do with your time.

They basically sum up all that is fun, punk and having a great time and with 7 albums, they will go down in history. Upon listening to this album, I am definate that this is the best Blink 182 album. It features the fast, punky trashy songs, those that are a little out of tune, or slightly off time. It features those hilarious sketches inbetween tracks, and basically feels like Blink 182 are not particulary serious about producing a perfect album more, trying to produce a fun album, one that will cheer everyone up. It's typical Blink at their old time best, and is a MUST have for Blink 182 or anyone just trying them out. \\"Adam's song\\", a triumph of musical excellence, \\"What's my age again\\" funny punk, enjoyable, all other tracks, just a little disc of fun!

'All the small things' has just been number 1 over here in the U.K and this really great track sums up the general mood of the album, fast, loud and very jumpy. A lot of people are saying that Blink have sold out, quite frankly I couldn't care less if bands \\"sell out\\", if they're still making great songs, plus making a bit of money does it really matter, no.

It seems to me that all these \\"try-to-hard-to-be-serious-musican-bands\\" or whatever is what has caused rock and punk to go so downhill in the last few years. ANd belive me I really wanted to like this band, I really did, but I just couldn't, I have no respect for Blink 182 nor their music. I mean if you like 80's party music (which I hate but I find others do enjoy) I guess you could take a chance, but other then that if you want a REAL album you should better pass on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Oppostie of What Punk is About","review":"I feel that punk is about not selling out. Blink-182 missed the target by a lot with this CD. The lyrics and videos appeal to teenybopper teenage girls, and their attempt at being 'funny' and 'cute' is horribly nauseating. One of the lead singer's voice is horribley screechy and hard to stomach. Punk-rockers: Stay away from this CD. Teenybopper Girls: I think you'll like it. Bottom line: Not punk, annoying lead singer, no talent, 'punks' trying to be 'cute' and 'funny'. Now ask yourself: Is it really worth it? Do I want to be another sheep? No, you sure as hell don't. stay away from his disk..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorably Great","review":"I bought this album when I was 10 years old and probably listened to it a million times. Over time I varied my taste and hadn't heard blink-182 for about 5 or 6 years until very recently. The second Dumpweed came on all of my old memories of repeat listens flooded back. But this is not a nostalgia record. It is full of simple, incredibly catchy, pop songs. No its not \\"punk\\", but so what? Sure there are only about 4 chords in the whole album but its so short that they don't get old. On this album blink-182 never tries (except the slightly dumb Adam's Song) to be more than they are. This music is so devoid of pretentiousness that it is timeless gold. When I am 80 years old I will turn on blink-182 and remember the good old days."},{"rating":"2","title":"182 Enemas Anyone?","review":"Blink-182 released their breakthrough album in 1999. ENEMA OF THE STATE brought them much needed attention. The Punk/Rock group was given movie soundtrack spots, including for the film American Pie with the bands' track \\"Mutt\\". Blink-182 has interesting guitar solos and amusing lyrics. Drummer Travis Barker is the promising musician of the band, and it amazes me that he hasn't aspired to a higher form of music because he would do so well. The band has a unique style of switching singers depending on the songs they perform. The record is at times repetitive, but after awhile the sound changes. As a whole, ENEMA OF THE STATE is a good Punk/Rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollick and Roll w/ Blink 182!","review":"Probably the late Blink 182's most exhilirating, mainstream effort; from the catchy opening licks of \\"Dumpweed\\", this one's a winner; \\"All The Small Things\\" is infectious rock-pop at it's late 90's best, and \\"Adam's Song,\\" combining slam-dunk rock with a hauntingly beautiful chorus, demonstrates the group's growing maturity. The three aforementioned tracks alone make \\"Enema\\" a sweetie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awsome cd!!!!!!!!","review":"This is an awsome cd that if i get enouhg money i would buy it in an blink!!!!!!!!!!!!! but firts i have to get the money to get the cd. love dunia"},{"rating":"2","title":"response to charlie gigante","review":"this review is in response to that of charlie gigante a few reviews below me. your review is well written, and displays your very extreme opinion in the matter of punk rock. however, whats this about choose wisely. its not the end of the world if someone has a different taste in music than you do. you streach your point of view to insulting these bands. but there are so many people out there that would completely disagree with your statements. this can be determined by how successfull green day, offspring, and blink are. they are selling so many albums that you are left alone in your classic rock world."},{"rating":"1","title":"redwahinee","review":"i admit that i do love blink,but they are sellouts.nothing wrong with sucess,but they strayed a little from their punk roots and early K-ROQ days to this processed pop Britney Spears junk. listen to siamese cat and then to this new enema cd and tell me you dont hear a definite dif.they better change or they will lose many dedicated fans,including me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is my personal favorite","review":"Some people say this cd is pop, others say that they are trying to be cool.

It did not even have a zip on the edges to put baby in and out of the stroller. Only way to take the baby out is to take off the cover completely, fold it and keep it aside. Imagine doing that frequently on a shopping trip- It had a depressing yellow tinge. Cannot imagine my baby watching surroundings in that depressing color tinge- Material was of very poor quality. Every time you fold it, the line would stay permanent. It would become crumbled very easily and have very poor visibility after that.We returned this one and got the Jeep Premium one instead and are very happy with the product. It has everything that was lacking in this product plus a lot more. With just $7 more, it is definitely a better value for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It fits brytax perfectly","review":"It fits brytax B-agile stroller. Brytax's cover is ridiculous expensive. This one is a great substitute.Just hope it can be a little bit clearer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kim Is The Truth!","review":"This cd is Kim's best by far. I am not a big fan of hers at all, usually. All her sex talk in previous albums was just garbage to me, with a few exceptions. But this time around, the change in content and the experiment with different types of sound worked in her favor. Every beat on the album is hot and her lyrics are very clever and well spit. I think the pressure of the trial and the hurt from the betrayal brought out her genius. My fav song is \\"I Know Ya See Me\\", its got a nice beat, the vocalist is great, and Kim's rhymes are on point. The sampling done on the album takes nothing away from its quality, I mean who doesn't sample in the music industry these days. I hope the Kim on this album, is the one we get on future records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil' Kim:The nakes truth","review":"Hi Everybody!I don't have her Hard core album so when I say that this is her best work I compare The naked truth to Notorious K.I.M. and to La bella mafia.What I like about this album is the diversity of the sounds.There are club tunes like Whoa, Kitty box, there is Jamaican feeling like Durty.You can find slower songs like Slippin and Last day.There are some big names as features like Twista, The Game,Snoop Dogg and T.I.The other positivity is that this album is 76 minutes 34 seconds long.So there's a lot of tracks on it althought there are some intros and skits too.My favourite songs are Whoa, Kitty box,Durty and Last day.The lyrics are very good.Some are very hardcore like Kitty box and Gimme that but this is Lil' Kim and I love her no matter what.So if you like female rap buy this album because it worths your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake, horrible talent","review":"Years ago I had the pleasure of meeting the REAL lil'kim from when Diddy and them all were just starting out. Unknownst to most people there were actually two Lil'Kims. Like many sad stories, the less talented one succeeded while the talented, true and beautiful Kim now lives in ghetto of Philly trying to make ends meet. Like her name, Lil'Kim, has lil' talent. Don't waste your money on this - McD's fries are more healther for your ears then this! Two thumbs down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Matured Rapper!!!","review":"I absolutel love Lil' Kim and feel the same about this album. Hence, I don't care for the interludes by the male drag queen or whoever he is. I don't think it was needed and I find it quite dated a'la Rupaul's \\"Supermodel of the World\\" album. Another downside...that horrible song with Snoop Dog. What in the world was Kim thinking? No-one-in-this-day-and-time needs to be writing a song with Snoop about the \\"Chronic.\\" In any case, I feel this is probably her third best album. I rate them in the following particular order:First - HardcoreSecond - Notorious K.I.M.Third - The Naked TruthFourth - LaBella MafiaSo...there you have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but c'mon","review":"There are definately some terrific tracks on this album, especially \\"Quiet\\", but it is also a little depressing that Lil' Kim is such an influential artist because...I can't help but say it...but the image is so negative. How much longer do we need to bring each other down by worshipping people who have nothing positive to offer the world? She is incredibly talented, but what she represents is so damn dark. And the plastic surgery!!! I mean, compare the Asian-white-android creature that Kim has become on this album to the cute doe-eyed (but nasty mouthed) black girl she once was. Doesn't this spell self-hatred? I can't believe that sistas in the U.S. don't get upset about this. Kim is spellbinding to be sure, but so is the Devil..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of ehr best cds","review":"Wow this cd has a lot of my favorites like put your lighters up and spell check and shut up bitch. With this cd it is my favorite she has ever made. Im sure there will be better lil kim always does better."},{"rating":"2","title":"lil kim is the greatest","review":"Lil Kim is back and doing the darn thing like usual. I love Kim's racy lyrics. She is the epitome of a woman. With her unlady like lyrics she pushes the limits. One of my personal favorites is \\"Kitty box\\" in which she speaks freely about sex. Its 2005 and it;s time that woman speak out about the joy of [love making] and such. We can rap and speak about enjoying sex and still be the epitome of a woman. Her hit \\"lighters up\\" is simply a club banger. Its one of those joints where u get your crew and just bounce to it. It rocks. Lil kim we love you and cant wait unitl you are back in the studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kim's best effort is still pretty much crap","review":"It amazes me that she still has a career in music, she was never that talented, she just had her looks going for her, she looks pretty worn out these days with all the plastic surgery and her mic skills leave a lot to be desired. For all of you female hip-hop fans you seriously need to get into Jean Grae, she's the best thing you got going right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF is wrong with you people","review":"This is the worst rap/hip hop cd of the year so far. She didn't do anything but use the same old beats that everyone else uses and even bit Eminem, check out \\"Quiet\\" OMFG. I will admit that her lyrics are pretty good which is the only reason it got a 2 but she should have tried to be at least a little original. And I almost forgot, 13 minutes of this cd isn't even music it's just a bunch of talking and that fake pimp trying to be funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil' Kim Out Does Herself","review":"Lil' Kim has just released the best album since her debut album. I can actually listen to the whole album without skipping a track. Her lyrics are hot and candid, as she speaks of her trial, her sentence, and Junior Mafia. People really need to buy this album and support her, because this album is almost a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Lil Kim Albums Ever","review":"The Naked Truth is one of the best albums of this year and one of Lil Kim's Best since hardcore, this is how an album should be, every single song on there was perfect, the beats are perfect, Lil Kim's performance in this one is spectaular, this is how a great hip hop album should be, not this pathetic junk like the massacre and a thoughts of a predicate felon.This is one of the year's best albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just One Question...","review":"..is that suppose to be her (Lil Kim) on the cover of the album?

She JACKED BIG's flow and rhymes and she's even trying to sound like Eminem on a track. I thought I had my CD player on repeat, but no, she's just saying the same ish over and over.

Out of the four Cd's I bought that day Lil' Kim's \\"The Naked Truth\\" was by far the best, possibly the best album I got this year. Like others said, all the songs are good but there were some tracks that made an impression on me like \\"Spell Check\\", \\"Lighters Up\\", \\"All Good\\", \\"Gimme That\\", \\"Shut Up B****\\", and my personal favorite \\"Whoa\\". I also liked how she got back at everyone who dissed her. If you are thinking of buying this album, I give you the thumbs up to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot!!!","review":"I was neutral about Lil' Kim before but after hearing this cd I have more respect for her than ever before!

You might get burned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest CD She Has Made","review":"I personally have always been a fan of Lil Kim's work. However, she has released albums I was not satisfied with. This CD though is the best she has ever done. It out does Hardcore. Lyrically she is showing some strength. Maybe because now she has something to really talk about all of her songs make sense. I don't feel like I am bouncing around in one song saying \\"what is she talking about.\\" Honestly I love her personality though, she is my favorite but it doesn't mean I will nto be honest.Everyone out there who is doubting this album, all u have to do is listen to a couple of samples.

It is a really hot album Big ups to kim"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"\\"Lil Kim don't f*ck around wit REAL G'z, quick to snatch Yo ugly ass off the streets!\\" - If you don't know where that quote is from, then you're too young for me and I'm not addressing you. But man if there was ever a definition for WASHED UP, Lord knows, Lil Kim fits the bill. She needs to just ride off into the sunset and quit embarassing herself. The horrendous photo on the cover should serve as warning that it doesn't get much better once you open the album up. Many surgeries removed, she's lost her looks and her brash lyrical style. If Tupac were alive, he'd have a field day clownin her. Anyways, I recommend Trina's \\"Glamorest Life\\".

Lil kim 5 mics/5 stars? Quit playing. She is no where near the hottest female emcee in the game. She came in the game riding on biggies fat stomach rolls then sold herself (literally) to the mainstream. Lil kim relies on sex to sell albums not skill. To prove my point, compare lil kim lyrically to the likes of Lauryn Hill, Rah digga, MC lyte, Queen Latifah. Kim needs to quit rapping and be a stripper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil Kim","review":"Lil Kim's latest album is a superior project. I was extremely impressed by her lyrics and the album was mixed perfectly. The Money Mike skits and transitions were hilarious. The beats were extremely diverse. Lil kim's delivery was unbelieveable.

This book overlaps far too much info with the NT Server 4 book, about 70% I reckon, whereas the test overlaps about 10%.

Gen. Chamberlain comes across most as a man of ideals and integrity. His willingness to risk all living up to these character traits is inspiring: first risking life and limb on the battlefield then opportunity and office in Maine politics. The author's book is readable, well paced and engaging. A further examination of Chamberlain's political career as governor would have nicely rounded out the story. I imagine his dealings with the legislature and public would have further supported the author's demonstration of her subject's wartime personnae. But that is a minor observation, the war story is fascinating and moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Chamberlain!","review":"When will people realize how overrated Chamberlain really is?

He loves it! It is very well manufactured. It has all steel parts and basically looks just like a gas powered 4 wheeler. The body is plastic but not a cheap plastic. It came fully assembled except for putting on the handle bars and attaching the throttle and brake. It has no trouble moving on grass or going up hills. My son wanted a gas powered 4 wheeler but I thought he was too young for one so he saw this in a toy catalog and HAD to have it. It goes about 8 miles an hour which is fast enough for a 6 year old. I figured having this one would teach him the basics of riding a 4 wheeler and be much safer until he's older and more responsible.

WOW what a disappointment. I let it charge overnight (20 hours) Christmas Eve, Christmas Day the kids saw it a couldn't wait to ride. They began riding and within 20 mins the battery was dead and I had to push it home. The look of disappointment was terrible. I charged it again overnight (24+ hours) and the same thing, maybe 15 to 20 mins of ride time. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It was well built but very poorly designed. This thing needs to be retooled to last 2 - 3 hours on a single charge.

They keep coming up with more questions that had already been answered by previous e-mails, and my son just stares at it sitting in the garage asking when am I going to get it fixed, and tries to ride an old unit that he is way to big for.

Every single time he cornered a front wheel left contact with the ground.We've had great experiences with other Razor electric scooters and dirt bikes so were really surprised at how poorly this one handled. I think our 150 electric scooter goes faster.

It's light enough so not a big deal. Also, to bad they don't make a battery that lasts longer than 40 minutes of running time and an over night charge.We also bought the full face razor helmut that she has not taken off since Christmas.I also have two other kids that love it.

If you attempt to make a sharp turn at even half speed it will turn over. My grandson was on it for less than a minute when he flipped it. Fortunately he was not injured.

I'm not sure that it really goes up to 10mph but it is fast and has enough power to drive me (200lbs) around the yard!

I had read previous reviews about the battery charge being 'short' but we haven't had any problems with that. It has a battery strength indicator letting us know how much \\"juice\\" we have left (love that) and also is a smooth quiet ride.

The neighbors have an identical one and theirs seems to last longer and also goes considerably faster. I think there is a risk when buying this that you may get one with a bad battery.

If Ms. Blee asks the participants to describe their feelings as a child, then reports them as their current feelings, then the reader must be aware of the bias of the author.

Not only was the plot well thought out and well written, portrayal of Lorraine Page and her life was realistic, gritty, and left no rock unturned. I didn't find this story depressing, I found it hopeful. I enjoy stories that don't sugarcoat the bad things that happen but also leave the reader hopeful that there are good, smart people who can overcome adversity and catch the bad guys! Her fellow compatriots, Rosie (sweet and optimistic) and Rooney (tough, unperfect cop with a big heart) are interesting as well. This is the kind of book you keep so you can read it again! If you like a good whodonit with realistic characters and an interesting plot, you'll like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"COLD SHOULDER--a hot read!","review":"i've only seen one of the PRIME SUSPECT mini-series on PBS (PS #1) and only read one novelization (PS #3), so i came to la plante as a near novice. COLD SHOULDER is an amazing police thriller for people who enjoy character-driven storylines. for much of the book, the mystery takes a backseat to the spychological explorations of the main character--30-something lorraine page. seldom have i encountered a more fascinating and multi-dimensional character as page. at 452-pages, this is a tremendously readable page-turner that i couldnt put down. i carried it everywhere for more than a week. and i can't wait to spread the word to friends looking for the new patricia cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read","review":"This book has severe flaws in logic, so much so that it was painful to read. I only plowed through it because I didn't have anything else to read. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy, badly researched junk","review":"I love the Anna Travis series and had high hopes for Lorraine Page - I was sorely disappointed. Overwrought, under-researched, completely improbable and way too long. If you want to read great present-day stories about LA cops stick to Robert Crais and Michael Connelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careless writing ruins it","review":"The concept is okay, but the characters are cookie-cutter and the style, such as it is, consists of cliches from cover to cover. From the way LaPlante does love to focus on alcoholism you reckon she would have some experience of it or researched it a bit, but none of it rings true. And the plot just does not make sense. She has her main cop drink six fingers of bourbon straight down, twice, then start the third drink rather more sedately. Get real! And he's supposed to be on duty, and he's driving everywhere? It appears that everything LaPlante knows about American cops she's read in trashy novels or seen on trashy TV shows. In other words, nothing. They have ample reason to arrest their main suspect, with a good third of the novel left to go, with full means of eliminating him from the inquiry, but don't dare because he's rich. Dragging it out for dramatic effect like this does not make up for lack of imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wretched story from cover to cover","review":"This book had no redeeming qualities. It's important to somehow connect with the main characters, and to empathize with them to some degree. For me, a good suspense story has to have a break from the darkness once in a while, and an exciting and absorbing plot that has me eagerly waiting to turn the page. This book started badly with it's main character, and only near the end,a candle was lit. It was too little,too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves me cold","review":"This rates as one of the poorer mysteries I have read in years. It was truly an ordeal to finish, and I am left wondering why I bothered. It has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters, many of whom are stereotypical creations of little or no interest. I was particularly amused when the detective was told to \\"make a few inquiries at the transsexual shoe shop, giving the size and style of the shoe from the corpse\\". In all of LA, I am sure there is just one known \\"transsexual shoe shop\\". Please. I suspect Ms. LaPlante has better material, but this is a poor example better left unread. I would give it less than one star, but unfortunately that's not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"the survival of lorraine page","review":"This is my first Lynda La Plante book, I only read it because a friend gave me it and I will now look out for Lynda's other works.This is the story of the survival of Lorraine Page who had the 'great' job, the loving husband and children but who hit the bottle and rock bottom,losing everything including herself. It is a dark and sad story about the people we all look down on, who walk the streets and sell themselves for their choice of drug or alcohol. Lorraine Page begins to drag herself out of her 'grave', with the help of her new found friends, when she becomes the victim of an attack. Although it is sad it is a great story of survival.

Unfortunately, the sequel, \\"Cold Shoulder\\", left me cold. Stink-oh. It's hard to believe the two books were written by the same author. The plot of \\"Shoulder\\" is laborious and relies on unbelievable coincidences that one finds usually in stories from amateur writers. \\"Cold Shoulder\\" is at the bottom of the list of my choices from LaPlante, an author I usually enjoy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairy Tale???","review":"Let's see, female lieutenant guns down innocent black youth in L.A....and her name stays out of the paper in the weeks that follow. That episode from the prologue should make you realize this plot involving a high-ranking, Reagan-honored police officer-turned-fallen, drunkard prostitute is highly unbelievable. La Plante proceeds to build cliched, overwrought dialogue around cardboard characters, and completely loses your interest by page 50 (especially when you see you have another 400 pages to go). While Prime Suspect was a good read, this obviously is another example of a hot new writer demanding and getting carte blanche (and no editor?).

They work great and it is not as easy to break the code as some have said. I have purchased cheaper push button locking devices and there is definitely a difference in quality - this is a good one. This is good for daily use. I have only mounted these in weather protected areas. I have one mounted to a wall and one to a table. Opening the wall mounted keysafe is slightly difficult for one hand operation since the cover is not attached and has to be removed completely. There is a loop on the cover to attach a key, making it easier. I have fit a Toyota \\"key\\" (2008) and a house key in one and a house key and a few smaller odd shaped keys in the other.I recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different brand delivered","review":"I ordered this item last week and received it yesterday. The key safe delivered was not branded GE Access nor Supra, but Kidde.Comparing the Supra and Kidde websites, the key safes appear to be the same underlying box including the same model numbers. It would just be nice if Amazon correctly labeled it.The box is very heavy and seems very secure and well-made. The combination is easy to set, but the indicators showing which numbers are selected are very small. I haven't put it into use yet, so for now I'm reviewing only its potential.You need to hold the \\"open\\" button down once it's open in order to put the cover back on without re-entering the combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It became quickly apparent that this is primarily an art film. Unfortunately the special effects detracted from the interestings clips where the scientists spoke on the topic of evolution.

Overall disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a toy","review":"I purchased this for my son's birthday. It's a lovely model, but it is NOT a toy and should not be listed in Amazon's toy department.

This CD brings home the true meaning of Christmas and the selection of worship leaders he chose to sing most of these songs was perfect since we are familiar with them all. They all have such strong vocals and the passion they feel comes through with each song. This is so refreshing for us Christians. Tim Janis outdid himself and for that we are truly grateful. This CD will be treasured in our family for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.... ever.","review":"Subtitles. Might keep people away. But it shouldn't phase you a bit.

The scenery is astounding and the story is one to entrall you. But the actual movie lags a bit. It seems to want to be slow and deliberate but has no reason to be. It's quite a good movie.The DVD features deleted scenes, a featurette, and others I can't think of at the moment.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lush. Gorgeous. Interminable.","review":"The idea that another viewer might spend more than two non-returnable hours watching this well-acted, beautiful and pretentious film was enough for me to overcome my reluctance to comment on it.Two brief points:1.) This film was shot without a script. This will not come as a surprise to anyone who has seen it.2.) In the DVD extras, actress Ziyi Zhang (who plays Bai Ling) confesses with a nervous laugh, \\"None of us knew what the film was about.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"2046 is it really that long!!","review":"The trailer was better than the movie. Though it was beautifully filmed it was to long. The trailer was a bit misleading, but no spoiler here.

Visually, the film looks stunning. But there is really no plot or storyline and the characters are boring. The story doesn't really go anywhere. It is almost like an exercise in aesthetics.Maybe not having a written script is not a good idea for this film. It might have worked for his past films but certainly not with this one.And my personal fave of WKW would be In the Mood for Love, which I recommend highly. It is such a beautiful film, from the visuals, the storyline, the acting, the set, everything is perfectly done. Even the smoke from the cigarettes creates a certain mood/nostalgia.Also, Happy Together is another film from WKW that I like.But this one is a total mess. It was pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring","review":"This movie is so boring. It spends 2 hours talking about the same thing over and over. They have someone speaking Japanese to someone who is speaking back in Chinese. The conversation does not make any sense at all. The only thing I like is the Spanish song. But there is only one. They play the same song over and over for 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me about the first time","review":"Beautiful movie to look at. I remember a scene where a girl asks the main character why things can't go back the way they were. And he walks away smiling....not laughing at her or anything, but a smile born from pain and understanding how fleeting love can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous and mesmerizing","review":"Like almost all of Wong Kar Wai's films, this one is intensely beautiful to look at with a stunning soundtrack to match, and has a wonderfully lyrical style.It's one of very few films that made me want to watch it again as soon as I finished watching it...there is so much richness and depth, almost every frame and scene invites repeated re-viewings. There were a number of elements of the story and characters that I didn't immediately \\"get\\" the first time, which was nice. Much better than your typical dumbed-down, over-simplified Hollywood dreck that is easily predicable within the first 10 minutes.The special features are also substantiative, with the deleted scenes being quite good and fully produced rather than some raw unfinished footage. The interviews with Wong Kar Wai, (the absolutely exquisite) Zhang Ziyi, and Tony Leung are also very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have GOT to be kidding ...","review":"Why is it the greatest part of many films are the previews. If this director and screenwriter woiuld have spent as much time on the move as they did on the preview this may have been an interesting film.Unless I guess you keep a bong very nearby while watching this film I will guarantee that the viewer will have absolutely NO idea as to what is going on at any one point in time. The film most certainly is very Oriental with the dark and brooding images, the compulsory 'player type' bad boy and of course we need the chain smoking super sexy bright lipstick female lead.To say that I was disappointed with the lack of substance would be an understatement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not even finish it.","review":"I love Asian movies. I like them because they tend to be more cerebral and less politically correct than the garbage coming out of Hollywood these days. 2047 however, was the first asian movie that I failed to finish becaase of the sheer BOREDOM of the plot. Don't get me wrong, the main actor (Clark Gable look-alike) is an excellent actor and the babes were gorgeous, but the movie itself IMO is overrated. You can argue \\"art\\" all you want but if you like an endless stream of a playboy making girls sad it may be for you(not my bag at all).

The book gives equal and welcome emphasis to programs, personalities, and invariaby interesting behind-the-scenes stories of production, budgets, and technical challenges, as well as ratings and the myriad other business factors that allowed local kids' TV to flourish but which finally decreed that it must die. This is an attractively packaged volume, with smart, pleasing art direction and a generous selection of photographs. The book will be embraced by grown-up Chicagoans, of course, but also will fascinate people like me, who grew up elsewhere, but who have an interest in the art and business of television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I bought this for my hubby.

In my opinion, it's not worth the avg review of 4.5 stars.The book starts with introductory chapters, that's fine for new users. But after that, it continues to follow the path of giving out code by code, with little exlaination of the real world requirements and the implemented mechanism.The book lack a chapter for CFML language (types, functions, etc), which should be placed in the beginning part and should be a base for further learning.The chapters on application framework and session variables is not even as clear as Allair's online documentation, which is brief itself.The chapter about custom tag should be place on this book, not on \\"advanced\\" one, as modular design should be used in the first place, and not many designers/developers have time to read both books before starting their projects.This book contains some good parts though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"If you interested in learning Cold Fusion, don't waste your time or money on this book.

There is almost always a practical example to be a guide for each of the small things that go into applications we write. Examples are clearly explained and they WORK!We standardized on Cold Fusion rather than ASP in part because of the much faster learning curve the Forta Book makes possible. (We could find no equivalent book for ASP). Further, we almost never refer to the Cold Fusion manuals that come with the Product - the Forta book is the reference of choice.This reviewer's background includes writing in 25 different programming languages over the years and this is the best practical \\"How to do it\\" software manual I have seen to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference!","review":"In fact, most of the material in the book can be found in the various reference manuals that come with ColdFusion Studio 4.0. However, Ben Forta has consolidated the important information into a single resource and includes examples (both in the book and the included CD) that make this book a necessary addition to any ColdFusion developer's library.

Come on, Ben!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource Book","review":"Although there are a few typos and mismatched screencaps in the book, all in all it is well worth the price if you're getting started in ColdFusion.

It is one of the most enjoyable technical books that I have read. However, if you if you have the 2nd Edition, the information in the 3rd Edition is only 5-10% new. Case and point, there are several screen grabs from Cold Fusion 3.0 and chapters that are verbatim the same as the 2nd Edition.

If you are new to CF buy this book along with the 'Dummies\\" book and you should be in good shape. Use the Dummies book for the installation and setup and some straight forward examples. This book builds on the Dummies examples. However, this book alone may cause you undue frustration - lots of typos and weak explainations.

However, what I didn't like was the section on application.cfm, session and client variables. The explanations, or rather, the lack of explanation, were very superficial and did not cover in depth the purpose of these important variables. The example with the CF_pet would be a complete mess for many developers. Later as I had to develop more and more CF applications I realized that client and session vars are actually very important.

As a 4 grader and a good player at my school chess club I got this book to help me. But, I became confussed by the explaining of things. I did read the other reviews and it is absolutely true that the writer does not know how to checkmate with the King and the Queen against a lone Queen properly - he doesn't teach using the king to make it fast. I could teach this to the writer of this book and improve it. The writer must learn to play chess good before trying to teach kids or he will teach kids wrong like he does in the book. I looked the writer up on the chess federations website and he is not a master or even a chess expert. Very sad and probabably one reason why there are so many mistakes in the book. Chess books should be writen by good players. You should not buy this book and make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not clear and not well set up","review":"I returned this book after getting it when it came slightly damaged in the mail (a good excuse to get my money back).

I thought that maybe this book would have improved in the ability of the author to explane things. Not so.I agree with the revewer that said that the way this book shows checkmate with a King and a Queen is slow.

If you were hoping for a skeptical, but refreshing, take on traditional Roman Catholic beliefs presented in an honest, academic manner, look elsewhere. It is sad, and frightening, that this kind of Anti-Catholic invective still exists at the dawn of the 21st century.

This and the prequel - both over 1000 pages - would have been much better books at 250 pages. The punishment is literal - you want to find out what happens but Hamilton punishes you with tedious unnecessary detail.

(Perhaps mature is the wrong word: \\"age\\" might be better, when I think of Patricia Cornwell, Tom Clancy, or Dan Simmons.)Very happily, I can report that this is a fine, absorbing, diverting read, which I unreservedly recommend to all.

Having very much enjoyed the first book I am surprised I waited this long to grab the second.I will not go into the story it is very important to let it develope without having any knowledge of how it plays out and would be unfair to anyone that has not read it. So I will just keep it short by fully recommending this book. However don't read it without reading the first one Pandora's Star. You will be very pleased by getting both they are a great read if you like fully blown universe. Hamilton has a way with his characters that makes them endearing and real.Peter F.

Like the other books, I just find them way too long. This book weighted in at just over 1200 pages, and I think at a minimum should have lost at least 400 pages.The story itself is not bad, but it is just buried too deep in drug-out descriptions and non-essential story lines that by the time I final finished, I was more relieved than impressed. Finishing the book felt like getting to the weekend after a week of work at a job you almost like....the work being = the book.I also grew tire of the author's jr high-ish glee in sex scenes. Many or most of the main characters (10-20) are all sleeping with each other or have at some point in the past.

A continuation of Pandors Star, which was a good book, Judas Unchained is a GREAT book. The author twists a tail full of space adventure, intrigue, politics, money, sex, and emotion. The idea of wormholes, evolution, and aliens hasn't really ever been so exciting. In my mind, Judas Unchained, is one of the Best Science Fiction books I've read since the Red Mars Trilogy! Also, I gave the bood to my Dad, he loved it as much as me... I hope it wins some awards..."},{"rating":"2","title":"complex","review":"Hamilton's normal M.O. is to dump a zillion characters on you at once, and then change scenes quickly. He provides little explanation for concepts, just to add to the problem. For awhile, you're reeling and confused, and really need to pay attention or you face the serious possibility of being totally lost as you enter this sprawling work--and others he does. While there may be some valid criticism of his technique of demanding hard work from the reader, it all comes together, and his works are complex and rewarding. The finishes are not always quite as good. Still, this is pretty fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good epic story, a bit long and wordy.","review":"Good story. Characters are developed although a lot of the issues were not resolved. It could be considered consistent on a vibrant large universe where everything does not end in a happy ending or we follow everyone's story.The technology seem to be too obscure in the details. We are just expected to assume that the technology is there and that people re-life in a normal and regular basis, etc. I guess, in a way, this is what we already do in modern life in our world, where we just assume that technology works and sometimes forget the marvels that were discovered before all of this has become everyday mundane things.

This epic was complex and very intriguing. I enjoyed the characters, scenery, technology and the way they fit into the twenty or so subplots. I was constantly amazed at how little tangents were brought back to a close in the final chapters. The ending however was a bit anticlimatic. I felt like the entire book was extremely fast paced but in the end, the characters said \\"ok, we're done. Let's go have a beer. The End\\". In fact, it felt just the oposite of reading a Terry Goodkind novel where as he drags out the first 9/10 of the book only to jam the last 1/10 down your throat without any pacing.

Children in grades 2 and up can probably read the book by themselves and will love learning about horses along with the book's main character Toni. The story is very realistic in the way that it describes riding stables and how people first learn to ride horses. Toni gets better at riding by WORKING for it and learning all that she can. As a result, the book shows her achieving her goals and making some new friends in the process. In my opinion this book would make an excellent gift idea for a younger reader that loves horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"As far as \\"Tales of King Arthur\\" go","review":"I'd have ot rate this one as preety good now keep in mind I happen to be a fan of David Gemmell others who are looking for the same basic kind of stuff but more grounded in reality may want to look at some of the works of Bernard Cornwell.Overall-As for myself I liked the book a lot for some reason a lot of the books based on King Arthur seem to have Atlantis tie ins.

On top of that, there was a loose screw in the container that is supposed to collect the nail trimmings. While I was trying to re-insert the metal pieces and the spring, the red cap on the on/off flexible light switch popped off. This product is like something Mr. Haney would sell to Mr. Douglas on Greenacres.The idea is good, though.

In it, Louis Sullivan writes about himself growing from a child into a man, and recounts his personal drive, his fascination with nature, his love of man, bridges, engineering, and buildings, and his desire to create something new without the help of the dusty books of Neo-classicism. Louis Sullivan was never known for his modesty, and the tone of this book is nothing less than self-celebratory, which lends an overall optimistic tone to it. A bonus is the extensive photo plate section - it's interesting to see how his works grew as he did. Unfortunately the plates don't coincide with the text, which is the major flaw in this edition.

The author travels to Sindh and revists the places visited by Sir Richard F. Burton, and then writes about his observations.

Secondly, his views are clouded by his sources which are all feudal in nature. One cannot experience Sindh without looking at the lives of the everyday people. I for one wasn't impressed by the fact that the authors hosts in Sindh were the biggest criminals and landlords of the province.Finally, it is silly for the author to keep pointing out that Burton was well known for his controversial report about homosexuality in Karachii.

Perl and Dana were students in dental school; now they are practicing dentists with daughters who demand regular attention. When Perl notes signs that Dana is having a relationship, he tries to ignore them, but the children can't. This is a fine analysis of a marriage at work. Although he knows Dana is seeing someone else, Perl is convinced that if he ignores it--that if the marriage and family continue on--Dana will have to give it up. A bout of flu saves them all. The five short stories vary, but The Age of Grief is prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"short stories","review":"I didn't realize this was a compilation of shorts; but most of them that Iread, I enjoyed.

The narrator manages to be very interesting despite the humdrum surroundings. Highly recommended.The short stories that precede the novella are good but not particularly noteworthy. Unlike the most recent reviewer, I actually liked Dynamite the most. Smiley is a gifted craftsman and an interesting writer. I've managed to overcome my first reading of her -- the dreadful Duplicate Keys -- and her idiotarian op-ed current affairs writing to have real respect for her as an artist. On a side note, \\"Moo\\" has to be one of the best comic novels I have ever read. \\"The Age of Grief\\" isn't quite up to that level of quality and imagination but it's a very accomplished and affecting novella.

The picture is pretty good, but the box has a DVI out and the TV has an HDMI in, so I bought this cable and gave it a try. It noticeably improved the HD picture. This cable is a single-link DVI and the box connector is a double-link type, but it seems to make no difference. So if you have HDMI on your cable box, use it; if you have DVI-out, this cable might be the second-best choice. I am happy with the improvement.

One note for people setting up a similar system: although HDMI cables can carry both audio and video, the DVI connector on Macs (and probably other computers too) is video only so this cable will not carry sound out of your computer. Make sure your TV or receiver can accept an audio stream separate from the HDMI video.

However, the author, Paul Garner, has a very specific agenda which should be noted by the reader. Garner is a self-identified member of the \\"Neo-Porfiriato,\\" which, essentially, puts him in a position to defend the history of Diaz. Although he valiantly attempts to provide a fair and balanced view of the infamous dictator, he inevitably falls into a defensive mode, trying to restore Diaz's good name.Overall, it was a very informative book that I enjoyed reading. It is very off beat compared to most biographies of Diaz written over the last century. Most paint Diaz as an evil, heartless, ego maniac while Garner attempts to show a more thoughtful, loving president.

It's a great place for someone who thinks they don't like poetry to start reading, because it has the pacing and tension of a thriller; it'll make a believer out of the most reluctant of readers. But for people who already love poetry, it offers even more reward: an incredible fusion of the form with the theme. Mose undergoes such severe tests and agonies; everywhere those emotions are echoed in line-breaks, fractured sentences, and a growing sense of loss and Mose's shattering mental state. The structure is incredible; the poems are numbered in the days that remain of Mose's jail sentence, so they grow smaller even as time continues forward, meanwhile in Mose's mind, we move ever backwards towards the crisis that put him where he is. It makes time seem to collapse.

There's also still plenty of crosscultural intersplicing, with hints of Celtic, Asian and African music throughout, as well as an ever-present, ever-clever bit of Appalachian banjo picking and country guitar which pops up from time to time.

I purchased this 3lb. bag and was excited to try it. The first time I became very nauseous and I did not connect it to the Hemp Seeds. The next time I sprinkled it on my salad. Approximately two hours later I got horrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting. It was so awful! I was in pain the whole night. I was afraid to eat anything the next day.

I typically purchase the Manitoba Harvest brand, but the price on the 5 pound bag with Subscribe & Save was unbeatable.

I thought it was a fluke, and had nothing to do with the hemp seeds, so I ate them again a few days later, when I was feeling better. Within 30 minutes of eating, I was vomiting profusely, with terrible stomach pain. I wonder perhaps if there was some ecoli (or similar) bacteria on the seeds. I tossed the rest of the $50 bag.

I'm not allergic to hemp, in fact consume hemp milk every day, so this was quite a surprise.

However, after lightly toasting the seeds and sprinkling them on a salad, my first impression after a bite was that there were a bunch of shells among the seeds. I have no idea if the package I received was simply a bad batch or if hemp seeds always have such a gritty consistency but it seemed to me that I was eating shells as much as seeds.

In Arizona, Kimble has been shot by a cop, and Annie (Hope Lange) nurses him back to health, amidst suspicions by a small town policeman who cares for Annie too that she is shielding him from the law.

When he refuses to quit the coach takes drastic and unethical measures to force him off the team. With the help of Janet (Annette O'Toole), his lovely tutor and potential love interest, Henry must discover whether he has the talent and determination to prove himself both on and off the basketball court.Critique: \`The still waiting for a DVD release \`One On One' from '77 is an entertaining teen coming-of-age film that works for adults as well.

Disarming.","review":"Josh Kadison captures the essence of relationships, both sweet and broken, in a disarming, unusual way. And in the process, captures a piece of America. He writes poignantly and sweetly about loves lost and dreams still blazing in the California Sun.Kadison is a story-teller. His lyrics paint pictures of Jessie, Rachel, Lady Jane, and others so clearly and compellingly, we feel that we know them. \\"Beautiful in My Eyes\\" is as powerful as it is beautiful. Every I listen to \\"Jessie\\" I smile. \\"Picture Postcards\\" is dreamy and whimsical. In some way, Kadison captures the American dream and the modern relationship in poetry and in song.There is no self-pity here, only a charming, poetic, sometimes painful, glimpse into Joshua Kadison's heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Little Treasure Buried in the sands of Mexico","review":"From the moment I first heard \\"Jessie\\" on the radio in the early 1990's, I was hooked on Joshua Kadison's voice. I love this CD so much. Every song on it tells a poetic story of love, emotion, beauty and the singer/songwriter's life. Although this is the only CD of his I've ever owned (or even heard), it's one of my favorites. It's one of my \\"go-to\\" CD's whenever I'm feeling sad or depressed. It makes me feel beautiful somehow, and I envision the scenarios he sings about (Jessie, art, the cat, living on a beach in Mexico, etc). I am taken to these places with him. I love that he takes me on that journey. His voice is not only clear and strong, but it's also gentle, which I really enjoy.If you haven't had a listen, and you're not ashamed to enjoy music that some might classify as \\"cheesy\\", this CD is worth hearing. For someone like me, a true visionary, it's a wonderful escape. I hope it can be the same thing for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for making easy listening cool","review":"I don't ever hand out a 5-star rating lightly, but this album earns it hands down, first ballot, no contest, #1 with a bullet. It starts with the sweet, poignant, and incredibly pretty Jessie (which nearly earned the 5 by itself) and just smoothly sails from there.The thing that really stands out is that, like all great artists, Kadison finds the perfect balance. Never too syrupy, bland, gentle, sappy, or preachy. Some tracks, especially Mama's Arms, incorporate a gospel overtone without being overtly (and annoyingly) religious.On top of that, it just sounds really really nice, and who doesn't appreciate that?(Seriously, though, I *never* say that a single song makes the album worth owning, and I'm telling you, Jessie makes this worth owning. That says something right there.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible stuff!","review":"This CD is just my style! Joshua Kadison is a true artist, both with words and sound. He sings of things that I can recognize, and makes me laugh when he laughs, and cry when he cries. The piano work is beautiful, and I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes music that is truly musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Artist of the 20th century!","review":"This album is more than music, more than songs, you get so many different pictures from every line of every song on this album. This is one album that you never get tired of hearing and in a time where music is 2 or 3 different lyrics and synthized sounds it is so wonderful to be able to experience someone who has true talent and the ability to make you reflect why enjoying his musical gifts. I have this album, Deliah Blue and the 2 (\\"Saturday Night in Storyville\\" and \\"Troubadour In A TimeQuake\\").from his personal WEB site. He is truly one of the all time greatest talents to ever hit the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, inspriring album","review":"From the opening track, Jessie, to the awe inspriring close of Georgia Rain, each song on this album is a classic.Musical genius, poet and storyteller, Kadison tells stories of real people, real lives and real loves.Without doubt, the highlight of my music collection, though his other CDs, Delilah Blue and Saturday Night in Storyville both come close. Also check out his book - Seventeen ways to eat a mango."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat that exceeds all expectations.","review":"If you have a penchant for soulful stories, expressions of humanity, and incredible melody by voice and piano, you must expose yourself to the music of Joshua Kadison. His platinum album is only surpassed by his live performance. There's no question that his talent is on par with that of Elton John, except that Joshua is also an exceptional lyricist/storyteller. He does it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs for the soul","review":"While Joshua may not have reached the pop star fame of others likeRichard Marx - Greatest HitsandMichael Bolton - Greatest Hits 1985-1995He certainly isn't lacking in the soulful ballads and songs that tug at your heart.

An entertaining novel that will both stimulate and amuse from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not In Our Stars is Cosmic","review":"Hate politically correct? You'll love this novel.

Still standing the test of time.","review":"Three Simple Words 14. Wiggedy WackGood stuff. They still got that funkiness of \\"Something Good,\\"plus more. The tracks are quite diverse in styles. \\"Power to the beats\\" is a great breakbeat tune I could see Fatboy Slim remixing. Lost Vagueness is up-beat, trancy-- Paul Oakenfold had already used in his Travelling album. B777 is a great melodic trance tune perhaps resembling Art of Trance and someother Platipus record lable group. Vocals in \\"three simples words\\" are quite beautiful. A few other tracks may be compared to Basement Jaxx or Leftfield. Eventhough Utah Saints shows diversity in their music they still maintained their signature sounds (you'll figure out listening to them). They've spinned with Leftfield on Radio 1 UK, essential mix. So I guess they could be comparable. A great buy, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Contrary is Quite Compelling, & Quite Engrossing","review":"Stated simply... This is one of the most impressive reads regarding the Roman Catholic Faith!Not only is it educational, but it is provocative.

They never seem confused or concerned. They act like it's an everyday occurence. Ms Lykins gives a whole new meaning to the word time travel. They are very innovative and the people in her stories act confused, concerned and scared. They pull from an inner strength they never realized they possesed to deal with the situation. If you enjoy time travel and a good love story, you'll love any of Ms. Lykins books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil is in the Details","review":"When reading a story, I understand many look for realistic details to make them feel a part of the characters. Waiting For Yesterday certainly is long on details. In my opinion, the author could have left out the unsavory descriptions of childbirth(a man's hand shoved up into the heroine's uterus), the disgusting vivid account of breast engorgement(and breast milk shooting across the room), baby biological functions(specifically descriptions of feces being smeared on the heroine). I could go on, but I'm sure by now you get the picture.If it weren't for the unnecessary descriptions, which fill an abundance of pages in this book, the story could have been enjoyed more. I do admit to finishing the book, due to interest in how Barrett, the main character, would choose her fate.Normally, I would give a short detailed description of the overall story, but I won't bother this time since I sincerely suggest spending your reading entertainment dollars on a different book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The least liked time-travel romance I've read!","review":"Sorry, but I thought this book was boring.

I made my wedding and engagement rings under his supervision (lost wax), and could not have been happier!!! Unfortunately, he died accidentally in the 1980s; but his book will remain the best textbook for silversmithing there is, in my opinion. His only updates were to have new photographs of student work every few years. I'm glad the other reviewer was able to find his favorite edition.

Fit on both ends was snug to the point of being difficult. I have experienced no looseness. The length was ample for my installation in a full tower case.That being said, I had assumed that the angled connector would fit with the length of the cable turned down. The cable I received was not that way. The angled connector fits into the drive in such a way that the cable is fed upward toward the top of the case. If I were installing my drives low in the case, that might be perfect. In my application, it made the installation and cable routing awkward.

Exactly what I needed for my Dell. The cable I got had straight connectors on both ends! With a very sharp kink on the cable the cover closed with a push and the drive runs. However, I will not be surprised if the cable fails. My guess is a wrong cable was mailed. The cable is called on the shipping slip SATA18RA1 (RA=right angle?). The bag itself has only single marking (0.5 m = ca. 18 inches as advertised). There is no good way was the person pulling the order to know if it is an angled connector or not except to know the merchandise an look. I will see if I can return it, but at the price of the cable and cost of shipping and hassle, this seems hardly worth it. Even this review is costing me more time than is the cost of the cable.

Genevieve is filled with pop culture references, clever twists and mercifully devoid of fantasy cliches.The first novel in the collection Drachenfels opens with a group of mismatched heroes heading for the evil wizard's tower (YAWN) however they are messily killed in the first few pages and the story then skips ahead ten years and focuses on the big-budget play being produced to celebrate their triumph where the hero is a vain director and self-proclaimed genius.The entire book is like that, what seem to be typical fantasy stories soon focus on daily life in a medieval world.Pick it up you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a showcase of a legendary voice in country-rock& folk songs","review":"these songs captured my attention as a FM dj at a college station in the early 70's-what would become the eagles was her traveling band Linda can belt out a song with the best of them and she surely does on several here. I think the choice of music was eclectic-a trademark of hers on future efforts-the players can play and Linda will kill with that voice- this is a little country so if you don't like pedal steel guitars this isn't for you- I love this more than \\"heart like a wheel\\" and the rest-she was full of passion on these songs and it comes through.She wasn't famous when these were recorded so it's sparse on studio gimmicks which I appreciate.

I'm turning thirty and hopefully it'll keep my face totally free of crows feet for a good long time to come. No expensive anti-wrinkle creams here. Also, it's fantastic for cooking Thai and Indian food. Really high heat tolerance. Takes forever to go rancid, so the shelf life is awesome.

I use it for baking, stovetop cooking, and as a moistuizer for my skin (it works great, isn't real greasy, and it doesn't contain synthetic toxic ingredients like conventional lotions.)

It is at least on par or superior to the products purchased at Whole Foods and health food stores but at a much lower price. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product to family and friends, only problem is that most people are still sceptical of the health benefits of coconut oil.

This Nutiva is just as good. I like having the small jar from the Source Naturals product to refill with the Nutiva. I've been using this coconut oil for awhile now and will never switch back to any other type of oil/fat for stir-frys, etc. - anything involving cooking with heat, including baking where I would usually use pure butter. The only two food items that don't seem to taste as good using the coconut oil are eggs and pancakes. For stir-frys I still add a little olive oil toward the end for the health benefits but no longer cook with it after finding out the olive oil does not hold up well to higher heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there anything you can't use this oil for?","review":"I think not!OF course it is great for all the things people have mentioned, but I have found it particularly wonderful as a facial CLEANSER.

The excess oil comes off with all the dirt and makeup that was on my face (even the water proof mascara) and it leaves a nice light film of oil that makes my face glow, and for ONCE in my life I'm free of blemishes, even during those particularly difficult times of month!

Beautifully produced and arranged.

Just wish they didn't come off so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing stupidity","review":"As others have mentioned here, it's ridiculous that Plantronics forces its customers to purchase a replacement set of 3 different sizes, when all I needed was replacing the broken ear piece of the size I obviously know is the correct one for me. Why not offer packages with 3 ear gels of the same size, instead of forcing customers to order two sizes they don't need, in order to get the one that fits. Absolutely outrageous! For this idiocity I'm giving it only one star, although obviously, the product itself is OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad marketing","review":"It makes lots of sense when you purchase the headset to include three different sizes of earbuds. You get to choose which one fits best. But once you know that and want to order replacements, it makes NO SENSE to ship three different sizes. You should be able to order the replacement size you want and get three of them.The current marketing strategy is inefficient (for the consumer), wastes resources (you throw away the two incorrect sizes), and expensive (you pay for three, only to use one).Come on Plantronics, you make great headsets, you can do a much better job of consumer supplies."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is soooo expensive","review":"i lost the original set and needed the replacement. if i can do it all over again, i wouldn't buy a bluetooth headset and instead stick with the corded headset since i only use it when i'm in the car anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I just wish I could have purchased 3 of the same size instead of having to purchase one of each size (S, M & L)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the 35 seconds gone?","review":"Please forgive me Mr. Cerrone, that I give this milestone in music history only 4 stars.

This is another reason, not only look to CD's. If someone of you have a LP don't give it away. Everybody can see how important the \\"Supernature\\" is for me that I see this mistake.

Still sounds good after 20 years!","review":"I first heard this when it was on 8-track. It belonged to my sister and I would listen to it over and over whenever she wasn't around. I never heard this music on the radio but I thought it was good music. I must have been about the age of 10.The song \\"Supernature\\" sounds like todays dance music. It was ahead of it's time. And the 3rd song sounds like Enigma's music. Anyway, I couldn't believe that this album exsisted on CD and Amazon.com is the only place I know of that had it. So, I ordered it and I'm glad I did! It still sounds good since it's release date 1977."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?!!","review":"One the great dance albums... but whomever re-worked the tapes has altered it to the point where the vinyl record actually sounds better. The first part of the opening number is gone all together. The overall sound of this re-release has been either equalized wrong or was over compressed. Please spare your money and pass on this. Try to find Cerrone 3 by another production house.

I have been married for 2 years and I did not learn anything new from this book. I would say that over half the book and most of the exercieses are about how to play with yourself. For those of us that are not into that this is not a good book (Besides I wanted a book about sex not masturbation). Some of the exercieses are good but they seem to repeat themself and not expand on anything. It does teach some good stuff about self control which you can learn from but not very good for a beginner and not much there for the advanced. If you have even a little imagination and common sense you should be able to figure most of this out on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do much for me","review":"This book definitely doesn't fall into the \\"playful ideas to spice up a decade-old marriage\\" category.

The information on the sights was perfect for us. It helped prioritize our list of things to see, explained the layout of the city, and gave good background information. The book's emphasis on visual communication works better for me than the traditional purely narrative guidebook. The book also contains good street level maps for the central parts of the city.The information on restaurants, however, was weak. It is out of date.

I'm constantly amazed that they weren't more popular than they were. Each of their albums seems to have a different theme, intentional or not, and the vibe here is very much the southwest, and of course Mexico. But it doesn't dominate the album. \\"Heal It Up\\" is the only single I remember, and a very strong song. \\"End Of The Line\\" is an excellent guitar strummin' song. \\"(Love is a) Blind Ambition\\" seems to be the \\"Tommorrow Wendy\\" of this cd, musically anyway. Plus two versions of the title track, (one in Spanish). Johnette's voice is perfect as always. For someones first, or only Concrete Blonde disc, I'd suggest \\"Recollection\\", but for anyone this is really a wonderful cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing rock CD","review":"I have several CD's by Concrete Blonde, but I have to admit that I don't know that much about them. I do, however, know they make some really good music. This CD has almost a mystical feel and reminds me of being in the Southwest desert. As suggested by the title, the CD also seems to be influenced by Mexico. The song, MEXICAN MOON, is one of their best songs ever (along with \\"Joey,\\" from \\"Bloodletting\\"). I also like the Spanish version included here, which sounds quite different. I also really love HEAL IT UP, and Johnette Napolitano really wails on it in a primal kind of way. In addition, there are a couple of great ballads, including (LOVE IS A) BLIND AMBITION. Overall, a top-notch alt-rock CD. MEXICAN MOON was the group's last CD for awhile (they released a CD in 2002 that I haven't heard yet), and it's one to be thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed, flimsy","review":"I was disappointed with this book - it's more of an \\"optical illusion\\" kit with a little book inside of the kit. There are examples of optical illusions - but the book itself is small and you'll find bigger more comprehensive books elsewhere (e.g. Al Seckel). There are also some 3-D images and 3-D glasses but the pics were very marginal - i've seen much better. Then there are some other plastic and cardboard odds and ends to attempt your own illusions - but all these \\"spare parts\\" look flimsy and look like items will be easily lost, broken, or not perform adequately. I had hoped to use this for a Kindergarten class but there is no way it would hold up to young children. I was much more pleased with the quality of a book by Al Seckel and would encourage others to check his books out instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOFOG rocks","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing them live in concert and was hooked every since. Thanks guys, for a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bastard Life or Clarity","review":"I am a serious Russell Crowe fan. As an actor, he's right up there with Alec Guinness in his ability to play any type. As a singer, he's ordinary, as is this album. There are a couple of nice trumpet riffs, but you've got to admit that Crowe hits quite a few flat notes. The lyrics are banal, the music undistinguished. After listening a few times, I took this to my local music store as a trade-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did he venture into music?","review":"I'm almost terrified to write this review for the fact he might come beat me up.Come ON, people... this is just another side of Crowe's ego thinking he is some wonderful thing. Yes, he's a good actor, but singer? The songs are less than mildly pleasing and he has absolutely NO depth to his voice whatsoever. I would never recommend this to anyone, and just might go back to listening to Telly Savalas' 'If'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme more Grunts","review":"If you are in the mood for some country/folk/rock, I suggest you get the TOFOG cd, Bastard Life or Clarity. My favorite tracks were \\"Swept Away Bayou\\", a rollicking tune; \\"Sail Those Same Oceans\\", \\"The Legend of Barry Kable\\" and \\"The Night that Davey Hit the Train\\". This cd is like a good appetizer tray, and you might want to nibble at the tracks until you find your favorite flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 9 stars!!","review":"Curiousity begat another fan for the talent, intellect, and sense of humor shown in this group! I listen to it repeatedly and am not only entertained for the enjoyment of music, but am challenged to ponder over the stories being told. The crescendo in \\"Things have got to change\\" is wonderful. I love the sassy sound in \\"Somebody Else's Princess\\", which makes me smile every time I hear it. A person cannot stay in a bad mood while listening to \\"Swept Away Bayou\\", especially the end of it when the music just carries you away. Give it a try, you will be impressed as this 56 year old grandmother is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant album","review":"The first time I heard this album, I was totally surprised. It was so much better than I expected. And it gets better the more you listen!

This is one great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked","review":"I confess I really ordered this out of curiosity. And I can't believe it--I really like the CD!I swear it's not just because of the actor, but the voice and the songs. Most are stories from the heart and a nice new genre of folk/R&R with a range of tempos.Okay...I admit it, I figured I'd be sending the CD back--AND I'M NOT! This opinion comes from a Jazz, New Age, Sting and Madonna fan. Go figure? The only complaint I have is that they need more songs on their CD's. Buy it--it'll add a nice variety to your collection of music for those days when you need some perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sputtering flame","review":"Music is one of the rare forms of expression in which a good story can be found, IF it's told right. A story usually has a point and is often told so that the listener/reader is uplifted. The lyrics on this CD DO have a point, but I felt like a deflated balloon afterward. If the story is sung and accompanied by instruments, it should have a flow and rhythm to it, which is really lacking in this case. Russells' musical voice isn't bad, but some music notes elude the guy. The notes hardly ever stray further than a heartbeat from its flatline.. seems like they're missing a few strings from their guitars as well. I'll take musical notes for $1000 Alex. There's a whole range of octaves yet for these guys to discover. If their music was food, I'd say it had the pep of an unsalted peanut, edible but bland. They have potential, but don't buy it if your on prozac. Makes for a good sleep aid though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget that it's Russell...","review":"This is NOT just a movie star making an album. This is true, down to earth rock band with a pub/bar sound. The band features not only the usual cast of musicians, but also some awesome horns.

Iwas both amused and delighted by the songs on this CD. I wasblown away by the lyrics written or co-written by Russell. They are so open and full of feeling. The band has a solid folk-rock groove. While this is not the most polished collection I've heard, I love the haunting melodies of songs like WENDY and SAIL THOSE SAME OCEANS and the hard driving beat of SWEPT AWAY BAYOUand SOMEBODY ELSE'S PRINCESS.a couple of places on the CD that the band members were having great fun recording this CD. I play this CD over and over and have cassettes for my walkman and car. I am happy to have this as part of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time review","review":"Hi, I am new at all of this but I was very intrigued to hear Russell's music. I have admired his acting long before Gladiator but not into the music. I was very very pleased with all of the tracks. The lyrics are very impressive, insightful with expression of caring and longing. All very emotional topics which were handle by the band in rare taste and composure not found in much music today. Russell's deep voice is not the greatest but his ability to sell the song through emotion and depth is quite refreshing and amazing. I truly think you will enjoy it especially, Things have Got to Change, Sail Those Same Oceans and Judas Cart. Hope you all enjoy as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Grunts!","review":"To the uninitiated, who are contemplating buying a CD from the 'Russell Crowe's band': you will be pleasantly surprised. By his own admission, Russell is first a musician, and he was long before appearing on celluloid. This album is a nice sampling of the folky/country/rock sound of the band. Very easy to listen to....unusual enough to keep your interest. If you like folk/country or garage-style rock, you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long time fan","review":"Discovered the 'Grunts' by accident, long before they became so popular and I am glad I did. It is hard to describe the music because it is such a great combination of so many things, blues, folk, rock. The songs tell a story, many are personal to Crowe or other band members. The acoustic version of 'Legend of Barry Kable' is a true story and it is not to be missed. Band member Dean Cocrahan had the experince of knowing the man the song is about. The harder rock version can be found on their first album 'Gaslight'. Other songs on BLOC including the touching tribute to Crowe's grandfather \\"Memorial Day\\" and a very personal song \\"The Judas Cart\\" about Crowe's own neice.It is hard to find a song not to like on this album. Many will buy it because it is Russell Crowe but put that aside as you listen and let the music speak for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"??","review":"Why did you not post the review I already sent in? As far as I can tell it was within the review guidelines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Are These People?","review":"That 46 reviewers (as of this writing) would give this thing an average of 4.5 stars certainly proves that there is no accounting for taste. It is quite clear that Mr. Crowe cannot sing. Whatever these sounds are he's making on this cd, no reasonable person could call it singing. Maybe it's some form of performance art. Why people would be willing to listen to this recording, much less purchase it and then praise it in reviews, is a complete mystery to me. Obviously I just don't understand great art and great artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russell not only can you act but you can sing too!","review":"Wow was I surprised when I bought this TOFOG CD the man can sing and I love hearing his speaking voice so when I heard his singing voice I was impressed!Especially like the song Sail Away saw the video and was impressed with it but as a big fan I knew the man had been actually singing longer than acting, when he was a teenager he was writing music.All I can say is way to go Russ and the rest of the band are also very talented musicians.The music is different and enjoyable and the man has proven he is a many faceted individual with great talents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Primer on Asia Pacific","review":"Clearly the only reason Mr. Dobbs-Higginson wrote this book was to include the lengthy introduction explaining to the reader what a cool guy he is.

We also start to see some more insights into \\"The Syndicate\\" (the group Hei works for) and the shadowy Pandora organization.There is a lot more plot development in these two chapters and great action.

The continuous flow of rhythm from one song to the next with fast pased drums and multiple electronic string sequences emphasizes the complexity of the music. However the gregorian chants from \\"World Divided\\", \\"Destinations\\", and other vocal tracks demonstrate simplicity and emotion behind the songs. This album also contains groovy beats and beautiful new age piano melodies that reveal a softer tone in the music. Overall, this album is truly a \\"Culture Clash\\" by each song depicting its own unique flavor, bringing forth aspects of techno, dance, ambience, and electronica.

So what's missing? The 12\\" version of Borderline, and the track Ain't No Big Deal, which was a song that never made it on the original LP, but was later released on the b-side of the True Blue single. That would have made this the COMPLETE Madonna debut rerelease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's Original--And Best Album","review":"I bought this album on cassette back in 1984 and it instantly became a favorite of mine. You know it's a good album when you don't at all feel compelled to fast forward through any songs. I never had to with this one. All the songs are fantastic. When I first saw her on TV (on \\"Solid Gold\\" around 1983) I didn't think she'd be a huge star, but when I bought this album a few months later, I realized that she would be.I recently bought it on CD so I could rip the songs and put them on my MP3 player. I have to say I don't think the songs feel dated in any way. They're still as enjoyable and refreshing as ever. I highly recommend buying this album. I wish someone would come around and make an album similar to this so to revive today's brain-dead pop scene. An album like this one is sorely needed today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this album","review":"I have always loved this album.

I am in love with Madonna. She is the sexiest of all the stars EVER! She still is too.Back in the days when I had a small time garage band, we played a gig doing strait up Madonna songs as a tribute to this kitten. I think we started here with HOLIDAY and LUCKY STAR. These are the obvious hits, but now that I think about it maybe we should have covered BURNIN UP or even BORDERLINE. These songs are pretty solid too.Madonna is a bad ass, no matter how poppish the songs get, you can't help but like them.This album IS a little bit dated, and she still sounds very young- compared to the later more assertive sound that her voice obtained. Still, if you a are a fan, you will dig these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna is so great!","review":"Lucky Star- starts out with a twinkling beat, then goes into 80s synthesizers. Madonna then starts singer \\"You must be my lucky star\\". I love this song soo mich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great promise...but poor songwriting","review":"Okay, I first heard the track Sleeping Satellite and fell in love with it. This song was great. It was a song you could kick your feet back to, pop open and beer, and just soak up life. Sleeping Satellite is the first track on the cd, and after that, unfortunately, the rest of the cd fizzles off into pure progressive-pop rock boredom. The songwriting is horrible. The last nine songs on this cd sound like something Wilson Phillips would have released.Keep in mind though, this is only a debut cd, and there is a lot of promise here. Tasmin Archer is very talented. This is evident from listening to Great Expectations. However, her talent needs time to mature. I am anxiously awaiting her second cd, because I believe that she will have realized this album's weaknesses and invested in some better songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the bests","review":"this is actually one of the greatest albums of all time. from lords of the new church to somebody's daughter, you couldn't ask for the best of the most subtle music combined with powerful vocals that tasmin has to offer. i have purchased this album over and over, and have introduced her to many of my friends with nothing but the best things to say about the music. every song has a message to say, and speaks to everyone. not may people have heard her music let alone of her, they are missing out. i myself have been waiting for more from her but will always wait for something else to satisfy my tasmin fix. enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I don't know how many times I can listen to this guy ask \\"If you don't use your thoughts, memories, emotions, associations, or perceptions, how do you experience X\\".

What a tragic early loss to the music world and her fans, by the early passing of Ms Ripperton to cancer back in 1979. But through this excellent CD collection, the essence of her legacy lives on. Most all of her classics are here, especially since her original albums, even those transfered to CD can be hard to find or rather expensive. And those not really familiar with her work should start here. Us true fans will always have a place in our hearts for her. Her style and beauty continue to radiate through her recordings loud and clear (Perfect Angel, Memory Lane, Lovin' You, Simple Things), blissfully romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs are good, bad arrangements","review":"The CD includes 3 of the best songs performed by Riperton Perfect angel, Memory Lane and Lovin' You, but unfortunately, the arrangements are not good, and really worsen the songs with birds sound and violins.

It is a compilation of her absolute BEST! The songs on this CD speak of the love between Minnie and her husband, Richard Rudolph. The lyrics are so beautiful especially in \\"Lovin You\\", \\"Stay in Love\\" and \\"Simple Things\\". \\"Inside my Love\\" and \\"Here we go again\\" are also awesome! There is also the classic \\"Memory Lane\\"! Minnie is the real deal on \\"Adventures in Paradise\\"! Her vocal talents and skills and their amazing music writing resonate throughout! Once you play this, you will want to play it over and over again. I can guarantee you that you will not be disappointed! Sad that she left us too soon, but so thankful that God allowed them to produce and make such beautiful music! RIP Minnie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Been Almost 30 Years Since The Passing Of Minnie Ripperton.","review":"One of the best R&B vocalist of the 20th Century.

It has it' own soul and heart, by the end of it you will be inspired and moved. What else can I say that will help put my feelings into words for the world to read....there should be more movies like this. \\"Born To Be Wild\\" helps us see that today's youth can replace violence with love and that all things placed on this plant have gifts to give.....we sometimes just have to open our eyes a little wider and look not just see what is happening around us.

On the good side, it contains descriptions of all sorts of archaic personal firearms (now I can equip my post apocalyptic mutated badgers with gatling guns and pepperbox pistols - but I could have figured that stuff out anyway, I suppose).

The movie suffers from too many sub plot points all trying to rule the empire of being the major plot point. A little horror nightmarish, a little Jason Bourne, a little Fringe. If they stuck to one of these, the movie could have been better. Unfortunately it doesn't.If you're looking for Jean Reno films, this one is a \\"maybe-catch-it-on-TV-sometime\\" viewing.

Moreover there never is a plausible connection between all the dead Turkish women and Anna except for their nationality. Its never explained why the Wolves killed them or how their deaths came about.Far too much of this movie makes little or no sense until the end and then the explanations just leave you cold. Who are the Wolves? Turkish Terrorists? Why are they Terrorists? Oh, no reason, they're just evil. Only evil guys would hide out in the famous Christian catacombs in Turkey - unnoticed by thousands of tourists and locals.Give this film a miss and pick up Wasabi instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst movie of Jean Reno","review":"It is one the worst film I have ever seen lately.

There is a false advertisement; such as punks are introduced as Turks in the Turkish zone in Paris! Even the music is not Turkish but funky punk music when again when they show the Turkish areas.

I found that it's an excellent source of strength to get through the day when \\"memories are like mountains and each one gets harder to climb\\". \\"No Place That Far\\" is definitely Sara's breakthrough album.

This album is a worthy follow up, and shows her maturity in choice of music styles, and lyrical content. The album is extremely well balanced, and doesn't have a bad track. The other great thing about it is, it's flexibility, being equally at home as background music, or belting out at high volume on the car or home stereo. A truly powerful vocalist, who is fast approaching the league of Martina McBride, and even Reba McEntire, this singer is certainly one to watch, both now and in the future.

Hundreds, if not thousands of Slovene immigrants--including my grandparents-- contributed to this effort with great pride and for the author to speak about strip mining and copper mining is simply bewildering. How can she ever have been to Hibbing and not known this?Second, there are many stories to be told which would illustrate her premises--there are precious few included in this book. Lots of quotes from other academicians, not too much meat to this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"This phenomenal artist is a genius. In so many ways is this true as her virtuosity, technique, humor, and physical show-womanship. She spans the globe in her understanding of an art form generated by African Americans, embraced by others only later.The fact that this genius comes along in the form of a beautiful Japanese woman shows me that we as a society need to work much harder to encourage, support and to fund the Arts for everyone equally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistable","review":"I saw this band recently at a local jazz fest and when I saw this DVD was coming out I ordered it immedialtely.For anyone who only has her CDs- seeing her live is a whole other experience.Our seats were pretty far away when I saw her so its a treat to be able to see everything up close on this DVD.The lighting is somewhat subdued on this stage but everything is clear and the angles are interesting and they didn't jump around too much for the editing.And the sound is superb.This girl has everything-amazing technique-yes-but so much more- energy,commitment and musicality,charisma-and her obvious love for the music all come through loud and clear on here.So many highlights but her interpretation of the Beethoven Sonata is just exquisite.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!!","review":"I mean.....It's Hiromi!!

He also had the uphill battle of sifting the truth from the lies and legends surrounding Thornley.And this book is the result! Tracking the life of Kerry W. Thornley was quite difficult, even for Thornley. And yet Gorightly made excellent use of letters, interviews, court transcripts, and social history to present a well written biography of a talented, verbose, and iconoclastic man, much overlooked by the JFK assassination community and social historians.Gorightly also explores fairly Thornley's descent into mental illness and the resultant irrational Kennedy assassination \\"facts\\" which Thornley spoke to friends and A CURRENT AFFAIR viewers (\\"I am a Nazi breeding experiment\\" is perhaps the best well known.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific performances from Jodi Foster and Terrence Howard (4.5/5)","review":"this movie was much better than i had hoped or expected it to be.itbasically turns the vigilante genre on its head,and has a femalecharacter as the vigilante.like any vigilante movie,it certainly posestough questions.it contains some terrific performances in it's two leadcharacters,Jodi Foster as the vigilante,and Terrance Howard as the copon her trail.both are outstanding and very credible in their respectiveroles.Foster really makes you sympathetic to her character and rootingfor her,even though you probably shouldn't.Howard's character is alsosympathetic,because he has mixed feelings,but has to follow the law.hecomes off very convincingly as someone who is conflicted.the movie iswell paced and appropriately dark.even before the end of the movie,ithought it was well done,but the ending caught me totally off guard.itelevated the movie a notch.for me,The Brave One is a 4.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better","review":"Great scenes with Foster and Howard lift this from the average.

Both Jodie Foster and Terrance Howard give stellar performances. Although at times, I couldn't stop myself from shouting \\"Oh! Come on!...Are you kidding me!\\"...

The story involves a woman from New York who loses her husband to be in a cruel and unfortunate way. It covers what happens to her as she quickly moves on a downward slope. It doesn't immediately start as a move about revenge, but moves there at its own pace. The directing is excellent. If you enjoy revenge flicks where everything works out, after a fashion, this is one that will keep your attention and you will enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"The brave one DCD","review":"I am not a particular fan of jodie Foster, but she manages her role in the Brave One superbly, I do not think any other movie actress could have done better. I recommend it to all fans of suspense and action movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I have been let down by my fellow Amazon reviewers on this one. So many 5-star reviews for this cliche filled mess. I shan't waste much time on this one, I'll give a very brief plot synopsis. Jody Foster is a simple, quiet woman who becomes a killing machine after a violent event in her life (ala Mr. Bronson- Death Wish 1 through 18). She starts out barely able to hold a handgun, yet by the second day she is firing sniper quality rounds and performing hand to hand combat punches worthy of a Navy Seal. They threw in a troubled and emotionally torn detective as an attempt to add dialogue, however it falls flat and adds nothing to the film. You've seen it all before folks, not even worth a rental. Spoiler.......I gave it 2 stars because she gets the dog back at the end so at least there wasn't needless animal violence tossed in. Thumbs down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"A lot of problems with this one. Quite a few long boring scenes that stretched my patience. Many scenes were just implausible (NY subway stations are NEVER empty). Many scenes seemed stagey, not realistic. They seemed like set pieces. Had to take a break several times to break up the monotony. Jodie is a fine actress but I never really cared deeply about her character. The best part of the movie was the cute dog!! Dogs rock!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many remakes. So much wasted time.","review":"Hollywood is out of ideas. This movie was ok, JUST OK, and I'm still kicking myself for spending $5 at the video store on a film I've seen a dozen times. Save the money. You can get this movie for the cost of a VHS tape or blank DVD. Check your tv listing for Charles Bronson's <u>Death Wish</u>. Except for the gender of the main character and a few other details, this movie is nothing but a remake of that one. Writer's. Go back on strike and use your free time to find some inspiration. Stop stamping your names on Asian films and old films you hope nobody remembers."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughable","review":"oh my god, I love Jodie Foster and yet felt like she was asleep throughout this movie. A frustrating waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"I've always had a bad feeling about The Brave One, ever since I saw the \\"subway thug\\" licking his knife blade in the film's trailer before it hit theaters. And sure enough, I was pretty much right. The characters - especially the bad guys - are such silly stereotypes that they nearly ruin what's supposed to be a serious film. It could have been a much better film, if it were made to be realistic; instead it's a generic Hollywood movie in every way. The writing and acting are underwhelming, except for the two leads who give decent performances. It's not necessarily a terrible movie, but it definitely falls a bit flat and isn't as thought-provoking as it aims to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I skipped the second act","review":"I think Tom Keough provides a good summary of this film's strengths and weaknesses. I would add three observations: I thought the villains were terrific; I perceived little chemistry between the lovers before they were assaulted, despite the actors' effort to achieve it; and I fast-forwarded all the scenes with Detective Mercer except the ending because I found the revenge theme more compelling. In sum, I am glad I watched this film on DVD instead of at the cinema. Had I seen it at the cinema, I likely would have walked out in the middle of the second act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mish-Mash","review":"I must not have seen the same movie as most of the other reviewers.I thought this movie was all over the place........... anti-gun? Pro-Vigilante? Anti-Vigilante? Cop movie? romance??! Pro-Victims rights?!? What already. I got to the end of it and thought \\"well that was pretty much a waste of everyones time and money\\". Can't even say it was a pro-dog owning movie because the dog has to find HER at the end of the movie!What a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, gritty, interesting and thought provoking film","review":"In my opinion this film from the onset knocks you off your feet and how the main lead Jodie tries to recover both mentally and physically from the murder of her partner and her own violent assualt is gritty and thought provoking. To me the film was fluid from beginning to end because of how well Jodie acted and also how well Terence acted they make their characters trials and tribulations believable right up to the end. I also think the story provided a back drop to the underbelly of any large city and how when you are violated by it it inevitable changes you and your view of the place you call home...although one would hope such a change would make us morally stronger and tougher and thus would prevent us from sliding down the slippery slope of being judge and jury as it was for Jodie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"I really loved this movie.

Yeah, it's a revenge movie, but that's where it ends.Watching Jodie Foster as the victim was painful and uninspiring. I felt like I could care less about what happened to her.The whole movie felt like it was slowed down to a snail pace to make you try and feel her pain, but it just made it drag on even longer. I just wanted it to end.Speaking of...the ending is also horrible and predictable. I guess this is worthy of a rental if you are really bored, but I would suggest renting Death Wish instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I was very pleased with the movie....it came packaged like new as advertised. Also I received it in just a few days...good service"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unwatchable","review":"I really was shocked at how bad this movie was....Terrence Howard was the only saving grace. I almost quit watching it, but thought that it would perhaps redeem itself at the end, but I was mistaken. If they would have shortened it up it would have not been as bad, but I feel that they could have told the story in about 30 minutes, and it still would not have been worthwhile. First time that Jodi Foster disappointed me. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bored One....","review":"Thats what I was when I saw this. Zzzzzzzz is all I can say. I saw this with my friends earlier this evening and we could barely sit through this mess. Terrence Howard's acting was mediocre and Jodie Foster's performance was as if she was in some kind of coma. Naveen Andrew's (Lost) role was just irrelevant and I could not see the point. And to top it all off, Jodie Foster's hair stylist should be locked up for giving her that horrendous haircut. She looked like Alex P. Keaton from Family Ties with those atrocious choppy locks. Can anyone say Fantastic Sam's? Tired acting, predictable plot, and horrid lighting make this film into a snoozer. Skip this one and save your $8.00 bucks for a lovely T-shirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendously Bad","review":"One of those films where you tend to look at your watch 10 minutes into this and wonder if your sock drawer needs arranging, the cat was fed and if Jody Foster's career will ever bounce back from a lame movie with a terrible script. While there are differences between this \\"revenge\\" movie and others (Jody is a radio personality, who's boyfriend is brutally murdered), there is no everyperson quality about her as there are in other films (read: an architect who's wife is killed and daughter driven to psychosis). The whole movie seems to be both forced and contrived as if taken from another movie (where Paul Kersey is an avenging citizen). Jody just doesn't seem to have the \\"Death Wish\\" that another film so powerfully had in the 1970's. If you haven't got the hint yet, buy or rent \\"Death Wish\\". It's a much better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"R*U Strong Enough?","review":"I love Jodie Foster, but I did not enjoy this movie. I had a problem with the storyline and some of the acting was a bit amatuer. Jodie Foster did a great job playing her character, doesn't she always? But some of the other actors seemed like they were nervous, or just need more acting lessons. It's hard to get into a movie when the actors don't seem like they know what they're doing. There were too many improbablities in the plot, too many to name. The dialogue was amatuer as well. Like the whole \\"radiohead\\" thing they kept repeating, please give me a break. And the voice over narration by Jodie Foster sounded like bad poetry, that kind of poetry went out in the 80's. It's like the script was written by a high school drop out. I hope Jodie Foster picks better movies, someone give this girl a good script."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT LIKELY","review":"It is laughable to see tiny, little woman like Miss Foster playing the \\"macho\\" part in movies. As convincing as Demi Moore in JI Jane! Anyone who went through boot camp knows Mrs. Moore would not have survived the first half hour! (I didn't because I'm a woman but my husband did.) Women don't have the strength of men--and I mean PHISICAL strength--no matter what they do. If you think I'm wrong, if you're caught inside a burning building, who'd you trust more to rescue you: a strong man or a strong woman?! Keep in mind that firemen physical fitness requirements (as well as the Military) had to be dropped considerably in order to be able to accommodate women."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brave One","review":"It's a Brave person who can sit through this clap trap movie,It is so bloody predictable on what happens,even before it happens.I am surprised that foster would take this role.I will think twice before renting another jodie foster movie.I know jodie can do better than this, give us another(Contact) movie, or silence of the lamb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vigilante justice with a HUMAN face...","review":"...flawlessly played by Jodie Foster as a dynamic Everywoman whom circumstances push into taking the law into her own hands, opposite Terrence Howard in an equally strong performance as the sensitive \\"good cop\\" who is intrigued by her, investigates her, and then...well, I'll refrain from any spoilers here, but it's not quite as formulaic as it sounds.What makes this film interesting from the typical dime-a-dozen revenge/vigilante movies is that the protagonist is not cast in some vainglorious heroic light, but instead is portrayed as a 3-dimensional fully fleshed out, entirely human character.The actual violent scenes are ok, nothing to write home about, but they get the job done.Am not sure I'd want to own this movie, but it was worth seeing once.3 and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Death Wish\\", but with a female vigilante","review":"The Brave One with Jodie Foster is a female version of Death Wish with Charles Bronson.

Although relatively unknown to me until just now, it is a solid recording with the standout tracks having to be \\"Descarga los Bandidos\\" with killer bongo solo and \\"Quiero Averiguarlo\\" with Aponte showing why he deserved to be recruited by the great salsa institution that is El Gran Combo.

I plan to keep it on the roll in the Ziploc bag in my house, in hopes the adhesive will still be strong when I need it again next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This is not as reflective as the stuff I can get from Walmart. What really upset me was that it's not 1 inch wide, it's 0.93 inches wide. I needed it 1 inch wide. That is why I went through the trouble looking for this product. I am very unhappy. Not as described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stick to anything, don't waste your money","review":"I tried to use this on my car, I prepped the area with some rubbing alcohol and dried it off, it was a little cold, would not stick at all, it was falling off. I took it inside and left it for a bit and decided to mess with it again inside, it was stickier and loses most of its adhesion in the cold. Inside I was able to get it to stick to a metal cooking pot, but it pulled off easier than painters tape. If you want an idea of how sticky this stuff is grab a piece of wrapping or packing tape, stick it to the palm of your hand about 5-7 times and then stick it something and try and pull it back off. another example is a sticky roller that you just used and needs the sheet ripped off, still a little tacky but not sticky. This stuff is very reflective, but does me no good as it does not stick to anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"JVCC REF-7 Engineering Grade Reflective Tape: 1 in. x 30 ft.

I Think NOT","review":"This 'reflective' tape is terrible. There's nothing reflective about it. It barely catches any light, and unless you're massively photosensitive, no one would consider this reflective at all. Even cats and owl's superior night vision would miss this one.

That said, I believe drivers are far more attentive to blue reflectite (due solely to it's association with the police)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and flexible","review":"I ride a motor scooter to work year round. This time of the year it is dark on my ride home. Visibility issues are compounded by the dimmer scooter lights,when compared to an automobile. I put the tape on my helmet and fabric briefcase.

I have had it on the fabric of my shoulder pack briefcase for a month and it hasn't peeled or cracked."},{"rating":"2","title":"reflective tape","review":"It works pretty well and is reflective; however, I would buy the wider tape next time which will show up even better.

Well, it was a terribly written book. It is surprising how dull the author made this book. It was so boring that I heaved a sigh of relief when it was over. When I told my friend that I was ready to return it to her, she told me not to bother, that I could give or throw it away. She said that she really had not liked it either.

She is now nearly five months old and enjoys watching and listening to this fun and entertaining mobile as much as she did when she was much smaller. This was a simple product to put together and is well-worth the money. The batteries that we put into this mobile when we first bought it have not been changed, even though it runs several times each day, for the full ten minute cycle each time. I cannot think of a single complaint regarding this item and would strongly encourage you to think about purchasing this mobile either as a gift or for your own child. When our daughter out-grows it, we hope to hang onto it for our next baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy a wind up!","review":"Don't make the same mistake I did - I tried to save a few bucks by purchasing a crank (wind up) mobile and within 2 days I scrapped it for a battery operated one. I love that this mobile doesn't have obnoxious things hanging low from the arms - rather, the discs are more interesting and practical (they become teethers). The discs flip for complex shapes or simple ones and they pause so they baby can focus on them. The music isn't bad and we love the remote control. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad!","review":"My only criticisms are that the music comes out sort of tinny and mechanical sounding, and that, though you can detatch the toys and use them as rattles later, they have hard, plastic knobs in the middle of them (where they attatch to the arms of the mobile)from which I find myself protecting my little one again and again. Also, the shapes aren't so mesmerizing as all that. Stuffed animals seem to be preferred, but I guess that would vary from baby to baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much","review":"This was one of four different mobiles we bought in trying to find the perfect one for our daughter. The toys were stimulating which was not the desired affect when trying to have her sleep. It was nice that it had different song selections but they were all too loud. She would jump when we would start it and try to move away from it. A volume control should have been added. Needless to say it was returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT Toy from Sassy","review":"My daughter LOVES this mobile! Sassy really comes up with fun, developmental toys and this mobile is no exception. Our daughter will spend time in her crib happily when the music is playing, and even when it is not, she loves to look at the fun shapes. It was extremely easy to assemble, and it is easy to change the shapes on the mobile arms (they are two sided.) The remote is handy, since we short people don't like to reach all the way across the crib to push buttons.We received this as a gift and it is in the top 5 of necessary baby gifts. Don't buy the fluffy, matching mobile for you little one. Definitely get the fun, practical and developmental mobile. It is great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Product!!!!!!","review":"Our triplet sons are 2 months old (1 week corrected gestational age) and they ALL love this mobile!

The toys are creative, bright, and eye-catching. This mobile is a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble & worth the money!","review":"It took me about 5 minutes to completely assemble this mobile, batteries & all! So, I don't understand the low marks for assembly from some other reviewers. The remote IS short-range, but that is not the reason I bought this mobile. I bought it for the images on the pieces, which are reversible AND are rattles once you are done using it as a hanging mobile. PLUS, you can use the music box seperately on a nightstand or dresser. I wasn't expecting a top-of-the-line mobile for $30, but I am pleasantly surprised by how nice it is for the low price I paid. I definitely recommend this mobile if you are looking for something visually stimulating for your baby & not just something that looks \\"cute\\" in the nursery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mobile that lasts beyond the crib","review":"I bought this mobile after throwing away one of those \\"cute\\" wind-up ones. My son loved both sides of the disks and played with them after I removed them from the mobile. He is now 17 months and still loves the purple button music.

I just bought the deluxe model for my second child due soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it twice","review":"If it were reliable it would be perfect. This mobile is not well made. It was one of my daughters favorite toys, she loved to lie in her crib at watch it spin. However, after a month or two it stopped spinning, even with brand new batteries. We returned it for another one, which lasted a little bit longer but inevitably suffered the same fate. I will not ever buy another Sassy mobile again. The remote is terrific though, it goes around a door knob so we could just reach our hand in and hit a button to start it up, or stop it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't pay full price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I just bought this mobile tonight because I was in the store shopping and seen it for 6 dollars.(on clearance) Well, I am so glad I didn't pay full price because it's not worth ... dollars at all. First of all the music is way too loud, I don't know what people r saying that theirs is too low but this one is so loud. Second of all the remote control is useless, u might as well just walk over to the crib to use it. So I am gonna be returning it even though I got it so cheap. I would not recommend this mobile at all. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The mobile / music box that lasts and lasts","review":"We love this mobile!

It keeps her entertained for a long time which is great if you have to make dinner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries...not an easy thing!","review":"I bought this mobile to go over the changing table. Unfortunately, I encountered a problem even before I tested it. The compartment for the batteries is made very poorly. It is hard to get the batteries in and to keep them in place.

I think it's just a design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"But it squeaks like hell","review":"All right. I'll give you that it's neat to have the remote control. And that the designs flip over to accomodate the baby's maturing visual sense. But after three weeks, mine squeaks like a shoebox full of frantic mice. I've taken it apart, tried silicone lubricant, graphite powder, even a little WD-40. My husband suspects that our 11 week old likes the noise, but it's anything but soothing. The plastic works are hopelessly flimsy, and completely unfixable. There's got to be a better way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't even fit the crib!","review":"We recieved this through our baby registry, but after putting it together, we noticed that it wouldn't even fit on our crib!! I guess Sassy didn't consider that not all cribs are built the same. Our crib sides were too thick for it to screw on. It would lean over. And once we turned it on, we noticed that you can hardly hear any sounds from it. Since there isn't a volume adjust, you have to strain to hear it. If these two things weren't a problem, we would LOVE this mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"never thought this would be a 'must have', but it is!","review":"My daughter's face lights up when this mobile is on. I am very happy that there are different songs to choose from, that the music isn't 'tinny' sounding, and that the designs can be switched around to keep her interest. the batteries seem to last well, too.We wound up putting this on her changing table, as the base couldn't be screwed onto her crib - the position of the holding screw won't allow it to fasten to a railing top more than about 2 inches tall, and the tops of her Emily crib are three inches tall. As a result, we haven't used the remote control feature, but we've been happy with this mobile regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Baby Product","review":"This mobile, Boppy, the Baby 411 book, Nuk nipple, Evenflow glass bottles, BabyBjorn Baby Sitter 1-2-3 are all great products that you will not regret buying!This mobile will buy you that precious 15 mins for a quick shower or just grab something to eat.

I'm just going to use the music/vibrator from my Jeep playyard.

Last time I could get the remote opened, this time I can get one screw off the mobile. If it doesn't loosen by tomorrow, it's going back for good and I will choose something by another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"We purchased this mobile for the fact it was something our son could grow with. When we assembled it, we realized pieces were missing as well as it looked scratched and used. (as in someone else probablly returned it) Regardless, we got it mostly assembled and tried to attach it to the crib, however the bars on the sides of our crib were too wide and there are no other adapters you can buy. The box says nothing about what size crib railings it works with. On top of that, the mobile did not spin, as it said on the box. This mobile was really NOT worth the $30 they sell for. It will be returned ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - terrible product :(","review":"We registered for this and recieved it at as a gift. We had to exchange it right away because after we finally had it all together the mobile rotated but the music box didn't work. When our son was less then two months old it started squeaking and now that he is almost three months old it has stopped rotating.

My son is now 1 month old, and he stares at the moble and is able to focus when it pauses. I find the music is a little loud for naptime, but the ocean waves are soothing and puts my son to sleep, or keeps him entertained until he falls asleep. The remote does have to be pointed correctly (directly at the sensor) in order for it to turn back on. I did not give it 5 stars because we had to rig the mobile to attach to my sons crib.

With all my years of being a mom (13) I have never seen so much plastic junk for $29.99. I took it out of the box and the paint is chipped off the inside of all the toys. I installed it just to see how it works and yes the motor is louder than the music. There is no way of adjusting the volume and the ocean does not sound real either. The housing is also made of very thin cheap plastic. My opinion: There are many others to choose from that are developmental.

Considering the money spent on this and the money spent on batteries, you would think the music could play a little louder and that the toys would actually go around on a regular basis, instead of once around every minute or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cute ---- but that is it","review":"I got this as a shower gift. I totally loved the fact that you could control this without entering the room. This was the best feature this thing had.

It was $39.99 but the baby found it fascinating and made mommy's life easier for 20 mins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 6 months","review":"I received this mobile and began using it when my daughter was a new born. She was mesmorized by it which gave me a little time. We turned the shapes over when she was about 3 months old and one of them was missing the beads inside. The remote stopped working after about 4 months even with new batteries and the whole thing has stopped rotating now that my daughter is 6 months. The only thing that still works is the music which is loud like others have said. I keep the bumper pad over the speaker. My baby did love looking at the mobile when it worked, but I'm disappointed that it broke already."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as we expected!","review":"First it takes the skills of a mechanic to put this toy together!And it doesn't even have a lightbeam features like other similiar mobile toy.And last, who knows the 3 C battery are going to last ( 3 days or 3 weeks)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"My baby loved the mobile, but after 3 months it stopped rotating.

Although my son loves the designs and music the beads and rattles make noise with the slightest movement. I have the mobile attached to the side of his crib and when ever I would put him to bed the beads would rattle and the noise would startle him awake. It would also make noise every time he would kick or move in his sleep waking him up. So although this mobile is pretty to look at I wouldn't get it if you want to get any sleep. I recommend a plush mobile ... something with out beads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit our crib","review":"I couldn't wait to use this mobile.

The motor whirs periodically, so I opened the housing to see that the small gear driving the rotation was cracked, so the post it was set in just rotated and was unable to transmit that motion to the larger drive year.I left a message on Sassy's web site asking for advice but received no reply...sadly, I bought this thing months ago and was only just now getting around to installing it.So, please don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mobile","review":"In my other review I forgot to mention that, though it does take 3C batteries for the mobile and 2AA for the remote, the batteries in mine lasted over three months with quite a lot of use. This kept my baby entertained for hours for the months he was in the hospital. It made the transition from home to hospital to home easier with a familiar calming object. There does need to be a direct line of sight between the sensor on the monitor and the remote for it to work effectively. Do not place mobile under any heat source (warming hood on hospital baby bed) as it will damage the rotating mechanism.

I purchased one for the nursery. First, it was difficult to put together. I needed to use the flat end of a screw driver to remove the piece that is used to hold the main arm. Once I got that off, I had trouble snapping in the little plastic arms to hold the mobile pieces. Finally, with pieces in tact I tested it out. It worked for one whole day. The rotating mechanism died. Frustrated (having tried new batteries), I returned it with no trouble at Toys R Us. When I got a second one as a gift, I thought, \\"Why not give it another try?\\". Very, very dumb. After all that trouble putting it together, the second one didn't rotate AT ALL. Turns out, my little angel is quite happy with the old fashioned wind up model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a great thing for babies","review":"I am 12 years old and always go down there to play with her and her older sister who is four. I started baby sitting a new born and she is now 14 mouths old. The music put her to sleep to sleep right away and the mobile was great. As soon as she was standing up her mom took off the mobile.

What makes this CD a true collector's item is the title song \\"Tu Bien Lo Sabes\\" which was intended for inclusion on Hector's 1981 Fania album \\"Que Sentimiento\\" but which was ultimately shelved and is unavailable anywhere else. While Hector's popularity as a Bolero singer never matched his popularity as a Salsa sonero, this compilation proves that he was a singer who could make any genre his own.

My favorite tracks are the top 10 hit's \\"the red strokes\\" and \\"standing outside the fire\\" as well as the album cut \\"the cowboy song\\". This is a fine album and will be liked by anyone who likes a wide tatse in good quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of all","review":"Well what can I say about this album or about this man and his music, probably nothing, but before I heard Garth\`s music, I had no idea about country music. But in 1994 when in won an award in the \\"World Music Awards\\" for the best selling country artist, and he wasn\`t able to recieved by himself they gave us a taste with his last video \\"The Red Strokes\\", and I can tell you, that I stand in front of the TV and watching the video, and was so powerful. As you can see even for a guy in one country, that don\`t know very well country music, I love the song, and ran on the next day to buy the album \\"In Pieces\\".

Nouns are nice but who wants to go into a market and just say \\"ham\\". How about \\"I would like twelve thin slices of ham\\"?Didn't need to know all the names for the pastries (although many are in the book). With Kathy's help I could point to the case and say \\"this one, no the one behind it, yes, that one\\"!Asking directions was possible. Understanding them wasn't a bad experience either! grin.

Any rapper who name checks Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Saddam Hussein, and Bill Cosby within one minute of each other does not write his own rhymes; he has Carson Daly write them.There is little to review here. It's not even culturally significant, the one \\"hit-single\\" is completely obscure, and I'm not even going to bother reprinting the name of it here. I love 'Nsync and Puff Daddy, but Ride Wit Me: Dirty South Style is seriously MANUFACTURED. Carson's new album heavily differs from other \\"Dirty South\\" rap in that it has determinedly crappy beats and the most mundane lyricism this side of Lionel Richie.It's just awful. Archie Eversole is the Hindenburg of rap music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archie holdin' it down!","review":"HE was spittin beats and rhymes how can you say he was manufactured. Nowadays everyone uses these same types of beats yet he gets criticised this is a solid album packed with fresh beats. There isnt a track in this album that you can skip. Archie is holdin it down Highly reccomended if you like No Limit, TRU, Master P, C-Murder, T.I., Pastor Troy and Southern Rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archie is the definition of dirty south country rap tunes","review":"I highly recomend this cd if you like any of these other rappers - UGK, Mac Mall, T.I., Jadakiss, LIl Keke, RBL Posse, 3-6 Mafia, Young Gunz, and many other dirty south rappers. First off I have to say that Archie sounds like old school UGK and that was the better UGK. I like the use of the bass lines, synths and horns. I dont care what anybody else thinks or says If you like dirty south you HAVE TO BUY this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith is just as sorry as the rest of the BAD Boy Artists","review":"Faith could not sing a song live if her mother's life depended on it. BOTH of her CDs are boring and she really messed up the remake of Rose Royce's Love Don't Live Here Anymore on her first CD.Faith Evans can be compared to Mary J. Blige and Lauryn Hill because none of them can sing live. If you want a real singer listen to Patti Labelle or Kelly Price. Although, all of MAry's CDS are great and that is a FACT. Mary can make you feel her music and there are a lot singers out there that can not do that. Especially Faith. I am still waiting for Faith to release a CD that has more than one good song on it, but I know that it will never happen.I see someone did not check the credits on Faith's 1st CD because Mary wrote for her just like Faith wrote for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous album, i love her","review":"i listened to #5 about how someone wiped all of her tears away, and i fell in love with this album. i believe that she was really in love with her husband B.I.G. and that she really greived after he died. i also know that #6 is dedicated to him. i basically disected the whole album. caramel kisses is my jam, and i am so glad that you came and found me is my song too(#7). #8 reminded me of how my x and i kept going through repeat circles and how we are not together now, but we vowed long ago to always be together. i definitely love this cd, and i challenge anyone whose in love, and anyone who appreciate fantastic singing to get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that Faith is great sngerand also a beautiful women.","review":"If I had the chance to meet her I would ask her how was her life after Biggie died.

Everybody is getting killed for nothing these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Keep The Faith\\" ALL DAY, EVERYDAY!!!","review":"Faith Evans has truly done it this time. I knew this album was going to be a hit when I heard the intro. \\"Keep the Faith,\\" track #10 is the most uplifting. Faith sings from the heart on this album and her vocals make me feel like I know what she is feeling. I have to give her hitmaking team big props, because the music is so moving, especially on tracks #2, #7, #12, #14, and #15. The interludes are nice like always, but please if someone from her hitmaking team, or Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs, is reading this, let's make \\"Tears Away\\" (interlude #5) a song on the next album. I listen to that interlude over and over!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FILLER CD","review":"Most of the songs on Faith's sophomore effort sound like filler. THe only highlights include the three singles that were released from the CD: ALL NIGHT LONG, LOVE LIKE THIS (party anthems) and the quintessential wedding song NEVER GONNA LET YOU GO. All three were top ten hits on the Billboard charts helping the CD to sell over a million copies. The other songs are primarily unmemorable and heavily steeped R&B songs. If you're not into strong R&B then pass on this CD but if you like it from a decent singer like Faith then come get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best Work","review":"While you can easily find a hit on all of her CD's, this is the only one you can listen to straight through, and every track is a hit!

However, I was disappointed in her lastest, \\"Keep the Faith\\". This album definitely puts me to sleep. The only song that I liked was \\"Love Like This\\". All the other songs completely disenchanted me. If you are a Faith Evan's fan and haven't bought the cd yet, I would suggest downloading sound waves or listening to someone else's cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well done on this cd!","review":"This album was excellant if you like a variety of songs.

It was not and I hated it .After about a year in my collection along with plenty of dust I overheard a friend playing NO WAY .I instantly took my Keep The Faith out and started to listen and found that I had missed a year of Faith. What was I thinking this was a wonderful CD that was packet with hits. I just felt like Faith should have a more upbeat album but she didn't and thats what made her albums different.If you have to get over a break up this cd is great or if you are in love its great 2.I highly recommend this along with her other 2 albums ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Evans and Karen Clark-Sheard..","review":"They are simply sensational.. I, too, have Faith Evans's CD. I really like this one better than the first CD, because she sings about life, love, and God. She really shows true vocal ability on this CD. You Faith fans should check her out on the gospel CD \\"Finally Karen\\" by Karen Clark-Sheard of the Clark Sisters.

The first one had better production but the singing was very whiny and overdone. She has a tendency to over riff. She always sounds like she's either crying or whining. The songwriting (Caramel Kisses, All Night Long, No Way) could be better. The dance songs are all samples. This album is as bad as Mary J's. I don't see much of a difference btw the two.

Faith uses her personal trials and tribulations to convey beautiful, rythmically-inclined ballads and a few up tempo tunes that can be applied to everyday situtations. In such tracks,as \\"My First Love\\" and \\"Sunny Days\\", Faith Evans displays her lyrical ability that the R&B culture has known her by from her self-titled debut album(Faith). She is definetly a writer who shows her verstality on the gospel-inspired song, \\"Keep The Faith\\" ,her sultriness on \\"Anything You Need\\" and her dance-'til-you-drop flava' on \\"All Night Long\\" featuring Puff Daddy( as usual) and the current single, \\"Love Like This\\".This is a definite must-have for a true R&B fan who love songs as well as, singers who want to back to putting the \\"soul\\" into \\"R&B/Soul\\" music.

It's an hour's reading, and that includes plenty of padding--15 pages, for instance, on frontier medicine and plenty of stuff that has nothing to do with Deadwood. The book is vastly underresearched--a simple Google search will tell you a lot more about Deadwood. It shows signs of being hastily written.

We can capitalize on the TV series.\\" Writer to publisher: \\"How soon do you want it?\\" Publisher: \\"Yesterday.\\")The only thing in the book that's really interesting are four or five photographs--of Hickock, Calamity Jane, Seth Bullock. If you want to see them, don't bother to buy the book. Instead, search Google images under \\"Deadwood.\\" Or try some other book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Deadwood","review":"Dissappointing. Not enough about the characters.

I would wish the book to go into more detail, and not have so many references to \\"Deadwood\\" the HBO show. If I wanted to know all that, I would watch the show.I would not recomend buying this book.

With the MD.2 I fill it up every 4 weeks. In 3 months she's only missed one dose, when she pressed the button but didn't take the pills. I still call her daily, but now we can chat. Before I was waiting while she took the pills and hoping she would remember to come back to the phone. I've also set up a the schedule to give reminders at lunch and at dinnertime, so she doesn't sleep through meals any more. This is a great alternative to having someone at the retirement apartment dispense the medication. That would have cost $300 a month. I also have peace of mind knowing that it will call me an hour later if she hasn't pressed the button at the scheduled times."},{"rating":"1","title":"old news","review":"so there's a lot of Jewish hip hop out right now and these guys just don't hold up...This is as bad if not worse than MOT.

After that, it got worse with each successive playing until I basically had to throw it away.Satisfy your curiosity with the 30 second RealAudio soundclips provided here, laugh and run away from this album.

This is all fitting given that Yorkston grew up around the countryside of the British Isles. His vocals are reminiscent of Beck's on *Mutations* and *Sea Change* - weary enough from the burdens of the labor of love but forward enough to keep pursuing the dream. \\"Tender To The Blues\\" even sounds as if it could've been lifted from Mr. Hansen's songbook. Title track, \\"Moving Up Country, Roaring The Gospel\\" and \\"Cheating The Game\\" have an old saloon feel to them while \\"I Spy Dogs\\" is easily the most raucous cut centered on a soul-like piano melody. Unfortunately Yorkston puts some of the least accessible tunes at the beginning of the disc which makes *Moving Up Country* initially slow to appreciate, but repeated listens prove an album worthy of the beautiful landscape it depicts."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give 0 stars I would","review":"When I saw this magazine on amazon, it was not made clear that they don't have a set publishing schedule, which is CRAZY for a magazine.

There are \\"pre-made\\" halloween spider web guns you can buy that cost a lot more than this, but they do fit the copper tube inside the frame.

Unfortunately the sound is very distorted just as the original Mercury LP's were distorted. Perhaps that was the master source for this issue? Anything above a soft piano dynamic sounds fuzzy/muddy as if the tape was overloaded by the microphone signal. From other reviews, it sounds as if the Preiser release sounds much better, but in the listening samples available I can still hear some distortion. It's a pity this great performance is not in clear, clean sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented!!!!","review":"I think the two stellar reviews were biased works by invested parties.

This is where he surpasses most modern material written by other popular artists. And it's not just this. It's the voice too - truly infectious! A great voice and a great melody makes a surperb record!The song \\"Just\\" is his debut single, and I'm glad I ordered it from amazon on import. The title track is terrific and will have you dancing in no time. But it's the second track on the single, \\"Thorn from a Rose\\" that makes the listener's heart soar and break in one listen. It's one of those rare ballads that just rip you apart emotionally and takes no prisoners from the damage.This is definately recommended for anyone who's into both a good melody AND true artist intergrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable but not mirror finished.","review":"As another reviewer had said, this is not as shiny-bright as many other similar products, and I would not necessary say it is my idea of copper color. We've had it nearly a year as I write this, so I can say it has proven durable. Our original garden globe blew away during a storm, never to be found again, so we bought this as a replacement. I was hoping it would be heavier than most, but it is not. It does, however, have a small molding hole at one point, so with a lot of patience and a small funnel, I was able to pour enough sand into it to keep it stationary - at least so far. We've had winds strong enough to blow over a cast aluminum bench that sits next to it, so I have my hopes. Overall, I'm reasonably pleased with the purchase, though I wish it were shinier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I expected.","review":"I am glad that it is metal because it blew off its stand in a recent windstorm.

Again # 1 is hit.You think the woman's satisfied? Forget it: TRUE BLUE is a track that relies heavily on the '60's beats while OPEN YOUR HEART is the tenacious attempt at getting the guy of your dreams.And if ever there was an artist that ever started the latin-flavoured campaigning, that was Madonna thru LA ISLA BONITA.I do have the regret of not having seen WHITE HEAT launched as single...it really had the potentiality to break through the charts...Big Time!Bottom line: this album is truly a well-crafted, well-produced and well-performed one.You gotta get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Madonna's better collection.","review":"Madonna who has had so many hits throught her musical career has one of her best hits contained on this CD.

Possibly only Crazy For You has had more impact on people in the romantic sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best CD ever!","review":"This was for me her finest moment in music. It is the only CD from her I can still listen to today.

When I first heard this album, I decided that Madonna was a true musician, on her way to the top. So somewhere along the line, I lost that 1986 release to an ex-wife or ex-girlfriend.This remastered CD is terrible! You know those idiots who drive by your house with the thump! thump! thump! issuing from their rolled-up windows? The people that they put up Noise Ordinance signs for? Well, that same tone-deaf moron remastered a beautiful album. The vocals (and hence the lyrics) are buried beneath an over-powered 120dB bass and a hisssssing 100 dB percussion.After buying this remastered garbage, I couldn't wait to go an buy a used copy of the original. My recommendation? Save your money on this remastered album, and buy the original 1986 release! js"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good, I wish I had it in CD instead of tape","review":"I got this on tape probably about 11 years ago, the first Madonna album I ever had and I loved it then AND now!I naturally like all the hit songs(since I've heard them before I got this) but I also like the non-hits. \\"White Heat\\" was a song that should've been a hit(I think it would've made a great music video. An 80s party wouldn't be an 80s party with out \\"Where's the Party?\\". \\"Jimmy Jimmy\\" was silly but fun and \\"Love Makes the World Go Round\\" defines the \\"innocence\\" of the mid 80s.

Five stars for Ms. Madonna..."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome album","review":"I love madonna's singing and songwriting on this album a lot. Papa Don't Preach, La Isla Bonita, True Blue and Open Your Heart are feel good pop songs with passion and soul that will stand the test of time as already proven and are real classics. Madonna's voice is beautiful on this CD and has an even more mature sound than Like a Virgin. My top 5 madonna albums would have to be like a virgin, true blue, ray of light, music and american life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna can do better than that","review":"I really love Madonna, but this CD is just nuts!!!!! I love her old songs, i bought this CD because it is old, its made in 1987. I thought it would be better, mabe 3 or 2 songs are good out of the hole cd.

True Blue Baby I Love You","review":"I love this album. It's my third favorite except for Jimmy Jimmy. True Blue is her song about Sean Penn, Live to Tell is my favorite song ballad which has the video also with the movie At Close Range with Sean Penn. Papa Dont Preach is about her Keeping her baby which many people found controversial I dont know why, awesome video though. Open Your Heart is obviously great and so is White Heat. Where's The Party is also awesome. Please get this CD. The new ones have special remixes for True Blue oh yeah I forgot the beautiful La Isla Bonita, I love that song so much. She looked so pretty in the video too!! La Isla Bonita has a special remix too.

No less depressing but that much more uplifting. Unlike the first album, which was entirely negative, Electroshock Blues begins with E singing about his sister's suicide in \\"Elizabeth on the Bathroom Floor\\" and gets progressively more positive as the album goes on. Musically progressive as well, E employs a wider range of instrumentation and effects than on \\"Beautiful Freak\\" Highly recommended for anyone who appreciated the first album or just wants to hear some real musical genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired of music that doesn't have guts? BUY THIS ALBUM!","review":"The Eels' Electro-Shock Blues is one of the most innovative and creative albums since Radiohead's OK Computer and The Bends albums, and one of the freshest sources of sounds since the emergence of Beck. With Electro-Shock Blues you get the best of both worlds; it is a masterpiece of massive proportions. The Eels are the Picasso of the modern age, no doubt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a life affirming and beautifully original album","review":"\\"Electro-shock Blues\\" is by far the best album of the year. It's subject matter is off-putting at first, especially to the ears of people who are more accustomed to the irony and soullessness of today's popular music. It is the kind of record that one must listen to a few times before it really shows itself to you. While at first it seems like a bummer album, on about the fourth listen you hear melodies that are beautiful and catchy and if you listen to the lyrics, you are left with a feeling of new found faith in music and your life. The production is highly original and risky in it's use of homemade sounds. It sounds like nothing else but is completely accessible. I urge you to give this album a chance. Are you as brave as this record? If so, it will pay off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-mazing","review":"Some records you like--some records you love--and some records change your life. This record changed my life.Yes, it's the story of how songwriter E deals with the death of his mother and the suicide of his sister, but don't think it's a total bummer of a disc. It's not.Sure, you'll travel over some rough emotional terrain while listening--but you'll be glad to be there. The record has an arc to it, from beginning to end, and keeps me listening intently all the way through, every time. (How many records can you say that about, truly?)The CD ends on a life-affirming note that feels genuine. Throughout, the songs are catchy, varied and musically quite interesting.If you think Pink Floyd's The Wall is a good concept record, check this one out. If you like the idea of some ungodly combination of Captain Beefheart and Ween, dig into all eels records. Electro-Shock Blues, especially, is a must-hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad but not all that good","review":"i bought the album pretty soon after it came out. because i really liked that song Last Stop, This Town. I listened to the rest of it during my spare time and found that almost all of it was very not very good and getting one to feel depressed seemed to be the common aim for most of the songs, got to hand it to E about creativity, however. the only other song i thought was allright was 3-speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth full retail price!!","review":"The debut Eels CD was very good and I expected \\"Electro-Shock Blues\\" to at least equal it. I was wrong. Half the material is worth listening too, whilst the other half is pure junk. I would only recommend it if you absolutely must have everything they have recorded but I do NOT advise paying full retail for it -- half price for half an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aargh! Why did I buy this???","review":"Their first albulm was brilliant - this tries so hard to copy it but none of the songs are memorable at all. \\"Cancer for the Cure\\" is passable, \\"Last Stop: This Town\\" has a few redeeming qualities, but in all the other songs on the album you can hear parts of their first album sneaking through but not quite getting there. I was really looking forward to this album - waiting for a song to challenge \\"Your Lucky Day In Hell\\" or \\"Novacaine For the Soul\\". It doesn't happen. Maybe I was expecting too much - their first album was a masterpiece, so how could they better it? From this album I would have to say they didn't even try."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy at your own risk","review":"I bought this album because I read the singer's book. The book was great but this album is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fair CD","review":"I bought this cd pretty much just for last stop:this town ( witch is a great song). The cd is sort of deperssing. Im am sure i will discover this cd's magic some time and love it deerly, but it is not the case right now. ps. go with beautafl freak"},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy!!!","review":"This recording is quite possibly the worst cd I have ever purchased. I bought it based on the reviews I read here. Big mistake! Both lyrically and musically like a demo of somebody just fooling around in the studio and somebody decided to record it. I would give it a negative star if that were possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful depressant","review":"Scarred by the death of his mother and sister, this masterpiece was always going to be subdued. Yet its beauty thrives off E's vocal simplicity and his ability to implicity evoke messages through subtle lyrics. 'Last Stop This Town' is a wonderful figurative piece engraved with euphanisms, as through is restrained voice he chokes 'Its getting dark a little too early, are you missing the dearly bereft?' Although undervalued upon its first hearing, the album grows with time to emerge as a collection of songs simply incomparable with any of its peers. Infectious at times (my descent into madness) and thoughtful at others,its only defect being the occasional filler (baby genius), Electric Shock Blues is a masterful album whose beauty will prevent you from reaching for the anti-depressants."},{"rating":"2","title":"PS This album rocks my world!","review":"Once again, E and Butch have cranked out a masterpiece! Several of the tracks on this album are less musical and more spoken-word than the tracks on Beautiful Freak, and these are sort of weak, but there's still plenty of good stuff. My favorites are Last Stop This Town, PS You Rock My World, Ant Farm, Climbing to the Moon, My Descent into Madness, and Cancer For the Cure. The two Going To Your Funerals are really good too. Of course, it's almost all really good. The only tracks I don't like are Elizabeth on the Bathroom Floor, Electroshock Blues, and Dead of Winter, all of which seem very out of place (in style, not in message). But the other great tracks more than make up for them, especially PS You Rock My World, which has the most amazing lyrics of any Eels song yet. \\"I was thinking about how everyone is dying... and maybe it's time to live.\\" Right on, E!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eels Rock My World","review":"I got this CD three-and-a-half years ago after hearing \\"Last Stop: This Town\\" on a compilation CD that was being handed out at a ski resort. After all that time, Electro-Shock Blues is still one of my favorite CD's. It incorporates indie rock, punk, folk, jazz, gospel, and even industrial rock into an amazing mix, resulting in each song being a trip into another world, a world of depression, cancer, suicide, and ultimately hope. Although the tracks are sequenced to tell a story, they are all great on their own, and each have a unique sound. Sort of like Radiohead's Amnesiac album. If you like honest, experimental music, do not hesitate to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Darker Less-Friendly Eels","review":"E's real-life tragedies make this a rather dark album, but a good listen nonetheless.

Finding a 'new' love interest but not able to shake the past. I clapped for both women. I can understand both point of views. In all, it boils down to the child.

Very disappointed. They did sound very good driven directly off the Sony stereo head with no amp so I am looking for and RMS/maxRMS similar since the 300 watt speakers would sound like crap off of stereo power. I don't want an amp that can go bad as well. For your comparison I live in saltwater area that is humid (Tampa Bay).

To me this is the perfect introduction to my favorite band, String Cheese Incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cheese","review":"I'll keep this brief, because there are plenty of other great reviews of this great disk. Suffice to say, if you only own 1 String Cheese Incident disk, this is the one to get. In all events, buy live cheese - virtually all of their studio albums pale in comparison to any of their live disks. And frankly, this is far & away their best overall live disk, in terms of production values, song selection, everything. Land's End is a particular favorite of mine. San Jose, Pirates... all great. Walk this Way is a fun way to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album anyone will enjoy","review":"I've never been a fan of the \\"Jam Rock\\" genre, but I happened upon this album and I absolutely love every single song on it!

The album contains blazing versions of fan favorites like Lands End, Pirates and Rhythm of the Road, as well as a fun, bluegrass version of Aerosmith's Walk this Way. A String Cheese Incident is a perfect example of what a live Incident should be and a \\"must have\\" for any SCI collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Sick Album!","review":"if you don't already have this album, and dig similar jam bands like widespread, leftover or phish, run ou to your local homegrown record store and get it. the harmonies on rythym of the road alone are worth the money, but you throw in kickin riff based jam sessions like pirates, and land's end, and the vocal driven stylings of wake up and san jose, plus kang's sick electric mandolin, and keller williams' harmonic chord progressions and solos, and you get one of THE BEST, without exaggeration, best albums ever published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album!","review":"A String Cheese Incident is arguably the best live album that I have heard.

The first 3 bands I mentioned are gone now, and part of history, but SCI is alive and well and *on the road*... you can't loose going to any of their shows, and you also can't loose with this CD... check it out, for starters... the grab everything else they have recorded... you will be glad you did..."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Replay Value","review":"I think I now own all their CD's and this is still one of my favorites (asside from a live show I downloaded).

The recording is a little rough, and is sometimes tough to hear, but that is the only flaw.

You too will realize that The Incident plays a style all their own and are on their way to becoming one of the next great bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"Good expose of analyst's trade and inherent biases, especially in the bull 90's. However, with regulation FD, and the frequent trading of Zack's system, it is unlikely to be very profitable going forward.I was also dissappointed that the author not so subtly points the reader to the Zack's online pay service ranking system. He essentially builds the case for why you should sign up. Furthermore, the writing style and syntax was simple and dry, not up to the author's Ivy pedegree. Likely intended for the mass-audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earnings Matter for 300 pages","review":"This is a marketing ad for Zack's and the only thing the book offers is that earnings matter (past, present and future) and oh yes Zack's algorithm is the best so subscribe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"These wipes are not worth out, even at half the price.

A chemical smell was present for about 2 weeks but then dissipated. I've had them for about 8 weeks now and couldn't be happier. One hell of a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of usefulness in a little space","review":"We have a small family room, where we often gather for conversation, TV or video games. Seating is always at a premium, especially when the kids have friends over. I bought two of the ottoman sets, and I am very glad I did. These are very useful - seating for additional people, or an easily portable side table, or an ottoman that easily moves out of the way. When not in use, they sit together against a wall, and give a nice look to the space. The only reasons I did not give them 5 stars are that they are not genuine leather. The vinyl was stinky for a few weeks, and I don't expect that they will last very long, but they were a very good value for the price. The smell has already faded, so if they hold up for longer than a couple of years, I will happily amend that to five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this ottoman set!","review":"I purchased this because it fit perfectly with the decor in my living room.I needed storage to keep books out of sight, a place to put a small blanket for those cool evenings, and a tray to put food and drinks on since I don't have a coffee table. I love it and can't imagine how I managed without it.Others have said that it had an odor when they opened the box so I left the box outside for a couple of days before bringing it in and now it's fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value but as others have said... a tad smelly","review":"This set exceeded expectations for the price. I read the reviews and expected the chemical smell. I just made sure I kept it on the porch for several weeks prior to bringing it in the house. As I'm not sure the smell is entirely gone, I wouldn't store blankets or other items that can absorb odor within the large one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional ottoman set!","review":"I really like this set.

The toxic smell does not go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy - Great quality - Great design!","review":"I was very happy with this purchase, as it added a modern touch to my brand new loft.The material is durable and does not have the petroleum smell that some described in their reviews. The tray is of great quality as well and the smaller ottoman is even more comfortable to sit on than the large one, due to its thickly cushioned top.For $40 it is a steal! I have seen this at other retailers at the mall for about $80!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price & Product","review":"Except for the wait, the product is great! The little free ottoman is quite small but sturdy enough for a snack or drink. The larger ottoman is perfect for some little toys to keep my living room tidy. Perfect alternative to coffee table in a house with two little ones under 3. Not real leather but looks good - especially at this price. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Disappointment","review":"We purchased this item at a great promotional price, a really good deal. Unfortunately, both of these ottomans reeked like they'd been soaked in gasoline. Perhaps it was just the synthetic smell, but it stunk up the whole house and made me sick to my stomach. We returned it for another and had the same problem. Maybe this explains the reason for the deep discount!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid ottomans","review":"Despite reading other reviews on how aweful these ottomans smelled, I opted to purchase them anyway since they were at such a reasonable price. I really thought I could air them out (they smell like gasoline), but it has yet to happen. I started by airing the ottomans out in my spare bedroom, but the smell began to take over my entire apartment, so I now have them sitting outside on my balcony. I received the ottomans on December 27th, it's now January 20th and the smell still remains. Do no waste your money on these ottomans unless you have a poor sense of smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional but Smelly","review":"I really liked the size and these were perfect for the area of use. However, we cannot get rid of the horrible chemical smell. Left them out in our garage for a week prior to bringing inside the house. Still smells horrible. May have to return since we are worried for our health."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad smell","review":"I wish I had read the reviews from others about the bad smell of this product before ordering it. I opened it before the holidays, assumed the smell was a temporary one from packing. Went out of town for a week and came back to find the smell as strong as before. Even with a room deodorant sitting right on it, I still smell it.Except for the smell this is a great product and just what I was looking for at a wonderful price. I live in a small Manhattan apartment and have no place to set this outdoors to \\"air out\\".Recently customer service at Amazon was finally able to get me a phone number for the manufacturer - I hope to be able to call them next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"smell bad but looks fine","review":"As above the item came and smells a lot like shoe polish or dye. Took quite a while for the smell to dissapate like two weeks and I had to leave them outside to air out. They still smell some. Give where this product was made and the recent recalls on products I was concerned about the toxicity of the smell. Just be aware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful smell","review":"I've had this ottomen set for over two weeks now and I still can't stand the smell. I placed the set in the bathroom with the window open with a fan- still smells. I had to resort to leaving the set outside my apartment door when I slept the smell is so bad. I'm returning it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Powering Chemical Smell","review":"I must agree with the other amazon reviewer.

I doubt I'll buy from amazon again after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with product","review":"I was very happy with the look of the ottamons. I also like that you can use the one side as a tray. My package did have that slight roach spray odor when it arrived also, but I sprayed the ottomans with Febreze and sat them outside for an hour and the smell disappeared. I'm thinking about ordering another pair so I can use them as a coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid, Permeating Smell that does not go away!","review":"My hubby bought 2 of these one year ago. The smell permeated the room. Not sure if its varnish or paint or just some other kind of toxic waste that these ottomans were saturated in before shipping. Anyway, after one week of hoping the smell would go away, I threw em out the door into the weather and for one year they sat outside as occasional tables near the pool. Well, the smell has cleared some, but as soon as I open the lid, there it is! That toxic smell wafting through the outdoor air! Ewww yuck. I've tried them for one year and they are finally going to the dump! Save the Landfills, Don't buy these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it smells so bad!!!","review":"i baught this just recently and now i deeply regret it. It's was a present for my mom and dad but their reaction,,,, what's that smell? Smells like gasoline!?! My mom felt dizzy so we had to take it out to the garage.

They are still in the garage. But they look nice and they are functional. What did others do about the smell?"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Smell- Good Value","review":"This is an extremely good value for $32 shipped. When I opened the box, I stuck the ottomans right under my nose and there is no weird smell. There is a slight smell of faux leather, but that's normal. I think everyone should be fine with that.Excellent product, for the price. I should have bought two when the price was that cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"You get what you pay for. I purchased this item at a great price on Amazon. I read some other people's reviews and saw that some experienced strong chemical smell, and others didn't. I decided to chance it.The item arrived and much to my disappointment it did have a strong chemical smell. Also the inside tray under the lid is made out of some sort of cardboard, so don't even think about putting a cold glass on it without a good coaster or it will swell up. Also the tray on the underside of mine looked like it was scratched and somebody colored it in with a black ink pen to conceal the damage. Needless to say it went back. Amazon's return policy is awesome! Its too bad the items didn't work out for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"They both broke!","review":"Both of these broke. The big ottoman cracks more and more every time someone sits on it. The little one completely collapsed. I want my money back. Now, they are both useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"That atrocious smell","review":"I've had this set for over 4 months now and the smell has not subsided at all. I was using the big ottoman to store an extra bed sheet set, but it transferred its smell onto the sheets too. The smell is bad enough to make the set rather worthless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extra Seat","review":"You get lots of storage and a serving tray with an extra seat/ottoman. Can't ask for to much more than that for the money. It looks ok. Not high grade, but ok. I left it outside for a few days at first, due to the plastic smell. You really get a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice value for the price, no problems with odor","review":"I was a little skeptical about ordering these, given the concerns others had raised about the odor, however, for less than $30 figured it was worth a shot.They're nice looking pieces, and while I noticed a little bit of a chemical smell when I first opened the box it has dissapated very quickly. Have been using them both as a footrest as well as as a small couch side table (with the tray flipped) and am really enjoying having them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe I got Lucky or My Nose is Disfunctional!","review":"The reviews citing the horrible chemical odors for this item nearly made me stay away. But I took a chance and found this BOGO set to be quite attractive and utilitarian, WITHOUT aforementioned odors! The larger ottoman has plenty of storage (for a blanket, DVDs, etc.) and quite nicely flips to become an end table or serving tray. It is comfy to sit on, but a bit high for leg placement when sitting on the couch. The smaller one on the other hand is the perfect height and size for leg stretching as a footrest. It is very light and easily portable from room to room. Although the material is faux leather, it is well-constructed for the money. Come on, $32 is cheap! If anyone still has doubts, air the set out in the yard or basement overnight. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"For the price of this product I came out ahead. They are very functional, look great to put in any corner for storage or extra seating, or as an actual foot rest. The cover on the underside is very thin and can easily be pushed through the stapling that holds it, but that is my only problem with it. I did in fact buy two as I couldn't beat the price any where, and they work great as a tasteful toy chest I can keep in my living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are SO nice!","review":"Really a great purchase! I bought 2 sets and love them. They did have a slight smell to them, but I just aired them out overnight in the cold and now they are fine. Would definitely recommend them, especially for the price they are selling at. Overall, highly functional and great visual appeal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value! Buy them","review":"Yes, they did have a smell to them! But once it clears up you can enjoy the ottoman set! High functional! Buy them you will love them. I order 3 sets and they are perfect for my living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Global Distinctions Ottomans","review":"Overall, pleased with purchase. Decent quality at nice price. If you're looking for bulky, not for you. I use larger one to store blankets and the tabletop and the smaller one as a footrest. Nice accent to room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase at your own risk...","review":"They look good. They smell bad. They've been airing out on my patio for 5 weeks now; they still smell. Got 'em for cheap; returning not worth it. Hopefully they'll be aired out by spring. Buyer beware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinky situation","review":"This is a very nice looking and well designed product. There is one very large problem however. I have this product for almost a month and it smells horribly of what I would describe as a terpentine smell. It actually tears up your eyes and smells up the room. It was so bad I tried keeping it outside whenever weather permitted. Then I kept it in my front hall. I have tried cleaning it many times and using air freshening sprays. Nothing seems to work. Whatever type of stain or dye that was used to manufacture this product. It really is a shame. I like the ottomons very much. Right now it is in my basement so it doesn't smell up the house. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solves a need","review":"Considering the \\"lack-of\\" room that I have available in the Living Room, these ottomans really solved a great need... leg/foot-rest support. (No room for a coffee table) They look good and for the price, ya can't go wrong! (even with destructive kids around, I'm not too worried about them getting busted and feeling a big loss in the wallet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stinkier than 3 day dead skunk","review":"The good is that its China cheap. Also very tiny in size.The bad is that its stinkier than anything else I could think of. This will overpower any other odors that your home has to offer. Should have come with instructions to remove from box and leave outside for at least a month before bringing inside.Overall I guess its ok. China crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal. Very Good Purchase","review":"I just got this earlier this week. It's great. The \\"chemical\\" smell that people complain about really isn't bad. You have minimal odor if any. It's built pretty well for the price and the tray is excellent. I am glad I got it and I love it. Good service too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice...","review":"I just recieved mine. I was bracing myself for the odor...but mine didn't have it!!!! Looks nice, will serve its purposte well! A little larger than I thought. Well worth the money, even if it lasts for 3months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"These seemed like a great deal but they are too poorly made to be worth it. My furniture-challenged boyfriend (and even his kids!) were really excited when I gave these to him. They are good looking and (seemingly) useful. HOWEVER, within two weeks part of the inner support of both pieces had broken and collapsed inward. They will be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Suprised","review":"I ordered the ottoman on a Monday and it was here by Saturday, 1 cent shipping!!! No chemical smell, well put together.

They love it!!! There was no smell, no problem with the shipment, which arrived within a week. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for extra seating, storage or an end table !","review":"I bought these for a friend with a nail salon. I was skeptical at first after reading the several reviews about this item having a strong chemical smell, but happily, there was no problem whatsoever when these arrived. The ottomans serve as little tables for customers to put their purses or sodas on while they're at their nail tech's station. It's a great addition for seating or storage, too. I'm very pleased with this purchase and would buy products again from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice... and stinky, but very worth it","review":"I read the reviews before purchasing this on how stinky it was but I also read a review that said how to reduce the smell. Being such a good value ($25 at the time) I ordered this and hoped for the best. When I opened it it did have a smell. I followed another reviewer's advice and took some vinegar and water mix on a damp cloth and lightly wiped down both ottomans. It reduced the smell although there is a bit of a lingering smell now but not much. The mixture didn't discolor or mess up the ottomans. The big one I use as a storage unit and small one as a foot rest. And my cats love them both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"Bought this ottoman on gold box deal, Love it! I had no problem with odor, so I guess this has been resolved. A GREAT DEAL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift!","review":"I bought three of these for adult children for Christmas and they were all delighted with them.

I wiped the furniture with soapy water, sprayed with furniture polish, windex... and the smell still lingers - though not as bad as the first day. I've had for over a month now. I would have returned them - but the price went down 30% after I bought them, and Amazon quickly refunded the difference. They're a great for storage, but now if I can only get that smell to completely go away ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice item, HORRIBLE chemical smell","review":"The item itself is nice. The design is tight and the material is seemingly well stitched. The storage space within is ample. This would be a four-star review...BUT... whatever chemical they used to treat or cure this fake leather smells absolutely horrible. After one afternoon of having two of these in my living room, my wife started to get a headache, and we were both concerned about letting our daughter sit on them.I eventually put both of them into my garage to air out. They've been in there about 30 days, and the smell has lessened, but it's still not gone. I have no idea what I'm going to do with these... perhaps by spring they might be usable again."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKY!!!!","review":"These are so nice looking and functional...however the smell is discusting and i cant take it anymore...these are going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!!!","review":"After reading several reviews, I was hesitant about ordering because of scent issues. Since I was using a gift certificate, I decided I'd try anyway, and I am so pleased that I did. These give a modern feel to our entertainment room and I have storage for DVDs and board games. The smaller ottomans are a perfect size for sitting on when I have parties at our house too! I did notice a slight smell, but only because I was trying to find it after reading other reviews. In fact, I was hosting a holiday party to begin 3 hours after they were delivered, and everyone commented on them and said nothing about a smell. They're great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look good, weird smell","review":"These ottomans are very functional and the storage compartment in the larger one is great. The stitching on the smaller one's top makes it look nice. The only negative is there is a strong smell from the inside of the box - a vinyl/plastic smell. I have had them for 2 weeks now and the smell is still very strong. When you put blankets in the storage area and then open it later, it smells funky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking. Bad smelling","review":"I am in agreement with all the comments regarding the odor that comes with these ottomans. IT STINKS! Some sort of heavy chemical type odor, that seems to be associated with the material they are made of. I have been \\"airing\\" them out for several days and it is not helping much. Other than that seem to be of good quality and mine arrived very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit","review":"The Metra dash kit does not line up well, it pushes the top right corner of the Honda Ridgeline dash out so that it no longer stays in place.

The Musicians (yes, they deserve a capital \\"M\\") are excellent, well-coordinated, playing as tightly as one, and yet inspired, sounding like they are totally \\"in the moment.\\"For the most part, the melodies, especially on \\"Bo Mambo,\\" are beautiful and haunting. They are saved from being overmelodramatic by the intense, driving, yet \\"partylike\\" atmosphere generated by the orchestra.Good humor abounds on this CD. On \\"Malambo No. 1\\" Ms. Sumac's vocal antics make you laugh out loud with delight. Her trademark \\"growl\\" is used in full force in a couple of numbers, adding to the fun atmosphere.I could go on and on. However, you have to hear this CD to fully appreciate it. Buy it now, and be prepared to be amazed, entertained, and totally satisfied with your purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One for all you lounge lizards!","review":"Yma Sumac is completely insane!

The Kaluah ad music is on that, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real view of how is to live in Greece","review":"A true view of life in Greece. I am speaking from experience as I grew up there and planning to return to retire there also. Greece is a beautiful country that offers a great life to someone who wants to retire there and is tired of all the crime, dirty water, boring, robotic life, fake smiles etc. If LIFE is what you are looking for, then GREECE is the place, and this book gives you a lot of instructions on how to handle things there. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not get a real sense about what Greece is like from reading this book. I thought this author had a very pessimistic/negative bent as well. He focused a lot on the ancient past and not much on the present. Never having been to Greece, I can't say whether this book is accurate or inaccurate but I would think the job of a guidebook is to make the reader excited about going somewhere and this book did not accomplish that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other Culture Shock books","review":"It does have some good information if you plan to move there, but if you are reading it for entertainment, don't bother. The author focuses on nitty gritty of the law in Greece and lawsuits and real estate transactions, might be useful but is very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impressing","review":"It is impressing that the author manages to write 283 pages without giving any relevant information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeper Hit Western","review":"Wow I was looking for a good book when... I thought I would try a ol' western story and found this awesome read! Could not put it down. I am suprised that it is not on the best seller list with westerns making a comeback and all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddha Bless You!","review":"You might ask why I called my title \\"Buddha Bless You\\" well its because the main character who is a monk uses this term, he uses it so much that it's aggravating.The movie begins with this monk arriving at a town looking for a young chiropractor who will soon become his pupil after a tragic incident. The story is hard to follow due to the poor picture quality and the atrocious sound that is barely audible. Honestly the only sentence that I heard clearly is the damn monk saying Buddha Bless You, and again is freaking annoying and not to mention the last fight scene which is not only painfully long but ludicrous as well. The fight scenes are horribly choreographed, it makes it worse that the editing is choppy and improperly done in the only so-so moments. Anyway don't watch this please even if it cost a penny avoid the flick its not even good to laugh at.MY PERSONAL RATING: 0 OUT OF 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a little interesting free bin find!","review":"I have not finished this book. I paid nothing for the book. I am completely enjoying the book. 1988 copywrite? Very nice. Thank you somebody for putting this in the free bin. There is wisdom and strategy in this little book. Worth a revisit."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLACK YAWN","review":"Remember when Steven Seagal was a hot property and his action films were decent? Well don't expect that in this wearisome retread. Seagal plays Jonathan Cold (thank God they didn't call him Jonathan Hott!), an agent for some deep dark secret covert organization with \\"four columns\\"? Tamara Davies is the requisite hottie agent who wonders what Seagal's up to and carries on like most female agents in these Romanian movies--makes one dumb move after another. The storyline (ho hum) centers on terrorists out to set off a nuclear bomb in downtown Los Angeles. Seagal is hardly seen during any of his few hand to hand combats, pretty much confirming that the beefy actor's stuntman did all the work, of which there is very little. A preposterous chase scene in a garbage truck is reminiscent of Roadrunner cartoons in its lunacy. Two stars for the hammy but effective performance from John Pyper Ferguson as the villain. At least he looks like he's having fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad, painful to watch...","review":"It was painful to watch this one. The day that stunt doubles start doing your trademark fighting scenes, it's time to hang it up. I love his early movies. Seagal looked bloated and uncomfortable. Everything, including the opening credits, looked cheap, rushed and disjointed. The transition between scenes was rough and choppy. The only star in this one was the computer geek whose brief appearance was actually funny. Can't recommend it, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the greatest","review":"he has done better. to much gun play in this one. prefer some of his other movies to where there was one on one combat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"I thought when I saw Steven Seagal in the movie, \\"how could you go wrong getting this?\\" After seeing just 30 minutes of it, I knew how wrong it could go. This is at best a B movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to go to sleep to","review":"Me and my wife watched it and it is not your common StevenSeagall movie. We found it very boring. Not much hand to hand combat."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a Black Eye","review":"To your wallet well in this case my wallet. Here i go thinking that this one would be any different from Seagal's recent \\"efforts\\". Not even close i cant believe i even lasted as long as i did. Not really anything nice to say about this the acting was marginal at best, fighting scenes were just blah and to be honest. He is a bit old and a tad bit more out of shape weight wise. Sorry i'm a fan but even i know when to throw in the towel...DING...throw it in please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beer gut and choppy lines, Steve is depressing me slowly...","review":"Welcome to another movie documenting the slow decline of my hero. Watching Steve fall apart from movie to movie is making my own aging easier. I mean if the Steve can age and get fat, I feel better about me getting fat and old. In this movie, his \\"not even close\\" stuntman works hard although there are no real martial arts anyway. It's a \\"run and gun\\" and Steve left his running shoes in other movies. I think I enjoy paying for his retirement by buying these \\"straight to DVD\\" release wonders. I am going to his website to buy some almond oil in a few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Dawn for Seagal","review":"Of course only fans would get this movie.Steven looks fat, old, and tired -- even to fans who were hoping for a little escapism.Whats with the accent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"another awful film in Seagal's Direct-to-DVD Era","review":"Black Dawn is one of the very bad films in Seagal's direct-to-DVD era. It's a sequel to the equally horrible The Foreigner (also a 2-Star Film). As with other bad Seagal films the storyline is very difficult to follow. Making the film even more difficult to follow is the terrible sound quality. I gave up watching Black Dawn 40 minutes into the film. Unless you're a big Seagal fan, I would recommend skipping this film and going for some of his earlier works or even some of the more recent DTV works which are of much better quality. If you've really got to watch this one, rent it or buy it used on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Foreigner isn't great but still better than Black Dawn","review":"It's a watch-able Seagal outing but ultimately very forgettable and verges on being boring. Today You Die even with all its problems and stock footage ripped from other movies has the edge on Black Dawn. The much talked about chase scene is boring, cheap looking and makes use of very obvious green screen effects when Seagal is on the top of the Dump Truck. Seagal looks bored, the script has nothing to give Seagal a chance to deliver lines the fans want to hear, he has no fight scenes and for some reason the producers decided to insert a stunt double that looked absolutely nothing like Seagal in any way near the end for no reason I could see and made me cringe when I saw it. The stunt double is not even wearing the same coloured suit as Seagal. For Seagal fans it's worth a rental then forget about it and move on to Mercenary For Justice which sounds very promising. For non Seagal fans, it's probably not worth even renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Listed","review":"Every movie gets worse and worse and worse and worse, the man needs to retire. Before I get into my review I'm going to talk about the cover of the film, notice those two guys fighting? Well they never ever appear in the film. Some guy thought it would be a good idea to put a couple of people fighting because it might sell some more copies.And can someone tell me why they chose to make a sequel to one of his worse and most hated films.There are close to no fight scenes in this movie and when Seagal is supposed to fight it's just his stunt man. The film is full of bad acting, dubbing, stunt men and stock footage. The story is lame, a poor excuse at trying to make a suspenseful movie. Don't buy this movie, save your money. 0/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"about the film/movie black dawn..........","review":"This DVD film/movie has been sold in Singapore and I grabbed one copy and watched....hee hee and the story is basically about the stoppage of sale of the nuclear bomb which ended up been activated by timer where Seagal and his woman colleagues managed top get rid of the bomb by throwing into sea from helicopter and the explosion went off after several minutes and the whole story ended.

We have thoroughly enjoyed each selection of this fine cd and listen to it daily. It just has that sound that gets you moving and often gives you a chuckle to hear and feel the words. B. B.

It is a great compilation of smooth blues from beginning to end and truly reflects the intended ambiance of a casual Louisianna setting without modern day recording magic.

Each was moving, and this terrific set is as well. The thing that struck me about the live show was how perfectly \\"Good Vibrations\\" (not my favorite song) ends the 3rd movement and SMiLE. This is evident here as well, as you can see the audience being stunned by the beauty (especially at the England premier, shown on the \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" disk) as the show endsThis DVD also shows how well Brian plays the piano (albeit not in concert!) You can see how the music continues to dominate his life.Finally, Brian's voice in the live set is letter perfect, even better than the original CD.

Their playing and singing is so fresh and energetic. They really show how much fun they are having with this music! It is great to see the SMiLE album complete after so many years, and even better to see the live performance. I even bought tickets for the Denver show on August 26 because of this DVD.

The Earth, meanwhile, is controlled by one government, and a group of bureaucrats is trying to shut down the space exploration industry, leading to a war between the \\"good guys\\" in space and the \\"bad guys\\" from Earth.

While the female counterpart has strong female characters that appeal to girls, this book does not feature strong male role models. Book after book had strong female characters, dealt with males having feelings more than adventures. I am not saying that is wrong for females to be strong or males to have feelings, but that is not the kind of book that my son gravitates toward. He wants action, adventure, fantasy -not \\"girls are great\\" and \\"it's okay to cry\\" mantras. The biography selection leans heavily on minority and female, often obscure, figures. This book is great if you are looking for books for both girls and boys that teach diversity and want to raise a sensitive male but it is lacking on \\"boy\\" appeal if you are looking for books for reluctant male readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource","review":"I have a 2 year old son and want to get him on the road to reading as quickly as possible...with the result of loving it.

I have SO much radiohead to catch up on, only owning their first two albums, I am terribly slacking on my Radiohead but I will get there. Too bad this isn't sold on vinyl.....neither is The Bends for that matter...... Ah well.

No denying the fact that all those were innovative, concept albums however this one stands out from them in being easily accessible given just 1 or 2 listens. You'd be hard pressed to find a cut over here that you don't like. Musically Pablo Honey should be right there on top with the best rock albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the beginning...","review":"From the reviews i've read everyone seems to be reviewing this in retrospect from OK Computer. \\"The band that would go on to better things...\\" Of course we know the story to date but Pablo Honey stands as a testament to the band that was always reaching. I hesitated to buy the album for fear of the popularity that was \\"Creep\\". But a friend had it and i was floored by the three guitar slinging approach and the English swagger tempered by self loathing.This is essentially a guitar rock album. The standouts being the anthems \\"Stop Whispering\\", \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\", and \\"Prove Yourself\\". Oh, and of course the legendary Chukka- Chukka of \\"Creep\\" like razorblades slicing your ego. \\"Been Thinking About You\\" is a great ballad. The lyrics are reaching out, the songs are reaching for something other than here, and the best bands are always reaching..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A solid first effort","review":"Pablo Honey displays Radiohead before the fame and experimentation that ensued. Some songs, such as \\"Stop Whispering\\" and \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\", are qute listenable, as is \\"Creep\\", but most of the rest is forgettable. This CD is a neccesary addition to your collection only if you are a Radiohead fan. Otherwise, there is little to enjoy on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"They got better","review":"Agree with the guy who said a lot of people listened to this after hearing OK Computer. That said - this album isn't much good. But it if you really, really, really like \\"Creep\\" - otherwise, it's just really depressing guitar fuzz. Couple of other good tracks - \\"Lurgee,\\" but otherwise... These guys got a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 10 albums of all time","review":"I can't believe some of the reviews on here. People are comparing this to radioheads later work? Others are forgetting that this was recorded in 1992. This entire album rocks. Every song is good. The melodies are intricate and beautiful, the guitars create a beautiful wall of sound that just rips you in two, the vocals are poetic and take many listens to understand. I don't understand how someone can not love this album. I listen to it all the time, along with all of radiohead's other albums. I don't try to compare them, I enjoy them for what they are. Even today this album is stellar and is one of the greatest rock albums of all time. Nothing sounds quite like it. If you don't own it, buy it, and don't try to compare it to their other works, just relax and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start, but the best was yet to come","review":"This is a very deceiving album if you haven't heard it first. You have to hear this album first then hear Radiohead's other four so you can see how they grew, how they developed into one of the best bands out there today. Creep was a huge single for them, but that's what it was, a single. It was a good song, released for the commercial success, that's what singles are released for. However, the rest of this album doesn't tie together like the later releases do. It's great, yes, a great debut, but it's not the familiar Radiohead. Don't let it deter you from listening to the rest of their catalogue, because it only gets better from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to be in a band when i get to heaven","review":"What a change RH has made since the release of this album. Im sure you have all heard Creep, which is enough of a reason in its self to buy this cd, but there is definately so much more to this album. The album starts with You, which is one of the most beautiful songs the band has ever written. Stop Whispering(a tribute to the Pixes), Anyone Can Play Guitar, Thinking of You, Blow Out, and I Can't make this one of the best cd's from this era and one of the best in my collection. From begining to end it is a masterpiece. It really desevers 4.5 stars. Buy it and remenice with me on the overly guitar driven RH of the early 90's. Thom sounds like such a man on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"wall of guitar","review":"i'll keep this quick and to the point. pablo honey is a great freakin' album. it may be different than anything after, but that doesn't make it any less of an album. with three guitarists going at pretty much any time, the wall of guitar they produce is too tall to look beyond. the japanese import with five extra tracks is even better. anything released by radiohead is better than anything released recently. it doesn't matter which album you buy first, just buy them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait just a sec...","review":"Any of you true radiohead fans find this album unbearable, cliche of rock that you've been hearing for the past 5 years or so (which is why we love radiohead so much; they are so unique). However, you have to notice that Pablo Honey was released in 1993. Imagine a world of rock with Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Nirvana, and then Radiohead's Pablo Honey. Things are in perspective now, aren't they? Although Pablo Honey is, in comparison to every other radiohead album, a true bore, it is at least worth acknowleging that it was way ahead of its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very VERY humble beginnings","review":"Another title to this review could've been 'Whoa! Whoa... Really not good. -at all'.Let me first state that Radiohead is one of my favorite bands. I would give The Bends and OK Computer both five stars and the rest after them between three and four stars but this album is not really the Radiohead that I, and most everybody else, have come to know and love.Another reviewer said it best in his title to his review, \\"Doesn't really foreshadow the future greatness of the band\\". And yet another reviewer said that \\"this could be anybody\\". I couldn't agree more with both of those reviewer's statements. Aside from track two (Creep) this album is nothing special and in my opinion is only worth having to complete a Radiohead collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birth of Radiohead","review":"This release is a must for a Radiohead admirer but only to complete a collection. The growth of Thom Yorke & company is amazing!In this writer's opinion, Pablo Honey is nothing \\"special\\". There is no new ground broken except Radiohead's debut & it is difficult to see the quality of their future work. Yes the performance is fine but the material offers nothing unique. If I had bought this CD first, I probably would not have purchased another. However, with the breathtaking abilities displayed by each of the subsequent releases beginning with \\"The Bends\\", Radiohead has now achieved greatness! So, go ahead, complete your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIABOLICAL RUBBISH","review":"An album that is almost indescribably horrible. I couldn't believe how bad this was after hearing their RH's other albums. The difference between Pablo Honey and Amnesiac is the difference between night and day. I mean, this album is really, quite bad. It's tuneless, uninspired tripe; possibly the worst debut album in history from a band that would later become great. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off band!","review":"I liked the song \\"Creep\\" better when it was called \\"The air that I breathe\\" by the Hollies. No wonder they hate it and won't play it live-- the song that made them so popular is not theirs.Don't believe me? Then how do you explain the fact that Albert Hammond and Mike Hazelwood's names are in the publishing credits along with those of the five band members? Were they feeling generous?The songs have an almost identical bass line and the verses have the same chord structure and a similiar melody.Learn a thing or two about music theory.This band [is not good]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbagehead","review":"I could give a long winded review on how bad this album is, but let me just say this... Radiohead is one of the few bands that I fell for all the hype about. What an idiot I was, I bought this cd and listened to it about 20 times trying to figure out what it was that I was missing. I finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever. The song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable. Garbage folks that is all this amounts to. The most overated band of all time perhaps? Oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes I didn't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance, let me say... it ahas all been done before. You just have to dig a little deeper than MTV and Rolling Stone magazine to find it. Don't believe the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Radiohead but this is ridiculous","review":"I see nothing good about this album. Also, (this will incur many thumbs-down) I absolutely hate Creep; I hated the song from the first time I heard it (who the hell wants to feel sorry for himself). There are no good lyrics and there is absolutely nothing catchy about them to make up for it. This album is no fun and offers no enjoyment, it is extremely bland; I dislike it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead's Only Good Album!","review":"People, get over yourselves. \\"OK Computer\\", \\"The Bends\\", and \\"Kid A\\" were all horrible and boring as hell albums. Few can deny that besides idiots. Here, they started off as a really good Brit Pop-Rock band with Grunge influences. If the band stayed this way, all their albums would be good and maybe they would ACTUALLY progress instead of making crappy boring electro indie alt whatever \\"music\\". Most of the songs on here are great, but I rated it a star less since I'm a bit tired of their only true rock radio hit \\"Creep\\". (I'm SERIOUS on that one, are you so called true Radiohead fans (even though I'm not lol w/e) getting this?) Still a decent song and better than any other crap they've done though. All in all, this is the only album by them you should EVER hear.Overall: BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Amazing!","review":"Radiohead have always managed to suck. Don't buy this if you want to go anywhere on the road of life! You might end up in Seattle and blowing your brains out like Kurt Cobain. Buy Vulture Street by Powderfinger. It's way better. Honk the gibson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I got this several years ago, and when I saw it on my recommendations I couldn't help but put my two cents in. I grew up with a family who loves music, my first 'band love' was The Beatles, which my parents would play with their records. My brother whose older than me, became very into music with many different bands, and so I too, loved those particular bands. Once he had gone off to college and it was just me, I started actually looking for music to listen to on my own accord and then I stumbled upon Radiohead's Pablo Honey album and I was in love with them ever since. I read somewhere that it was somewhat underrated when it first came out which baffles me since each song has a unique enough sound to be distinguishable, yet the album seems to flow without interruption. I found this cd to be an excellent purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"the good moments are worth waiting for...","review":"Yeah, these guys sound stilted and earnest here, which is probably why I still like it--so was I, listening to this at age 15 when it first came out. They've transcended so much, and not only themselves, since \\"Creep.\\" But the high point on this album is the wall of sound that hits you in the mouth on \\"Blow Out\\" after the lilting intro. The whole album builds toward it and then it explodes. Their first soundscape, purely guitar-driven and yet a sign of things to come. It's definitely worth checking out, just for that, if you like their later stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Lots of people call this Radiohead's \\"weakest effort.\\" I disagree; Radiohead has absolutely no weak efforts so far. Heavier and more textured than The Bends, this album focuses heavily on the sort of guitar-driven sound that Sunny Day Real Estate and Failure are known for. All the songs are great (which I can say about any other Radiohead album), however \\"You,\\" \\"Vegetable,\\" \\"Thinking About You,\\" \\"Blowout\\" and \\"Creep\\" especially stand out. \\"Creep\\" is an especially important number in the Radiohead catalog; one could argue that if it hadn't been such a great single, the band wouldn't have developed into one of the most experimental groups around as of now. If you're new to Radiohead, go ahead and pick this up; there's something for everyone on here. If you've liked Radiohead for a while then you NEED this CD! Get it as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even show promise","review":"I decided to listen to this CD again after going completely gaga over The Bends, OK Computer, Airbag, and My Iron Lung. And you know, it is really pretty bad. There is only one song on the disc that reveals anything about the destiny the band was headed for (\\"Stop whispering\\"). And of course you know \\"Creep\\", but all the rest of the songs are unlistenable to me. Skip it. I assume you've already bought OK Computer--so BUY THE BENDS!!! And if you already have that too, buy the Australian My Iron Lung EP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure this is Radiohead?","review":"Pablo Honey is a pretty bad album on it's own, but compared to Radiohead's later work, it's terrible! It's what has always made popular music disgusting; pointless, predictable, commercial rock. Kid A, Amnesiac, and Hail to the Thief are absolutely brilliant, and OK Computer is undoubtedly the best rock album ever. Thank God Radiohead changed. Get Kid A. That's where I started and since then I have become a huge Radiohead fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pablo Honey in comparasion w/ their later releases","review":"personally, i think that pablo honey, while it is their first release, is their best album. its so much more...i dont even know...melodic maybe? naa...i dunno. but i just like it more than the bends and a lot more than ok computer. i would definitely recommend getting pablo honey if you like radiohead/this kind of music, and then later you can get the bends or ok computer:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one","review":"I bought this CD in the mid/early ninties when I was taken with the dominant progressive rock movement. Yes, I heard the anthem 'creep' and bought the album based on that song, which is a decent song, but not revolutionary by any means. I was dissapointed by the rest of the album. I just couldn't make it through without getting bored. I was really taken with the pavement album 'wowee zowee' during this period (a classic prog rock album that I still love). Eventually I lost interest in alt rock altogether and wrote radiohead off as a boring band. but just two weeks ago I purchased OK Computer and realized that it really does live up to most of the hype. the improvement from 'pablo honey' to 'OK Computer' is staggering!Sometimes when you buy an album that you like, you want to go back and explore the artist's previous. Don't do that with radiohead. I can say that 'Pablo Honey' is not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"...CREEP...","review":"...IF you are interested in getting into Radiohead, do not even bother getting Pablo HOney...Even the most die-hard Radiohead fans do not like Pablo Honey that much. Sure 'Creep' was a huge commerical hit, but it is extremely pop and doesn't represent the quality of music Radiohead produces in their later two albums. Pablo is a more buy the book, how to make a commericially successful album, very pop, very mainstream...nothing really special...Therefore, buy Pablo if you got some extra cash and already have the others. If you are just starting get Bends or OK COMPUTER...you cant go wrong with either...."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 excellent songs....","review":"\\"Creep\\" (esp. the clean version - the 'f-ing' seems juvenile), \\"Thinking about you\\", \\"I can't\\", \\"Prove yourself\\", \\"Lurgee\\", and \\"Blow out\\" are all classics that anyone who likes Radiohead will want to play *a lot*.This record is known as a minor Radiohead record (because it is!), but if it had been made by anyone other than Radiohead, it would be regarded as one of the best records of the early 90's (seriously, how many records released in the 90's have more than 6 great songs on them?). The same thing happens in other media: _The Killing_ is regarded as a minor Kubrick (because it is!), but if someone other than Kubrick had made it, it would be recognized as one of the two or three best noirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone Can Play Guitar...","review":"This album, in my humble opinion, is rather good. Technically it isn't as good as The bends or OK Computer but for gutsy, fun rifts and flowing melodies you can't go wrong with Pablo Honey. It is the album that Yorke is ashamed of, in fact there is only one song included in his live set (and yes it's awesome but...) from the album, Creep, and that is a shame because there are some real stompers on here. 'You', 'Blow out' 'Anyone can play Guitar' and 'Vegetable' are all examples of the way Radiohead were before they got all serious and turned into 'proper' musicians.And, more importantly they are all brilliant songs. One of my 'first' bands, they are the inspiration behind my own music and this album opened the door for me and many fellow listeners. They shouln't, in that case, be so quick to disown it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome record....","review":"Too bad for all those people that caught on later. Some of radiohead fans have been there from the beginning. I love new radiohead but for the same reasons anymore. They have changed and some argue its for the better but that really does little to convince long time RH fans. We love this album because it was there for us when we were young and it introduced me to some of my favorite music. I can identify with this album more than any other RH album. Hey, thats just me like it or not. Anyone that says they dont like this album is simply ignoring the musical beginnings of a rock and roll icon. Without Pablo Honey there would be no OK Computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Collection but why not Remastered?","review":"I bought this collector's edition set thinking that they were also remastered. They sound exactly like the CD I bought originally in 1993. The collection is nice, but it's unfortunate that they didn't go over and beyond to remaster the sound. I own their OK Computer Collector Edition as well and realized that all of these collector editions are not remastered. Radiohead has such beautiful sound and were not given the same treatment as the Beatles 2009 remaster albums. I won't be surprised to see these collector editions have another reissue with remaster sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"One day fly?","review":"Not my cup of tea... Sure, it's got \\"Creep\\" (wich is still their biggest hit song to date i guess) and i like \\"You\\", but the rest of the cd isnt that great really.

Thank God the Bends came out a few years later..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God they changed in 4 years.","review":"UGH, this is bad for any band. Why on Earth would you want to play post-grunge a few years after it died? \\"Creep\\" is just awful. One of the worst songs ever recorded. Radiohead said themself that they hated it.

Get The Bends for a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for one good song!!!","review":"I think the only good song on this compact disc that is worth listening to is Creep, and that's just okay.

Don't buy a compact disc unless you know more than one song off of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one has always been a big disappointment","review":"Unfortunately this is one of those albums that has only one good song on it - in this case, Creep. I still love that song nearly 15 years after its release, but I've always found the rest of this album completely unbearable. I just can't make myself listen to any of the other songs. Thank god the ipod generation came along so I could copy that one song and forget about the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is OK but not worth getting too excited about","review":"I recently bought this CD and was extreemly diapointed.

This is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"90s pop rock, as good as it is going to get","review":"While I know most people buy this album for the track \\"Creep\\" there are other good tracks as well. It took me a while to like these tracks (like at least 4 or 5 listens) after that it stuck with me. There are some very catchy pop tunes on here. \\"Stop Whispering,\\" \\"You,\\" \\"How Do You?,\\" and \\"Vegetable\\" are some of the most memorable tracks. It is worth buying this especially if you are a fan of 90s pop/rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even popular in Korea","review":"I'm an American citizen living in Seoul, Korea on business for the past three years. Last night, I found myself as usual, late at night with clients in the bowels of one of the many karaoke hostess bars. There weren't many English songs to choose from other than the typical Elvis, Beatles or Sinatra. But nestled right in that list of songs of this hole-in-the-wall place was \\"Creep\\" by Radiohead. I couldn't believe it. I punched it in and sang it at the top of my lungs in front of one startled Korean crowd. Thanks Radiohead for giving me a taste of home."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Thom!","review":"I have only listened to this album a few times, but I was touched by the songs Creep, and Thinking About You. Creep is pretty self explanatory, and I think nearly all of those who have heard it have related to it at least once and have loved it. Thinking About You is wonderful. It ranks as high or higher than Creep. It questions love and brings tears to my eyes when I listen to it because I've really known depression and right now I love someone to such an extent that I cry and wonder if they do care when I'm not around. You all can probably understand that in one way or another. So think about buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start and An Indication of Things To Come","review":"\\"Pablo Honey\\", Radiohead's first album, was where I got my start with Radiohead. I loved \\"Creep\\" so much, but that was about it. Most of the other songs never appealed to me until years later, when I reintroduced myself to Radiohead with \\"Amnesiac\\". I bought \\"Pablo Honey\\", and the first thing you realize when listening to it as compared to \\"Amnesiac\\" is that it is almost TOTALLY different. So, Radiohead have come a long way, and it's somewhat good and somewhat bad the progress they've made, but despite it, \\"Pablo Honey\\" turns out to be a great album, even if it completely contrasts \\"Amnesiac\\" (another great album). It took quite a few listens to truly begin to appreciate \\"Pablo Honey\\", but I certainly do recognize it as one of their better albums. It's a good album, and I am a \\"true fan\\" of Radiohead, so I suppose I am unorthodox in saying this. Maybe yes, maybe no. Just trust, it's a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great early effort","review":"Pablo Honey is a good album though different from their later material. Pablo Honey is a straight rock album really. Other radiohead albums like OK Computer, the Bends and especially Amnesiac and KID A push boundaries and experiments with new sounds and ideas. Pablo Honey is a good debut with some sold rock tracks and helps to put the whole band's career into propestive because it shows how much this band has changed and redifined itself. Overall, it helps to give a more complete picture of radiohead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for a debut album","review":"So many people have bought this album after hearing Ok Computer and dismissed it as mediochre and derivative that they've forgotten what exactly this album is: a collection of 12 excellent songs. If somebody like 3rd Eye Blind or Matchbox 20 released and album like this, people would be calling them the greatest thing to come along since Beethoven. However, this is Radiohead, the band responsible for one of the greatest masterpieces of the nineties, and all Pablo Honey offers is 12 excellent tunes, and this album would have recieved a lot more attention if not for The Bends and Ok Computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Radiohead Album","review":"I don't why most radiohead fans don't love this album, the crunchy guitars, wicked lead hooks, Its amazing how they created something so brilliant, I keep playing this album over and over again, i also have it on vinyl and can't put it down. Because of this album Johnny Greenwood is begining to be my top influence for guitar playing. If you need another classic 90's album for your collection this is your best bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album doesn't suck","review":"I know many, many radiohead fans think this album suck. But, I really don't think so. This song is famous for it's \\"creep\\". But you can listen to any other songs in this album and it stills appeal to me. In my opinon, Pablo > Amnsesiac. Man, i just think amnsesiac suk. Eventhough it's suppose to be recorded at the same time as Kid A. They just sound completely different. Kid-A, btw, owns. Anyway, \\"You\\", \\"I can't\\" are probably one of my favourite songs from Radiohead. Polyethylene part 1+2 owns too though, so does paranoid, so does the bends, so does climbing up the wall....whoa getting kinda high... my point is this album doesnt suck. Just cause everyone says it does (and i know MANY people havent even heard the whole album and just goes with the flow to look cool), you should still try it. Not their best work, but not their worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the upgrade","review":"Even though it is annoying how the record companies keep making us re-buy stuff we already have, the bonus material on all 3 of the new Radiohead reissues makes it well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT LET THIS TURN YOU OFF","review":"Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles. That said, this is not the album for that reason. Do not let this album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about. There is one hint though in where Radiohead will go. In the song \\"Creep\\", which is not a fantastic song, there is a brilliant \\"CHU-CHUNK\\" made by Johnny Greenwood. SO PLEASE - IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. For the \\"rockers\\" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may become obsessed with KID A.

Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish.","review":"Before The Bends- before OK Computer- before Kid A and Amnesiac, there was this. Pablo Honey. I look at reviews for this album and quite frankly, they piss me off. There is really nothing noteworthy on this album. At all. From Creep's boring rythms and Thom whinging painfully cliche'd lyrics over the top to Anyone Can Play Guitar's uhmm...well, the same thing, really- It all just adds up to one painfully cheesy album that really makes you question how on earth Radiohead managed to keep their indie cred.Now, don't get me wrong- I'm actually a huge Radiohead fan. But really, before OK Computer their work was just very unconvincing and lacked the attention to detail and artistic beauty that were the power behind albums like Kid A and OK Computer.If you're into emo, and gritty cliche' as hell brit-pop, then by all means get the album, but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, it was the early 90's","review":"As a recent fan of Radiohead, I have plenty more to hear, but I do love this album. I was surprised to hear how old it is (What was I listening to back in '93?) but there are two songs in particular that I'd be sad to have missed out on: Creep and Stop Whispering. These guys are truly brilliant at crafting sounds that evoke emotion, mixing harsh and lush just right. Nothing can possibly touch OK Computer but Pablo Honey gives me some of the same joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their newer releases.","review":"I own Kid A and OK Computer and I love them. I have heard most of hail to the theif and it is excellent, so I heard Creep and decided to get Pablo Honey. This album doesn't stand up to the albums I've herad, it has less of their creative use of computer generated sound and the songs tend to sound too whiney,sad and very 90's rock without it. I listen to it 3 times and dedcided to get rid of it. sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!!","review":"I picked this up at the mall on a humble and guess what this is the bomb!!

No real techno riffs, except in the first song by Capella. But even that isn't hardcore techno, it's basically the same exact riff as in Quadrophonia, just not as in your face. A lot of this music borders on being acid house. So, if that's your thing, get it. But if you're looking for classic techno from 1991/1992, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir CD","review":"I enjoyed this album when it first came out, but over the years I lost the vinyl version - I was quick to order this when I found that it was available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steam cooking for everyone","review":"Great instruction book on steam cooking.

This was by far superior for all of the sightseeing elements of the tour. The book is readable, clear, and provides pictures of many of the major landmarks and buildings of Istanbul so that you know what you're looking at; it also provides maps to major sites like Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque so that you can orient yourself. There are several interesting sidebars on Turkish history or customs that are fairly interesting.The only drawback to this book is that is has only a cursory review of most of the restaurants and (especially) hotels in Istanbul; this is the only place where I felt that Lonely Planet was better in any way.That said, I nearly bought a second copy of this book because my wife always was looking at it and I got tired of looking at the maps and text written upside-down.

The first picture was 3 seconds, the second picture was 10 seconds, the third picture was 15 seconds, the fourth picture was 8 seconds. You get the picture. NO consistency what so ever.

But this frame broke down in 3 months, and the whole screen just went black and no pictures. So I contacted Kodak for customer service, but was told that since I bought it from Amazon, Kodak is not responsible for the product any more. So I argued that it IS a Kodak product, and still within the period for the 1 year warranty, Kodak should be responsible for it. So the Rep told me that she would transfer me to technical support. But guess what? She transferred me to an automatic system for self service, and I got nobody to talk to about the product. This is definitely the worst customer service I have ever had, and no to mention that I still could not believe a Kodak product would break down so fast.

One even got used at her parents' 60th anniversary party, and it was a great hit.This model doesn't have any internal memory, but that wasn't a problem as both recipients had memory cards laying around that were really too small for taking photos, but they held plenty of photos for display.

I contacted Kodak, and after a few e-mails back and forth and upgrading the firmware as recomended, I have still the same problem with the frame.One would think that paying a premium when buying Kodak products provides you with a certain peace of mind that you won't have those type of problems, but it looks like I would have been much better buying a cheaper brand.Very disapointed with that product.

Don't bother reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read just not the author's best.","review":"This isn't Wolfe at his best. The story is at times maddeningly confusing. It appears to be a mishmash of Arthurian legends, fairy folklore and vampire stories all set in small town America. The characters often seem to act in a contrived manner and for a short novel is has an extensive cast. But it's still Wolfe. The book has some interesting ideas and wonderful images and his prose is always a pleasure to read.It moves along at a fair old clip and the second half is practically frenetic. This both serves to draw the reader in and then to leave them even more bemused when they have a moment to cogitate on what just occurred.Definitely worth a read but would not recommend this to a first time reader of Gene Wolfe.

Very few characters have any parallel to Arthurian figures (other than an occasional name), and most of them behave in a completely bizarre fashion.I slugged my way through every last agonizing page in hopes that the end might clear up the mysteries of this book... only to be disappointed again. My only guess is that Wolfe wrote this book while on drugs, his publisher agreed to publish it based on his prior reputation alone, and that anyone who claims to have enjoyed it is a diehard Wolfe fan that won't admit that this book is a total failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARG!","review":"This book was recommended to me by Library Thing.

She could be a successful rock singer, but maybe that doesn't interest her. One thing is certain, despite good song selection here, people didn't buy it. She should record \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\". She could rip the hell out of that. There is a really nice catch in her voice which would give her a unique sound, as long as she was contrasting it against electric guitar, not highly produced MOR country. And the louder the better - it's a big voice, like Bonnie Raitt, but different.But wait. I've just listened to a sample on her website (helendarlingmusic.com) of a song called \\"Jump\\" off an independently released album and I'm very happy to see she's heading in the right direction. If you listen to that you'll see what she can really do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five U.S. Presidents in the Civil War","review":"As one of the previous reviewers has stated, the writing on Grant was not great, but the experiences of Hayes, Garified, Harrison, and McKinley were good. I did not know the courage and heroism of these individuals. All were brave men, who put their lives on the line for their country. Hayes stands as a very fine example of leading his men from the front. Garfield was a little devious. McKinley, even though a cook, showed front line heroism when he delivered food to the front lines. Harrison showed the courage of his grandfather.This is a good book about the soldier exploits of five of our post Civil War presidents. They were common men, with extraordinary courage. No wonder the population voted for these men in their era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mix of Maxi's best","review":"If your a reggae fan, lovers rock, dancehall, classic musician/ songwriter mellow rock from the 70's & 80's, this disc will have something for you. I have been a fan of Maxi's for 13+ years from reggae music programs here in the US, even before he had mainstream hits. This CD provides a great collection of Maxi's pre-1992 hits.Great rhythms, make you feel good listening to this album. It's uplifting, sensual, and still great to listen to nearly 10 years later. From his mid-eighties early stuff to early nineties hits this is great passionate music. Listening to it again, I forgot how much I loved this music. This is a great style of music. I wish reggae stayed in this format, switched way to much to rap in late 90's.This is an album that's great for cruising in the car, have dinner with a date, even having on in the office with headphones. Buy it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best","review":"I still remember 14years back, when I was just crusing with my boyfriend around the island where I went to college , and he started playing the new tape he just bought earlier that afternoon. It was Maxi's and I was simply mesmerized by how 'Wild world' and 'Some guys have all the luck' sounded. I did not know anythinhg about reggae including Maxi back then but that was it! After I first heard 'Some guys have all the luck', I'd become one of the biggest reggae fans in the world in general and of Maxi Priest in particular. I try to take as many chances as possible to attend to his concert and trust me, as a Korean who currenltly lives in Korea, it ain't that easy.Maxi is. to me, still the best and the most favorite of all time. Now that we have this CD which is a collection of just a few of his best songs from vintage to contemperary, you will be more than satisfied. Scank, groove or just chill out with it.The whole CD is full of joy and the spirit of Rastafari!!!One Love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise flops horrible","review":"Starting with a good premise (post nuclear holocaust) this book is a horrible addition to the genre. The entire book is nothing more than childlike characters engaging in adult practices. With no inhibitions or restraint. The characters are drab and unappealing. The description of the character is such that it is very difficult discern between the individuals with a few exceptions. The ending is not worth 250 pages of mindnumbing drivle you have to endure. This book is a romance with less of a plot than usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost it, really missed it, bought it again","review":"This is one of my favorite CDs, you know, the kind you always take on vacations where there's a rental car and long miles ahead. Sooner or later my favorite CDs all get lost, including \\"Longing in Their Hearts.\\" So I just bought a replacement. My review is simple - if you like Bonnie Raitt and don't have this one yet, you're missing one of the all-time greats. And if you don't know Bonnie but love country with a little rock, a lot of rhythm, and no twang, well, like I said, you're missing one of the all-time greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Stikfas, but...","review":"I've been a Stikfas fan for quite a few years now since discovering them back in... eh, 2003ish.Though they are fun to assemble, opposable and have interchangeable parts, they are definitely not for very young kids or those who handle things roughly and have very little patience.Some of the smaller parts can be a pain to snap together or take apart, and articulations can become loose with time and wear.Joints may also come apart during manipulations.I like to think of them more as a big kids' toy.

He normally is very good at putting things together (does large lego models by himself), but this one was definitely beyond him. Tools (needlenose pliers) were required to push in the the delicate wing pins referred to below, and the legs are constantly coming off, which is definitely frustrating for a child (and the parent too). Visually, there are small \\"tags\\" left on the model where each piece was detached from the plastic frame, which I find unappealing. Finally, after less than a week of play one of the key body pins broke off, which is pretty much the end of the Stikfas play value.

A list of rules on how to pamper, feed, and love you man. This book is about how you as a woman need to learn how to deal with the type of person you are when seeking a man and learning how to undo some of those things. I am not giving anything away. You have to have an open mind. Because if you're seeking a bashing on black men- then you may just want to look some where else. This is an excellent read.

The woodcut illustrations are really cool, and quite funny. The end is a little weird and unexpected (the cats \\"ate each other up\\"), but it is not a violent book at all. It's very sweet.

I started to think it was for little kids once a lttle fairy came into one of the episodes and started doing stupid childish things. This anime has a Tv-14 rating but it should really be Tv-pg because there is hardly any violence except for a little bit of blood in one of the first episodes. I hardly recall any swearing but there was some suggestive content but nothing above pg. If you are older and looking for a more mature anime I would suggest Nabari because there is more fghting and it is more mature.

The first episode is great and I had a good feeling about this series, but it all falls apart. Kazuma, the main character contradicts himself and by the end of these 12 episodes he was not the same character at all. The love interest, is a cliche schoolgirl chick, with cliche hair, and a cliche bad attitude, and pretends to be angry with Kazuma all the time, even though she likes him.Typical anime chick.

It barely touches on the author's experience with the illness, yet spends too much time exploring her little black book. But if you read between the lines you might get a glimpse of what a terminal illness can do to the human psyche. Using an online alias to trick her husband and tracking down married ex lovers were silent, desperate attempts to find worth. One can only assume this desperation stemmed from having such a horrible disease. However, if you want to learn about the many effects and treatment of cancer there are much more insightful books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Books can be inspirational, entertaining or have some kind of point or purpose. This book has none of the above. \\"Smirk in the Wind\\" is about someone who has a serious illness, yet there is hardly anything in the book about the illness, the effects it had on the author or how they lived with it. So no inspiration. The book didn't teach me anything about the illness so there was no point or purpose. Almost all of the book is about an average individual's dating habits/ life, which is certainly not very entertaining. The book really boils down to the author blaming everyone else for what happened to them with out any self-discovery.In conclusion I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"May she rest in peace","review":"Carelessly written with questionable validity.

To be honest, I have not finished it (and have no plans to). I usually finish a good book in a day, but this novel took me three days just to get through four dull chapters (because I kept putting the book down to find something more interesting to do). The basic plot of the book seemed fine, but there was no spark in this novel or in the characters themselves. The characters' dialogue seemed forced, the characters themselves were one-dimensional, and the forward momentum of the book was, well, nonextistent. I don't usually write reviews, and negative ones at that, but I felt people should have the option of reading differing points of view before deciding to buy this book.

THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLES is one of them. Nothing about Kimble, his case, the one-armed man, or Gerard is in evidence. What director Jud Taylor gives is another excuse to dump Kimble right in the middle of someone else's problem and see how he can set things right without getting recognized. The Disciples is a motorcycle gang that frees Kimble from custody only to antagonize the law. In return, the cyclists want him to break the law further by avenging the earlier killing of one of their own.

They tend to feed their favorites from time to time. The rest they simply knock away from them.While the beginning attitude towards the cats was unpleasant, it was only a mild warm-up for Ms. Carr.There is a scene where a woman in the harem dies after giving birth.

The lyrics are surprisingly good for this kind of album. The singer does a pretty job, but I wouldn't call her \\"great\\". She has a slightly cheesy sound that hurts the appeal of the album. Every track here is good which definitely helps things, but, once again, only punk fans will like this. It's a pretty unique sounding album with some great production - they are definitely a talented group of people. There's also a bunch of hitworthy punk songs here (\\"Everything Looks Beautiful On Video\\" and \\"Radiation\\", for example). I wouldn't call it a classic, but it's pretty darn close (mainly because it seems pretty derivative) - genre fans will most likely love it.

I have enjoyed listening to their work all the way from the early 80s. This album is very different from their previous work. It's tries a different style than that of \\"Fore\\" or \\"Sports\\". It has a more R&B feel but still maintains the good old rock and roll feel that they've always had. Another thing that is nice, they still retain their song themes, that of love, women, relationships. Quite refreshing from the garbage put out today with lyrics of death, hatred, blah blah blah. I've enjoyed listening to practically every song on the CD, I hope everyone will buy it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casual Fans Won't Like It","review":"Acoustics were good in this depressing comeback album from Huey.

The band seems to have mellowed in thier old age as proven by the fact that there isn't a single rock track on this album. It's a collection of ballads and slow songs that might as well be a completely different band than the excellent musicians that turned out such 80's anthems as The Heart of Rock 'N Roll, and The Power of Love. While there are some longtime fans that may appreciate the different direction the band took with this release, I'll stick with their older releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Solid CD","review":"This CD is a good example of what good rock should sound like. It is not flashy, overproduced, or lacking substance. The guys do a good job of producing a good, solid work that does not rely on pop hits in order to make up for useless tracks. Even though I was barely born during this band's glory days, I still consider them to be a very good bar band, and there is nothing wrong with that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back and better than ever!","review":"Huey Lewis and the News are back with their first album of all new material in 10 years.

From the party atmosphere \\"We're Not Here For A Long Time (We're Here For A Good Time)\\" to the bluesy title track \\"Plan B\\" to the soulful Wynonna duet \\"I'm Not In Love Yet\\"- this is an album you'll be listening to over and over.If you're an old Newsfan, this will not disappoint.. as for everyone else... here's your chance to hear what you have been missing all of these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 80's continue...Plan B works well","review":"This cd would fit in nicely with HL's 80's output of hits. Being that it is not the 80's (thank goodness) and that finding good music has become a full time job, this one has gone relatively unnoticed....which is a shame. This is solid HL jazzy, r & b pop that is timeless. 'We're not here for a long time', the cool version of Lowe/Edmunds 'When I write the book', the smooth duet of 'I'm not in love yet', 'Thank you #19' are all HL classics that could match anything on 'Sports' or his other great poppy tunes from the 80's.

Don't let the lack of the band's success as of late scare you away into checking out their post-\\"Fore!\\" music.

This CD is great if you are a Huey fan from way back or are just getting into them or simply like good ol' rock and roll. Standout cuts are tracks 1, 4, 5 and 11. I highly recommend this! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"This album is fantastic the ten year wait (although too long) was well worth it. The first track sounds like it has been lifted off the Picture This album and at first you think they are going to tread old ground but when you here track 2 'My other woman has another man' you then know your in for a real treat.'I aint perfect' is a classic and the tracks that follow 4 5 6 just complement one another greatly. The title song 'Plan B just takes you back to the time when Huey and the News dominated everything.My personal favourite 'The rhythm ranch, has me singing away as if the song is already an old classic tracks 9 10 11 are equaly as good. This album is a soul searching album about relationships and love not at all like the rubbish these new bands are pumping out, you know you are going to sit back and enjoy this album.

Callas Went away is a relaxing piece with quiet music and soft vocals with an operatic interlude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, mystical, spiritual","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite albums. I heard the song \\"Saddness\\" (track 2) on the radio and just had to have it to skate to. Except, I didn't know the name of the group who produced it. It was a year or so later when \`94 Gold Medal Olympic Ice Skating champion Oksana Baiul (sp?) skated to this song in a t.v. special, that I finally heard the name of the group that did this awesome song. Oksana and I had the same idea.It prooves that this song is full of emotion and great rhythm. I think the whole CD is aboslutely wonderful. It's spiritual, it's mystical, it will completely capture your soul.The best tracks are 2 (\\"Saddness\\") and 4.And well, I've been a huge Enigma fan for years now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the only CD that will be my ALL time favorite!!","review":"I brought this CD when I was about 16, 6 years ago now, and itis still my most favorite, and most listened to CD! The only trackthat I have never liked on it is 'The Voice and the Snake', a bit creepy for me, but other than that this CD is awesome, it never gets boring, and it never seems to date! I strongly recommend this CD, I can't bear to think that I might never have got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every music lover","review":"I Had the cassette of this title since 1991, date enigma released this first album. I bought yesterday the limited edition CD with 4 extra tracks that are worth having. Words are insufficient to describe this CD as the music contained in is very special. It transports you to heaven with soft music, well contained beats and gregorian chants that are a masterpiece. If there is a CD you must have, it is this one, whatever taste you like, it is THE ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic","review":"The rhythm and music from this album is absolutely hypnotic. It is excellent for meditation. I've purchased four copies since it's debut in 1991. It seems that every time I loan it to someone, I never get it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Best of All Time!","review":"This is simply one of best ambient new age CD's of the 90s and certainly the best I have heard. I never get tired of this CD and have owned it since it's first release. It heightens the senses and soothes the soul.While the later Enigma offerings are not quite up to the same level Enigma III is not a bad second to this CD. Delerium's \\"Karma\\" is also a great CD, only the first CD by Deep Forest and anything from Amethystium (the best overall new age composer) and Digital Moodz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good back in the day but...","review":"This album does not stand the test of time. You've heard the beat a million times, and although it's not their fault that gregorian chants have become overdone, that fact alone dooms the album. The sounds lack inspiration and the music sounds rather amateurish. What this album truly lacks is a sense of atmosphere - there's so much empty space in it that you feel like you're in the room with a drum machine and a tape deck.I have to admit that I loved this when it came out but there are much, much better options for downtempo listening these days (Thievery Corporation, Kruder & Dorfmeister, a lot of the new bossa nova-influenced tracks, Massive Attack). This album is the musical equivalent of Zubaz pants (OK that's unduly harsh but what's the 90s equivalent of a Members Only jacket?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"I honestly thought this cd would be better. I was expecting this to be great, but I was very disappointed. This is not a very good Enigma cd. It is dull and monotonous. It's good at first, but it gets boring towards the end.

Try Enigma 3, the solo male vocal works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cognitive dissonance","review":"I was quite disappointed by this, and a bit worried by the almost uniformly-five star reviews here (which usually mean that something has gone terribly wrong). Essentially, 'Sadeness' is the standout, although the samples sound very naff nowadays. 'Principles of Lust' was also a moderate hit in the UK, but the rest of the album is basically ambient euro-pop filler, a bit like Jam & Spoon but much more pompous - all this stuff about how the album is a serious meditation on religion and sexuality seems divorced from reality. The supposedly-controversial religious angle is actually quite funny, and I get the impression that a lot of people take this much more seriously than it warrants. Unless you're fan, you'll find this extremely naff, and if you're a fan you'll probably grow out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"i heard all the hype about this disc and i checked it out.it's okay nothing ground breaking.sadness was alright but i didn't get what all the fuss was all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more puzzles.

Too cheap for a motel, I slept in the park atop the hill. Some local kids came by, we smoked and talked thru the wee hours and a thunderstorm. I saw the hands down *sexiest* thing in my life (amd I'm a 3 tour Navy vet!)...

I remeber seeing the video Sadness on MTV back in my first year of going to Spyken. Here we get classic tracks such as \\"Sadeness\\", \\"Principles of Lust\\" and \\"Mea Culpa\\". The limited edition also includes 4 additional remixes not included on the original release. The artwork is quite nice and was done by H.P. Uertz. None of the lyrics are included. Allmusic gave this album a 4/5 in the review and I concur with this assessment. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I first have to say that I am a HUGE fan of dark, deep music. I bought this CD expecting that, Plus I love chants, and I was told that this CD was filled with them. I have to tell you, the closest thing to a chant in this, is religious wailing. It was a terrible dissapointment. I wasted [$$$]on this CD. Unless you are a hardcore fan of this band, DON'T GET IT!! I only gave it 2 stare, because it had a FEW good songs on it, and the instrumental parts were ok, but VERY repetative. I also have to say something else about the chants (if you like chants like me, you'll know what I mean), chants are ONLY good sounding if they are in LATIN, not French, like they are in this CD. I highly regret buying this. The only time I would buy this CD if it was on sale"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can find sadeness (pt.1) as single, stay away....","review":"With the exception of that song, this is truly the worst album which I have ever heard. And I've heard all of David Gray's albums. I bought this album on the strength of the undisputed classic sadeness, and turned it on to hear pathetic female exhortations for me to turn off the lights and 'meditate' which I studiously ignored. Then came the classic, followed by several samey, terrible songs. The album reaches its nadir with 'The principles of lust' which is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. The female 'singer' must be disposed of now.I bought this album expecting to hear the greatest work ever recorded, and am extremely disappointed.PS- An interesting story A friend of my brother was suspended from school for repeatedly chanting Sadeness (PT.1) at a teacher, who called it 'The Devil's song' PPSIt probably isn't. Enigma pretend to be devil worshippers but the reality is even more pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Insipid, uninspired, uninspiring.If you want creepy with Gregorian chants, the Swans crush this music as the heel of a giant crushes an ant.

These guys have flow, although I admit I found my attention wandering midway through the album... Andres Salazar's sax work is a little flat in places; not bad, just not as soulful as it might have been, although his Spanish-language rapping easily matches Gustavo Veiga's Portuguese tounge-twisting toasting talents. Keep in mind, these kids are pretty young, and this is a pretty strong debut. Worth checking out if you're into the whole global hip-hop trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this only for the live tracks","review":"\\"Walk On\\" is one of the highlights of 'All That You Can't Leave Behind', and this is merely a shortened version of that song. That said, there is no excuse for cutting off a song that was only 4:55 to begin with. So if you REALLY like the song, get 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'.The b-sides are live performances from the relatively small FarmClub venue (you can hear individual whistles and claps). \\"Beautiful Day\\" is nicely done and even more anthemic with its extended ending (e.g., Bono singing \\"Go with soul!\\"). \\"New York\\" has a more dramatic guitar sound at the end than on the studio version, and Bono sings the refrain a bit more straightforward. (A MOMENT OF BITCHING: They really should have put a live version of \\"Elevation\\" on here, which is quite different from the studio version - especially their Saturday Night Live performance in December 2000.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Indepth for My Purposes","review":"The book was very thorough but was too indepth for my purposes at this point.

Sad to say, I have done the comparison now and the box set is inferior in the extreme when it comes to sound quality. The digital processing of this release would NEVER pass muster with Brian Wilson--at least that's what one would think.It is fascinating to listen to the demo pieces and think of how certain works developed into icons of an era in pop music, but other than that this set is a disgrace to everyone involved in creating it. I feel cheated, and I had been thinking of this set for quite some time. Yes, I know, I should have done due diligence in reading the reviews. I thought I had.I would certainly rather amass a collection of five Beach Boys albums than purchase this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best box set ever?????","review":"For anyone wondering what the Beach Boys are REALLY made of, then this box set is for you. Forget all their surfing and car songs (which happen to be on here, too), go straight to discs 3 and 4 and listen to what the group can accomplish. There is hardly anything else I've listened to that can match the complex and beauty of songs such as \\"This Whole World\\" and \\"Til I Die\\". \\"Sail On Sailor\\" is a great slow rocker that never really was given a good chance.

If what you want is every single bit of noise they ever made, then look no farther. If what you want is uninterrupted hours of great stuff, you better look elsewhere. There were far too many promos, alternate takes, and not-the-greatest tunes between the immediately recognizable ones.

Secondly, over 50% of the songs if you want to call them that (some are short commercials and a variety of vocal and instrumental torture) I have never even heard before. There are 2 cd's with their hits spread here and there. I would say of the total number of tracks on all the cd's that about 30% are the songs you want to hear. The one cd with the most hits was not remastered very well if at all, very little bass and the one cd with some hits was decent.

Among other things, these lower fields of magnetics provide opportunity for rapid manifestation.In a chapter devoted to the phenomenon of crop circles, Braden attempts to explain their meaning and messages. A subsequent chapter interprets the meaning and message of the life of the Christ Jesus.This wonderful book sets many things in place and helped me to understand the connection we and our bodies have to the conscious Being that is our Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I know the description didn't say these socks were for a horse, yet they were too thin for a mans leg and would have fit up to my husbands hip, should he have tried to put them on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"Since beginning 'Eight Nights' a week ago, my workdays have been filled with anticipation to get home and hop back on Luke's motorcycle to continue a magnificent journey that, though set in the U.S. great plains, thoughtfully leads us into our own rebellious, naive and oft grief-stricken souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorlly made but pretty.","review":"I purchased this bracelet with the matching necklace.

Can adjust length for different individuals or uphill/downhill hiking. Nice for scooting snakes out of the middle of a trail if you can get around it. The shock absorption is a nice feature.CONS: Cork handles feel weird on your hands. The circular dirt/mud stops at the end fell off along the hike. not a big deal i didn't use them. after a long while the poles turn from use and loosen the telescoping adjustment. had to stop and tighten it a couple times.Buy them. for 12 bucks per pole it could have a lot more cons and id still buy them if my pair ever gave out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic parts","review":"After 6 hikes, the plastic thread that expands/reduces the length of the pole became loose and the pole became useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted Only One Hike!","review":"I purchased a pair of these poles at a local Walmart and one of them lost the ability to lock once expanded after just one hike.

However, the first time I used it, the carbide tip fell out. I saw some of these at Wal-Mart and examined the tips. Quite a few of them had already fallen out prior to even being purchased. I even tried gluing mine into the staff, but it fell out again during the first use. I threw away the tip and made my own with a nail. So even though this is a well-made pole (except for the crappy tip), I don't recommend it (due to the crappy tip!). Instead, get a Kaito pole. I got one for Christmas and it's awesome. Light-weight, well built, sturdy, the tip hasn't fallen out yet(!), and it has extra features (camera screw-mount, compass, thermometer).

Georgia to the sand in Central Florida and they just keep working. I have not had any problems with the tips coming out.

However, for whatever reason the first 4 movies have been squeezed onto one disc (two each side). The one I got stopped playing for a couple of minutes each side. I am returning it in the hope the next one will work smoothly. If I had known four movies were on one disc I may not have bought this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Having been a Joe Cocker fan in the late 60s and the 70s, I recently realized that I had no Joe on CD (only on vinyl). After picking up his greatest album ever (\\"Joe Cocker!\\") on CD, I ordered \\"The Best of Joe Cocker\\" to bring me up to speed. One of the main reasons for getting this CD was that it contained the LIVE VERSION of \\"Help from My Friends.\\" However, after receiving the CD and listening to the first few notes of \\"My Friends,\\" I realized that this was NOT the live version we all know and love. The classic live version of this song done at Woodstock (as well as the studio version on his 1st LP) makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck (the way the lead to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" always does). This version is OK, but BUYER BEWARE - it is WAY less powerful than the Woodstock version. The rest of the album is OK, but all these songs are so overproduced compared those songs exhibiting the raw energy that his earlier work had. This was a disappointing buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Joe's best","review":"You can't call a compact disc \\"The Best of Joe Cocker\\" if it doesn't contain \\"Feelin' Alright.\\" Or \\"The Letter.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not the best CD collection ever!","review":"Try getting Joe Cocker's Anthology [BOX SET] instead this needs a major improvement.

Shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read !!","review":"Being a Mississippi native and enjoying reading about corruption in the state's capital city, ON THE RECORD was a superbly enjoyable read. With the author's description of characters and what is happening, you will feel as if you are in the middle of the action. Suspence, along with surprise fills this thriller to the end. You will not want to put it down. It left me wanting to know more.....Hope there's a sequal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ode to Mississippi","review":"Joe Lee's first novel, On the Record, offers an insiders view of one our country's greatest assests... Mississippi grit. His characters abrasivly rub one another raw, yet the end result is scrumpious!As a native Mississippian myself, I firmly believe that Joe Lee's witty tale tells more about the inside working of political power and the personal stakes involved in playing the game. Beyond layers of deception surrounding his heroic female lead, Joe Lee uncovers an unfettered human response to career women, love-hate relationships, fright and flight.Indeed, On the Record is a keeper, and Joe Lee is a writer the publishing industry should keep up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is simply a disjointed journal of a series of short hikes with portions deteriorating to a lame account of car camping.

Connected using HDMI cables from Direct TV HDTV box to reciever and HDMI to Sony HDTV. System volumn is so low, I must turn it up to the max level to begin to enjoy watching movies. In fact the audio system & speakers built into the Sony TV are better. Then while using system, occasionally the audio stops and is replaced with a loud ( wish I could get the normal audio this loud) static noise. I have to either turn the system on and off, or toggle the XPL mode switch on the remote to stop the racket.Samsung's web site wants me to ship the unit at my expense to a shop in California so they can fix(?) or replace. Since the shipping, wait, etc are more than I think the unit is worth, I'll probably just purchase a unit from a different manufacturer.After buying and loving a Samsung LNS3251D LCD HDTV, I'd hoped for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a compilation album","review":"This cd is a compilation of tracks from Electric Africa and the Deadline Album down by law on which Manu Dibango appeared.They appear to be minor remixes,but maybe it is just different mastering? They renamed the tracks so it is no immediately clear they are from the other albums. One track has no sax on it so I don't know why it appears on a Manu Dibango Album.

It's actually earlier sounding techno than X-static volume one. The songs are very simplistic and not at all hardcore or pumping, although there are a couple of tracks that clearly pushed the hardcore envelope and stand out as must have techno songs. So, if you are interested in having a compilation to demonstrate the progression towards hardcore techno, this is it, otherwise, look for later volumes to get that real techno sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful debut album","review":"Most people think of Sixpence as a new band, with their hits \\"Kiss Me\\" and \\"There She Goes\\" seemingly coming from out of nowhere to being played all over mainstream radio. But the truth is, Sixpence has been around for years. TFATW is their first CD and is a stellar debut. Their earlier stuff is very different from their latest album, but still shines with the ethereal vocals of Leigh Bingham (Nash) and the poetic lyrics of Matt Slocum, who also plays guitar. This album sounds a bit like the Sundays with a hint of 80's-era U2 mixed in. Definitely worth checking out. Also check out their second album, \\"This Beautiful Mess\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start of Something Big","review":"I bought this album at a concert right after it was released and was not disappointed. Sixpence is known for their recent work in the mainstream market, but this early release is of no less quality. I cannot tell you how many times the \\"trust\\" reprise has lifted a dark spirit.

A great deal of thought and care obviously went into the logistics of repeated time transformations. I fear, however, that the technical aspects of this endeavor get in the way of this play having any particular point. There are a number of ill-developed characters, none of whom elicit much emotional reaction.\\"Arcadia\\" is sort of a literary parallel to \\"Twister\\" or \\"Jurassic Park\\": Lots of focus on the special effects, very little on a plot or character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good play.","review":"Didn't find any solid monologues in this one.

Really wish some enterprising company would start filming live performances of these great plays so non-New York City residents might get a chance to see them. The Met Opera has an excellent live broadcast to theaters throughout the nation at a modest cost. Why aren't live theater groups following suit?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intelligent Drama","review":"This play is essentially a love story - no, much more than that, but at bottom, a sad love story between tutor and pupil. Septimus Hodge, whose being become alive on the pages and of course, the lovely, intelligent Thomassina. But that was way back in 1809 or thereabouts. In the future - oh yes, this is also a time travel science fiction play. We also discuss Newton, quantum physics, literary history, Lord Byron. All in but a brief few pages. There is much, much to recommend this dramatic work, although one wonders if unlike most plays it lends itself better to the written page than the stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming","review":"This is a wonderful book to read for yourself and to give as a gift to your friends. The individual stories range from long-term friendships developed as young adults, to those formed in later years of life that may have only lasted for a \\"season\\". The one thing each of these friendships have in common is a deep love and respect for each other, as well as for God. I found the stories to be touching, inspiring and in some instances incredibly humorous, just like friendships are in real life. This book gave me the opportunity to reflect back on my own friendships over the years and to see how God has moved in me to bring some incredible \\"sheltering trees\\" into my life.
